AFP/Getty Images Washington And The World Kim Jong Un’s Warning to Trump North Korea’s leader is telling Washington that his patience is wearing out. But his New Year’s Day speech contained other fascinating clues to Kim’s ambitions for 2019—and beyond. By ANKIT PANDA Continue to article content

Kim Jong Un had a simple message for U.S. President Donald J. Trump during his New Year’s Day address . Echoing months of statements carried in North Korean state media since the June 12, 2018, summit meeting between the two leaders in Singapore, Kim noted that he had followed through in good faith on measures to signal his interest in seeing through “complete denuclearization” on the Korean Peninsula. In two words, Kim’s message for the United States: “Your turn.”
It’s a message Kim has been repeating since June 13 , when the North Korean leader was paraphrased in his state media as vowing that “if the U.S. side takes genuine measures for building trust in order to improve the DPRK-U.S. relationship,” North Korea would offer up further concessions. In Kim’s view, he had offered up ample concessions in 2018 to merit concessions from the Trump administration, which remains fixated on offering North Korea sanctions relief and other inducements only after the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea is attained.

In 2017 and 2018, Kim had a habit of telling us what he was going to do in the year ahead and then proceed to do it. While North Korea is often painted as an opaque state, impossible to predict, the truth is that Kim has been remarkably transparent about his intentions. On defense and nuclear matters, at least, North Korean policy has remained static through his tenure.
In 2017, for instance, Kim promised that North Korea would acquire a capability to strike the U.S. mainland that year. By November, he showed that he had successfully overseen that project, with two intercontinental-range ballistic missile designs having been flight-tested successfully. Similarly, in 2018, Kim ordered the mass production of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Per multiple reports last year citing U.S. intelligence assessments, that’s happened, too—even as Kim jetted off to foreign capitals, shedding his reputation as a hermit king.
Kim recounted this history in his speech, underlining North Korea’s internal and external promises to behave responsibly as a nuclear weapons-possessing state. He noted that North Korea had “declared … that we would neither make and test nuclear weapons any longer nor use and proliferate them, and we have taken various practical measures [in this regard].”
This line may sound new and significant, but it isn’t. It reiterates directives dating back at least to North Korea’s March 2013 adoption of nuclear-state status . In that declaration, the Kim regime pledged to handle nuclear materials securely, not proliferate them, and to only use nuclear weapons in circumstances where it perceived its national security and survival to be threatened. (North Korea has been promising not to proliferate its nukes for years before Kim Jong Un.)
Kim’s “your turn” message for Trump this year shouldn’t have surprised anyone paying attention. It was, after all, during the September 2018 summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that the North Korean leader signed his name onto a statement that suggested he might be open to the prospect of further disarmament gestures should the United States deliver “corresponding measures.” During the North Korean foreign minister’s address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York that same month, it became clear that the primary North Korean demand—as had been true for years—was the removal of international sanctions.
In April 2018, Kim had announced a unilateral suspension of nuclear tests and tests of the kinds of missiles that could strike the U.S. homeland. The gesture was at the time justified on the basis of technical parameters: Kim suggested that North Korea had sufficient testing data, had completed its deterrent force qualitatively, and could now cease testing. In subsequent weeks, however, those measures came to be described as “denuclearization steps” by North Korea. Kim was framing the mere cessation of testing as a significant concession on the pathway to the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
That phrase received particular attention in Kim’s New Year’s address, too. In December, a remarkable commentary in the state-run Korean Central News Agency attributed to the pen name Jong Hyon defined that phrase—and its geographic contours—in stark detail. “When we refer to the Korean Peninsula, they include both the area of the DPRK and the area of South Korea where aggression troops including the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are deployed,” the commentary noted, revealing North Korea’s continuing conspiratorial belief that U.S. tactical nuclear weapons that were removed from the Peninsula in 1991 remain there.
“When we refer to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it, therefore, means removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted. This should be clearly understood,” the commentary added.
Kim Jong Un emphasized this same message, though less explicitly. He noted that U.S. “strategic assets”—a North Korea phrase used to mean everything from ballistic missile defense capabilities like THAAD to nuclear attack submarines and aircraft carriers—“should no longer be permitted” on or around the Korean Peninsula.
It’s here too that Kim seized on the tremendous progress North Korea made in 2018 to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. Pointing to the success in the implementation of the September 19 inter-Korean Comprehensive Military Agreement, which saw a range of tension reduction measures on land, at sea and in the air, Kim said South Korea should cease “joint military exercises with foreign forces.” The allies have already announced that the upcoming 2019 iterations of Foal Eagle and Key Resolve—the large springtime exercises—will be modified to allow diplomacy to proceed with North Korea. But separately, Kim’s speech, which was broadcast live for the first time in South Korea, comes amid great discord between Seoul and Washington on the finalization of an agreement to govern burden-sharing within the alliance.
Going further, Kim encouraged his counterpart in the South to push ahead with inter-Korean projects without waiting for support from the United States—effectively an invitation to Moon to recognize the historic moment and push forward in the spirit of Korean self-determination, even if that meant violating international sanctions. Kim dangled specifically the prospect of resuming the operations of the Kaesong Industrial Park and tourism activities at Mt. Kumgang—two banner projects of the “Sunshine” era of inter-Korean rapprochement in the early 2000s, during the rule of his father, Kim Jong Il.
Zeroing in on what Kim said about the United States misses the broader significance of his speech. Although Kim spent about a quarter of his speech addressing inter-Korean issues and diplomacy with the United States — generating most of the headlines — it was primarily about internal affairs.
That other three-quarters reveals North Korean priorities in the year ahead. Namely, the “new strategic line” announced by Kim last year in April as a successor to the byungjin line , which sought the parallel attainment of a nuclear deterrent and economic prosperity, is here to stay. This strategic line remains without a name or a slogan for now, but North Korea’s core drive now is attaining economic self-sufficiency and prosperity—an updated version of its foundational ideology of juche .
It’s clear from his speech that Kim hopes to see through North Korea’s economic development regardless of changes in the external environment. He emphasizes the importance of industrial capacity-building, improvements in management techniques for facilities, attaining energy self-sufficiency and modernizing North Korea’s military. Last year, despite Kim’s relatively heavy travel schedule, he conducted multiple “on-the-spot guidance” visits to a range of North Korean industrial, health care and commercial facilities to direct this project of economic improvement. While Kim himself and his father and grandfather all have conducted these kinds of visits, his tours in 2018 were notable for the push toward modernization and development.
Kim also signaled that he recognizes that the United States won’t be lifting its sanctions anytime soon. As a result, North Korea intends to hedge by shifting away from its reliance on exporting coal—a sanctioned activity—to using it domestically. Kim additionally referenced “atomic power” in his speech, perhaps suggesting that 2019 may see a new push by North Korea to finalize and announce the operation of a new facility thought to be an experimental light-water reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex.
Kim did leave one warning on the table that should be taken seriously by Trump and his national security team. He warned the United States not to insist on his unilateral capitulation as it has been and, in the process, test North Korea’s “patience.” If it does, Pyongyang may “be compelled to find a new way for defending the sovereignty of the country and the supreme interests of the state and for achieving peace and stability of the Korean peninsula.”Kim conveyed again his willingness to meet Trump—and only Trump—but he also made clear that a second summit will have to open a door to the concessions that North Korea seeks from the United States.
What exactly Kim wants is left ambiguous, but even Trump—who has repeatedly tweeted about how much he appreciates the cessation of nuclear and missile testing—can guess what might lie on the other side. At some point in 2019, if the “corresponding measures” North Korea has been seeking from the United States fail to arrive, Kim will likely turn back to his old ways. The missiles will begin flying again as North Korea showcases the fruits of its qualitative and quantitative attainment in 2017 and 2018. A North Korean statement in the final days of 2018 alluded to this , suggesting that the U.S. State Department was “bent on bringing DPRK-U.S. relations back to the status of last year, which was marked by exchanges of fire.” Given progress on the inter-Korean front in the meantime, Kim may be betting that South Koreans supportive of Moon’s inter-Korean peace push will be eager to blame the collapse of diplomacy on the United States, dealing a blow to the already-troubled U.S.-South Korea alliance in the process."
Pro-Trump Republicans plan 8-figure play for the Jewish vote in 2020 -,www.politico.com,ALEX ISENSTADT,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/07/donald-trump-jewish-vote-2020-1260172,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
LAS VEGAS — Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decadeslong stranglehold on the Jewish vote.
Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. On Friday morning, the group’s board members — many of them prominent Republican Party donors — gathered in a conference room at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions said, will far surpass what the group spent in past presidential elections. Story Continued Below
With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who has himself faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism—as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.
“We’re at the intersection of a very unique moment in time where we have the most pro-Israel president ever in history in Donald Trump, and we also at the same time have the Democratic Party — because of the pressure of the progressive left— moving away from the traditional support for Israel that has existed going back to 1948,” said Matt Brooks, who has served as RJC executive director for nearly three decades.
“This strain within the Democratic Party is making those centrist and center-left Jews who care about these issues feel more and more uncomfortable, and with the strength of Donald Trump and the Republican Party on these issues, we believe that we’ll be able to bring those folks over to the Republican side,” Brooks added.

At a time when Trump’s approval rating remains mired in the low- to mid-40s, the offensive shows how Republicans are taking steps to contest any votes they can. Jews only account for about 2 percent of the U.S. population and have overwhelmingly supported Democrats in past elections. But GOP officials believe that siphoning off even a small portion the Jewish vote in a few battleground states could be critical in 2020.
“The Jewish vote will remain and largely loyal Democratic vote because of domestic issues largely, but if there was ever a cycle where Republicans could make inroads, it is this cycle,” said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush White House press secretary who now serves as an RJC board member. “If you accept that there are sizable Jewish populations in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania [and] Michigan, the Jewish vote — if we can make additional inroads — can be very helpful in putting you over the top. The White House knows that.”
The administration is all-in on the strategy. On Saturday, Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and three White House officials — Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt, and Avi Berkowitz — all made pilgrimages to the Venetian, where RJC members were gathered for the third day of their annual spring conference. Before a sea of supporters waving “We are Jews for Trump” signs, the president accused Democrats of opposing Israel and “advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history.”
Before taking the stage, Trump met privately with Adelson and his wife, Miriam, who together gave more than $120 million to Republican causes during the 2018 midterms. The 85-year-old Adelson, who’s been undergoing cancer treatment, hadn’t been expected to be in attendance. But those close to the billionaire said he was intent on making the Trump rally, and when he entered the auditorium on a motorized scooter and wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat , he was greeted with a standing ovation.
Democrats are deeply skeptical that the GOP will succeed in making inroads with Jews. Since 1992, according to exit polling data, the Jewish vote has remained remarkably stable, with Democrats winning between 69 percent and 79 percent in each presidential election.
Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said that recent polling her group had conducted showed that Jews remained confident in the Democratic Party’s posture on Israel and that they overwhelmingly disagreed with Trump on an array of domestic issues. And, she pointed out, Republicans had long vowed to make gains with Jewish voters only to fall short."

Why Beto and Buttigieg Pretend to Be Kennedys - Magazine,www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/07/beto-buttigieg-2020-campaign-kennedy-jfk-226575,"For the past six decades, Democrats have been mesmerized by the Kennedy style, like adult children searching for the forever-young father who left them before his time. The pressure for candidates to fit the Kennedy mold—in looks, style and political bearing—became so oppressive that the writer Garry Wills coined a term for it: “The Kennedy imprisonment.” The generation of politicians that immediately followed John F. Kennedy—John Kerry, John Tunney and even Republicans like John Lindsay—tried so hard to emulate JFK that they enacted impersonations: fastening the top button of their suit jackets to flap in precisely the same patterns as his, chopping the air with their hands like he did, extending their necks to mimic his chin-in-the-air stance at the lectern. In more recent years, such candidates felt freer to adopt their own mannerisms but their political posture remained pure JFK: that of the young and earnest outsider, alone on the stage, a prince suffused in a golden aura of charisma.
Story Continued Below
Now, as the 2020 contenders emerge from the wings, the Kennedy ghost is alive again, mostly in the person of former Texas Rep. Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke. Unlike the JFK mannequins, he has chosen to ape the tousled Bobby variant of the Kennedy style, honed after Dallas, that of the surviving brother searching for meaning in a strange and violent world. He even shares Bobby Kennedy’s first two names. But the 46-year-old O’Rourke must compete with an even younger Kennedy clone—the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend (Ind.), Pete Buttigieg, who (naturally) won the JFK Library’s Profile in Courage essay contest in 2000 as a sweaty-palmed high school senior. A decade later, in 2015, he won the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award from the Kennedy School at Harvard.
Among all the mini-dramas within the still-growing Democratic field, the 2020 primaries will also be a test of whether, after 60 years, after the fraying of the Kennedy family dynasty, and after the emergence of the #MeToo movement, the character of a Kennedyesque charismatic loner still stirs the Democratic imagination and excites the passions of the electorate. It’s a question that goes beyond just the horse-race odds of O’Rourke and Buttigieg, and to the core of the party’s ability to win the White House.

One would assume that, if the Kennedy political recipe was losing its flavor in 1981, when Wills conjured the term “the Kennedy imprisonment,” it must surely be rancid by now. But even if some of the outward trappings of the Kennedy image—the high fashion, the self-satisfied smile—have fallen out of vogue, the Kennedy approach to politics and, especially, to winning a presidential election as a Democrat, are as relevant in 2020 as they were in 1960. Far from being an anachronism, JFK’s evangelistic style of leadership is still the Democrats’ most potent weapon. His is not just a proven route to the White House, but has been, for more than a half century, literally the only route for a Democrat to win the White House.
This is an imprisonment the Democrats might choose to end at their peril.
***
John F. Kennedy was neither the most liberal nor the best-credentialed Democrat in the 1960 primaries, but he encapsulated the hopes and dreams of the electorate. He evoked themes that proved irresistible to liberals (generational change, a we-can-do-better scolding of a neglectful Republican stewardship, the need for national unity), but were vague enough not to alienate moderates who might be fearful of overreach.
While Kennedy’s persona—his glamour, sex appeal, erudition and speaking style—was a big part of his success, there was a more durable truth undergirding his breakthrough: Voters love Democratic values and aspirations, but are terrified of Democratic legislation. Kennedy’s vagueness on policy was as important to his success as his precision in articulating the challenges of the ’60s was.

The electorate wasn’t blind to these realities. The party’s liberal old guard, led by Eleanor Roosevelt, distrusted Kennedy and preferred Adlai Stevenson. In both the primaries and the general election, Kennedy stood accused of lacking specific policy proposals. But his reluctance to put a price tag on every priority, to make firm, unbreakable commitments, or to attach his name to every overloaded barge of a bill being pulled through the Senate served him well: Liberals saw a candidate who shared their fondest beliefs, while moderates saw a president whom they could trust to resist partisanship in favor of the broader national interest.
Kennedy’s nomination was a victory against his party’s congressional leadership, represented by his eventual running mate, Lyndon Johnson. Then, as now, close exposure to the sausage-making in the House and Senate did not inspire loyalty in the voting booth, at least for presidential aspirants. And the choice of JFK was also a rebuke to the principled left, represented by Stevenson, who had led the party to defeat in the two previous elections.
Three years later, Kennedy’s assassination produced an outpouring of sympathy so great that it carried Johnson to a record-breaking election victory in 1964. Thereafter, every Democrat who has been elected president has followed the JFK road map.
The record of the past 50-plus years is irrefutable: Whenever the party has nominated a former vice president (Hubert Humphrey in 1968, Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000) or a similar figure of long exposure to the public eye, such as Hillary Clinton in 2016, he or she has fallen short. The same has been the case with policy-oriented liberals like George McGovern in ’72 and Michael Dukakis in ’88.
The little-known Bill Clinton, however, passed around copies of a photo of himself as a bedazzled Boys Nation recruit pumping President Kennedy’s hand on the White House lawn. He preached a Kennedyesque message of generational change and we-can-do-better idealism to capture the party’s heart. Despite generating a suspicion that he put strategy ahead of principle, he cruised to two victories. The largely unknown Barack Obama asserted his own Camelot connection by campaigning alongside Ted and Caroline Kennedy, while Caroline penned a New York Times op-ed predicting he would be “ A President Like My Father .” Obama’s message of hope and change was castigated as vague and empty, but it served the crucial purpose of inspiring liberals without alarming moderates. He won twice. Finally, there was Jimmy Carter, who seemingly came out of nowhere to win the Democratic nomination in 1976. He too evoked generational change and a hopeful, I’ll-never-lie-to-you message, and prevailed in a close race.
John Kerry tried—oh, how he tried—to be Kennedyesque in 2004, with his Massachusetts roots, JFK initials and bromance with Ted. He stressed electability over ideological purity, and he arguably performed better than fellow nominees Humphrey, Dukakis and Hillary Clinton, who lost races that were possibly more winnable than his. But in important ways, Kerry broke the model. Unlike Carter, Clinton, or, later, Obama, he wasn’t a fresh face on the national scene, nor did he offer generational change. At 60, he had been in the Senate for two decades and had first achieved notice more than three decades earlier as a veteran opposing the Vietnam War.
Kerry’s campaign serves best, perhaps, as an object lesson in what parts of the Kennedy legacy—the looks, the accent, the association with actual Kennedy relatives—have diminished in significance over time, and which remain evergreen: youth, vigor, a sense of high purpose.
There is, of course, another, less admirable, aspect to Kennedy’s political style: maintaining a sense of what might generously be called flexibility on the issues, which may be every bit as important to achieving victory as the others. Younger brother Ted—the keeper of the flame who never quite lived up to the expectations that fate placed on his shoulders—violated this precept in his own national career. His unabashed liberalism and tireless commitment to legislating helped to bring about an era of progressive change, but probably contributed to his failure to win the White House.

Under Ted’s stewardship, the family brand became synonymous with policy-oriented liberalism, which probably convinced many people that Jack and Bobby had been equally earnest in pursuing Democratic legislative priorities. They were not, though they conveyed such a powerful sense of progressive values, the feeling that change was not only inevitable but righteous and necessary, building toward a greater country and a more equitable society, that they were forgiven any sins or omissions.
***
The events surrounding the assassinations of President Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy cleansed the family legacy of any residue of distrust or compromise. The nation’s sense of loss quickly grew into a sense of nostalgia. Particularly after the other agonies of the ’60s and ’70s—social change, Vietnam protests, economic reversals, Watergate—Kennedy’s thousand days in office began to feel like a memory of a better time, when politics was inspiring and politicians were admired.
The #MeToo movement, however, has forced a reconsideration of the “Mad Men” era of the Kennedy presidency, of the womanizing associated with JFK and some of the men of his administration. Kennedy’s personal image is now tarnished. But there are signs that Kennedy-style presidential politics can survive the hit.
O’Rourke, who makes no disguise of his admiration of the Kennedys, evokes the less sexually aggressive Bobby rather than JFK. There’s far less swagger in Bobby’s image, crafted late in his life, after the open-bar era of the early ’60s had ended. The Bobby Kennedy of the later ’60s strived to overcome an earlier reputation for conservatism, the vestige of having once worked for the notorious Sen. Joe McCarthy, and for ruthlessness in having served as his brother’s political prod. Chastened by grief, the new Bobby climbed mountains, marched through Appalachia, and visited urban ghettos in search of understanding. He still wore suits like his brother’s and spoke with the same accent and emphasis, but he added shades of warmth and empathy. Bobby may have been late to the causes of the ’60s, but he presented his conversions as the product of deep, intensive soul-searching.
That is certainly Beto’s M.O. The onetime adolescent writer of poetry took to the road by himself in search of inspiration before deciding on a presidential run, only to find himself chastised by some observers for self-indulgence. Those same skeptics accuse him of being too conservative, despite the spirited idealism that surrounded his 2018 Senate run against Ted Cruz. His fundraising success suggests he retains a passionate grassroots following, but his early struggles on the campaign trail raise a legitimate question of whether current-day voters are simply too cynical to fall for a Kennedyesque candidate.
Should Beto succeed, it won’t be because of his mere resemblance to the Kennedys—a physical coincidence that elicits as much eye-rolling as admiration. Voters under 55 have no memory of the living Bobby Kennedy, even if a constant diet of miniseries and docudramas might lead them to think otherwise. Rather, Beto’s success would be built on the freshness of his presentation, his skateboarding spontaneity, his sense of being a man apart—apart from the corruption of Washington, the calculations of the party elites and the demands of the special interests. That’s the aspect of the Kennedy formula that remains potent.

Pete Buttigieg has followed a clear Kennedy path: attending Harvard, studying in England, serving in the military, and preaching generational change and “a fresh start.” Meanwhile, he has a natural means of erasing the predatory womanizing from the JFK image: He’s gay. His extroverted husband , ubiquitous on social media, provides both the reassurance of domestic tranquility and a reminder that the Buttigieg candidacy is groundbreaking in more than just his audacity in running for the White House while serving as a small-city mayor. His fearless pursuit of the nomination, while eschewing the usual credentialing process, marks him as a man apart, too. Democratic primary voters love to make a statement and voting for a gay man may feel more refreshing, and more like a symbolic repudiation of Donald Trump, than opting for a more conventional Kennedy stand-in.
The other Democrats are, more or less explicitly, repudiating the Kennedy style. Elizabeth Warren, who occupies the Massachusetts Senate seat that launched JFK to the presidency, seems to have the Kennedy formula backward. Her M.O. has been to offer specific proposals—and, more than that, specific proposals on new and cutting-edge issues. While she can be an inspiring speaker, she has chosen to stint on rhetoric in favor of showcasing her fighting spirit. Authenticity, not charisma, is her calling card.
Joe Biden, meanwhile, is stepping into the Happy Warrior mold of the garrulous Humphrey, his fellow VP. And Adlai Stevenson would see something of himself in Bernie Sanders’ rumpled-professor style. The women candidates—Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris in particular—might reasonably wonder if the Kennedy path is even open to them; JFK’s electoral magic rubbed off on a few of his male relatives, but not his sisters, niece or daughter.
And yet if JFK’s mannerisms are subtracted from the equation, there’s no reason that a politically appealing, slightly elusive, outsider woman couldn’t replicate some of his mystique. The enduring takeaway of the past half century is not that the candidates who looked and acted the most like JFK were successful. It is rather that those who embodied his spirit of generational change, inspiring rhetoric and arms-length distance from the party establishment have prevailed, while those lacking such attributes failed.
That’s not a coincidence or an accident of history. There’s a clear logic in the idea that the party of progressive change often wins the battle for hearts and minds, but loses on practicality: People want wider access to health care, but many don’t want their own health care changed. They share the party’s values but are wary of the vehicles for change.
Democratic candidates can’t ignore that pervasive reality. JFK would be unlikely to sign on to an unfocused “Green New Deal” or make a specific pledge to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither, for that matter, would Bill Clinton, who fretted about raising your taxes too much, or Obama, who campaigned against a health care mandate in 2008.
Their appeal to the majority rested on their sense of promise. Tomorrow belongs to the young, the vigorous, the idealistic—a notion that might register especially powerfully when running against a 74-year-old Donald Trump.
Now, as ever, the Kennedy imprisonment is regarded by the left as an electronic dog fence—one that traps the Democrats into relying too much on compromise to achieve victory, and an over-reliance on personal charisma over party organization. Still, it’s a lot better than losing, and at its best can feel so dazzling that the boundaries of the possible seem to fade away. For the Democrats of today, as much as in 1960 or 1980, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die."

""I wasn’t involved in it. I was over at OMB during that process. I don’t really have much interest.” | Alex Wong/Getty Images DRIVING THE DAY NEW … PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S WEEK AHEAD -- MONDAY: The president will have lunch with VP Mike Pence. He will also meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. TUESDAY: The president will have a bilateral meeting with Egypt President El Sisi. WEDNESDAY: Trump will travel to San Antonio and Houston. THURSDAY: The president and First Lady Melania Trump will meet with Korean President Moon Jae-in and his wife Kim Jung-sook. He will also meet with WWII veterans.
SUNDAY BEST -- BILL HEMMER spoke with ACTING WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF MICK MULVANEY on FOX NEWS’ “FOX NEWS SUNDAY: HEMMER: “[The president] also threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries. Is that still a threat?” MULVANEY: “Absolutely, it’s for the same reason. This is his number one priority. Keep in mind, dealing with healthcare is nice, dealing with the economy is nice. The president’s first responsibility is to protect the integrity and safety of our nation, and we really do believe and I think again, most folks are starting to agree with us now, that the situation on the border is a national security crisis.”
-- ON TRUMP’S TAXES: HEMMER: “Do you believe Democrats will ever see the President’s tax returns?” MULVANEY: “Oh no, never, nor should they. Keep in mind that that’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway, which of course is what drive the Democrats crazy.”
-- ON THE MUELLER REPORT: HEMMER: “Do you want to see it?” MULVANEY: “I don’t really have much interest in seeing it. I wasn’t involved in it. I was over at OMB during that process. I don’t really have much interest.”
JAKE TAPPER spoke with HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN ADAM SCHIFF (D-CALIF.) on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION” about whether parts of the Mueller report should be redacted: SCHIFF: “Well, look, if there are classified portions of the report, if there’s the classified annex, for example, that may need to be close-hold, depending on whether that reveals sources and methods. There may even be some parts of that, though, that can be declassified in the public interest.”
-- SCHIFF on collusion: “Yes, there’s ample evidence of collusion in plain sight. But that is not the same thing as proof of a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, and that I would defer to Bob Mueller’s judgment. And I do. But I think what we’re talking about here is the difference between conduct that rises to the level of criminality and conduct that is deeply unethical, unpatriotic and corrupt that may not be criminal.”
-- TAPPER also spoke with National Economic Director LARRY KUDLOW about Trump’s possible Federal Reserve picks of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain. KUDLOW: “I mean, first of all, they’re both very smart people. Second of all, let’s take Mr. Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneur, businessman, he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans, I think, about a decade.
“He is intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues. So I think these criticisms are very unfair.”
SCOOP: ALEX ISENSTADT in Las Vegas: “Pro-Trump Republicans plan eight-figure play for the Jewish vote in 2020”: “Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decades-long stranglehold on the Jewish vote.
“Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. On Friday morning, the group’s board members — many of them prominent Republican Party donors — gathered in a conference room at Adelson’s Venetian resort, where they were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump. The investment, people familiar with the early discussions say, will far surpass what the group has spent in past presidential elections.
“With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who himself has at times faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism — as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.
“‘We’re at the intersection of a very unique moment in time where we have the most pro-Israel president ever in history in Donald Trump, and we also at the same time have the Democratic Party – because of the pressure of the progressive left – moving away from the traditional support for Israel that has existed going back to 1948,’ said Matt Brooks, who has served as RJC executive director for nearly three decades.” POLITICO

Good Sunday morning. THE VIRGINIA CAVALIERS will face the TEXAS TECH RED RAIDERS for the NCAA men’s basketball championship Monday at 9:20 p.m. EDT in Minneapolis. It will be broadcast on CBS. Virginia is an early one-point favorite in Vegas.
MORE SUNDAY BEST … CHUCK TODD spoke with SOUTH BEND MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS” about what makes him qualified to be president: BUTTIGEIG: “I would stack up my experience against anybody. I know it’s not as traditional I haven’t been marinating in Washington here for a very long time and I know I’m not part of that establishment but I would argue that being the mayor of a city of any size means that you have to deal with the kinds of issues that really hit Americans.”
-- BUTTIGIEG on the issues: GUN CONTROL: “We’ve already decided within the framework of the Second Amendment that we’re going to draw a line somewhere, right? ‘Shall not be infringed’ clearly doesn’t mean that you're entitled to a nuclear weapon. I mean somewhere in between a slingshot and a nuclear weapon we’re going to draw a line about what makes sense.”
… ON ABORTION: “This is a moral question that’s not going to be settled by science and so the best way for it to be settled in practice is by the person that actually faces the choice and when a woman is facing this decision in her life, I think the – in terms of somebody besides her who can most be useful in that, the answer to that would be a doctor. Not a male government official imposing his interpretation of his religion.”
-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS spoke with JAY SEKULOW on ABC’S “THIS WEEK” -- via Matthew Choi: “President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, on Sunday dismissed House Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns, charging the probe sets a precedent for using the IRS for political purposes. ‘What stops another party from doing the same thing?’ Sekulow said. …
“Sekulow dismissed any notion the request had any policy value and characterized it as weaponizing the president's personal finances. He also pointed out that several House Democrats have not made their taxes public and that it's illegal for Congress to disclose others' tax returns, including public officials, without their consent. ‘The president has not asked for Nancy Pelosi's tax returns,’ Sekulow said, referring the Democratic House speaker from California.” POLITICO
BUCKLE UP … THE NEXT TWO YEARS … AP’S LISA MASCARO: “Senate GOP game plan means more Trump nominees, fewer bills”: “Mitch McConnell says the Senate will be in the ‘personnel business’ this year. But the majority leader’s focus on confirming President Donald Trump’s nominees is coming at the expense of any big legislative priorities.
“Nearly 100 days into the new Congress, the drive to confirm is adding more conservatives to the courts and putting more Trump appointees in government offices. But Trump’s promises to replace the Affordable Care Act, invest in infrastructure or cut middle class taxes have been essentially shelved.
“The result is that the GOP-controlled Senate is on a very different path heading into the 2020 election than is the House, where the Democratic majority is churning out a long list of bills on ethics, gun violence and other topics that, while unlikely to become law, show voters their priorities.” AP
PELOSI INTERVIEW … WAPO’S PAUL KANE: “Pelosi outlines a path to victory for House Democrats in 2020 — and guarantees it”: “Barely three months into her second turn in charge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already mapped out a plan to overwhelm Republicans in the 2020 elections.
“‘I’m going to have our races won by this November,’ the California Democrat said. Yes, the House speaker predicted that she will have locked down the majority a full year ahead of schedule, leaving the political battlefield to what she considers an intense presidential race all the way up to November 2020.
“It’s a remarkably bold guarantee for Pelosi, who will celebrate this new majority’s 100-day mark at a Democratic retreat next week outside Leesburg. Her caucus has had its share of growing pains in the first quarter of the year, with younger, more-liberal Democrats trying to push Pelosi’s leadership team as far to the left as possible.” WaPo
-- PELOSI made similar remarks about being focused on 2020 to us earlier this week at a Playbook Interview. Look for this to be a new rallying cry for the speaker to raise money and to energize the base.
MEANWHILE … THE WAITING GAME CONTINUES -- “Congress Waits as Barr Blacks Out Parts of Mueller Report,” by NYT’s Charlie Savage
WHAT’S ON PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP’S MIND -- @realDonaldTrump at 9:50 a.m.: “Looks like Bob Mueller’s team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!”
FROM 30,000 FEET -- “Threats From Trump Often Fall Short,” by NYT’s Michael Tackett and Linda Qiu: “For President Trump, a threat is frequently his first impulse. He is forceful, declarative and speaks with unvarnished conviction. He has made the theme of promises made, promises kept the anthem of his re-election effort. But his threats often remain just that. The most recent example was when Mr. Trump backed down from a vow to close the border with Mexico, instead saying he would give one of the United States’ most essential trading partners a year to deal with the migrant crisis. ...
“Here is a look at some of Mr. Trump’s more high-profile threats[:] Closing the border with Mexico ... A bullhorn to Russia ... Telling General Motors to reopen a plant, or else (he would cut subsidies) ... Threats against the media ... Trying to overturn a constitutional right ... California on his mind ... A veiled warning to James B. Comey.” NYT
HMM … WAPO’S HEATHER LONG: “Trump administration nearly doubles H-2B guest visa program, which brings many Mexican workers”: “The Homeland Security and Labor departments plan to grant an additional 30,000 H-2B visas this summer on top of the 33,000 they had already planned to give out, the agencies confirmed.
“The H-2B visa allows foreign workers to come to the United States legally and work for several months at companies such as landscapers, amusement parks or hotels. About 80 percent of these visas went to people from Mexico and Central America last year, government data shows.” WaPo
-- “U.S. says reuniting separated families laborious process,” by AP’s Elliot Spagat in San Diego: “The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.
“The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 — the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation — for example, children under 5.” AP
ABOUT LAST NIGHT … “Trump to Jewish Republicans: Democrats pushing ‘extreme, anti-Semitic agenda,’” by Gabby Orr in Washington and Alex Isenstadt in Las Vegas: “Speaking before a crowd of influential GOP donors and Jewish Republicans, President Donald Trump on Saturday accused Democrats of mistreating Israel and allowing the ‘scourge of anti-Semitism to take root’ in their party. ‘Democrats are advancing by far the most extreme, anti-Semitic agenda in history,’ Trump said.
“‘If implemented… the Democrats’ radical agenda could very well leave Israel out there all by yourselves.’ In remarks at an annual conference hosted by the Republican Jewish Coalition, which endorsed Trump in 2016 and has spoken glowingly of his administration during his first two years in office, the president riled up the crowd by tearing down his political opponents one-by-one.” POLITICO
TOP TWEETS -- WAPO’S FELICIA SONOMEZ (@feliciasonmez): “‘Special thanks to Representative Omar of Minnesota. Oh, I forgot. She doesn’t like Israel. I forgot. I’m so sorry.’ Trump to RJC crowd, singling out Omar one day after a man was arrested for threatening to kill her and calling her a ‘terrorist.’”
… AP’S ZEKE MILLER (@ZekeJMiller): “Trump was greeted at the steps of Air Force One by Steve Wynn, former RNC finance chair who resigned after sexual harassment allegations.”
2020 WATCH -- WAPO’S CHELSEA JANE in West Hollywood: “‘It got real gay real quick’: Pete Buttigieg’s rise electrifies the gay community, but he could face a rocky road”: “Pete Buttigieg was sitting in the back of a black SUV with a couple of staffers, sipping a still-steeping cup of tea to ease the fatigue from his suddenly frenetic schedule, when he looked out the window and interrupted himself.
“‘Man,’ said Buttigieg, taking in the rainbow-hued signs and colorfully dressed passersby that signaled he had entered West Hollywood, Los Angeles’s de facto gay neighborhood. ‘It got real gay real quick out there.’
“Few Democratic presidential candidates could assess their surroundings so bluntly without seeming painfully out of line. But Buttigieg is not like any other Democratic presidential candidate — in part, if not exclusively, because he is gay.” WaPo
-- ELENA SCHNEIDER and MAGGIE SEVERNS: “Gillibrand leans on female donor groups she built over last decade”: “In her first years in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand traveled to major cities across the country to start female-centric donor circles to elevate women in politics, harkening back to her own political awakening as a donor in a male-dominated space.
“Now, the New York Democrat is returning to those groups — some of which now contribute over $1 million to candidates per election — and asking them to help make her the first female president of the United States.” POLITICO

-- JAMES ARKIN: “Former Auburn football coach running for Alabama Senate seat”: “Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville is running for Senate in Alabama as a Republican, he announced Saturday. … Tuberville is joining the race to run against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a special election in 2017 and is running for a full term next year.
“Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne is already in the race, and several other Republicans are considering jumping into the primary to challenge Jones, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat on the ballot next year.
“Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former White House communications director, is expected to assist Tuberville with the campaign, according to sources familiar with the budding operation, though a formal role hasn’t been determined yet.” POLITICO

MEANWHILE IN ISRAEL ... “Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected,” by AP’s Karin Laub in Jerusalem: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
“Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state. An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.” AP
-- THIS IS A BIG DEAL: This is essentially throwing the two-state solution in the dustbin.
WHAT WALL STREET IS READING -- “How regulators, Republicans and big banks fought for a big increase in lucrative but risky corporate loans,” by WaPo’s Damian Paletta: “Actions by federal regulators and Republicans in Congress over the past two years have paved the way for banks and other financial companies to issue more than $1 trillion in risky corporate loans, sparking fears that Washington and Wall Street are repeating the mistakes made before the financial crisis. The moves undercut policies put in place by banking regulators six years ago that aimed to prevent high-risk lending from once again damaging the economy.
“Now, regulators and even White House officials are struggling to comprehend the scope and potential dangers of the massive pool of credits, known as leveraged loans, they helped create. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and other financial companies have originated these loans to hundreds of cash-strapped companies, many of which could be unable to repay if the economy slows or interest rates rise.” WaPo
BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “Survivors of Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle fear they have been forgotten,” by WaPo’s Patricia Sullivan and Joel Achenbach in Mexico Beach, Fla.: “The stretch of the Florida Panhandle east of Panama City is known as the Forgotten Coast, because it’s so rural and undeveloped — a remnant of a wild, pre-Disney, pre-air-conditioned Florida. ... Government agencies have cleared the roads and utilities have restored power, water and communications, but thousands of people are still desperate for permanent housing, competing not only with one another for the scarce supply of rental units, but with construction workers who have come into the area.
“Many residents are living in damaged homes or trailers unfit for human habitation. Some live in tents. Homeowners are frustrated by stingy insurance companies and bewildering government paperwork, and they’re wary of shady contractors. ... Residents here wonder if their fellow Americans understand their ongoing struggle. Charitable donations flowing into the area have been modest. The American Red Cross calculated that designated donations for Hurricane Michael victims totaled $35 million through the end of March.” WaPo
VALLEY TALK -- “Scheme to Swap Fake iPhones Adds Up to $900,000 Loss for Apple, Prosecutors Say,” by NYT’s Rick Rojas: “The con was simple: Send a fake iPhone to Apple claiming that the device would not turn on and that it was under warranty, and not long after, a genuine replacement arrived in the mail. It was a scheme that federal prosecutors said two college students in Oregon repeated on such a scale that it amounted to nearly $900,000 in losses for Apple as they sent in hundreds of counterfeit phones. The two students, identified as Quan Jiang and Yangyang Zhou, would then ship the iPhones overseas where they would be sold for hundreds of dollars, and in return, they would get a cut of the profit.” NYT

Homeland Security chief Nielsen is out,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/07/homeland-security-nielsen-trump-administration-1260429,"Kirstjen Nielsen will leave her post as secretary of Homeland Security, President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, highlighting the administration's inner turmoil over rising levels of illegal immigration just days after the president backed off a threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of migrants arrested at the border in recent months — a proxy for illegal crossings — has increased to the highest levels in more than a decade. Under Nielsen’s watch, the administration experimented with a range of policies to deter migrants, only to see border arrests continue to rise.
Story Continued Below
“Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting Secretary for @DHSgov. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!“
Nielsen oversaw the implementation of Trump’s contentious immigration agenda, including the separation of thousands of families at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The 46-year-old Cabinet member was confirmed to the role in December 2017. Almost from the start, she came under fierce criticism from Trump over an uptick in illegal immigration. As a wave of Central American families arrived at the southwest border in recent months, scrutiny of her performance only intensified.
The news comes after the White House on Friday unexpectedly pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to become director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Vitiello, a longtime Border Patrol official, had already been approved by one congressional committee, but still need the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate confirmation.

A White House aide said Nielsen was told of the decision to withdraw Vitiello’s nomination two weeks ago, but disagreed with the move.
“I think she thought by stalling on making a plan for new ICE leadership, she would buy time to relitigate the decision,” a senior White House official said.
However, a person familiar with the situation argued that Nielsen was blindsided by the decision to drop Vitiello.
“At the end of the day, there were mounting frustrations on both sides,” the person told POLITICO.
Trump said Friday that his administration sought to “go in a tougher direction“ with the ICE role, but the White House has not announced a new nominee.
A senior administration official aligned with Nielsen said the White House had summoned her to a meeting with the understanding that she would be required to explain the rising arrests on the southwest border. The official said Nielsen didn’t want to plead to maintain her role and chose to resign instead.
Nielsen’s departure, coupled with the decision to abandon Vitiello’s nomination, leaves DHS thin at the leadership level — even as Trump and other officials warn that illegal immigration has reached crisis levels. With McAleenan elevated to acting secretary, Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez of U.S. Customs and Border Protection will probably take over at that agency.
“The system’s at a breaking point,” one congressional aide said. “I’m not sure how adding more chaos and throwing more fuel to the fire is going to be helpful.”
In recent weeks, both Trump and Nielsen have argued that the influx of migrants amounts to a pressing crisis that requires Congress to take action. DHS estimated that border officials encountered 100,000 migrants in March. If that trend continues, arrests this year could resemble the higher levels of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In addition, family members make up a significant number of those crossing the border recently, a situation that presents unique health and safety concerns, according to the administration.

With that in the background, the White House has urged lawmakers to toughen asylum standards and make it easier to detain and deport families and children from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Democrats have countered that the Trump administration has squandered resources by arresting low-level targets and seeking to detain as many people as possible. They also have ripped Trump for a recent move to cut hundreds of billions of dollars in assistance to Central American countries as a punishment for failing to stop migrant outflows.
The names of several possible candidates to replace Nielsen surfaced Sunday. Rick Perry, the current energy secretary and a former Texas governor, and former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli have both been discussed as possible candidates, according to the aide.
Another name in the mix is Emilio Gonzalez, city manager of Miami, according to a former DHS official. Gonzalez was director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the administration of President George W. Bush.
The president was widely expected to dismiss Nielsen after November’s midterm elections and surprised allies by keeping her on board. The two have clashed on their approach to immigration and border security from the outset of her tenure, with Trump complaining that she was too soft and regularly pushing her to take measures that crossed legal boundaries, she told allies.
In a resignation letter published online , Nielsen touted the administration’s performance, despite the soaring numbers of border arrests.
“I can say with confidence our homeland is safer today than when I joined the administration,” she said. “We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders, combat illegal immigration, obstruct the inflow of drugs, and uphold our laws and values.”
The letter said she would resign as of April 7, but Nielsen tweeted late Sunday night that she would continue as secretary through Wednesday to facilitate the transition. An initial draft provided to POLITICO misstated the year as 2018.
Democrats repeatedly sparred with Nielsen during her tenure as secretary and fumed at her department’s decision to split apart thousands of migrant families under the “zero tolerance” policy that ran from April to June of last year.
""Hampered by misstep after misstep, Kirstjen Nielsen's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a written statement following Trump‘s tweet. “It is clearer now than ever that the Trump administration's border security and immigration policies — that she enacted and helped craft — have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.“

Notable departures from Trump’s White House By POLITICO STAFF
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued that Nielsen’s departure signaled that Trump had moved far outside the mainstream when it comes to immigration enforcement.
“When even the most radical voices in the administration aren’t radical enough for President Trump, you know he’s completely lost touch with the American people,” Schumer said in a statement.
Nielsen lost two allies within the Trump administration at the end of 2018: White House chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of Defense James Mattis, whose departures came after a lengthy record of clashes with the president.
Kelly, who preceded Nielsen as DHS secretary, was a mentor to Nielsen, who was his chief of staff at DHS and later his White House deputy.
Still, her alliance with Kelly didn’t shield her from the president’s ire over migrant “caravans” that trekked to the border from Central America over the past year. Nielsen teetered on the brink of resignation in May after Trump blasted her border management during a Cabinet meeting. Six months later, Kelly and national security adviser John Bolton engaged in a heated conversation outside the Oval Office over Nielsen’s approach to securing the border.
The announcement that McAleenan would assume the secretary’s role in an acting capacity surprised some former DHS officials. According to the department’s line of succession outlined in a 2017 defense spending bill, Claire Grady, the undersecretary for management, would be the next in line to helm the department.
Grady is currently the acting deputy secretary, a position that has remained vacant since former deputy Elaine Duke retired last April — one of numerous top positions that remain filled by acting officials at DHS.
One person familiar with Nielsen’s departure wondered whether McAleenan could win Trump’s approval in the short or long term, and contrasted his measured style with former acting ICE Director Thomas Homan’s brash persona.
""Kevin’s a smart guy, but he’s not like Tom Homan, like a rabble rouser,” the person said. “Kevin is very thoughtful and deliberate.”

Trump withdraws ICE director pick to take agency in 'tougher direction' By KATIE GALIOTO
Roger Dow, president of the U.S. Travel Association, praised McAleenan’s appointment and history of facilitating legal trade. McAleenan served as both deputy commission during the Obama administration and became acting commissioner when Trump took office. He was confirmed as commissioner in March 2018.
“In Mr. McAleenan we have an ally with a full and complete understanding of both national security and the importance of facilitating cross-border trade, which includes travel,” Dow said.
Amid Trump’s busy immigration agenda, Nielsen remains best known for her involvement with the zero-tolerance policy and resultant family separations.
The policy called for all suspected border crossers — including parents and asylum seekers — to be prosecuted for illegal entry. As a result, thousands of children were separated from their parents, with children classified as “unaccompanied.“
Nielsen eventually helped Trump draft an executive order barring family separations, but 10 months and several legal challenges later the administration is still struggling to deal with the fallout.
Nielsen has repeatedly said the Trump administration never had a family separation policy, a semantic dodge undermined by the reality of increased separations at the border.
A DHS internal watchdog report released in late October said Nielsen and other officials from DHS and the Health and Human Services Department were blindsided by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' initial decision to implement zero tolerance.

White House performing chief of workers Mick Mulvaney stated on Sunday that congressional democrats won’t ever see President Donald Trump's tax returns, arguing that any controversy surrounding the elusive monetary statements was ""litigated"" through the 2016 presidential marketing campaign.
""Oh no. Never. And neither did she, & # 39; Mulvaney informed host Bill Hemmer on & # 39; Fox News Sunday & # 39 ;. Story continued beneath
""Keep in mind: that is a matter that was already being raised during the elections,"" Mulvaney stated. ""Voters knew the president could have done his tax return, they knew he didn't, and they chose him anyway – which of course drives the Democrats crazy.""
House manners and sources Commission President Richard Neal (D-Mass.) On Wednesday, in a letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig, demanded that the company present Trump & # 39; s particular person and enterprise tax returns for six years by April 10 on the newest.
Trump stated that day later that White House journalists wouldn’t make his return public and claimed that he was nonetheless underneath management of the IRS – an announcement he used for years to justify his refusal to launch the statements.
""We are under control, despite what people said, and we work it out. I am always under control, it seems. But I have been under control for years because the numbers are large, and I assume that when you have a name, you is being checked, ""Trump stated. ""But until I am not under control, I would not be inclined to do that.""
On Thursday, Trump delved into his non-compliance with the legislator's request and stated they may remedy the issue along with his private legal professionals and the Justice Department.
& # 39; They will discuss to my legal professionals. They will converse to the Attorney General, & stated Trump.
Mulvaney acknowledged Sunday that the president ""always allowed people to see his tax returns,"" however ""that's not what happens here,"" he stated.
""The Democrats demand that the IRS reverse the documents, and that will not happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt from my former colleagues,"" stated Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman and finances chief of the White House.
""They just want to focus on the problem because they don't want to talk to us about policy,"" he added.

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s communications director is leaving City Hall to work on his federal political action committee, the latest sign that de Blasio is leaning toward a run for president.
Mike Casca, who came to City Hall in 2017 after working on Sen. Bernie Sanders ’ presidential campaign, will leave his city job Monday, he said. Wiley Norvell, a communications aide to de Blasio since he was the public advocate, will assume the $180,000-a-year role.
Casca will work as a spokesperson and communications strategist for Fairness PAC, which de Blasio has been tapping into for his and his aides’ travel to key voting states as he explores a White House bid. This weekend, de Blasio flew to Nevada to discuss his income inequality agenda and meet with a culinary workers union. The mayor then promised to join members on a picket line .
De Blasio has traveled to Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire in recent weeks, all while saying a 2020 bid is “hypothetical” and insisting he will decide “sooner rather than later.”
He argues polls that show New Yorkers have little interest in seeing him run are premature.
Casca has been working on de Blasio’s national aspirations for several months, but had yet to officially leave his job overseeing City Hall’s communications strategy. He said he was being paid his public salary while working on the mayor’s hypothetical campaign in his spare time.
He also said he received a formal waiver from the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board allowing his plans.
Another top City Hall aide, intergovernmental affairs director Jon Paul Lupo, has taken leave to work on the potential campaign. He continues to be paid by the city while using vacation days, Casca said. That arrangement was also cleared by the ethics board.
De Blasio has yet to set up a campaign, but has been raising money through his federal PAC.
He held a $5,000-a-plate fundraiser on March 6 hosted by real estate developer Aby Rosen of RFR Holding, the New York Times reported . And on Friday, de Blasio had another $5,000-a-head fundraiser in Boston hosted by Suffolk Construction, a firm looking to expand its business in New York City, the New York Times also reported .
When the PAC was set up last summer, de Blasio told POLITICO he would not accept funds from anyone with business before the city.
The mayor defended the arrangement with Suffolk, as well as one with another Fairness PAC fundraiser who is the lawyer for a building owner in the midst of a deal with City Hall , in a particularly heated exchange with WNYC’s Brian Lehrer on Friday.
Lehrer grilled the mayor on why he declined to disclose details of those fundraisers, and why he thinks it’s appropriate to raise money from people looking to do city business.
“There’s lots of different companies involved in New York City. Each one has a different situation,” de Blasio said. “But again, if we are going to have a campaign finance system that requires private donations which I think on its face is not the right system, I’m a participant in a political world where that is the only way to get the resources to get your message out as you’re starting out and I think we should just come to grips with it.”"

-- NYT: “Ms. Nielsen had requested the meeting to plan ‘a way forward’ at the border, in part thinking she could have a reasoned conversation with Mr. Trump about the role, according to three people familiar with the meeting. She came prepared with a list of things that needed to change to improve the relationship with the president.
“Mr. Trump in recent weeks had asked Ms. Nielsen to close the ports of entry along the border and to stop accepting asylum seekers, which Ms. Nielsen found ineffective and inappropriate. While the 30-minute meeting was cordial, Mr. Trump was determined to ask for her resignation. After the meeting, she submitted it.” NYT
WHERE TRUMP’S HEAD IS AT -- @realDonaldTrump at 8:45 p.m.: “More apprehensions (captures) at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes -- No Open Borders (Crimes & Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary…”

MILLER RISING -- ANITA KUMAR, GABBY ORR and DANIEL LIPPMAN: “Stephen Miller pressuring Trump officials amid immigration shakeups”: “As President Donald Trump roils the capital over illegal immigration, his influential aide Stephen Miller is playing a more aggressive behind-the-scenes role in a wider administration shakeup.
“Frustrated by the lack of headway on a signature Trump campaign issue, the senior White House adviser has been arguing for personnel changes to bring in more like-minded hardliners, according to three people familiar with the situation — including the ouster of a key immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security, whose secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, announced on Sunday that she is resigning.
“Miller has also recently been telephoning mid-level officials at several federal departments and agencies to angrily demand that they do more to stem the flow of immigrants into the country, according to two people familiar with the calls.” POLITICO
-- TRUMP WANTS TO GET TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION. We get that. But part of that is finding someone in his administration who could work with a DEMOCRATIC HOUSE! The president lost the House in November, and he doesn’t seem to have fully reckoned with that.

He held a variety of positions at the border protection agency before becoming its deputy commissioner in 2014 under the Obama administration. He won the country’s highest civil service honor, the Presidential Rank Award, in 2015.
“Mr. McAleenan became the acting commissioner of the agency in January 2017 and was formally sworn in as commissioner in March 2018. He focused on counterterrorism, border security and trade enforcement, oversaw about 60,000 employees and managed a budget of over $13 billion, according to the agency.” NYT

THE LATEST ON DISASTER FUNDING … SARAH FERRIS and JOHN BRESNAHAN: “With a disaster relief bill deadlocked in the Senate, House Democrats are prepared to move ahead with their own package that includes billions of dollars in aid for the rain-swollen Midwest. The Democrats’ revised bill would add $2.5 billion for heartland states reeling from catastrophic floods, an overture to Republicans after months of partisan bickering.
“But the new version is unlikely to advance in the Senate because it includes the same contentious pot of money for Puerto Rico, which has been among the GOP’s chief criticisms against the bill.” POLITICO
ADAM CANCRYN and ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN: “Trump’s health care brain trust says no thanks”: “President Donald Trump promised a new plan to replace Obamacare. But the four Senate Republicans he tapped for the job aren’t jumping at the opportunity.
“Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) says any new plan has to come from the White House — and that he had no warning Trump planned to make him part of the health policy group. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) won’t say more than he and colleagues are ‘working on health care thoughts.’ John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), when asked about the Republican plan, turned the question back on the opposition, saying, ‘Democrats want to go to the complete government takeover of health care.’ And Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the fourth member of Trump’s team, hasn’t committed to anything more than conversations with colleagues’ about health care affordability.” POLITICO
2020 WATCH … AP’S JUANA SUMMERS and JULIE PACE: “Sanders finds himself in a new role: front-runner”: “Less than two months into his second White House bid, no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest, a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives.
“That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run, creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns, which he has not yet released.
“He initially blamed ‘mechanical issues’ for the delay, and his campaign now says he wants to wait until after the April 15 tax filing deadline to fulfill his promise to release a decade worth of returns.” AP
301 DAYS UNTIL IOWA … WAPO’S CLEVE WOOTSON JR. and HOLLY BAILEY in Malcom, Iowa: “In Iowa, Bernie Sanders and Beto O’Rourke change up their styles to win over skeptical voters”: “For Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been criticized for having little interaction with voters, that meant answering dozens of questions from people in Malcom about whatever they wanted to discuss: student aid for undocumented immigrants, a universal basic income or criminal justice legislation.
“At one point during his town hall, an aide warned Sanders they were running short on time and ‘this will have to be the last question.’ ‘No,’ Sanders replied. ‘We have time to take one or two more.’ Then he took a question about his plan to raise the minimum wage.
“For O’Rourke, who has been accused of being heavy on rhetoric and skimpy on policy specifics, it meant talking to voters in all the detail and length he could muster. ‘Let me try again,’ he said at Grinnell College after being asked a second time for more specifics of his platforms to address climate change and police violence.” WaPo
-- DAVID SIDERS in Des Moines: “Reality bites Beto after high-flying kickoff”: “[B]y the time he left the state on Sunday, it was also clear that the euphoria that greeted O’Rourke’s entry into the race three weeks earlier has started to subside. The inevitable slog of competing in a packed Democratic primary is underway, and O’Rourke has not yet drawn the wave of national adulation from the left that his Senate run against Ted Cruz last year received.

CALIFORNIA VS. TRUMP -- L.A. TIMES’ TARYN LUNA in San Salvador, El Salvador: “ Newsom seeks to counter Trump as he makes world stage debut in El Salvador”: “‘I think right now you have a president that talks down to people in this country, talks past them, demoralizing folks living here and their relatives in the United States,’ [California Gov. Gavin] Newsom said of President Trump. ‘I think it’s important to let folks know that’s not our country, that’s an individual in our country, who happens at this moment to be president.’
“The governor chose the smallest country in Central America as the backdrop for his debut on the world’s stage to observe its socio-economic conditions, which send tens of thousands of Salvadorans fleeing for the U.S. each year. But the journey nearly 3,000 miles from the state he governs also affords Newsom a key political opportunity to counter Trump’s immigration narrative to an international audience, a move that could boost his national profile for future campaigns and help position him as a progressive leader of the resistance.” LAT

HAPPENING TOMORROW: the Israeli elections. Longtime P.M. Benjamin Netanyahu faces a vigorous challenge from a centrist coalition led by former Army chief Benny Gantz. Trump has gone all in for Netanyahu; will it be enough to get his ally re-elected?
-- THE STAKES … NYT’S DAVID HALBFINGER in Jerusalem: “As Israelis get ready to go to the polls on Tuesday, a stark, fateful and long-deferred choice has suddenly reappeared to confront them after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s unexpected promise to begin extending sovereignty over the West Bank if he is re-elected.
“Do voters want to make permanent their country’s control over the West Bank and its 2.6 million Palestinian inhabitants? Or do they want to keep alive the possibility that a Palestinian state could be carved out there one day?
“That question has been made newly urgent by Mr. Netanyahu ... His shocking announcement about Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank appeared to be a last-ditch effort to rally his right-wing base and stay in power.” NYT

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— Homeland Security joins the Defense Department in having an acting chief after Kirstjen Nielsen resigned Sunday night.
— Commanders are concerned about the safety of U.S. forces in the Middle East as the administration prepares to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist organization.
— The National Space Symposium gets underway in Colorado Springs this week.
HAPPY MONDAY , where we're dbrown@politico.com @dave_brown24
HOMELAND SECURITY NIELSEN OUT: “Kirstjen Nielsen will leave her post as secretary of Homeland Security, President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, highlighting the administration's inner turmoil over rising levels of illegal immigration just days after the president backed off a threat to close the U.S.-Mexico border,” write POLITICO’s Ted Hesson and Eliana Johnson.
“A senior administration official aligned with Nielsen said the White House had summoned her to a meeting with the understanding that she would be required to explain the rising arrests on the southwest border. The official said Nielsen didn’t want to plead to maintain her role and chose to resign instead.”
Trump named Kevin McAleenan , head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. More on him here and here , via The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.
Space TALKING SPACE: The National Space Symposium runs through Thursday this week in Colorado Springs. Today, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson speaks at 2.
Our own Jacqueline Klimas is on station and will bring us the latest throughout the week. The full agenda is here .
The Air Force, meanwhile , has narrowed the list of possible locations for the new U.S. Space Command to six, per CNN.
“The six finalist locations are Buckley Air Force Base, Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station, Peterson Air Force Base, and Schriever Air Force Base — all in Colorado — as well as the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Alabama and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.”
STICK WITH TWO: Sen. Doug Jones is urging the Air Force to maintain its plan to award contracts to two — not three — companies for the second phase of its Launch Services Agreement contract, Klimas writes .
IRAN NEW TERROR DESIGNATION: “The Trump administration is preparing to designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guard a ‘foreign terrorist organization,’ an unprecedented move against a national armed force that could have widespread implications for U.S. personnel and policy in the Middle East and elsewhere,” The Associated Press reports .
An announcement on the move is expected today, and could result in sanctions and the freezing of assets. The U.S. military is concerned that the designation could prompt Iranians to retaliate against U.S. forces in the region.
New threat: “With this stupidity, the American army and security forces will no longer have today’s calm in the west Asia region,” said Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the IRG, according to Reuters.
Pressure on Iraq: “Iran’s supreme leader urged Iraqi leaders to take the necessary steps to end the U.S. military presence in Iraq quickly during a meeting with prime minister Abdul Mahdi,” Bloomberg reports .
“You should take necessary measures so that the U.S. will withdraw its troops from Iraq as soon as possible,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.
ON THE HILL OPENING BUDGET CAPS BID: The House this week considers legislation to boost defense and domestic spending caps. The caps bill heads to the House Rules Committee today , where lawmakers will set the parameters for floor debate and weigh whether to allow votes on amendments.
The legislation — which would allow $733 billion in national defense spending for fiscal 2020 — is House Democrats' opening bid in talks to raise the budget caps. But Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) has little margin for error in passing the measure amid resistance to increasing defense spending from some progressive lawmakers. Still, Yarmuth says he doesn’t expect the defense topline to change. Read here for more details from POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma.
NO SEQUESTER: House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith unveiled legislation on Friday that would maintain spending caps but get rid of automatic cuts known as sequestration, our colleague Connor O’Brien writes .
Read the bill here .
DISASTER AID: “With a disaster relief bill deadlocked in the Senate, House Democrats are prepared to move ahead with their own package that includes billions of dollars in aid for the rain-swollen Midwest,” POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris and John Bresnahan write .

White House battles the Fed,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/04/08/white-house-battles-the-fed-422323," The White House battles the Fed — The White House is putting a heavy press on the Fed and Chair Jay Powell to cut rates this year to juice growth again heading into 2020 with both President Trump and NEC Director Larry Kudlow now public calling for a reduction, noting that inflation remains low.
Trump’s unconventional nominees of Herman Cain and Stephen Moore are also aimed at setting up a more pro-Trump, MAGA wing of the central bank that could undermine Chair Powell. The trouble is, much of the economic data push in the other direction, notably Friday’s 196K job creation number and 3.8 percent job creation.
So don’t expect a cut any time soon — MM spoke with AXA economist David Page: “I think there is a risk that they do that. But there’s certainly not a good argument for it … You continue to see a tight labor market and what the Fed has delivered is a closing in spare capacity in the U.S. economy… From this point going forward you would expect to see more inflation pressures.”
Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The return to normal in the March payroll numbers, with a 196K headline increase, is another nail in the coffin of the ‘imminent recession’ theory.”
BATTLE OVER TRUMP’S TAXES HEATS UP — Don’t Nancy Cook’s story on Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin losing two top aides who would help fight the push for Dems to get Trump’s tax returns. And over the weekend, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney indicated the public will NEVER see the returns.
GOOD MONDAY MORNING — Maybe some of you had Virginia in tonight’s NCAA championship but I bet none of you had Texas Tech. Tip is 9:20 p.m. @AubreeEWeaver .
Driving the Day DRIVING THE WEEK — President Trump on Tuesday has a bilateral meeting with Egypt President El Sisi … Trump on Wednesday visits San Antonio and Houston … Trump on Thursday meets with Korean President Moon Jae-in … Fed meets Monday on a foreign bank tailoring proposal and a living will-related plan
IMF and World Bank begin their spring meetings on Tuesday … House Financial Services subcommittee has a hearing at 10:00 a.m . on the Community Reinvestment Act.
Hearing: House Financial Services Committee … Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appears before full House Financial Services at 2:00 p.m. Tuesday … House Financial Services has a hearing Wednesday at 9:00 a.m . on “Holding Megabanks Accountable” featuring CEOS of some the nation’s largest banks. Promises to be a wild affair.
KUDLOW ON TRUMP’S FED PICKS — Kudlow to CNN’s Jack Tapper on Cain and Moore: “I mean, first of all, they're both very smart people. Second of all, let's take Mr. Herman Cain. Besides being a very successful entrepreneur, businessman, he was a board member of the Kansas City Federal Reserve, and actually was the chairman of the board of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. His time there spans, I think, about a decade. He is intimately acquainted with Federal Reserve operations and policy issues. So I think these criticisms are very unfair.” Read more .
MM SIDENOTE — Cain has advocated for a return to the gold standard and a nine percent national sales tax and faced sexual harassment accusations. Moore has tax issues of his own and questions about the nature of his departure from several jobs. The vetting process will be interesting on both.
MNUCHIN LOSING KEY AIDES — Nancy Cook piece mentioned above: “Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is about to lose two of his most trusted aides, just as House Democrats ramp up pressure on his department to release President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
“Eli Miller, chief of staff at Treasury and a former Trump campaign official, will leave the department [this] week, according to a staffwide email sent Friday afternoon. Close Treasury observers say Miller is expected to join the private sector. …
“Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs Tony Sayegh has also planned for months to leave by the end of May and is interviewing candidates for his replacement as the agency’s top communications official. Among them is Monica Crowley, a Fox News commentator who was spotted in the building Thursday afternoon.”
MULVANEY: FORGET TRUMP’S TAXES — White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to Bill Hemmer on “Fox News Sunday” on Dems getting the tax returns: “Oh no, never, nor should they. Keep in mind that that's an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn't, and they elected him anyway, which of course is what drives the Democrats crazy.”
THE RISKS OF GETTING THE TAXES — Our Brian Faler: “Democrats’ bid to seize … Trump’s tax returns will come with some serious legal risk to themselves. Lawmakers are concerned that, even if they get the president’s filings, his returns will still be protected by strict confidentiality laws — it is a felony, punishable by up to five years, to improperly disclose private tax information.” Read more
THE BIG IDEA: NOTHING IS OVER WITH U.S. AND CHINA — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “China and the U.S. last week signaled substantial progress in their trade negotiations .. One issue remains a puzzle, however: Why has the U.S. opted to deal bilaterally with China rather than lead a coalition of Western nations that share the same concerns about some of the Asian giant’s trade practices?
“How this question is answered will be one of the leading issues in assessing whether a China-U.S. agreement is a decisive resolution to a conflict that has hang over the global economy or, instead, just a short-term cease-fire.” Read more .
FLY AROUND BOOKER RAISES JUST $5 MILLION — Our Quint Forgey: “Cory Booker has raised more than $5 million since launching his presidential campaign on Feb. 1, a relatively modest figure for the New Jersey senator compared with the sums announced thus far by several of his rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination.
“Booker’s haul, announced Sunday in an email to supporters, falls short of the $18.2 million raised by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the $12 million raised by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), the $9.4 million raised by former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), and the$7 million raised by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, in the first quarter of 2019.” Read more .
BUFFET URGES WELLS TO LOOK BEYOND WALL STREET — FT’s Robert Armstrong, Eric Platt and Oliver Ralph: “Warren Buffett, the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, has called on the US bank to look outside Wall Street for a new chief executive who can restore its battered reputation. ‘They just have to come from someplace [outside Wells] and they shouldn’t come from Wall Street,’ Mr Buffett said of the bank’s next leader in an interview with the Financial Times. ‘They probably shouldn’t come from JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs.’” Read more .
TRUMP WANTS THE FED TO CUT RATES, AND IT JUST MIGHT — Bloomberg’s Rich Miller: “With his call for lower interest rates … Trump has weighed into a debate inside the Federal Reserve about what central bankers should do about sub-par inflation.
“It’s not totally crazy to think he’ll eventually carry the day. In advocating easier credit, Trump and senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow have harped on the paucity of inflation to justify their call for a change of course by the central bank, even with the U.S. economy still expanding.” Read more .
CORPORATE PROFIT SQUEEZE LOOMS — WSJ’s Michael Wursthorn: “The stock market’s strongest run in more than two decades will be tested beginning this week, as a looming pullback in corporate profit growth sets up major indexes for a fresh bout of volatility. Dozens of companies have slashed their profit forecasts for the first quarter.” Read more .
INFLATED CREDIT SCORES LEAVE INVESTORS IN THE DARK — Bloomberg’s Adam Pempkin: “Consumer credit scores have been artificially inflated over the past decade and are masking the real danger the riskiest borrowers pose to hundreds of billions of dollars of debt.
“That’s the alarm bell being rung by analysts and economists at both Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Moody’s Analytics, and supported by Federal Reserve research, who say the steady rise of credit scores as the economy expanded over the past decade has led to ‘grade inflation.’ This means debtors are riskier than their scores indicate because the metrics don’t account for the robust economy, skewing perception of borrowers’ ability pay bills on time.” Read more .

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— The long-sought Colorado River drought contingency plan gets one step closer to authorization today with a key House vote.
— The Trump administration is again taking aim at the oil sector in an attempt to thwart the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
— Kirstjen Nielsen's departure from the Department of Homeland Security has left an opening to oversee implementation of the president's contentious immigration agenda — and Rick Perry's name is already being mentioned as a potential replacement.
WELCOME TO MONDAY! Dan Meyer of Duberstein Group is the trivia winner. Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens was the last justice to not attend an Ivy League law school. He is a Northwestern graduate. Another SCOTUS question for today: Several justices were not born in the United States. Who was the most recent? DROUGHT BILL GETS VOTE: The House has set up a vote to authorize a Colorado River water-sharing deal, as Pro's Annie Snider reports . The bill, H.R. 2030 (116) , would authorize the Interior secretary to implement the deal negotiated by seven states along the Colorado River in order to avoid a drop in water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell — two main reservoirs.
— The single largest user of Colorado River water , California's Imperial Irrigation District, did not sign onto the plan because of concerns over federal funding to deal with the Salton Sea' s environmental problems, but has since said that the legislation offered sufficient environmental protections that it would not oppose it.
Feinstein weighs in: California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote a brief op-ed in the Los Angeles Times over the weekend that she is ""working with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to make additional funds available as quickly as possible to support conservation efforts at the Salton Sea.""
AROUND THE AGENCIES WHITE HOUSE TRIES TO STOP VENEZUELAN OIL TO CUBA: The Treasury Department on Friday sanctioned two shipping companies transporting Venezuelan oil to Cuba, activities the U.S. says is helping to prop up the ""illegitimate"" regime of Nicolás Maduro.
Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control also identified 34 vessels on Friday as ""blocked property"" of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A., Venezuela's state-run oil company. ""Cuba has been an underlying force fueling Venezuela's descent into crisis,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. ""Treasury is taking action against vessels and entities transporting oil, providing a lifeline to keep the illegitimate Maduro regime afloat.""
DHS SECRETARY PERRY? Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation this weekend leaves the leadership ranks of DHS thinned out, and POLITICO’s Ted Hesson and Eliana Johnson report that Rick Perry's name is among several possible candidates to replace her.
Of course, it's not the first time Perry's name has come up to replace departures in the Cabinet. The Energy secretary is seen as one of the more successful officials in the Trump administration, having avoided major scandal and earning the praise of several on the Hill throughout his time at the department.
For his part, Perry's hasn't weighed in on the job, but tweeted a thank you to Nielsen on Sunday. ""Thank you, @SecNielsen for your service to @DHSgov, The @WhiteHouse, and the @realDonaldTrump Administration. Your commitment to National security, grid security, and our communities in times of natural disaster will not be forgotten,"" he said .
ECOS KICKS OFF: The Environmental Council of the States' spring meeting begins today, including a discussion between EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and ECOS President Becky Keogh, director of Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, on ""advancing collaboration with EPA."" Read the full agenda .
— On tap this week: Wheeler is set to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee tomorrow for a hearing on his agency's budget request for 2020.
IN THE COURTS PERMIT PENDING : Environmental groups are asking a federal court to block 's latest attempt to green-light the Keystone XL pipeline. A complaint filed in Montana court Friday argues that while Trump may have the power to invalidate the previous permit the State Department issued in 2017 — and which courts have already deemed insufficient to allow pipeline construction — he does not have the authority to allow pipeline developer TransCanada to start building a cross-border pipeline without the government first conducting an environmental review.
""Under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress — and not the President — holds the 'Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States,'"" the groups start in their complaint. They also argue Trump doesn't have the authority to override the State Department, which normally approves cross-border paths for oil pipelines.
Just sayin': The new lawsuit is before Judge Brian Morris, the very same one who ordered the State Department to redo the environmental review in the first place.
ANOTHER FREEZE FOR CPP LAWSUIT: The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has once again given the Trump administration more time to finish repealing and replacing the Clean Power Plan. The move comes as no surprise to court watchers; despite complaints from some judges last year that EPA was dragging its feet, the court has consistently given EPA more time ever since it released the proposed replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy rule, last year.
The order issued Friday afternoon places the case ""in abeyance"" for another 60 days, though that effectively comes with a couple more months attached informally, giving EPA well into summer to produce a rule before the next abeyance fight warms up.
CALIFORNIA SUES OVER CLEAN CAR STANDARDS: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration last week seeking data from EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that the administration is using to justify plans to roll back federal fuel economy standards, Pro California's Debra Kahn reports .
""[T]he Trump Administration is willfully withholding information on their ill-advised rollback of federal vehicle emission standards because there is simply no science or logic to back up their actions,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.
HOUSE SUES OVER BORDER WALL: Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is among the officials named in a new lawsuit from House lawmakers over Trump's emergency declaration to force funding for a border wall.
The lawsuit , filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. , asserts Trump's emergency acts in direct disregard of Congress' will and disputes the president's ability to access certain funds for the wall simply by declaring an emergency, POLITICO's Matthew Choi reports .
ON THE HILL CLIMATE CHANGE HEARINGS THIS WEEK: The Senate Energy Committee will hold a full committee hearing later this week to examine ""opportunities for energy innovation and other potential solutions to help address global climate change,"" with testimony from officials from the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute; the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and Stanford University, among others.
Meanwhile, House Democrats will continue their focus on climate change across several committees this week:
— The House Foreign Affairs Committee will mark up legislation H.R. 9 (116) that would bar the U.S. from withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, following an E&C Committee markup last week that advanced the measure.
— House Oversight Committee will hold a hearing on the importance of action on climate change in maintaining national security, where former Secretary of State John Kerry and former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will testify.
— A House Homeland Security subcommittee will also take a look at ""the Homeland Security Impacts of a Changing Climate.""
ON TAP THIS WEEK? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not yet scheduled a floor vote for Bernhardt's nomination to Interior after he cleared the Senate Energy Committee last week. But expect a vote any day now: Majority Whip John Thune told POLITICO last week he's hoping to move the nomination through the chamber ""as quickly as possible.""
CALLING FOR CARBON CAPTURE: Twelve bipartisan senators asked the Appropriations Committee to include the ""highest possible levels"" of funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies as it begins work on its fiscal year 2020 funding bills, Pro's Anthony Adragna reports .
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Bipartisan Sens. Lisa Murkowski , Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito re-introduced the ""Rare Earth Element Advanced Coal Technologies Act"" Friday to allow for the development of technology capable of extracting rare earth elements from coal and coal byproducts. Bill text .

De Blasio press secretary to leave for private sector,www.politico.com,sgoldenberg@politico.com (Sally Goldenberg),04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/04/08/de-blasio-press-secretary-to-leave-for-private-sector-955972,"

Mayor Bill de Blasio’s longest-serving press secretary, Eric Phillips, is leaving the administration for a crisis communications job in the private sector.
Phillips has held the job since 2016, handling the tumult of a multiyear federal investigation into de Blasio’s political fundraising, a terror attack on the West Side Highway and entrenched problems at the city’s housing authority. Story Continued Below
He garnered a reputation among reporters and political insiders for elevating the administration’s use of social media, debating with the press on Twitter when he viewed stories or questions as unfair to de Blasio.
Phillips will leave Friday for a job as senior vice president in crisis and reputation risk at Edelman, a communications firm with offices around the world. He will handle a global portfolio and does not plan to manage local issues or campaigns.
“This is the best spokesperson job in America and has been the opportunity of a lifetime,” Phillips said. “Communicating what’s happening in the most dynamic city in the world is a humbling exercise of imperfection. I tried to do it with integrity, accuracy and at least a little humor. I hope that sometimes I got it right.”
In managing the mayor’s fraught relationship with the local press corps, Phillips sought to lighten the mood at times. In November of 2017, for instance, he tweeted a picture of a Chicago pizza, calling it “the best pizza in the United States and it’s not close.” His challenge set off a light-hearted firestorm on Twitter.
Freddi Goldstein, who currently handles communications strategy for First Deputy Mayor Dean Fuleihan, will assume the $185,000-a-year press secretary job.
Phillip’s departure comes as de Blasio moves closer to announcing a run for president, which dozens of his aides and consultants have privately expressed doubt about. Mike Casca, City Hall’s communications director since 2017, left the administration Monday for a job handling the mayor’s federal PAC.
Casca is replaced by long-serving de Blasio aide Wiley Norvell, who previously worked as a spokesperson for some of the mayor’s top issues — an $82 billion housing plan, universal prekindergarten and Vision Zero, a quest to eliminate traffic-related fatalities. Norvell, who will earn $180,000 in the post, also wrote the mayor’s State of the City speech this year. "

I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border. Other than that, I’m on my way to keep doing what I can for the next few days.”
TRUMP’S NEW IMMIGRATION PUSH -- NBC’S JULIA AINSLEY and GEOFF BENNETT: “Trump’s support of renewed child separation policy led to collision with Nielsen”: “Three U.S. officials said that Kevin McAleenan, the head of Customs and Border Patrol who is expected to take over as acting DHS secretary, has not ruled out family separation as an option.
“The policy McAleenan would consider, according to the officials, is known as ‘binary choice’ and would migrant parents the option between being separated from their children or bringing their children with them into long term detention. Trump has been pushing this policy since January, the sources said, when the numbers of undocumented immigrants crossing the border began to rise. A senior administration official said they believe Trump is convinced that family separation has been the most effective policy at deterring large numbers of asylum seekers.” NBC
-- “Senators urge Trump admin to ease policy on detaining pregnant migrants,” by NBC’s Daniella Silva: “More than a dozen Democratic senators called on immigration authorities to restore presumptive release for pregnant women after a stillbirth in government detention earlier this year and an increase in the number of miscarriages in 2018, according to a letter sent exclusively to NBC News. …
“The senators urged ICE to bring back the Obama-era directive of presumptive release ‘for all pregnant women’ in immigrant detention, which President Donald Trump reversed. They also called on CBP to institute measures ensuring ‘timely and appropriate treatment’ for pregnant women in its custody.” NBC
MUELLER LATEST … KYLE CHENEY: “House GOP calls on Dems to bring in Mueller to testify”: “Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called Monday for Democrats to immediately bring special counsel Robert Mueller to the Capitol to testify on his still-secret report on Russian contacts with President Donald Trump’s campaign — and whether Trump himself obstructed the probe.
“‘If you seek both transparency and for the American public to learn the full contours of the Special Counsel’s investigation, public testimony from Special Counsel Mueller himself is undoubtedly the best way to accomplish this goal,’ Collins wrote in a letter to the committee’s chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).” POLITICO
-- THE THEORY behind pushing for Mueller to testify is twofold. First, Republicans want him to testify so that the public can see there’s nothing to hide. Second, Mueller could speak specifically (although in a closed session to get into grand jury and classified information) about why redactions are needed legally.
-- “Democrats still crafting Mueller response if report drops during recess,” by Kyle Cheney: “The House leaves for the week on Wednesday morning while Democrats hold their annual retreat in Leesburg, Va. Then members will scatter to their districts for a two-week recess, leaving Democrats urgently clamoring for a glimpse of Mueller's report with a choice: to react from the road or underscore their concern by reconvening early at the Capitol. … [L]awmakers on the Judiciary Committee, which is leading the House Democrats’ Mueller response, say they’re at least open to the idea of coming back to Washington.” POLITICO

WHITE HOUSE WORKAROUND? -- NYT’S JESSE MCKINLEY: “To Get Trump’s Tax Returns, N.Y.

“The designation targets Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a group that already faces numerous U.S. sanctions. Iranian officials have blasted the latest move, warning of ‘consequences’ for U.S. troops in the Middle East. President Donald Trump and his aides have mulled the move for many months, but have held back until now, in part because military experts say it could endanger American troops and lawyers warn it could be legally tough to defend.” POLITICO

“As part of that investigation, OSC has also reviewed allegations about potentially improper dealings by senior members of the Trump administration in their attempt to map out a nuclear deal with Riyadh, according to two sources with knowledge of OSC’s work. The details of the OSC probe, previously unreported, are the first indication that a government body other than Congress is investigating matters related to a potential nuclear deal between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.” The Daily Beast

NIELSEN RESIGNS AS HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF -- Key Republicans dodge Trump on health care -- HOUSE DEMS TO REVIVE DISASTER AID BILL -- Battle over Trump’s tax returns intensifies,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/08/nielsen-resigns-as-homeland-security-chief-key-republicans-dodge-trump-on-health-care-house-dems-to-revive-disaster-aid-bill-battle-over-trumps-tax-returns-intensifies-422324,"with an assist from Andrew Desiderio NO MORE NIELSEN -- After months of speculation about her job security and facing constant criticism from the president, Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned from her post as secretary of Homeland Security. The sudden departure leaves Donald Trump without a border chief at a time when the immigration system is overwhelmed with an influx of migrants at the border, and tees up what is likely to be a bitter confirmation battle on Capitol Hill.
THE REASON: Nielsen was blindsided by the White House’s unexpected decision to pull the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to become director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, report Ted Hesson and Eliana Johnson. The president also had been frustrated with the uptick in immigration and Nielsen’s handling of the situation at the southwest border, while her tense relationship with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner had recently come to a head, according to The New York Times.
After being summoned to a meeting at the White House Sunday night, Nielsen decided to quit instead of defend herself. (And in a sign of how sudden the move was, she didn't even have the date right in her resignation letter, notes Bres.)
THE REACTION: Democrats were quick to slam Nielsen, who oversaw the implementation of Trump’s contentious immigration agenda, including separating thousands of families at the border. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it “deeply alarming that the Trump Administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House’s liking,” while 2020 hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said her “legacy of tearing innocent families apart will follow her for the rest of her life—and she should be ashamed of the role she played.”
And some Republicans, including the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, didn’t even mention Nielsen by name. “We need steady, informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out of control border security and immigration problems,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).
THE REPLACEMENTS: For now, Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting DHS Secretary. Among the names in the mix to permanently replace Nielsen include Rick Perry, the current energy secretary and a former Texas governor; former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli; and Emilio Gonzalez, city manager of Miami.

BUELLER… BUELLER… BUELLER -- Not even the four Senate Republicans who Trump tasked with writing a health care plan have much interest in writing a health care plan, report Adam Cancryn and Alice Miranda Ollstein. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) didn’t even know he would be named to the health policy group and said any plan should come from the White House; Mitt Romney (R-Utah) just said he and his colleagues are “working on health care thoughts”; John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) deflected questions about the Republican plan onto Democrats; and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) hasn’t committed to anything more than “conversations with colleagues.” The ducking and dodging from key Republicans is just the latest sign that the GOP has little interest in taking ownership of the hot-button issue, despite Trump’s vow to be the “party of health care.” The dispatch: https://politi.co/2UGsVgW .

ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER -- House Democrats are hoping to revive a massive disaster aid package that has been stalled in the Senate, report Sarah and Bres. The House Appropriations Committee is prepared to unveil a revised bill that includes billions of dollars in aid for the rain-swollen Midwest, which they think could help move it along in the Senate. But the package would still include the same contentious pot of money for Puerto Rico, which was one of the GOP’s chief criticisms against the bill. Both chambers are under pressure to act before the upcoming two-week recess, with the situation becoming increasingly dire in disaster-stricken states. The latest: https://politi.co/2U0nVQ0 .
SAN FRANCISCO’S OTHER BRIDGE -- The biggest challenge for Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)? Serving as a bridge between the liberal flank of her party, who want more aggressive oversight of Trump, and the moderate corner of her caucus, who want to focus on the issues that helped deliver the House majority to Democrats. One way Pelosi is trying to do that is by touting her own liberal bona fides, while also stressing that Democrats need to find the “boldest common denominator” of legislation that can actually pass. “While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what’s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,” Pelosi told USA TODAY. (Note: liberal superstar Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has nearly 4 million followers on Twitter.) Much more from Eliza Collins: http://bit.ly/2I6pBWz .

TAX SEASON -- Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats will “never” see Trump’s tax returns, as the battle over the president’s tax filings intensifies on Capitol Hill. “That is not going to happen and they know it,” he said. Mulvaney’s comments come after Trump’s lawyer urged the Treasury Department in a letter on Friday to reject House Democrats’ demand for Trump’s tax returns, arguing that Democrats have no legitimate reason for the request. “Requests for tax returns and return information must have a legitimate legislative purpose,” the letter states. “It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponent.” Keep an eye on the House Ways and Means Committee this week, which demanded six years worth of Trump’s tax returns by April 10.

Driving the Day THAT WAS QUICK! The House will vote this week on the IRS measure, less than a week after the bill sailed through the Ways and Means Committee.
Based on the context clues, the prospects for H.R. 1957 (116) look good. The bill is being brought up under suspension of rules, something generally reserved for noncontroversial measures — though that also means it will need a two-thirds majority to pass. (Also of note: Did we mention a version of this bill passed the House unanimously last year?)
Two of the more influential senators on IRS matters, Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D-Md.), have signaled that they would like to amend the House bill to include a provision regulating paid tax preparers, as Tax Notes’ Stephen K. Cooper reported late last week. But Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has yet to show any inclination to alter the House bill — which he and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the committee’s top Democrat, have sponsored in the Senate — and has also declined pleas to hold a hearing on the IRS measure. For their part, Cardin and Portman have also signaled that they could likely accept the bill as is, even if it’s not totally to their liking.
GAUNTLET, TOSSED: Considering that it’s already been a three-year fight (and considering the general state of things these days) — did you expect that Democrats’ formal request to get Trump’s tax returns would get anything but heated?
The president’s allies fanned out to the Sunday shows to pound the leading case for Trump getting to keep his returns under lock and key — that there’s no legitimate legislative purpose propping up the request from Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.). On top of that, Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, said on ABC’s “This Week” that “the Supreme Court has said that on multiple occasions that congressional oversight cannot become law enforcement,” in a statement that raised some eyebrows. ( More on that from our Matthew Choi.)
Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, flat ly predicted on “Fox News Sunday” that the Democrats’ efforts would be ultimately unsuccessful, as our Quint Forgey reported.
Also worth noting: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he continues to believe that Trump should release his tax returns, but added that the Democrats’ approach to getting them was “moronic” and bound to fail.
From the other side: Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a House tax writer, scoffed at the idea that Republicans had a case for defying Neal’s request, and also brushed aside the notion that Democrats would have asked for additional information about the audits of previous presidents if the examination process was really their main concern. Kildee noted on ""This Week"" that presidents habitually released their tax returns in the decades before Trump, and that “it would be easy for not just Congress but any member of the public to take a look at that and make determinations as to whether or not the tax laws of the United States are being properly administered.”
And speaking of blunt perspectives on the matter: “Any well-informed person who disagrees either that the Ways and Means Committee has an obligation to demand Trump's tax returns as part of fulfilling its oversight duties, or that he is legally obliged to turn them over, is self-exposed as a partisan hack who has contempt for the rule of law,” wrote Daniel Shaviro, a tax law professor at New York University.
ICYMI: Pro Tax’s Brian Faler dove into Friday’s response from yet another Trump lawyer, William Consovoy, who prodded Treasury to rebuff Neal because of a lack of a “ legitimate legislative purpose .”
Plus, Brian wrote about how Democrats understand they would have to be careful while handling Trump’s returns, which will still have confidentiality protections.
A LITTLE POLICY INTERLUDE: In between all the tax return stuff, one longshot contender for the Democratic nomination, Andrew Yang, laid out his proposal on ABC’s “This Week” to use a value-added tax to help pay for a universal basic income. Yang estimated that the U.S. could raise about $800 billion (presumably a year) even with a VAT more modest than the current European examples. And how would he make a VAT less regressive, a key criticism of the consumption tax from the left? “You can actually make the VAT so it falls more heavily on luxury goods as opposed to consumer staples,” he said.
DON’T DO IT, TRUMP: There is some bipartisan interest on Capitol Hill in a gas tax increase. Meanwhile, Trump certainly views himself as a natural dealmaker, and has sounded open to a gas tax increase in the past.
None of that is all that new, but the past few days have seen some conservatives trying to alert Trump to think again. Perhaps most notably, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson recently called a gas tax increase “ so mindless and counterproductive there’s literally no way you could get reelected after doing it.” And over at National Review, Michael Brendan Dougherty cautioned Trump to look at the Yellow Vest protests in France that sparked up after President Emmanuel Macron ordered a gas tax increase.
INTERNATIONAL UPDATE ON THE SLY: Big earners in the United Kingdom are getting hit by “stealth” tax increases , according to a new study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the issue appears to be bracket creep — the U.K. set the top income tax threshold at 150,000 pounds (about $195,000) back in 2008, but didn’t tag it to inflation. Now, some 428,000 taxpayers have reached that top bracket, up from 319,000 around a decade ago. The IFS basically acknowledged that the top earners might not always get the most sympathy, but argued that it’s not in the U.K.’s best interest if those people “work less in order to keep their income below an arbitrary threshold.”
STATE NEWS WHAT ABOUT THE OIL? Alaska is scheduled to give out $1.2 billion in tax credits to oil companies this fiscal year, and that’s got residents and advocates worried about budget cuts up in arms , the Anchorage Daily News reports. One issue, according to experts: Effective tax rates on oil would increase if the credits were scrapped, and that has industry advocates worried that the entire system for taxing oil would have to be revamped. And so far at least, the potential for having to take on more widespread changes has state lawmakers taking a more cautious approach.

Why Is Trump Helping Egypt’s Dictator Entrench His Power? Magazine,www.politico.com,Peter Canellos,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/08/donald-trump-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-egypt-226579,"As someone who has watched the Egyptian people struggle against dictators for years, it is hard to fathom the fact that President Donald Trump will welcome Egypt’s brutal military leader, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, for a White House visit this week. Eight years after Egyptians went to the streets to remove 30-year ruler Hosni Mubarak and only weeks after Algerians did the same to remove 20-year autocrat Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the White House is betting on Sisi. It’s an endorsement Egypt’s president-for-life will use to entrench his grip on power: Showing he has Trump’s enthusiastic support will help Sisi force any potential critics in the army or elsewhere to follow suit.
Story Continued Below
Sisi’s Oval Office photo-op will come just a week or two before Egypt holds a popular referendum on amendments to the constitution that would give Sisi an exception to term limits, allowing him to stay in office until 2034. The amendments will also give the military a constitutional right to intervene in politics and will tighten his grip over the judiciary. If the referendum is similar to Sisi’s second election in 2018, Egyptian voters—demoralized and cowed by years of brutal repression since the 2013 military coup—will largely stay home .
To be clear, amending the constitution is not about the security or prosperity of Egypt. It is Sisi’s attempt to develop a highly personalized form of power for himself and loyal military officers, sidelining other institutions and ending all meaningful accountability—a direct violation of his own promises .
What good, then, can come of supporting Sisi to keep himself in power indefinitely? What harm might it cause? Can the United States remain neutral? As a former policymaker, I know firsthand that U.S. officials often face difficult decisions when trying to balance national security interests with human rights. But our history in the Middle East has shown that we often get these decisions catastrophically wrong.
***
Trump should support Sisi in his bid to stay in power indefinitely, the general’s supporters argue , because he is a visionary uniquely qualified to combat dangerous Islamists, reform Islam, boost women’s rights, fix his country’s ailing economy and promote regional peace with Israel. Plus, the U.S. needs to give Sisi unconditional backing lest Egypt fall into Russia’s grip.
Is Sisi a unique warrior against terrorism? While a concerted military push into the troubled Sinai in 2018 did quiet down the terrorist insurgency (an indigenous group that affiliated to ISIS) a bit, Sisi has no magic formula. Violence continues, including a significant attack against government forces in February. If anything, the continued presidency of a strongman who oversaw mass killings and other brutal human rights violations fuels recruits to violent movements.
Is Sisi an irreplaceable reformer of Islam and friend of Christians? Sisi is fond of positioning himself as such, but mostly he has resorted to public statements and gestures rather than significant changes to government policies , which continue to discriminate against non-Muslims. He has brutally crushed the Muslim Brotherhood as a political rival but failed to protect Christians from terrorist attacks. In fact, Sisi’s government has been more zealous than that of his predecessors in enforcing illiberal norms against atheists and LGBT citizens, among others.
Is Sisi the friend of women? In the style of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, yes--which is to say that Sisi gives lip service to women’s rights (winning praise from Ivanka Trump) while harshly repressing independent women’s rights organizations and activists. There have been no significant advances in women’s rights during his five years in power.
Is Sisi making an economic miracle? International Monetary Fund officials say they are content with Sisi’s austerity measures, but there is a big fly in the ointment: the growing economic dominance of the rapacious military. Foreign direct investment was lower in 2018 versus 2017 because investors do not want to compete on a tilted playing field. GDP growth is driven by energy production and government construction projects; in any case it is eaten up by rapid population growth. Youth unemployment remains very high, and double-digit inflation has led to more downward than upward social mobility under Sisi’s broken economic model .
Is Sisi a priceless partner to Israel and will he deliver on Trump’s peace deal? In the 40 years since the peace treaty, Egypt has cooperated with Israel consistently on military and intelligence matters—even during the brief tenure of deposed Brotherhood president Mohammad Morsi. Egypt under Sisi continues to impose a heavy price on civilians (even members of parliament) who meet with Israelis or visit Israel . Regarding the Trump peace plan, count on Sisi to do only what is in Egypt’s national security interests and not one iota more.
Finally, should Sisi be supported unconditionally as a bulwark against the encroaching grip of Russia? Sisi’s personal affinity with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his desire to grow that relationship have been on display since he came to office. He has purchased more Russian weapons than his predecessors did, including a recent $2 billion deal for fighter jets that might trigger U.S. sanctions. If the concern is pushing back against Russian influence, Sisi is more of a problem than an asset.
***
So those are the supposed benefits of supporting Sisi. What about the potential dangers?
First, helping Sisi stay in power violates longstanding U.S. opposition to such moves—which tend to increase corruption, diminish accountability and lead to change via violence instead of politics—around the world. Even the Trump administration, not known as democracy enthusiasts, has criticized similar amendments in Democratic Republic of Congo , Burundi , Rwanda and Bolivia . Making an exception for Sisi—currently head of the African Union—sets an injurious example.
Second, supporting Sisi in this brazen power grab will diminish rather than increase U.S. leverage over him. Experience shows that the U.S. wins concessions from Egypt—for example, overturning verdicts against workers in American NGOs, making military aid more productive , promising to repeal a draconian NGO law—only after applying strong and persistent pressure. There is no reason to give Sisi this undeserved benefit in the face of serious outstanding issues involving U.S. citizens, particularly those detained as political prisoners as well as April Corley (an American gravely wounded in a bizarre 2015 attack by the Egyptian military).
Third, inordinate support for Sisi will only undermine U.S. influence in the country—a lesson American officials should have learned by now. In 2011 and 2013 , the Obama administration was harshly criticized for being seen as too close to Mubarak and later to Morsi, damaging America’s standing among Egyptians. Why would the Trump administration similarly undercut U.S. leverage by overinvesting in Sisi?
***
Can the United States stay neutral?
This much we know about dictators: They usually end up overstaying their welcome and brutalizing their own citizens. So supporting Sisi’s bid to stay in power for decades will certainly come back to haunt the U.S. Nor can the U.S. really prevent him from forcing through these constitutional amendments.
Yet claiming neutrality is not a credible option while the United States continues to back Egypt’s military to the tune of $1.3 billion annually.
The only sensible course is for the United States to make clear, privately and publicly, that it opposes the amendments and sees them as taking Egypt in the wrong direction—even if the U.S. cannot stop them from happening. Whether the Trump administration does do so or not, members of Congress should, via statements and conditions on military assistance.
What the United States says and does still matters a great deal in Egypt—otherwise, why would Sisi even be coming to Washington now? At a bare minimum, members of Congress should signal their understanding of the plight of citizens of Egypt, where, as actor and activist Khaled Abol Naga said at a recent briefing, Sisi’s narrative is, “nobody cares about you anymore.”
It’s time, at a minimum, to show he’s wrong."

HOMELAND SECURITY DHS LEADER EXITS — Nielsen, who made her name prior to her appointment as a cyber expert and emphasized the subject during a tenure that began in December 2017, is on her way out. As leader of the department, Nielsen created the National Risk Management Center and stressed the importance of well, managing risk, as well as strengthening resilience against cyberattacks. She had dubbed the cyber threat the most dangerous threat to the homeland. ""I am immensely proud of our successes in transforming DHS to keep pace with our enemies and adversaries — whether it is in cyberspace or against emerging threats from new technologies,"" Nielsen said in her resignation later.
Despite DHS' role in combating election meddling, Nielsen backed President Donald Trump on his doubts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf — a position at odds with the U.S. intelligence community's conclusions. ""I haven’t seen any evidence that the attempts to interfere in our election infrastructure was to favor a particular political party,” Nielsen said in July.
Replacing Nielsen as acting secretary is Kevin McAleenan, the current commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. He has little to no record on cyber issues. Privately, Nielsen allies and fans often said she didn’t come into the department intending to concentrate on the border, and some admitted she hurt her credibility on cyber with statements on, and in support of, the president’s controversial immigration policies. DHS has gone without a permanent deputy secretary for approximately a year, and there’s no nominee.
CONNECTING THE DOTS — A cybercrime group known for stealing credit card data from hospitality and retail companies has been deploying the Ryuk and LockerGoga ransomware for almost a year, FireEye said late last week, in one of the first instances of researchers linking the two famous strains of malware. In this case, the group, dubbed FIN6 , targeted an engineering firm. “FIN6 has expanded their criminal enterprise to deploy ransomware in an attempt to further monetize their access to compromised entities,” FireEye said. “We have recently identified multiple targeted Ryuk and LockerGoga ransomware incidents showing ties to FIN6,” beginning in July 2018.
It isn’t clear why FIN6 appears to have shifted focus from stealing payment data to hitting industrial firms with ransomware. FireEye pointed to “tactical differences between these ransomware incidents and historical FIN6 activity” to suggest that some FIN6 hackers may have gone rogue and independently conducted the ransomware attacks. Ryuk’s high-profile moment was in January, when security firms linked it to Russian actors as a corrective to a news report that called it North Korean code. LockerGoga, meanwhile, became famous in late March when it hit the aluminum manufacturer Norsk Hydro and crippled some plants’ automatic operations.
TAX SEASON BRINGS TAX SCAMS, PART 2 — With the tax filing deadline coming up next week, security researchers are on the hunt for cybercrime. IBM’s X-Force found some, it wrote in a blog post out this morning. Specifically, the company found phishing campaigns misleading recipients into believing the emails came from large accounting, tax and payroll service firms like ADP and Paychex, targeting primarily businesses.
The emails carry malicious Excel files employing one of the most popular and effective banking trojans, called TrickBot. “If your computer is infected with TrickBot, the cybercriminals operating it have complete control and can do just about anything they wish on your device, including spreading to other computers on your network and emptying your company’s bank accounts, potentially costing millions of dollars,” IBM warned.
FACEBOOK CYBERCRIME TALLY — Cybercrime groups proliferate faster on Facebook than the social media network can take them down, according to research published late last week by Cisco Talos. The groups are often hiding in plain sight, Talos discovered, and can be found with searches a simple as “spam.” Some have names like “Spammer & Hacking Professional."" Talos initially found 74 of them with 385,000 total members. “Despite the fairly obvious names, some of these groups have managed to remain on Facebook for up to eight years, and in the process acquire tens of thousands of group members,” a Talos blog entry read.
Talos at first tried to remove the groups via Facebook’s abuse reporting mechanism, leading to removal for some and only removal of specific posts for others. “Eventually, through contact with Facebook's security team, the majority of malicious groups was quickly taken down, however new groups continue to pop up, and some are still active as of the date of publishing,” according to Talos. “Talos continues to cooperate with Facebook to identify and take down as many of these groups as possible.”
Intelligence Community HOUSE INTEL FIREWALL HOLDS ... FOR NOW — Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have settled into an uneasy truce, following GOP calls for Schiff to resign, Martin reported late last week. However, there are fresh worries that tempers will boil over as they did during a public hearing last month and the policy firewall that has kept the panel’s Russia probe apart from its daily oversight will collapse. “Yes, it’s holding,” said Rep. Chris Stewart , the top Republican on the committee’s Strategic Technologies and Advanced Research subpanel. “But is it weakened? Yeah, I think it is weakened.”
The committee held a series of meetings last week , including a classified hearing with senior intelligence leaders about the Trump administration’s proposed $86 billion spy budget for fiscal 2020. But both sides see the harmony as tenuous at best. “My guess is there will be peace until Adam decides it’s time to start holding hearings on whatever he decides to hold hearings on,” according to a person familiar with the committee’s deliberations.
THE 5G RACE — A Pentagon report released last week warns that risks to 5G posed by China aren’t just about whether Chinese suppliers are involved in the rollout, the current focus of U.S. policymakers. It also goes to the spectrum band of choice, whether sub-6 (electromagnetic spectrum below 6 GHz) or mmWave (between approximately 24 and 300 GHz). China is focused on the former while the U.S. is focused on the latter, according to the Defense Innovation Board report.
“As sub-6 becomes the global standard, it is likely that China, the current leader in that space, will lead the charge,” the report states. “This would create security risks for DoD operations overseas that rely on networks with Chinese components in the supply chain.” It continues: “Even if the United States were to restrict use of Chinese equipment suppliers domestically, the United States is not a big enough market in wireless to prevent China’s 5G suppliers from continuing to increase market share globally, resulting in significant pressure on a declining set of vendors that would serve the U.S. market.”
WIKI OR WON’T HE — WikiLeaks claimed last week that Ecuador was preparing to expel the group’s founder Julian Assange from its London embassy within “hours or days,” but as the weekend passed Assange remained ensconced. Ecuador didn’t sound happy about the declaration that it would evict Assange and had a deal in place to hand him over to U.K. authorities, saying it had endured a great deal of “rudeness” and “ingratitude and disrespect” from him despite giving him sanctuary. Maybe it was all a plot to bleed the U.K. budget by forcing its police into overtime.

QUICK FIX Kirstjen Nielsen is out as Homeland Security secretary, following the president's withdrawal Friday of Ron Vitiello's nomination to lead ICE. Reports say USCIS director Lee Francis Cissna may be next.
— The president warned of ""traffic and commercial delays"" at the southern border.
— USCIS announced Friday that it's already reached fiscal year 2020's congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 regular H-1B visas.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Monday, it’s April 8, EXIT NIELSEN: ""Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position,"" President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday evening. ""Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become acting secretary."" Nielsen will stay through this week, a White House official told POLITICO.
""The president was widely expected to dismiss Nielsen after November’s midterm elections,"" reports POLITICO's Ted Hesson and Eliana Johnson, ""and surprised allies by keeping her on board. The two have clashed on their approach to immigration and border security from the outset of her tenure, with Trump complaining that she was too soft and regularly pushing her to take measures that crossed legal boundaries, she told allies."" More here .
News of Nielsen's departure follows Trump's announcement Friday that he was withdrawing Ron Vitiello as his nominee for director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Nielsen was informed of the president's decision two weeks ago, a senior White House official told POLITICO, but had hoped to change his mind. Vitiello, who took over ICE in an acting capacity in June, cleared the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 11 and was awaiting action by the Senate Judiciary Committee. “We’re going in a little different direction,” Trump told reporters Friday. “Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction.”
Is Stephen Miller cleaning house? Jill Colvin and Colleen Long report for the Associated Press that the withdrawal of Vitiello “was encouraged"" by Trump de facto immigration czar Miller, who is also “eyeing the removal"" of USCIS director Lee Francis Cissna. Miller reportedly had no great fondness for Nielsen.
AT THE BORDER DELAYS AT THE BORDER: President Donald Trump isn't shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border, as many businesses and Republicans feared he would. But the administration’s decision last week to ramp up the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico is straining commercial processing times at the border.
The president warned on Twitter Saturday that 750 custom's officers' reassignment to ""specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants"" will cause “traffic & commercial delays” along the southern border. “Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry,” Trump warned.

Visa Update H-1B REGULAR CAP REACHED: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced Friday that it has received enough H-1B visa petitions to reach the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 for fiscal year 2020, which starts Oct. 1. It took less than one week, a pace that matches previous years. USCIS said Friday that it will next determine whether it's received a sufficient number of petitions to meet the separate 20,000 cap on H-1B visas for workers with U.S. master’s degrees or higher. “USCIS will continue to accept and process petitions that are otherwise exempt from the cap,” USCIS said.
JOBS REPORT JOBS BOUNCE BACK IN MARCH: Employers added 196,000 jobs in March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, and February's dismal job number was revised to 33,000, up from a first estimate of 13,000. Wage growth slipped a little, to 3.2 percent over the previous year, down from February's 3.4 percent.
The Washington Post’s Matt O’Brien writes that the March jobs number may have “overstated growth.” The report includes two surveys, one on how many positions businesses have added and the other on how many individuals are working in a household. “Usually these figures come pretty close to matching up, but sometimes they don’t — sometimes, they’re not even close,” he writes. “This was one of those times.” More here .

UNIONS SEIU MEDIATION SET FOR TOMORROW: SEIU and the D.C. local of the Office and Professional Employees International Union will have their first mediation session Tuesday, a person familiar with the discussions told Morning Shift. The two unions agreed to mediation after OPEIU members working at SEIU's Washington headquarters authorized a strike. OPEIU says that SEIU reduced union-staffed professional and technical support positions and outsourced work to non-union consultants.
2020 WATCH DO DEMOCRATS LACK A BORDER AGENDA? : As border arrests spike to their highest levels in a decade, some argue that Democrats will need to develop border-security proposals to put on their 2020 platform, Tal Kopan writes for the San Francisco Chronicle. Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a senior member of Congress’ Progressive Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, told Kopan that “This is going to be the cannon fodder for the Trump campaign and for Republicans in general.”
“I think the vast middle are looking for somebody taking the lead,"" Grijalva added. More here .
IMMIGRATION ICE NAMES OF AGENTS IN TENNESSEE WORKSITE RAID: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week provided advocacy groups with the names of 37 officers, including seven Customs and Border Patrol Agents, who were present at a raid last April of the Southeastern Provision meat processing plant in Grainger County, Tennessee. The disclosure was filed in a lawsuit brought by the National Immigration Law Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center that alleges ICE agents violated dozens of workers’ constitutional rights during the raid. CBP declined to comment. NILC is pressing the agency for more details. More here .
MOTEL 6 PAYS $12 MILLION FOR GIVING GUEST INFO TO ICE: The Motel 6 chain last week agreed to pay $12 million to resolve a lawsuit brought by Washington State that alleged its motels in the state gave more than 80,000 customers’ names, birth dates, and license plate numbers to ICE agents, Tiffany Hsu reported for the New York Times. The settlement stated that immigration agents would “sometimes circle the names of guests that sounded Latino before targeting them for questioning, detainment and deportation,” Hsu wrote. More from the Times here. Read a press release from the Washington State Attorney General Office here .
CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION STRUCK DOWN AGAIN: A third federal court on Friday struck down the Trump administration’s addition of a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, NPR reported . ""The unreasonableness” of the move to add a citizenship question, Maryland District Court Judge George Hazel wrote in an opinion Friday “is underscored by the lack of any genuine need for the citizenship question.” The move is the third blow to the administration’s Census addition; a Manhattan-based district court judge blocked inclusion of the question in January, and a San Francisco-based district court judge followed suit in March. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the matter this month.
The drama over the administration’s attempt to add the question reached a was at an all time high on Capitol Hill last week, after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declined a second invitation to testify on President Donald Trump’s budget request before lawmakers. The House Oversight Committee last week also authorized subpoenas for documents from Secretary Ross related to administration’s efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

QUICK FIX — DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is out, after months of speculation about her hanging on by a thread.
Story Continued Below
— Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will return to Congress for another hearing on her agency’s budget, this time with the House Appropriations Committee.
— Dan DeBono , who lost a bid for Congress in New York in November, has joined DOT as chief infrastructure funding officer.
IT’S MONDAY:
""Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never looking back again / You found somebody who does it better than he can / No more making you cry, no more them gray skies / Girl we flying on the G5.""
NIELSEN OUT: Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned her post, and Customs and Border PRotection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will take her place on an acting basis. Read more in POLITICO about Nielsen's tenure, which was highlighted by her implementation of President Trump's contentious immigration agenda. McAleenan has worked at CBP since 2001 (besides two years in the private sector), and did a stint as Area Port Director at Los Angeles International Airport. Todd Hauptli, president of the American Association of Airport Executives, called him a ""pro's pro"" and said that the group is ""very pleased"" with his new role.
IN CONGRESS CHAO BACK ON THE HILL THIS WEEK: She’ll appear before the House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday to testify on DOT’s budget request for fiscal 2020, but if last month’s Senate hearing is any guide, she’ll likely get asked more about the recent Boeing crashes. Also this week, the House Homeland Security Committee holds a hearing on the TSA and Coast Guard budgets, and House Transportation holds hearings on highway safety and investment in waterways.
Inside the Agencies NEW FACE AT DOT: DeBono, a Trump ally and Roger Stone-endorsed congressional candidate, has landed at the department with a job managing infrastructure funding, our Tanya Snyder scooped Friday. DeBono, who lost a bid to unseat Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) last year, will be responsible for some of the duties vacated by Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy Grover Burthey, who left the agency a few months ago. DeBono’s portfolio will include INFRA and BUILD grants. His background is in finance, including stints with the Elliott Management Corporation and Goldman Sachs.
Aviation JOINT REVIEW TIMELINE: A joint review of the Boeing 737 MAX by FAA, NASA and international aviation representatives is expected to last three months, according to its leader, former NTSB Chairman Chris Hart. Our Brianna Gurciullo has more .
BOEING CREATING ITS OWN GROUP: Adding to the several reviews, investigations and committees examining the two recent MAX crashes, Boeing said on Friday it would create a panel that will examine “company-wide policies and processes for the design and development"" of its aircraft. The committee will be made up of members of its board. The company also said it’s cutting production of 737 planes by 10 a month, in order to focus on updating the MAX’s software and getting the global fleet back in the air.
SUMWALT PRAISES ETHIOPIAN REPORT: NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said Friday that the preliminary report from investigators in Ethiopia on the 737 MAX crash in March was “very thorough and well done.” As Brianna reports, he also warned the report is preliminary. “So be wary of speculation,” he said.
For the record: When it came to grounding the 737 MAX, the NTSB’s job was to “help the FAA have the data that they needed to make an informed decision,” Sumwalt said. The FAA “provided the NTSB with proprietary satellite-based ADS-B data when they became aware of its availability from Aireon” a few days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, and then the NTSB and Boeing analyzed it. By contrast, data that was available to the public at the time “was incomplete, didn’t cover the entire six minutes of flight, nor was it validated,” Sumwalt said.
About the black boxes: After his remarks, Sumwalt said the NTSB has both the data from the Ethiopian jet’s flight data recorder and a transcript of the cockpit voice recording, which the NTSB helped prepare. The NTSB doesn’t have the audio from the cockpit voice recorder, but Sumwalt said that wasn’t expected. “We guard that very carefully,” he said about the NTSB and its investigations into aviation accidents in the United States. “There’s a law that we can’t actually give the voice recording to anyone else. So that’s not unusual that a foreign country would not give us the actual voice recorder.”
NADER TAKES AIM AT BOEING: In a fiery missive published late last week, consumer advocate Ralph Nader accused Boeing of “corporate homicide,” argued the 737 MAX should never be allowed to fly again, and urged airline passengers to organize a consumer boycott of the aircraft. “The overriding problem is the basic unstable design of the 737 Max,” Nader writes, pointing to reports that the plane’s higher landing gear and larger engines contributed to making it more prone to stalls. If Boeing doesn’t divert from the “ruinous road"" it’s currently on, he says, more information will continue to come from investigations, lawsuits and news reports about what he calls the company’s “misdeeds.”
Infrastructure A REASON-ABLE PROPOSAL: In case you missed it last week, a new study from the libertarian Reason Foundation argues that states and Congress should utilize toll financing and transition away from gas taxes to mileage-based user fees. Specifically, the study recommends Congress create a voluntary program to exempt any state from the 1956 ban on interstate tolling if it agrees to a set of conditions, including: tolls would be collected electronically and charged per mile traveled, they would replace fuel taxes, and revenue could only be used for capital and operating costs for highways, bridges and tunnels.
Rail WELCOME TO MIAMI: Things are happening for Richard Branson’s train experiment down in Florida. “On Thursday, Branson and his rail company Virgin Trains USA, which is the country's only privately owned intercity passenger railroad, unveiled a new Miami hub.” The company says Virgin MiamiCentral will connect transit systems in the urban area as well as link to other destinations in southeast Florida. The company also announced it secured funding to expand its route to Orlando; Virgin says it plans to carry an estimated 6.6 million passengers per year on the Miami-to-Orlando service by 2023.

Looking back at 2017’s first-quarter fundraising,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2019/04/08/looking-back-at-2017s-first-quarter-fundraising-574238,"— Freshmen Democrats are starting to announce their first fundraising quarters as members of Congress, and we examine how they stack up against the Republicans they beat to get to Congress. — Former Vice President Joe Biden made jokes about his political style in a Friday speech, two days after he released a video saying he needed to be more “mindful” of others’ personal space.

THE TOPLINES THE CASH DASH — We’re a week away from the FEC filing deadline, but we’ve already seen a handful of freshmen House Democrats release their fundraising numbers for their first quarter as a member of Congress. The ones who have released so far are a self-selecting group (nobody is going to promote bad numbers!), but here’s how they’re stacking up to the House Republicans they beat.
The 29 Republican members of Congress who lost on Election Day brought in an average of around $311,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The high-water mark came from then-Rep. Bruce Poliquin in ME-02, who raised $629,000 in his first quarter. Two members brought in only five figures: NY-11’s Dan Donovan at a hair under $80,000 and OK-05’s Steve Russell at about $37,000 (IA-01’s Rod Blum was saved from the same fate only by loaning his campaign $500,000).
And many of these Republicans had a fundraising advantage that a lot of the Democratic freshmen don’t: corporate PAC donations. Over 40 freshmen have sworn off donations from corporate PACs (many still take money from ideological, labor or candidate committees). About 40 percent of Poliquin’s haul, for example, came from committees. That includes other candidate committees, but also corporate PACs . CA-25’s Steve Knight brought in more than 90 percent of his fundraising that quarter from political committees, with almost none coming from individual contributors. Some of the early announcements from Democrats, like Reps. Josh Harder and Antonio Delgado , outraised the Q1 totals from Republicans.
IN THE TRENCHES PRESIDENTIAL BIG BOARD — In Biden’s first public appearance since several women said he made them feel uncomfortable by inappropriately touching them, he cracked jokes about it. “I just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,” he said after hugging union leader Lonnie Stephenson at the IBEW conference, per POLITICO’s Nolan McCaskill and Caitlin Oprysko (he made a second joke after hugging a child on stage). He also defended not giving a straightforward apology. “I'm sorry I didn't understand more,” he told reporters. “I'm not sorry for any of my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything that I've ever done. I've never been disrespectful, intentionally, to a man or a woman. That's not the reputation I've had since high school, for God's sake.”
Biden also functionally said he was running for president but didn’t give any hints about timing. “I’m told by the lawyers I've got to be careful what I say so I don't start the clock ticking and change my status,” Biden said. ”I am very close to making a decision to stand before you all relatively soon.”
— New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker raised more than $5 million since launching his campaign, a modest amount compared to some of his 2020 competitors, per POLITICO’s Quint Forgey . He didn’t release information on the number of donors and said he’ll report $6.1 million cash on hand.
— New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand helped found women donor groups. And now they’re backing her campaign (and her rivals). “Not only have they provided seed money for Gillibrand, who has not yet released her first-quarter fundraising totals, the groups are also emblematic of the building blocks that Gillibrand is seeking to power her campaign,” report POLITICO’s Elena Schneider and Maggie Severns .
— No such thing as home field advantage: POLITICO’s David Siders writes that many voters don’t support the run of their own politicians.
THE CASH DASH (PART 2) — Collins raised $1.5 million in the first quarter, per her FEC report . She has $3.8 million in cash on hand.
— Randy Feenstra, one of the Republicans vying to primary Rep. Steve King in IA-04, announced he raised more than $260,000 in the first quarter.
THE SENATE MAP — Former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville announced he is running for Senate in Alabama. Sean Spicer is expected to work with Tuberville, Campaign Pro’s James Arkin reported.
— Democratic Rep. Xochitl Torres Small ruled out running for Senate in New Mexico, per the Albuquerque Journal’s Scott Turner . Former Rep. Steve Pearce (the current state GOP party chair) also told Turner that he is considering a run, but he’s “really focused on identifying strong candidates for the Senate race and the other congressional races.”
PICKING THE NOMINEE — Washington state Democrats will use a primary to allocate presidential delegates for the first time, switching away from caucuses, per the Seattle Times’ David Gutman .
GRASS ALWAYS GREENER — A few months removed from a competitive reelection battle, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) is eying his old job of governor. “I think about it every minute of every day. Now, thinking about it and doing it are two different things,” Manchin told POLITICO’s Burgess Everett . “I’ll make a decision this fall sometime. I don’t think there’s any hurry at all.”
HOUSE RECRUITMENT WATCH — Democrat Wendy Davis is “looking very seriously” at run against GOP Rep. Chip Roy in TX-21, she said on the podcast The Rabble , also ruling out a Senate run.
— Valerie Plame (yes, THAT Valerie Plame) said she is considering a run as a Democrat in NM-03. “I have a lot to learn and I would like another opportunity to serve my country,” she told the AP’s Russell Contreras .
KEEPING THE MAJORITY — Speaker Nancy Pelosi is bullish about Democrats holding on to the House. “I’m going to have our races won by this November,” she told The Washington Post’s Paul Kane . “She has charted a course of again appealing to moderate suburbanites and some rural voters frustrated by Trump’s reality-TV-style presidency. She doesn’t want to focus on impeaching Trump or on far-fetched legislation that has no hope of passing in divided government,” Kane wrote. Pelosi also defended the DCCC’s vendor policy.
FIRST IN SCORE — STAFFING UP — Rising Tide Interactive, the Democratic digital media firm, has three new hires: Brian Krebs (most recently IE digital director and senior adviser at the DCCC) and Paul Johnson II joined the firm as vice presidents, while Kate Hilts (a Heidi Heitkamp alum) joined as lead strategist.
— Stewart Boss is joining the DSCC as national press secretary . Boss was previously now-Sen. Jacky Rosen ’s communications director for her 2018 campaign.
TEAM TRUMP — The Republican Jewish Coalition, which gets significant fundraising from Sheldon Adelson, is pushing to win over more Jewish voters in 2020. The group’s board members “were briefed on plans for a $10 million-plus blitz geared toward attracting Jewish support for President Donald Trump,” POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reported.
LOW CLEARANCE — Only half of the members of the Election Assistance Commission “have security clearances, raising questions about whether it can effectively help local and state officials defend against adversaries such as Russian hackers,” POLITICO’s Eric Geller reported.

We’ve got part two of our dairy policy deep dive.

— USDA will release the ag census this week , providing fresh demographic data on U.S. farmers and ranchers.
— There’s a new bipartisan push in the House for broadband funding. More than 70 lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are asking appropriators to fully fund two initiatives designed to improve service in underserved areas. Find it first in MA.
HAPPY MONDAY, APRIL 8! your host is proud to report that our team’s farm bill coverage earned second place in the news category in the annual North American Agricultural Journalists awards. We also got nods for a couple of other big stories, including on the administration’s $12 billion trade aid package and its public charge plan.

Driving the Day DAIRY DIVIDED OVER SUPPLY MANAGEMENT: As the Great American Milk Glut continues, dairy farmers can’t agree on what should be done to stem the tide of producers going out of business, creating an obstacle to securing support on Capitol for a remedy, Pro Ag’s Catherine Boudreau reports this morning.
Grassroots call for radical change: States and organizations representing smaller farmers, such as in Vermont and Wisconsin, are renewing advocacy for a federal supply management system that would keep milk prices above the cost of production.
But the politics are complicated: Setting limits on production is sure to run into resistance from larger operations, which are growing in number as the industry consolidates. As a result, they hold an increasing amount of power within milk cooperative and national trade associations.
The state of U.S. dairy: While USDA is predicting slightly higher milk prices this year, 2019 could still become the fifth year of the downturn while feed, equipment and labor costs continue to rise.
Hitting the road for supply management: Expect this debate to intensify. The Wisconsin Farmers Union, National Farmers Organization and Holstein Association USA have embarked on what they’re calling the Dairy Together Roadshow to gain momentum for some version of supply management. Meetings are being held in states like New York, Minnesota, New Mexico and California through May.
What’s at stake: “It seems like if we don’t do something, we’re a generation away from not having any family-sized dairy farms,” said Dick Bylsma, national milk sales director for NFO, which markets milk throughout the Midwest and New England.
One idea: NFO is pressing for a national, two-tiered milk pricing plan that would pay dairy farmers a $4 premium on their first 1 million pounds of milk each month, and a lower price for anything above that. The organization said this approach would stabilize the market and benefit smaller producers.
Pros, if you missed part one of Catherine’s dairy policy deep dive from last week, read it here .
IT’S AG CENSUS TIME: The 2017 Census of Agriculture, set to be published by USDA on Thursday at noon, will reflect a major demographic change from the last iteration. Farmers and ranchers filling out surveys for the census were able to list multiple “principal producers” who are equally involved in making business decisions, instead of just one.
In the past, allowing only one principal to be listed showed that U.S. agricultural operations were predominantly run by men, but didn’t reflect farms with multiple people in charge, said Ginger Harris, a statistician and demographer for the National Agricultural Statistics Service, which conducts the census every five years. The change means the latest iteration will better capture the roles of people involved in farming, Harris said, but it will be difficult to compare how the demographics of principle producers shifted between 2012 and 2017.
The 2017 census also will include new data on how much money farmers earned from direct marketing and value-added products, Harris added.
Data mining: The census includes information on land ownership and the types of crops and livestock produced in every county in America. It also reflects products like ginseng and alpacas, for which USDA doesn’t publish data each year, unlike other major commodities.
Agribusinesses use the data to target certain locations for their facilities, and local governments and Congress use it to inform farm policy, said Adam Cline, section head of NASS’ census and survey division. The agency had a 72 percent response rate.
TRADE CORNER Kudlow: China talks ‘getting closer and closer’: Top U.S. and Chinese officials are closer than ever to reaching a deal to end the trade war and will continue negotiations by teleconference this week, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday.
After the latest round of high-level talks wrapped up Friday in Washington, the White House released a vague statement that cited progress but said “significant work remains.” Kudlow provided few details on Sunday other than to say the administration has made “great progress” with China on the issue of intellectual property theft and “good progress” on provisions aimed at curbing forced technology transfers.
The stumbling blocks: Unresolved issues include how to enforce any deal, Kudlow said, such as whether China would agree to give the U.S. a unilateral right to impose more tariffs if it believes Beijing is not honoring the pact.
“But in each and every place, a) they’ve acknowledged their problems,” Kudlow said. “That was a very big hurdle. And b) what wasn’t on the table [before] is on the table [now], and c) we’re getting closer and closer.”
Kudlow seemed less optimistic about USMCA on Capitol Hill: He was reluctant to predict whether Congress would vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement before 2020, once again noting that the decision is up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . But “we believe we’ll get a vote,” he said. “And if we get a vote, we’ll win. I don’t want to put timing on it. It’s completely up to her, but she’s been quite cooperative so far.”
Trump’s border threat jams Pence’s USMCA charm offensive: Vice President Mike Pence’s campaign to promote the NAFTA replacement across several swing states kicked off last week right as President Donald Trump said border security was more important to him than the USMCA deal, POLITICO’s Gabby Orr reported . The weeks-long tour includes stops in farm towns and agricultural regions across Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and other 2020 battlegrounds.
ROW CROPS — Dozens of Democrats and Republicans call for rural broadband funding. Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) and Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), both members of the House Agriculture Committee, led dozens of lawmakers in a letter today that asks appropriators to provide $550 million for USDA’s ReConnect Program and $350 million for the new rural broadband loan and grant program authorized by the 2018 farm bill, H.R. 2 (115) .

DeVos to address state education chiefs today,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-education/2019/04/08/devos-to-address-state-education-chiefs-today-422396,"With help from Kimberly Hefling Education Secretary Betsy DeVos today will speak to an annual gathering of state K-12 education chiefs, a year after she delivered some “tough love” to state officials on the quality of their education plans.
— Rep. Virginia Foxx , the top Republican on the House education panel, says in an interview with POLITICO Pro that Democrats have gone too far in their criticism of DeVos. She also thinks the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is “a mess.”
— Democratic state attorneys general are renewing their call for the Trump administration to help them with investigations into companies that collect federal student loans. The state officials say the Education Department’s refusal to fully cooperate with them is impeding their ability to protect student loan borrowers.
IT’S MONDAY, APRIL 8. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION. Drop me a line with your tips and feedback: mstratford@politico.com or @ mstratford
Driving the Day DEVOS APPEARS BEFORE STATE EDUCATION CHIEFS: Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will address state K-12 education leaders today, a year after she ruffled feathers by saying that some of the state education plans she was approving under the Every Student Succeeds Act weren’t ambitious enough.
— DeVos is scheduled to speak at the annual Council of Chief State School Officers legislative conference this afternoon. She’ll participate in a “fireside chat” with South Carolina State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman.
— Flashback: DeVos last year confronted state leaders. ""Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law,"" she said. ""Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won’t pass muster around kitchen tables.” Some of the education officials pushed back on the criticism.
Congress HAPPENING ON THE HILL THIS WEEK: A slew of education issues are on the docket on Capitol Hill with one week left before a recess:
— On Tuesday, a House panel will hold a hearing on the Equality Act, H.R. 5 (116), House Democrats’ legislation that would create new federal protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The House Education and Labor Committee’s civil rights subcommittee hearing will examine discrimination in schools and workplaces.
— On Wednesday, DeVos returns to Congress. She’ll testify before the House Education and Labor Committee for the first time since Democrats took control of the House. It’s a fair bet that Democrats will press DeVos on a wide range of issues, especially after the secretary’s appearances before appropriators in March produced a media firestorm over funding the Special Olympics.
— Also on Wednesday: The Senate education committee holds a hearing on accountability in higher education, the latest public airing of the issues that the panel is grappling with in reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. How the federal government holds colleges accountable for the federal aid they receive is a key policy difference that Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) are trying to hammer out as part of those HEA talks.
STUDENT LOANS STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL URGE DEVOS TO HELP STUDENT LOAN INQUIRIES: A group of 21 attorneys general is asking Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reverse her agency’s decision to prevent state law enforcement authorities from obtaining some information about companies that collect federal student loans.
— The attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia, all Democrats, wrote in a letter to DeVos last week that the administration’s lack of cooperation with state law enforcement authorities was harming their ability to enforce consumer protection laws.
— The letter comes as part of an ongoing battle between states and DeVos over who has the power to police the companies that collect federal student loans. The Trump administration has argued in court that states lack the authority to regulate student loan servicers, and the Education Department has thrown up roadblocks to state attorneys general getting access to information they need to build legal cases against student loan companies.
— The state attorneys general, led by Colorado, New Jersey and Washington, wrote that the Education Department’s recent rejection of requests from state authorities “impedes states’ ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.”
— Department spokesperson Liz Hill said that the government “takes very seriously its responsibility to provide high-quality service to federal student loan borrowers” and devotes “significant resources” to overseeing loan servicers. “Federal loans are Federal assets and therefore must be controlled and regulated by the Federal government,” Hill said in a statement. Read more .
— Meanwhile, Seth Frotman, the former top student loan official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , is calling on Congress to adopt greater protections for students as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Read his new blog post here .
ON THE HILL TALKING EDUCATION WITH VIRGINIA FOXX: House Education and Labor ranking member Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) is optimistic that Congress will reauthorize the Higher Education Act, but quick to point out differences between the two sides on higher education policy. She praises Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) as having the “best intentions” but is critical of how much Democrats have challenged DeVos.
— Foxx sat down with POLITICO Pro for an exclusive, in-depth interview on education policy. Here are some nuggets from Kimberly Hefling’s extensive Q-and-A, out this morning:
ON DEMOCRATS’ ONGOING CLASH WITH DEVOS: “She’s doing her job. The Democrats simply try to crucify anybody that disagrees with them on the tiniest little issue. We don’t do that in this country,” Foxx said.
ON PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS: “Well, the program is a mess right now. There are people in the program that thought they qualified and didn’t qualify. The fact that it is such a mess begs for reform. My feeling is that that program is one of their socialist planks.” Foxx also questioned why under the program “a nurse working in a not-for-profit hospital or Planned Parenthood and performing abortions could get her loan paid back but a nurse working, say, in a for-profit assisted living facility wouldn’t?”
ON HER PROSPER ACT H.R. 4508 (115) TO UPDATE THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT: “ Now, even I did not think that bill would be signed by the president, but I do think it's important that you put out your ideal situation. And frankly, we haven’t seen that from anybody else,” Foxx said.
ON SECLUSION AND RESTRAINT IN K-12 SCHOOLS: “It might be interesting to send all members of the committee to spend a week in the setting where seclusion and restraint has to be used. It just might be real interesting for that to happen, to see how eager our colleagues are to dictate to the teachers exactly how to handle every situation. It’s that walk a mile in my shoes kind of attitude,” Foxx said. “Most of us just cannot understand what a teacher deals with every day.”

Kudlow lays out the ABCs of the China talks,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/04/08/kudlow-lays-out-the-abcs-of-the-china-talks-422389,"With help from Adam Behsudi and Maxime Schlee Top U.S. and Chinese officials will continue trade talks this week by teleconference to get closer to an agreement.
— The European Union appears to be moving toward adopting a long-waited negotiating mandate for talks with the United States, but there’s a potential snag or two.
— American business leaders in Japan are calling for a “comprehensive” agreement between the two countries, rather than a “mini-deal” covering only agriculture.
IT'S MONDAY, APRIL 8! rewatched “The Magnificent Seven” last week and was unexpectedly reminded it was a story about American gunfighters (mostly) selflessly helping Mexican villagers beat off the local bad guys.

Driving the Day KUDLOW LAYS OUT THE ABCs OF THE CHINA TALKS : The United States and China are closer than ever to reaching a comprehensive trade deal, White House chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Sunday. “This coming week, there'll be a lot of teleconferencing among the top tier people to continue the discussions,” he said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”
Kudlow provided few details on talks, except to say representatives have made “great progress” with China on the issue of intellectual property theft and “good progress” in negotiations aimed at curbing forced technology transfers. A White House statement on Friday was similarly vague., The stumbling blocks: The unresolved issues include on how to enforce any deal, Kudlow said, such as whether China would agree to give the United States a unilateral right to impose more tariffs if it believes Beijing is not honoring the pact.
“But in each and every place, a) they've acknowledged their problems,” Kudlow said. “That was a very big hurdle. And b) what wasn't on the table [before] is on the table [now], and c) we're getting closer and closer.” Last week, Trump said he believed a final agreement could be wrapped up in the next four weeks, with perhaps two weeks more to finalize the paperwork.
KUDLOW: USMCA VOTE BEFORE 2020 UP TO PELOSI: Kudlow was reluctant to predict whether Congress would vote on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement before 2020, repeating for the third or fourth time in recent weeks that the decision was up to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). But “we believe we’ll get a vote,” Kudlow said. “And if we get a vote, we’ll win.
But while Pelosi has hosted a meeting for U.S. to make his case to House Democrats, she’s also refused to bring up the agreement until Mexico completes an overhaul of its workers rights regulations.
NIELSEN OUT AS DHS SECRETARY; McALEENAN IN: Trump tweeted Sunday that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen will be leaving the administration and that Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will become acting DHS secretary.
The move comes amid Trump’s frustration with an increase in the number of Central American migrants trying to enter the United States. From the outset of her tenure, Nielsen has clashed with the president on how to approach immigration and border security. POLITICO’s Ted Hesson and Eliana Johnson have more here on what the change means.
TRUMP COMPLICATES PENCE’S USMCA ROAD SHOW: Trump’s escalating border threats are making it hard for Vice President Mike Pence to make a serious pitch for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement during a multistate tour, POLITICO’s Gabby Orr reports.
As Trump sat in the Oval Office telling reporters that border security “is more important to me than the USMCA,” Pence was in his home state of Indiana kicking off a tour to shore up support for the pact in moderate Democrat districts.
Full swing ahead: A senior White House official told POLITICO Pence will stop in the coming weeks in farm towns and agricultural regions across Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and other 2020 battlegrounds.
The same official said Pence was ""not at all"" bothered by the president's comments because the White House believes Mexican officials are ""showing good faith so far and will continue to work with us so further action won't be necessary."" Read more here .
EU READY TO MOVE ON U.S. TRADE TALKS WITH FRENCH DEMANDS: The European Union appears to be on the path toward adopting a negotiating mandate for talks with the U.S. following persistent delays by France.
The EU-U.S. trade mandates are now scheduled to be adopted on Friday at a meeting of European envoys to the EU as a “point without discussion,” three EU officials told our colleagues in Brussels. That’s the usual procedure when EU countries have reached an agreement and are ready to move forward.
Don’t be too optimistic yet: One key French demand — the revocation of the old mandate for the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership — still hasn’t been satisfied, according to two officials. Romania, which currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the EU, will present a new compromise on Thursday, hoping to get the French on board.
Some EU countries are pushing back against the abolishment of the TTIP mandate, and the proposed compromise from the Romanians — pointing out there’s no link between TTIP and the planned new negotiations — wasn’t enough for France.
CEOs URGE COMPREHENSIVE JAPAN TRADE DEAL: There’s still no date for the first round of talks on the proposed U.S.-Japan trade agreement. But American companies based there are calling for a “comprehensive” agreement that reduces or eliminates tariff and non-tariff measures in all major sectors, including goods, services and agriculture.
“Japan is a critical market for U.S. exporters and companies in a wide range of industries,” Peter Jennings, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan and Dow Chemical Japan, said in a statement after a visit to Washington last week. “We now face a competitive disadvantage in Japan with the 11-country [Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership] and the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement in place.”
Mini-deal could hit headwinds in Tokyo: The plea comes amid talk that wants to pressure Japan into a “mini-deal” that would mainly cover agricultural goods, in order to quickly improve market access for farmers hurt by Trump’s previous trade decisions.
The idea of Japan giving up concessions on agriculture and being forced into an auto export quota to avoid Trump’s Sec. 232 tariff threat isn’t getting a warm reception in Tokyo.
One Japanese official told Morning Trade that Japan would expect the U.S. to commit to automobile tariff reductions it agreed to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership if Japan is to make TPP-level agriculture concessions. There’s also a view in Tokyo that quotas on autos and auto parts are a violation of WTO rules, the official said.
WTO RULING COULD BODE BADLY FOR TRUMP TARIFF DEFENSE: In a first-of-its-kind ruling on Friday, the World Trade Organization sided with Russia in a case involving trade restrictions imposed in the name of national security. Still, the ruling could make it harder for the United States to make the same case when defending challenges against its steel and aluminum tariffs.
“The WTO panel has rightly rejected the American (and Russian) argument that the WTO has no jurisdiction to judge a claim of national security as a defense to a trade restriction,” James Bacchus, a former WTO Appellate Body judge, U.S. trade official and member of Congress, told Morning Trade in an email. “An argument that what would otherwise be an illegal trade action has been taken for national security reasons is not a shield against WTO scrutiny in trade dispute settlement.” To find out more, read our story here .
TRADE REMEDY CORNER VIETNAMESE SACKS GET WALLOPED: The Commerce Department on Friday announced it had set combined anti-dumping and countervailing duties ranging from around 100 to 300 percent on laminated woven sacks made in Vietnam. The next step is for the ITC to vote on whether the duties are needed to protect U.S. producers from harm. That should happen by May 20.
CHINESE WIND TOWERS GET ATTENTION: Does the noise from windmills give you cancer? Trump said so last week. But no oncologists are expected to testify on Tuesday, when the ITC holds a hearing as part of its investigation into whether anti-dumping and countervailing duties are still needed on utility wind towers from China and Vietnam. The U.S. imported close to $300 million worth of the towers from the two countries in 2011 before duties were imposed. World trade rules require countries to review their trade remedy measures every five years.

Driving the Day NET NEUTRALITY HEADED TO HOUSE FLOOR — House Democrats are poised to bring their bill to restore the Obama-era net neutrality rules to the floor this week, and today the House Rules Committee will meet at 5 p.m. to determine which amendments for the Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644, may receive floor votes. A Republican aide from the House Energy and Commerce Committee said to expect similar amendments to those offered at last week’s marathon full-committee markup . Democrats have said the bill will codify the Obama-era FCC’s decision to exempt more than 700 traditional phone service regulations from applying to broadband, and Republicans will press for a list of just what those entail, according to the aide.
— The measure is widely backed by Democratic leaders, and party officials are heaping praise on Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for fast-tracking the legislation through the House. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a co-sponsor of the measure’s Senate counterpart, called Pelosi a “tactician extraordinaire.” He also had rave reviews for the freshman class of House Democrats, the majority of whom back the bill, for bringing “new energy” to the push. Prospects point to likely floor passage along partisan lines, with the latest head count on Democratic co-sponsors for the bill at 207.
— But don’t expect Republicans to let the measure pass without making their dissent heard. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on Sunday ripped Democrats for what he described as “pushing legislation that would put Washington in charge of the Internet.” And remember, the measure will face much steeper odds in the GOP-controlled Senate, where it is expected to face sharp opposition from Republican leaders.
AI ETHICS ACROSS THE POND — The European Union’s top artificial intelligence experts this week will release the final version of an anticipated report on the ethical use of artificial intelligence — an announcement that comes amid heightened scrutiny of the tech sector’s use of the software. Our Morning Tech colleagues at POLITICO Europe obtained a copy of the report, “ Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI .” Here are the highlights, with input from POLITICO Europe’s AI correspondent in Berlin, Janosch Delcker.
— The EU report is three-fold. The first part goes over broad ethical guidelines for developing and using AI, including ensuring that any systems that rely on it uphold fairness and don’t violate people’s fundamental rights. The report says particular care should be taken to ensure AI isn’t used to — intentionally or not — harm vulnerable or less powerful groups like children and people with disabilities. The second chapter outlines seven requirements for making AI trustworthy (ensuring it protects privacy, for instance), highlighting the importance of educating consumers on the limitations of AI. The third section offers a checklist for testing whether the technology succeeds in being trustworthy.
— Meanwhile, back in the U.S., companies are taking heat internally over their efforts to develop best practices on AI ethics. Google recently created an AI ethics board to address many of the same issues, only to see it implode within a week after thousands of company employees protested the appointment of board member Kay Coles James, president of conservative think the Heritage Foundation, because of her group’s longstanding denial of climate change and her use of rhetoric criticized as anti-trans.
SPEAKING OF EUROPE... — The EU’s sweeping General Data Protection Regulation privacy law and California’s Consumer Privacy Act have emerged as major markers in congressional efforts to craft U.S. privacy standards. But how do the two laws differ? Pro DataPoint’s Cristina Rivero breaks down the key protections offered under each measure. (View the full DataPoint graphic here .

TECH CHATTER ON THE TRAIL — Delaney and Gabbard (D-Hawaii) are nudging their way into the technology debate on the 2020 campaign trail. A number of higher-profile candidates, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), have already laid down major markers on tech with ambitious proposals on antitrust and broadband, respectively. Over the weekend Delaney and Gabbard weighed in on two other key policy discussions in the sector.
— Delaney, the former Maryland congressman, sounded off on robocalls. “While it may not seem like the biggest policy issue in the world, my Administration will end all these ridiculous robocalls,” he posted on Twitter on Sunday. “How incredibly annoying are they! We need an FCC that does its job!” To be sure, some corners of Washington have been stepping up their scrutiny of robocalls (“the scourge of civilization,” in the famous words of former South Carolina Sen. Fritz Hollings, who died at 97 on Saturday). Just last week, Senate Commerce lawmakers approved a bipartisan bill to boost the FCC’s power to crack down on unwanted robocalls.
— Gabbard, meanwhile, chimed in on consumer privacy. “Social media data should be protected at the same level as medical data — it includes sensitive information about our daily lives, relationships, health and finances.” she wrote on Twitter on Saturday. “As president, I’ll make sure that your personal privacy is protected.” In February, Gabbard jabbed “big tech companies” for “stealing our money, privacy, and freedom” in a campaign video .
VERIZON ON NATIONWIDE 5G — The wireless giant recently launched its 5G network in two cities — Minneapolis and Chicago — but will the rest of the country get coverage? Verizon’s Ronan Dunne, president of the company’s consumer group, told Margaret, “Our absolute plans are nationwide 5G coverage. How we achieve that may be technologically different in different places.”
— The company’s vision for reaching that goal? Dunne said a dense network that relies on high-frequency airwaves makes sense for 5G in urban areas, but for rural and semi-rural areas, a mix of spectrum that offers both coverage and capacity is key. “We will continue to re-farm the existing spectrum we have in the mid and low bands, and we will continue to encourage the FCC and the government to bring more and more spectrum — both high-frequency and midband — and make it available as quickly as possible.”

Mulvaney: GOP will unveil health plan 'fairly shortly',www.politico.com,politico.com,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2019/04/08/mulvaney-gop-will-unveil-health-plan-fairly-shortly-573872,"With help from Joanne Kenen and Dan Goldberg QUICK FIX — Mick Mulvaney vowed that the Trump administration would soon debut a health care plan , after his weekend meeting with HHS Secretary Alex Azar, CMS Administrator Seema Verma and other officials.
 But Senate Republicans have made clear: They're not interested in prioritizing health care , with four of President Donald Trump's hand-picked senators for crafting an Obamacare replacement mostly dodging the issue.
— Blue states have stalled on rolling out so-called public option health plans , even after many Democrats campaigned on the idea in 2018.
IT'S MONDAY PULSE — Where your author is wavering on watching tonight's NCAA men's basketball championship. (Let me get this straight: It's a football school vs. some Guy?)
Zion Williamson, we hardly knew ye. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com .
Driving the Day MULVANEY: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL 'ABSOLUTELY' ROLL OUT HEALTH PLAN — The acting White House chief of staff vowed that the White House would ""fairly shortly"" unveil a health plan that Republicans could use to deflect Democrats' attacks.
""We want to run on this,"" Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday. See video .
— Mulvaney brainstormed with ALEX AZAR, SEEMA VERMA this weekend. The HHS secretary and CMS administrator joined Mulvaney and other White House officials at Camp David.
""We spent the time this weekend saying, okay, what have we done, what can we talk about that's a success [and] what do we need to work on going forward,"" Mulvaney said. Among the administration's likely talking points: Lower drug prices and new health plans in the individual market.
BUT IN CONGRESS: GOP BRAINTRUST SAYS NO THANKS TO HEALTH — The four Senate Republicans tapped by Trump aren't jumping at the opportunity to devise a new health care bill, POLITICO's Adam Cancryn and Alice Miranda Ollstein write.
— Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) says any new plan has to come from the White House — and that he had no warning Trump planned to make him part of the health policy group.
— Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) won't say more than he and colleagues are “working on health care thoughts.”
— Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), when asked about the Republican plan, turned the question back on the opposition, saying, “Democrats want to go to the complete government takeover of health care.”
— Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), the fourth member of Trump’s team, hasn’t committed to anything more than “conversations with colleagues” about health care affordability.
More for Pros
— Why the stall? The GOP has been deadlocked on a replacement since its high-profile repeal effort collapsed in the fall of 2017, Adam and Alice write.
That’s left the party paralyzed — reluctant to contradict Trump but scared of entering another campaign cycle without a coherent health care message.
FOR THOSE KEEPING TRACK
— March 26: Trump vows that Republicans will be ""party of health care,"" a day after calling for all of Obamacare to be struck down by the courts.
— March 27-March 31: Congressional Republicans publicly signal that they don't want to re-litigate health care fight.
— April 1: Trump seemingly punts health plan until after 2020 elections. ""Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win ... back the House,"" the president tweeted. More .
— April 7: Mulvaney vows that a health plan is coming soon.
IN THE BLUE STATES: PUBLIC OPTION HITS A WALL — This was supposed to be the year that Democratic state legislators set up government-run insurance plans to bolster Obamacare. But three months into 2019, the plans are nowhere to be seen, POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan and Dan Goldberg write.
— State of play: Lawmakers have shelved or watered down legislative proposals in New Mexico, Nevada and other states that were intended to set up a public option to give people more coverage choices — and insurers more competition.
And multiple Democratic governors who backed the idea during their campaigns haven’t pushed it since taking office, underscoring the challenge of creating coverage expansions that are less ambitious than the ""Medicare for All"" plan.
— Why no action? “When you’re dealing with a new issue — and this is a new idea — the biggest problem around the idea is one of cost,"" said former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat. ""Where is the money going to come from? And obviously every politician is concerned about that, rightfully so.""
— One downside: Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said he thinks Democrats could potentially risk a primary challenge if they ran on a coverage expansion agenda and didn't deliver by the next election. ""It’s obviously powerful with the Democratic electorate,"" he said.
More for Pros .
THE WHITE HOUSE Mulvaney blames Jeff Sessions for not going far enough on ACA. Also on ""Fox News Sunday,"" the acting White House chief of staff defended Trump's recent decision to call for the courts to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. previously had called for Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions to be struck down but for much of the rest of the law to stand.
The new position ""should come as a surprise to no one,"" Mulvaney said. ""What was actually a surprise to us is that when Jeff Sessions was attorney general, he took a different position."" See video .
EYE ON FDA Now in seat — and with tweet — NED SHARPLESS. The acting commissioner, who's now officially running FDA, took to social media for his first message over the weekend.
""Excited to join Team FDA as Acting Commissioner,"" Sharpless tweeted , with a photo of him and Twitter-loving predecessor Scott Gottlieb. ""Like the rest of the hard working staff at FDA, I’m fully committed to protecting and promoting the public health.""
Meanwhile: How SCOTT GOTTLIEB made it safe for conservatives to love the FDA. In his two years at the helm, the former commissioner's style helped win over conservatives to his surprisingly up-tempo regulatory agenda, POLITICO's Sarah Owermohle writes. More for Pros .
INSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING ICYMI: HHS inspector general probing CMS communications contracts. The OIG has already ""taken preliminary steps to look into the matter,"" Inspector General Daniel Levinson wrote to Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and other Democrats. More for Pros .
The confirmation of a probe came days after a POLITICO report revealing that CMS had spent millions of dollars on contracts with GOP-linked firms.
AROUND THE NATION Idaho Senate sends Medicaid work requirement bill to governor. Under the legislation , which modifies the expansion that voters passed in November, the state would require most recipients to work or volunteer an average of 20 hours per week, POLITICO's Dan Goldberg reports.
Idaho Republicans also vowed that their legislation won’t meet the same fate as work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky, which were recently blocked by a federal judge. One of their arguments: Idaho beneficiaries would only be locked out of Medicaid for two months if they don't comply with the regulations. (In Arkansas, beneficiaries can be locked out for the remainder of the year.)
Anti-Medicare for All group targets Massachusetts congresswoman. The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future is out with a new digital ad campaign that blasts Rep. Lori Trahan (D-Mass.) for her recent decision to co-sponsor H.R. 1384 (116) , the House's Medicare-for-all bill. See ad .
“Congresswoman Trahan promised that she would protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, but in Washington she has co-sponsored legislation that would eliminate the ACA and replace our entire health care system,"" said Lauren Crawford Shaver, the Partnership's executive director. It's the first ad by the industry-backed coalition that singles out an individual member of Congress.
Consumer groups urge Congress: Deal with surprise bills. ""The public has identified health care costs as a top priority for action this Congress, and addressing surprise billing is a chance to demonstrate real leadership to the people,"" Families USA and 44 other groups write to congressional leaders.
That could require ""tough choices"" to protect patients from out-of-network bills, the groups argue, laying out potential recommendations. Read letter .
WHAT'S PLAGUING HEALTH CARE: It's the prices, stupid — plus some other stuff. That's what experts assembled by POLITICO and the Forum at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said in a discussion moderated by our Joanne Kenen, riffing off our latest health care poll .
Among the takeaways
— Consumers think health care's problem is ""price, price, price,"" and ignore problems like utilization and America's aging population, said Harvard's Bob Blendon.
Blendon also said that while roughly half of consumers (mostly Democrats), favor Medicare For All, they still doubt it will bring down costs too much – and enthusiasm is likely to dampen once the public better understands the tradeoffs.
— But prices aren't the only culprit, warned the University of Chicago's Kate Baicker, adding that intensity and quality of care also matter.
Baicker noted that in health care, it's hard to find true ""apples to apples"" comparisons because prices are so wildly different. That's one reason why solutions should focus on ""aligning incentives"" across providers, patients and manufacturers to improve health as much as possible, she said.
— One tactic: Capping revenue or global budgeting, said Stuart Altman of Brandeis, noting that’s how other countries have controlled spending. It’s also what Massachusetts has moved toward via its cost benchmarking , added Altman — who's also the chair of the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission .
Meanwhile, Altman championed spending more on social determinants of health. And he warned that an unsophisticated approach to cost control — like simply ratcheting down government heath care prices — could backfire with higher private prices.
— The ceaseless ACA fight has distracted us from other priorities in health care , lamented Harvard Kennedy School Dean and former CBO director Doug Elmendorf (and as Joanne noted in her cost story ).
The latest political crossfire isn’t helping, Elmendorf added. “Republicans have focused on the proposition that there is some alternative to the Affordable Care Act that would maintain high levels of insurance coverage but at most lower government cost and personal cost and fewer government regulations,” he told the Forum. “Neither logic nor evidence supports that proposition.”

Driving the Day AGING SERVICES GROUP TO CONGRESS: DON’T FORGET ABOUT ELDERCARE — The aging services provider association LeadingAge wants lawmakers crafting comprehensive telehealth legislation to keep older patients in mind, and to waive certain Medicare requirements to make the technology more accessible.
In its response to the Congressional Telehealth Caucus’ request for information, LeadingAge urged Congress to mandate testing new care models for nursing facilities. One demonstration LeadingAge described would test out telemedicine and remote monitoring technology in their patients' homes, independent living centers, affordable housing and other home-based settings. “Providers could bill for services such as: monitoring, educating, triaging and managing participants’ health,” the group wrote. Another demonstration could examine whether it makes sense to offer financial incentives to skilled nursing facilities. Read the rest of their comments here .
... Also on telehealth, CMS on Friday finalized updates to its policy on telehealth benefits in Medicare Advantage plans. Under the new rule, private Medicare plans that serve about a third of all Medicare beneficiaries can include additional telehealth benefits starting in 2020.
It’s a change that CMS says will encourage greater adoption of telemedicine. Medicare Advantage plans could already offer telehealth services as a supplemental benefit, but the final rule says telemedicine can be a basic benefit. That provision was mandated in the 2018 Bipartisan Budge Act.
Starting this year, beneficiaries in traditional Medicare can get coverage for virtual check-ins, while in the past they could only get coverage if they lived in rural areas.
As part of the same final rule, CMS updated its Star Ratings system for Medicare Advantage and Part D plan quality, including for plans affected by uncontrollable events such as hurricanes. Pros can read the story here .
... Elsewhere at CMS, HHS inspector general Daniel Levinson told Democratic lawmakers that his office is probing CMS' communications contracts with GOP-linked firms following a POLITICO report , according to our colleagues Dan Diamond and Adam Cancryn, who authored that report.
In a letter to Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Levinson said the OIG has already ""taken preliminary steps to look into the matter.”
Adam and Dan found that CMS had spent millions of dollars on the communications contracts, including one with a longtime GOP media adviser whose ask was to raise Administrator Seema Verma’s profile.
The OIG’s review would examine whether Verma had steered those contracts, which the Trump administration suspended last week.
This news comes shortly after Levinson announced his resignation; this probe could eventually be overseen by a new inspector general, after he departs on May 31.
NVIDIA AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RADIOLOGY PARTNER ON AI —Computing technology company NVIDIA and the American College of Radiology are partnering to make widely available an AI toolkit that radiologists can use to build, train and share diagnostic algorithms, the two groups announced today.
ACR plans to make NVIDIA’s software toolkit available through its own software platform for radiologists. The two groups did a pilot at The Ohio State University to better understand how to share AI models without also transferring sensitive patient data.
The system could help clinicians without programming experience tap into AI, Keith Dreyer, chief data science officer at Partners Healthcare, said in a news release. And while algorithms generally work best at the site where they were trained, “limited training sets are not always representative of the population at large,” he said. Allowing clinicians to train them at a diverse set of sites “helps ensure resiliency while reducing algorithm bias.”

RESEARCH CORNER 23ANDME RESPONDS AFTER GETTING DINGED ON BRCA TEST —Last week, researchers from genetic information company Invitae — which plans to offer its own personal genetic test —presented a study finding that 23andMe misses almost 90 percent of carriers of a BRCA breast cancer mutation. A 23andMe spokesperson tells Morning eHealth that research was “highly misleading.”
GenomeWeb reports that researchers from Invitae presented the study at the annual meeting of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Invitae clinical geneticist Edward Esplin said the study found that 23andMe’s direct-to-consumer BRCA test, designed to detect variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, actually misses the majority of carriers.
…”We are very clear with customers that our BRCA1/BRCA2 (Selected Variants) report only tests for three out of thousands of possible genetic variants,” the spokesperson said, pointing to a warning 23andMe issues at the top of reports.
NEW EHR STUDIES —One new study in JAMIA finds that the second stage of CMS’ Meaningful Use incentive program likely contributes to an increase in the use of patient portals; another finds that EHR downtime has no impact on 30-day patient mortality.
HEALTH CARE TRANSPARENCY HAS ITS LIMITS -Brandeis University’s Stuart Altman, who for decades has watched bright health care ideas come and go, and who is also the chair of the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, isn’t all that impressed with the Trump administration’s proposal for making hospital prices transparent. He’s not against transparency—he said no economist can be — but it's not magic.
“Much of this is rhetoric and pure nonsense,” he said at an event on health care costs sponsored jointly by POLITICO and The Forum at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Patients sometimes see a higher price and decide that means better care, and that they want to go there.
If the proposal involves just posting prices, as the Trump administration is currently putting forth, “I don’t want to say it’s useless – but it’s useless,” he said. He added that the Trump administration isn't the only one coming up with such proposals.
At the same event, Katherine Baicker, dean of the Harris School of Policy at the University of Chicago, pointed out that patients don’t always trust transparency. If it comes from an insurance company, the patient may just fear he or she is being pushed into care that’s cheaper, but also inferior.

Dairy farmers worry Congress’ rescue mission falls short,www.politico.com,CATHERINE BOUDREAU,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/dairy-farmers-congress-1307608,"The Agriculture Department is preparing to roll out a new program this summer to ease a multiyear economic slump that has drained dairy farmers’ savings and forced thousands out of business, changing the landscape of rural communities across the country.
Many bipartisan lawmakers have touted the plan, including House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.), who led an effort to revamp the dairy safety net in the 2018 farm bill and has said it will save many milk producers.
The producers aren’t as convinced. Although they are thankful for any help the government can give, the new aid won’t solve the more systemic problems at hand, according to interviews with a dozen dairy farmers from Vermont to California. POLITICO also spoke with several agricultural economists, bankers and cooperative officials, who highlighted the complexities of the dairy downturn.
Farmers are headed into the fifth year of low milk prices often below their costs for production — a problem spurred by global oversupply and worsened by retaliatory tariffs by top trading partners.
To boot, American consumers are drinking less fluid milk as alternatives like almond and soy-based products gain popularity. (Cheese and butter are having a resurgence in sales now that fat is no longer health enemy No. 1.)
Dairy farms are also consolidating, with larger and more efficient operations squeezing out smaller competitors. This means that even as countless farmers shutter their barns, supply continues to outstrip demand.
“Ideally, what we want to have is a solid milk price and solid trading partners,” said Joanna Lidback, who runs a 65-cow operation in northeastern Vermont and is a business consultant for the bank Yankee Farm Credit. “I don’t think any government program is going to make up for what we’ve lost.”
Targeting help to smaller farms
In 2018, Congress set out to address the plight of dairy farmers. The new farm bill bolstered a federal insurance program by slashing the costs of signing up for policies that are more likely to trigger payments. These changes built on other enhancements lawmakers included in an omnibus budget deal earlier last year.
The revamped program, now called Dairy Margin Coverage, is expected to send about $600 million in payments to milk producers in 2019 alone, according to estimates by the USDA’s Economic Research Service. That is three times more than what the old program, which was created in the 2014 farm bill, paid out over three years.
The dairy lobby and farm-state lawmakers deemed that version of assistance a flop because producers paid more in premiums than what they got back in return, even though milk prices dropped significantly.
Essentially, Dairy Margin Coverage will be more affordable for small and medium-size farms — those producing under 5 million pounds of milk a year, or fewer than 220 cows — to purchase greater protection against a slumping market.
As of 2012, the last time USDA compiled such data, these producers accounted for about 24 percent of U.S. milk production. Today, it is likely a smaller percentage because dairy farms are becoming bigger. This POLITICO DataPoint graphic illustrates the difficult trends.
The new benefits are available for larger dairy operations, as well, but can only be applied to a fraction of their milk production unless they want to pay higher premiums.
The program is designed to help farmers when there is a squeeze between the price of milk and the cost of buying feed for dairy cows. Payments are triggered when the difference between the two — called the margin — drops below a level each month that farmers choose to insure.
Under the old program, farmers could insure up to $8 margins. Now, they can be insured for up to $9.50 margins.
Producers who opt for the highest levels of coverage can expect frequent payments if the market conditions of the past few years continue, according an analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation. Since 2015, margins have fallen below $9.50 about 80 percent of the time and below $8.50 about half the time.
“Some people said it’s too good to be true,” Peterson told reporters in February after a House Agriculture Committee hearing. “This is a no-brainer.”
Peterson said that if the updated program would have been in place last year, dairy farmers who selected the highest levels of coverage would have paid only about $5,000 in premiums and received about $100,000 back.
“It could guarantee that they break even or better,” Peterson said. “It’ll change everything.”
The 2018 farm bill included other incentives, so more milk producers will enroll. For those who participated in the old program, they can either get 50 percent of their premiums refunded in cash or sign up for Dairy Margin Coverage and get a 75 percent credit to use toward future premiums. If farmers lock in coverage for five years, their premiums will be slashed by 25 percent.
Asked whether the new program could encourage farmers to increase milk production because it would be less risky, and therefore exacerbate the oversupply problem, Peterson said he wasn’t concerned because the smaller dairies that will benefit the most don’t produce a lot of the country’s milk.
“It’s not enough to make any difference. That’s why we did it this way. We don’t think it will be a problem,” Peterson said.
He and Senate Agriculture ranking member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), along with more than 100 other lawmakers, sent letters last week pressing USDA to fast-track updates to the dairy program. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has said that sign-ups will open mid-June.
Most of the farmers that POLITICO interviewed shared Peterson’s view, and said they plan to participate in the new program. Owners of large California dairies, however, said it would likely be too costly for them to enroll.
“With the new program and with prices expected to stay where they are now, farmers will be able to weather the storm a little better. There’s no doubt in my mind,” said Dan Vandertie, who milks 40 cows in Brussels, Wis., about 25 miles northeast of Green Bay. He also has a dairy genetics business and farms 400 acres of soybeans, corn and winter wheat.
“I don’t believe it’s meant to make you profitable,” he added. “So when we’re down to getting payments, it’s break-even time. Our real hope is that prices pick up and we don’t have to use it, even if we pay the premiums.”
Broader problems that plague the industry
The payments won’t mean the difference between hanging on or leaving the business altogether, farmers said, but acknowledged that extra aid will help tide them over another year.
But a government insurance program isn’t the solution to the broader problems overwhelming the industry, farmers said. Some called for supply management tools — a controversial proposition that historically has hit roadblocks on Capitol Hill.
Some producers noted that states like Wisconsin and Vermont convened task forces to analyze the industry, which have recently made recommendations. In Wisconsin, suggestions included boosting exports, investing in young producers and changing food labels. Vermont proposed establishing a federal, two-tiered pricing system for milk that could control supply by paying less for production above certain levels.
Other farmers are pegging their hopes on an expansion of overseas markets and a resolution to President Donald Trump’s trade disputes to stimulate demand.
Top U.S. dairy customers like Mexico and China responded to Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports with tariffs of their own on agricultural goods, including cheese, butterfat and milk powders. A study commissioned by the U.S. Dairy Export Council estimated that trade-related losses could total $1.5 billion in 2018, although the organization reported in March that despite the retaliatory tariffs, American dairy exports rose by 9 percent over 2017 levels.
For now, dairy producers said they have put off maintenance on their barns and milking equipment to cut costs. They have also restructured their debt and dipped in to their savings to continue operating through the downturn that doesn’t seem to have an end.
Vandertie said he has delayed replacing two roofs and hasn’t put money away in his retirement account the last four years.
Jim Davenport, who owns a 64-cow operation in New York’s Hudson Valley, is focused on improving the quality of his milk because his cooperative, Agri-Mark — which owns brands like Cabot — pays more for it. He also is a member of Hudson Valley Fresh, a group of 11 farms selling specialty products to New York City coffee shops and other retailers with customers who value supporting local farmers.
Andrew Novakovic, an agricultural economics professor at Cornell University, said a lack of market coordination needs to be addressed to make a difference long term.
“I think the thing that isn’t so obvious, unless you’re immersed in this industry, is that there are many farmers who feel that fundamentally, the market has failed them,” Novakovic said.

Socialism or savior? Some dairy farmers call for supply management to save industry,www.politico.com,CATHERINE BOUDREAU,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/dairy-farmers-socialism-1330613,"Four years of low milk prices have some farmers calling for a national overhaul of the market to put their industry on solid footing for the long haul.
There is just one problem: The dairy sector has yet to unify around one solution. Bridging divides will be key to securing support on Capitol Hill, where major upheaval of dairy policy has been a bruising battle, in large part because of a regional split between larger dairies in Western states and smaller farms in New England and the Midwest.
States and organizations representing smaller farmers, such as ones in Vermont and Wisconsin, are renewing a push toward some type of federal supply management to keep milk prices above the cost of production.
Setting limits on production is sure to run into resistance from larger operations, which are only growing in number as the industry consolidates. As a result, they hold an increasing amount of power among milk cooperative and national trade associations.
“How do you get big and small dairies to come together, as well as processors and consumers?” said Matt Perdue, government relations director for National Farmers Union, which generally supports some form of supply management. “The dairy industry hasn’t coalesced around anything yet, so it puts Congress in a tough situation even when they want to help.”
In typical cycles, low milk prices last two or three years before the market returns to an upswing. Even though the Agriculture Department is predicting slightly higher milk prices in 2019, it still could be the fifth year of a downturn as feed, equipment and labor costs are only becoming more expensive.
As POLITICO reported last week, a dairy insurance program enacted by Congress in the 2018 farm bill is designed to send larger payments to milk producers. Many farmers interviewed, however, said it won’t solve a systemic problem plaguing the industry: too much milk and lackluster demand.
“This is very much what an economist would call an uncoordinated supply chain,” Mark Stephenson, director of dairy policy analysis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, said. “We have nearly 40,000 independent decision makers.”
Easing future gluts
The Wisconsin Farmers Union, National Farmers Organization and Holstein Association USA have embarked on the Dairy Together Roadshow to build momentum for some version of supply management. Meetings are being held in states like New York, Minnesota, New Mexico and California through May, said Dick Bylsma, national milk sales director for NFO, which markets milk throughout the Midwest and New England.
NFO is pressing for a national, two-tiered milk pricing plan that would pay dairy farmers a $4 premium on their first one million pounds of milk each month, and a lower price for any production more than that. The organization said the method would stabilize the market and benefit smaller producers.
“We are trying to develop a coalition of people to promote this idea,” Bylsma said. “Then, we’ll take it to Washington to ask for changes. We’re still in coalition-building phase. It seems like if we don’t do something, we’re a generation away from not having any family-sized dairy farms.”
In January, a working group of the Vermont Milk Commission made similar recommendations to state legislators, developing broad principles for what they called a growth management plan. The working group is composed of state agriculture agency officials and cooperatives like Dairy Farmers of America and Agri-Mark, owner of Cabot Creamery known for its cheese.
The commission said the plan would have to be deployed nationally because regional efforts wouldn’t control enough milk to make a difference in prices. It would involve deciding how much milk the U.S. needs for domestic and export markets, as well as for a 30-day emergency supply, said Diane Bothfeld, director of administrative services for Vermont’s Agency of Agriculture.
Dairy farmers would be assigned a total amount of milk they can produce
d on their historical production, known as a “base.” If farmers want to go beyond their assigned caps, they’d see a deduction in their milk checks. Those funds would be redistributed to farmers who stuck to their limits.
Supply management has been in place for decades in Canada, where dairy farmers make robust profits. Bothfeld said that a major difference from Canada’s system would be that farmer's so-called base — known as quotas north of the border — wouldn't be worth anything.
These ideas cause a rift between small and larger dairies in the U.S. This reality makes national trade associations and milk cooperatives hesitant to take up the cause, as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
“We are hearing two arguments: that it’s a wealth transfer, and it’s socialism,” Bylsma said. “Well, socialism is when a few people make decisions for the rest of us. We’re headed for a situation where a few players will control the market.”
Farms in states like California and Washington average about 1,000 cows or more, while those in New England and the Midwestern are well under 500.
Some milk producers are as big as they will ever want to be, so they support supply management, but others may want to grow because they have multiple family members involved, said John Wilson, senior vice president and chief fluid marketing officer for Dairy Farmers of America. DFA has 13,000 dairy farmer members and owns 46 processing plants that make cheese, ice cream and other products.
“There is no way you’re going to get any national body within DFA to vote to support a national, government-style quota or supply management program,” Wilson added.
The most recent attempt at supply management came ahead of the 2014 farm bill and delayed its enactment as lawmakers wrangled over dairy policy.
The original versions of the House and Senate 2014 farm bill included a “stabilization” component. But it was dropped from the final law after opposition from Republicans like then-House Speaker John Boehner (Ohio) and former Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.). The lawmakers and the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents processors, argued it would hurt exports and increase prices for consumers.
Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson (Minn.) and Sens. Debbie Stabenow (Mich.) and Patrick Leahy (Vt.) — all of whom are still leaders on the agriculture committees, backed the proposal at the time — as did the National Milk Producers Federation, which represents farmers and their cooperatives.
“Supply management was something we pursued in 2014 farm bill, but dairy was split, and we ended up with a safety net that didn’t work,” said Alan Bjerga, spokesperson for NMPF, referring to the original version of dairy insurance.
“We have to be focused on the practical and possible,” he added.
NMPF has concentrated on enhancing the insurance program, now called Dairy Margin Coverage. The group also is pushing the Trump administration to normalize trade relations and expand export markets, as well as block plant-based products from being labeled with dairy terms, such as almond milk and coconut yogurt.
A focus on demand
In Wisconsin, where hundreds of dairy farmers have exited the business at a rate of nearly two a day in 2018, the state reconvened a task force to devise a long-term strategy.
The task force, chaired by Stephenson of the University of Wisconsin–Madison, made 51 recommendations mostly focused on building demand, in part because it is less controversial than addressing supply issues.
Supply management was considered, including a two-tiered milk pricing plan, but ultimately voted down.
“Proponents say smaller farms have greater costs, so they should be paid more. This is where you back up and say, but why?” Stephenson added. “In any industry, if you can cut costs out of system, shouldn’t you do that and reap the rewards?”
The task force instead recommended boosting exports, creating new value-added products like specialty cheeses and encouraging investment in agri-tourism.
It also proposed marketing efforts like adding more fluid milk in schools, as well as getting FDA to crack down on plant-based products using terms as “milk” or “yogurt,” a move the agency is already exploring.
The dairy sector may have to see how the new Dairy Margin Coverage works. If farmers think it is effective, that could change the conversation on supply management, said Perdue of National Farmers Union.
“There is a lot of anxiety out there, which is why the Dairy Together campaign is trying to strengthen the base of support and political will for change,” Perdue said."
New York lawmakers make new push to release Trump's taxes,www.politico.com,BILL MAHONEY,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/08/new-york-lawmakers-make-new-push-to-release-trumps-taxes-956169,"ALBANY — Two Democratic lawmakers in New York are pushing ahead with their efforts to force the release of President Donald Trump’s tax returns, announcing on Monday that they'll introduce legislation to make it easier for the state to share tax returns with congressional committees. State Sen. Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan) and Assemblyman David Buchwald (D-White Plains) have sponsored bills relating to Trump's taxes over the past two years, but the proposals have never gone very far, even after Democrats took control of both houses in January.
But with House Democrats in Washington, D.C., pushing to obtain copies of the president's returns , the lawmakers said it’s time to take advantage of New York’s unique role as the president’s home state.
“We’re not seeking the president’s cooperation,” Buchwald said. “We’re not looking to the IRS to turn over a copy of the returns. There’s a copy of President Trump’s New York state tax returns right here in New York state in an office anywhere, and the only thing that prevents that state income tax return from being made public is a state statute that we the Legislature have the power to amend.”
Buchwald has sponsored a bill since April 2017 that would change the statute. Under his legislation, the state Department of Taxation and Finance would have the power to release the returns of any New Yorker serving in statewide office or as president or vice president who have not made their returns public.
Hoylman first introduced his Tax Returns Uniformly Made Public Act in 2016. That measure, which would prohibit presidential candidates who have not released their returns from appearing on the state's ballot, has spawned copycat measures in many other states.
And it has caused some concerns. Former California Gov. Jerry Brown vetoed his state's version of the bill in 2017 , questioning the constitutionality of having states regulate presidential elections with such detail. And it’s by no means guaranteed to work. “The president or any other candidate, especially one who already feels they’re unlikely to win New York’s electoral votes, could simply decide, ‘I’m not going to be on the New York ballot,'” Buchwald said.
But Hoylman introduced yet another proposal into the mix on Monday. It would allow New York to turn over state returns at the request of congressional committee chairs.
“This legislation would make the work of a federal committee a little easier,” said House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) said in a release. “[I]f confronted with inability to receive the federal tax return, we can turn to New York State.”
Neither house of the Legislature has committed to acting on any of the measures. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has never weighed in on any of the proposals, although he included language in his budget proposal this year that was similar to what was in Hoylman’s bill — but it omitted presidential candidates from the disclosure mandate.
The senator, for his part, said he wasn’t picky about which bill makes its way into law.
“I don’t care how we get it done,” Hoylman said. “I want the route that is most politically feasible, which I’m certain is the one the Legislature will follow in our collective wisdom.”
State Republican Chairman Ed Cox characterized the proposals as bills of attainder, which is legalese for a law that singles out one person or group. Such measures are specifically prohibited in Section I of the U.S. Constitution.
“They’re going down the path of saying we want to be ethical, and the president’s got to release his taxes,” said Cox. “Well, wait a second — the public, when they elected him president of the United States, knew he wasn’t releasing his tax returns. They passed on that, so now they’re trying to really relitigate the election of 2016.”
Replying to these criticisms, Hoylman pointed to Cox’s familial ties to Richard Nixon.
“I would say to Mr. Cox to, if he could, speak to his former-father-in-law, about why he released his taxes and the importance behind that very important political tradition that we are now attempting to codify into state law,” he said."

He’ll lobby on foreign investment, government purchasing and “security-related issues arising under the National Defense Authorization Act,” according to a disclosure filing. The National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 banned the government from using many Huawei products and services. Jain is a former National Security Council senior director for cybersecurity policy during the Obama administration, as well as a former associate deputy attorney general.
 Jain will be the first Jones Day lawyer to lobby since 2003, according to disclosure filings. Huawei also retains APCO Worldwide and Canyon Snow Consulting . Burson Cohn & Wolfe and Racepoint Global also registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act last month to do public relations work on behalf of Huawei. Burson registered for “a short, limited project that was executed and completed,” according to a Burson spokesperson. The firm has no plans to do “any ongoing or future work for Huawei in the United States,” she wrote in an email.

"Democrats could blow election to Trump, Murphy warns - POLITICO",www.politico.com,BURGESS EVERETT,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/dems-fopo-murphy-1259699,"Congress Democrats could blow election to Trump, Chris Murphy warns The Democratic senator fears 2020 candidates aren’t seizing an opportunity to take down Trump’s foreign policy. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Democrats need to get serious about foreign policy in 2020 or risk losing to Donald Trump.
That’s the blunt warning from Chris Murphy, a second-term Democratic senator with increasing sway on the Foreign Relations Committee who just maneuvered a bipartisan condemnation of Trump’s foreign policy through Congress. Story Continued Below
And Murphy, who’s making his case to several White House hopefuls, isincreasingly worried his party is too focused on domestic policy and needs to train its fire on Trump’s haphazard national security record.
“This is not likely to be a foreign policy election. But it will be a close election in which a big national security gap between Democrats and Republicans could cost us the election,” the Connecticut Democrat said in an interview.

Democrats may ridicule the notion of Trump as statesman, but he‘s already bragging about winding down the country’s “endless wars,” improving relations with North Korea and eradicating the terrorists of the Islamic State.
“The quickest way to pierce [Trump’s] image of toughness is to show what a laughingstock America has become across the world,” Murphy added. “Talking about national security and foreign policy is a perfect mechanism to go strike at the heart of Trump’s brand, on a topic that he can’t handle.”
The president was, indeed, laughed at when he spoke before the General Assembly at the United Nations. And he has frequently spooked allies and his own generals — be it with his surprise Syria pullout, his threats to blow up NATO, his repeated attacks on the European Union or his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate agreement.
Trump’s erratic policy shifts appear to be taking a toll with the public. While Republicans still maintain an edge over Democrats when it comes to national security and foreign policy, recent polls show that the gap is narrowing more than at any other point so far in the Trump era.
And so Murphy sees an opportunity for the party — and is pushing his half-dozen colleagues pursuing the White House to make America’s standing in the world more of a campaign issue.
He teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to pass legislation ending the U.S. presence in Yemen’s civil war, in a startling bipartisan rebuke of Trump’s foreign policy.
He’s talked extensively with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) about Syria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, summing up his time with the Intelligence Committee member: “More time talking to Kamala than anybody else.”
And Murphy strategizes about international politics often with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a close friend and presidential candidate who shares his dovish world view.
Some Democratic contenders are beginning to embrace Murphy’s message.
“He has done things that have made the country less safe, that have weakened our alliances, that have been violating the Constitution,” Booker said of Trump in an interview. “This is something that should be a robust part of the conversation in 2020. I think you will hear me talking a lot.”"
Trump again overrules top brass - POLITICO,www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/08/trump-iran-revolutionary-guard-pentagon-1261448,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump has declared on more than one occasion that he’s smarter than America’s military leaders.
And with his unprecedented decision Monday to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist group, he’s setting up another test of that thesis. Story Continued Below
Trump chose to overrule the Pentagon after National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo advised that the top brass' warnings about risks to U.S. troops are overblown, several officials with direct knowledge of the deliberations told POLITICO.
The president’s move came despite Pentagon officials’ warnings that it could lead to retaliatory attacks against U.S. troops by Iranian-backed forces in the Middle East and threats from Iranian leaders that U.S. troops could face “consequences.”
“Like most things Iran-related, DoD opposed,” said a senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe ongoing tensions between the White House National Security Council, which has mounted a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, and a Pentagon brass that has cautioned against unnecessary provocations.
Senior military leaders used the same rationale this winter to try to resist the decision to designate an Iran-backed Iraqi Shiite militia group operating in Iraq known as Harakat al-Nujaba as a terrorist group. Morning Defense newsletter Sign up for Morning Defense, a daily briefing on Washington's national security apparatus.

After no retaliation resulted, the White House “pushed back hard” against Pentagon arguments that designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps would pose a risk to U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria, said the senior defense official.
“It was pretty much a fait accompli from Pompeo and Bolton, and DoD basically got rolled over,” added a former administration official familiar with the deliberations who also insisted on anonymity. “I think the NSC’s read is that DoD’s faking it, that there isn’t a real risk. That’s been an ongoing theme with Bolton with respect to all things Iran.”
The IRGC, a paramilitary arm of the Iranian military, has been blamed for a series of terrorist attacks around the world dating back decades.
Its formal designation as a terrorist group is the first time the United States has labeled an official segment of another government as a terrorist group. Such designations, which carry a more robust set of economic sanctions against personnel and those with financial ties to the organization, typically are reserved for non-state actors.
In response to Monday's decision, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif asked Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to declare U.S. Central Command, the American military headquarters responsible for the Middle East, a terrorist organization, Iranian state-run media reported.
The Pentagon would not say whether it had made any adjustments or issued any new warnings to itsforces deployed in the region. “As a matter of policy, we do not discuss adjustments to force protection levels or measures for operational security reasons,” a spokesperson said.
The CIA, which also operates paramilitary forces in the region, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
But many in the Pentagon’s top leadership were clearly against Trump’s move.
The Pentagon resistance came mainly from Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and top civilian officials including John Rood, the Pentagon's top policy official, and Kathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant defense secretary for international security affairs."
Duncan Hunter draws bigotry accusations for tying opponent to PLO,www.politico.com,JEREMY B. WHITE,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/04/08/duncan-hunter-draws-bigotry-accusations-for-tying-opponent-to-plo-956165,"SACRAMENTO — Rep. Duncan Hunter is facing new accusations of bigotry after again suggesting that a Democratic opponent is advancing an Islamist political agenda. The San Diego Republican faced an unexpected battle in his reliably red district last cycle as his opponent, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, sought to capitalize on a wave of liberal enthusiasm and a federal indictment accusing Hunter of illegally spending campaign funds for personal matters.
Hunter and his campaign repeatedly sought during the campaign to characterize Campa-Najjar as an agent of political Islam — and with Campa-Najjar launching a second challenge, Hunter has doubled down.
A fundraising pitch from Hunter claims that Campa-Najjar’s last bid was buoyed by “supporters of the Palestinian Liberation Organization” and noted that the Democrat’s grandfather was involved with planning the terrorist attack on the 1972 Munich Olympics (the email repeatedly misstated Campa-Najjar’s name and also had the group’s name wrong; it is actually Palestine Liberation Organization).
A Hunter campaign spokesperson did not respond to POLITICO’s requests for comment or corroboration.
“He’s just trying to fearmonger,” Campa-Najjar told POLITICO, calling Hunter’s claims “totally devoid of moral character and facts” and an effort to “distract from his criminal indictment.”
Democratic House members who represent the San Diego area are crafting a letter or statement rebuking Hunter, according to a source connected to the delegation.
The conspiratorial missive from Hunter echoes rhetoric from the last cycle, when the Republican incumbent warned supporters that “radical Muslims are trying to infiltrate the U.S. government” and released a campaign ad saying Campa-Najjar was a “risk” who was “working to infiltrate Congress.”
Campa-Najjar has repeatedly rebutted allegations that he is aligned with political Islam by noting that he is a Christian, he never knew his Palestinian grandfather — and has disavowed the Olympics attack — and that he had to obtain a security clearance to work in the Obama White House.
Campa-Najjar’s father was a Palestinian minister who has been Quote: d praising his own father but endorsing peace efforts with the Israelis.
The battle for Hunter’s seat promises to again be competitive: the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has rallied behind the race, designating it one of two “offensive battlefield targets.” Campa-Najjar has followed up on last year’s 3.4 point loss by announcing that he raised over $345,000 in the first quarter of this year.
Hunter, meanwhile, has been politically hamstrung by the federal case hanging over his tenure. House leadership has stripped him of his committee assignments, a situation the DCCC has sought to highlight.
Should he win his bid to unseat Hunter, Campa-Najjar would bring to Washington a sympathetic perspective toward Palestinians.
In a series of tweets on Monday morning, Campa-Najjar — who was born in the U.S. but lived for a few years during his childhood in the Gaza Strip — shared an image of Palestinian youths and wrote “I was one of these children,” adding that “Palestinians deserve full equality, the right to self-determination, and basic human dignity.”

Health advocates say schizophrenia should be reclassified as a brain disease - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/05/schizophrenia-brain-disease-1059386,"Health advocates say schizophrenia should be reclassified as a brain disease Changing the definition could unlock more money for cures. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Mental health advocates are lobbying Congress to help them get schizophrenia classified as a brain disease like Parkinson’s or Alzheimers, instead of as a mental illness, a move that could reduce stigma and lead to more dollars for a cure.
Federal health officials, scientists and doctors say conditions that cause psychosis, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are poorly understood and, in the public mind, often associated with violent behavior. Patients are more likely to be homeless, incarcerated, commit suicide and die younger than those with any other neurological diseases. Story Continued Below
“Look at the disconnect in the way these patients are treated. It’s unconscionable,” said Raymond Cho, professor of psychiatry research at Baylor College of Medicine and chairman of the Schizophrenia and Related Disorders Alliance of America.
His group is among those focusing on appropriators in Congress — particularly those who have championed mental health in the past — to include schizophrenia in a new CDC program that aims to collect data on the prevalence and risk factors of neurological conditions in the U.S. population. The findings could eventually be used to push the World Health Organization to reclassify the disorder — a complicated process that may take years.
The problem is the CDC only has enough money to study a finite number of conditions, putting disease advocacy groups in competition with each other.

The schizophrenia patient advocates’ efforts are just beginning, and to date, no lawmakers have clearly adopted the cause as their own. The Trump administration hasn’t taken a position at this point, although the chief mental health official Elinore McCance-Katz acknowledged there’s data supporting a neurological underpinning to the condition.
John Snook, executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that aims to eliminate barriers to treating mental illness, said the CDC has long ignored some less understood conditions despite alarming mortality rates. The death rate among people with schizophrenia is four times higher than the general population, according to one study .
“To not have the CDC engaged in this sort of outsized burden is very much a signal to other researchers and people in the pharmaceutical industry and to everyone that we aren’t taking mental illness as serious as other illnesses,” he said.
Part of the attitude may stem from the fact the cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Genetics, environment and an imbalance in brain chemistry all contribute to the risk of developing the condition, which may afflict upward of 2 million Americans, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. It's long been considered a severe mental illness because people with it experience episodes of psychosis involving delusions and hallucinations — often beginning in early adulthood. Treatments typically focus on minimizing symptoms.
Groups pushing for reclassification hope to do the same for other conditions like bipolar disorder, which can also involve psychosis, but are starting with schizophrenia because of its dire consequences. The NIMH ranks the condition among the top 15 causes of disability worldwide and estimates serious mental conditions like it can reduce the average lifespan by 28 years.
“The science is clear, it’s a neurological condition,” said Snook. “If schizophrenia was a disease that we just discovered today there would be no question that’s how we would classify it.”
“It’s a brutal disease,” added Linda Stalters, executive director of the schizophrenia alliance. “We are still treating people like they did in the medieval times.”
But discussions of the disease and its telltale symptoms are often confined to the aftermath of mass shootings, when the focus typically turns to the shooter’s mental health."
