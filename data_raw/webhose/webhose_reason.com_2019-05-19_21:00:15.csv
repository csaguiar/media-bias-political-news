They figured we’d never figure out a way to get at a lot of it, but we did, it just costs more.
One of my cousins works in oil, and discussing this issue with him probably 10 years ago that is exactly what he said. We don’t run out, but we will probably never be able to get it as cheap as it has been in the past again.
Imagine if we had the tech we have now for extraction, and the oil fields that were available 50 or 100 years ago… Oil would probably run $10-20 a barrel consistently.
I generally put my faith that people will figure shit out, but sometimes the data says a middle scenario like we’ll have it, but it might cost more, is the most likely outcome. I think the same for the “ZOMG we’ll be out of water soon!” issue."

The father commands his sons to do something. The first son says “Heck no!” but then feels pangs of conscience, and goes to do it. The second son says “No problem! I’m right on it!” and then doesn’t do it.
Jesus then asks: which of the two sons did the Father’s will?
The United States has chosen to ignore the Kyoto protocols and pull out of the Paris Accord…yet we have been steadily decreasing our CO2 nonetheless. Other countries respect these…yet their carbon footprints continue to increase.

I wish I had made a bet with them at that point, because it would have made a tidy sum of money.

There seems to be a general conceit among intelligent people that when they get a complex enough model of behavior, that factors in enough data, that they have discovered truth. This is especially true among hard engineers who can wrap their heads around complex physics equations that describe electronic circuits and rocket ships.
I, on the other hand, had become a follower of the Santa Fe institute that published works by people like John Holland, who were deeply interested in things like Complex Adaptive Networks and Chaos theory. I knew intuitively that Peak Oil was absolutely wrong, because its models had no leverage points or adaptation factored in. In essence the data fed into their models required you to make predictions about how much we could adapt, rather than adaptation being a part of the model.

It is not about whether the resources become expensive or not. They won’t. It is about whether some combinations of those atoms create external costs that the market can’t deal with until those costs are actually priced and incorporated into the market for it to make decisions based on those prices.
Just to state the obvious one – gigashittons of carbon sequestered in hydrocarbon reservoirs in the earth’s crust (where they have been for millions of years) have a very different net cost than the same gigashittons of carbon emitted into the atmosphere via combustion over a couple hundred years.
Until economics incorporates those costs – or even tries to calculate them rather than leaving those calculations up to power-hungry apocalyptics – then advocates for free markets will be on the losing side of the changes that WILL be forced once those costs become obvious."

Even this gives too much credit to Malthusian assumptions. In general, we’ve exploited around the top 10 km of Earth’s crust. Continental crust is around 30 to 70km deep. We haven’t even exploited all of what is reachable today and that represents only around 1/3 of 40% of the crust. To this day we are still finding resources to exploit in that same area, that represents less than 1% of the planet’s total mass. The new oil fields being built in Texas’s Permian Basin look to DOUBLE our extractable oil reserves, and we are already one of the largest producers in the world.
For all intents and purposes, Earth’s resources are infinite- especially if we are going to reach a peak population in 2030 or so. And this doesn’t even contemplate the vast amount of resources present in our solar system which we are only now beginning to make commercially accessible.

The market does not need economics to factor in costs. The market does what the market does as millions or billions of people make decisions based on local data available to them at the time. Many people try to use economics and other data to make their own decisions. But you cannot forget that these models are attempts to generate data- to describe the organic market that will happen regardless.
The entire global warmist movement has been about trying to make assumptions about the costs of your gigashittons in the future. So far, their models have tended to agree- just as all the peak oil folk tended to agree- but have been off by at least a factor of two. Even today, the costs attributed to Global Warming are small fractions of the growth predicted by the same models. That people use these (likely wrong) models to call for re-organizing and interfering in our markets today should be considered as absurd as the models proposed by other Neo-Malthusians who used them to call for massive reorganization and interference back in the 60s and 70s."

If the pricing system does not work – and a problem appears – then the market will be completely fucking irrelevant to perceived solutions. The EPA and clean water-air legislation was created because a river BURNED (and not for the first time) right in the heart of Cleveland. The Senate and House voted near unanimously to create that stuff within weeks of that fire because burning rivers are perceived as a serious fucking problem – and the market was incapable of fixing it or addressing it or even seeing it as a problem.
So we put in mandates instead. And the successes since then at reducing pollution are now viewed by fundamentalists as an inevitable success of the market. Stupid does not begin to describe you clowns."

Because he wouldn’t have won, in any decade.

The land owners around the river had been fighting to clean it up for years. However the CITY had claimed that area of the river, *as a dumping ground*, largely so it could have a place to send sewage. The STATE had instituted a permit system, selling cheap rights to dump in that area. Attempts to get the state and city to more responsibly use the resource were blocked in courts.
So spare me the condemnation of markets. No market failed there, but the same entities promising to save us from gigashittons of carbon did."

Once the market loses ownership of setting that agenda by solving the problem, it loses that FOREVER.
And the feds did not ‘step in’ unwelcomed. Carl (the mayor) and Louis (their House rep) Stokes both drove the legislation. Carl had the previous year convinced Cleveland to raise a big bond issue to clean up the river. But as long as co’s could continue to dump freely, local cleanup was like the water bucket guy in Fantasia.

I think there’s reason to believe that emotion and personality are less centralized in the brain than is commonly believed. There seem to be nervous system feedback loops interacting with things like the heart and digestive tract that influence what we feel and how we respond to it (the intestinal flora might even be part of that overall feedback system).
At the most rudimentary level, consider that things like anxiety can cause nausea, and that nausea can increase the “weight” of the of the emotions that sparked it. If your heart is prone to race in response to fear or sexual arousal, a heart that’s more or less prone to be triggered by such stimulus could effectively strengthen or weaken those emotions, and thus how much you’re influenced by them
That said, a transplanted heart is certainly *not* going to make you a fencing master, absent some sort of supernatural influence."

That they don’t price in an externality that is completely non-existent today, and merely predicted for the future is a feature, not a bug.
Let’s just say the Evil Oil companies had managed to suppress all awareness of global warming as a thing. If these models were correct, then in 50 or 100 years, we’d be dealing with the effects of Global Warming. Some places would be more dry, and other places would be dealing with rising sea levels. Still other places would be getting more rain, and others would be more temperate. And the markets would respond to that. Those mystical prices would deal with the problems on a local level.
You bring up the Cuyahoga river fire, and it is quite informative to my point. You see, the people in the local area were already dealing with this externality prior to the federal government stepping in. They were funding cleanups of the area, while still managing to keep their industry alive. They were making decisions based on the local conditions. And it is noteworthy that your example was not an example of them “Pricing in” externalities. It was instead a federal government making a one size fits all “solution” to a problem being dealt with at the local level. And, FWIW, this is the same Federal Government that is the biggest polluter in the country."

There has been very few deaths caused by nuclear power stations since the first one was set up, and far fewer than energy extraction in any other industry.
The meltdown in Russia was because of poor design and maintenance and the meltdown in Japan was because of a Tsunami.
Despite the predictions of hundreds of years before anything could grow or indeed live at the meltdown in Russia, the area is now flourishing with wildlife after a couple of decade. However, I wouldn’t eat anything growing there.
The bottom line is that nuclear energy has a proven track record of being safest way of generating electricity which is why France has invested heavily in it’s nuclear energy production. When was the last time anyone ever heard of a meltdown in France. It has never happened All this while other industries continue their pollution around the world.
Sooner or later the reality will be reached that nuclear energy is the best way forward until we discover a more reliable means of producing energy with renewables."
