Obama offers Trump some good advice: 'Stop whining' | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-offers-trump-some-good-advice-stop-whining,"US President Barack Obama speaks at a Hillary for America campaign event, Oct. 14, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. Photo by Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Obama offers Trump some good advice: ‘Stop whining’ 10/18/16 02:27 PM  Updated 10/18/16 02:45 PM By Steve Benen For a guy who enjoys boasting about his “strength” and “toughness,” Donald Trump has a bad habit of whining. When the Republican presidential nominee isn’t complaining about the nefarious forces he perceives as his enemies (journalists, GOP leaders, microphones, Democrats, members of the “global power structure,” et al), Trump is expressing his dissatisfaction with those he sees as uncooperative (pollsters, the Commission on Presidential Debates, Emmy voters, et al).
Reactions to this tend to be a matter of personal taste: Trump’s followers seem to relate to his near-constant complaining, while Trump’s critics are less impressed. But when the Republican candidate started insisting that the American elections process is “ rigged ” against him, the complaints raised a different kind of alarm: Trump’s misguided rhetoric is arguably dangerous if it baselessly undermines public confidence in the American democratic system.
To their credit, some notable Republican officials, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have pushed back, saying publicly that there’s simply no reason to question the integrity of the U.S. voting process. Today, President Obama weighed in on the same subject – in a rather direct way . President Barack Obama on Tuesday downplayed Donald Trump’s suggestion that November’s election is “rigged,” and said the GOP presidential nominee needs to toughen up.
“I’d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and try to go make his case to get votes,” Obama said at a White House news conference alongside Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
“If whenever things are going badly for you, you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job,” Obama continued. “There are a lot of time things don’t go our way or my way … that’s OK, you fight through it.” At the same press conference, the president added, “I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It’s unprecedented,”
That happens to be true. As we discussed yesterday, there’s simply no precedent for anything like this in the American tradition. Voters have never seen a major-party presidential nominee go to such lengths to undermine confidence in their own country’s voting system – without any proof whatsoever – intentionally trying to delegitimize an election before it occurs.
But also note how Obama lowered the boom: “It doesn’t really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you’d want out of a president.”
The point isn’t exactly subtle. The president could explain how and why Trump is wrong, but Obama chose to go one step further, noting that anyone who whines like this simply isn’t prepared for the task at hand.
The New Republic ’s Brian Beutler noted in response, “[A]s the current president, and the most popular and trusted politician in the country, Obama’s scolding and taunting serves both to restore as much faith as possible in the system and to make Trump look petty and weak. This will resonate widely both because it’s so evidently true and because it’s likely to set Trump off on a new round of anti-Obama conniptions.”
Ideally, none of this would be necessary, but since Americans find themselves in less-than-ideal circumstances, it’s good to see the president defend democratic institutions that are facing nonsensical attacks.

"Asked about evidence of obstruction, Graham says, 'I don't care' | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/asked-about-evidence-obstruction-graham-says-i-dont-care,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) speaks during the Sunshine Summit conference being held at the Rosen Shingle Creek on Nov. 13, 2015 in Orlando, Fla. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Asked about evidence of obstruction, Graham says, ‘I don’t care’ 04/29/19 09:20 AM  Updated 04/29/19 01:57 PM By Steve Benen When Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) was Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), he helped lead the impeachment effort against then-President Bill Clinton. In the process, the Republican lawmaker established a series of principles he said he believed in, setting benchmarks for lines a president cannot and should not cross.
The trouble, of course, is that Graham has appeared eager of late to ignore those same principles now that there’s a member of his own party in the Oval Office.
On “Face the Nation” yesterday, CBS News’ Margaret Brennan presented the senator with some of his previous statements, leading Graham to try and draw a distinction between Clinton and Donald Trump: “What President Clinton did was interfere in a lawsuit against him by Paula Jones and others; hide the evidence; encourage people to lie. So to me he took the legal system and turned it upside down.”
Of course, this wasn’t exactly helpful to Trump or those eager to carry his water. To read the Mueller report is to know that the current president also took a wide variety of steps to interfere with a federal investigation, including lying and encouraging others to lie.
And yet, Graham quite literally said he doesn’t care .
“I think it’s just all theater. It doesn’t matter. I don’t care what he said to [former White House counsel] Don McGahn. It’s what he did…. I don’t care what they talked about. He didn’t do anything…. I don’t care what happened between him and Don McGahn.”
Despite the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Graham, added that he considers obstruction allegations against the president to be “ absurd .”
Or put another way, as of yesterday morning, if a Democratic president interferes in a lawsuit and encourages people to lie, that’s an impeachable offense. If a Republican president interferes in a federal investigation and encourages people to lie, that’s trivia – according to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It’s an amazing perspective. Graham didn’t say this explicitly, but the unmistakable takeaway is that he believes Trump attempted to obstruct justice, but he failed to actually do so. The president told the White House counsel to fire the special counsel and lie about it, but since Don McGahn didn’t execute Trump’s wishes, then the whole sordid mess is just “theater.”
I’ll leave it to lawyers to speak to this with more authority, but as best as I can tell, this isn’t how the system is supposed to work. Attempting to interfere with a criminal investigation is itself evidence of obstruction. McGahn’s willingness to ignore a president’s corrupt instructions does not let that president off the hook.
South Carolina’s senior senator, however, has left no doubt that he simply does not care, despite the principles he said he cared about when there was a Democrat in the White House. The Washington Post ’s James Downie added , “Graham is far from the first hypocritical politician. But the South Carolina senator particularly prides himself on being no-nonsense and on his legal experience. That he has opted for such an obvious double standard is especially shameless.”

Trump's lies about abortion take an alarming and incendiary turn | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-lies-about-abortion-take-alarming-and-incendiary-turn,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump held his latest campaign rally in Green Bay on Saturday night, and as he’s done on several recent occasions, the president focused attention on abortion rights. In this case, the Republican described a very specific scenario:
“The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
The audience, on cue, expressed its disapproval of such conditions, booing loudly, as if their president had told them a gruesome truth.
He hadn’t. In fact, the scenario Trump depicted was ridiculously false. The New York Times published a detailed, albeit understated, fact-check piece , but the bottom line remains the same: there are no instances in which a healthy baby is born, only to be murdered soon after following a chat between a woman and her doctor.
If the White House can point to a single instance in which this has ever happened, anywhere in the United States, officials should feel free to present such an example to the public.
They won’t, because they can’t.
The problem in this case, however, isn’t limited to the obvious fact that the president lied – an alarmingly common occurrence – but rather, it’s the nature of this specific lie that stands out.
In an era in which domestic terrorism is an increasingly deadly societal scourge, it’s dangerous when a sitting American president lies to rabid followers with tales of infants being executed in medical facilities.
Complicating matters, Saturday night was an extreme example, but it was hardly the first example of Team Trump using incendiary rhetoric of late on the issue of reproductive rights.
As regular readers know , it was early last month when House Democrats launched an expansive investigation into presidential abuses, prompting White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to release an official press statement accusing Dems of trying to “distract” the public from the party’s agenda – which she said includes “killing babies after they’re born.”
Soon after, the president’s chief spokesperson went a little further. Asked about the virtues of possibly lowering the rhetorical temperature in D.C., the president’s chief spokesperson decided to do the opposite .
“Look, I think that the real shame in all of this is that Democrats are perfectly capable of coming together and agreeing on the fact that they’re comfortable ripping babies straight from a mother’s womb or killing a baby after birth,” Sanders said.
The use of the word “comfortable” was of particular interest – as if Democrats agree with the White House press secretary’s incendiary and false rhetoric.
No good can come of this.

Turmoil creates 'crisis' conditions for the NRA | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/turmoil-creates-crisis-conditions-the-nra,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/26/19, 10:16 PM ET Federal judge sentences Maria Butina to 18 months in prison Maria Butina, who pled guilty to acting as a Russian operative, was sentenced in federal court today to 18 months in prison. The judge ordered that Butina be deported immediately following the end of her sentence. share tweet email save Embed On Friday afternoon, as the National Rifle Association’s annual national gathering was getting ready to hear from the nation’s president and vice president, Russian agent Maria Butina was sentenced by a federal judge to 18 months in prison . Butina, of course, intended to influence conservative politics and the Republican Party, and she did so largely by focusing her efforts on the NRA.
At face value, that seemed like the sort of development that might’ve left a cloud over the far-right group’s convention. But as developments progressed, the Russian operative’s prison sentence was just the tip of the iceberg. As the Washington Post reported , “The typically bland corporate fare this year exploded with strife, including allegations of extortion, financial mismanagement and a leadership battle that have publicly overtaken all else at the event.”
Former NRA president Oliver North was ousted from the organization Saturday, one day after NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre issued a letter to the NRA’s board, claiming that North tried to extort him. The battle, which LaPierre appears to have won, was centered on what some claim are exorbitant payments to the group’s outside counsel and a lawsuit the NRA filed against its longtime public relations firm, Ackerman McQueen.
On his way out the door, North, whose resignation was not voluntary, said in his resignation letter that there’s “ a clear crisis ” within the organization.
That seems like a fair assessment. Before his own ouster, North sought LaPierre’s resignation , accusing the group’s longtime leader of financial improprieties, including allegations LaPierre spent more than $200,000 on “wardrobe purchases … that were charged to a vendor.” There are reportedly additional questions surrounding the lack of transparency surrounding the NRA’s contract with Ackerman McQueen.
LaPierre retaliated, told the board North was trying to divide the organization, and North clearly lost the fight. That does not, however, mean the drama is over.
Steve Hart, the NRA’s longtime lawyer, was also suspended over the weekend, and that news coincided with an announcement from New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), whose office is now investigating the NRA’s tax-exempt status .
The NRA’s full board of directors is scheduled to meet today . Evidently, the board’s 76 members will have quite a few decisions to make – including choosing a new president to replace North.

* There’s a lot to chew on in the new Washington Post /ABC News poll , but here’s a topline result that stood out for me: 55% of American voters say they “definitely” will not vote for Donald Trump next year. That may seem encouraging to the president’s critics, though it’s worth noting for context that in 2016, 54% of Americans who cast ballots didn’t vote for Trump and he won anyway.
* The same polling found former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading the Democrats’ presidential field with 13%, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 9%. Most of the party’s voters are undecided. (Note: in this poll, respondents were asked to volunteer their top choice; they were not read a list of candidates.)
* Biden picked up an important endorsement this morning, receiving the support of the International Association of Fire Fighters.
* In the face of criticism that his campaign hasn’t been substantive enough, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) unveiled a plan to combat the climate crisis this morning. His plan is to position the United States as a net-zero emissions country by 2050. That’s in line with United Nations targets, though the Green New Deal aims for the same target by 2030.
* According to the New York Times , 16 presidential hopefuls have qualified for the upcoming Democratic debates, while four – Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Mayor Wayne Messam, and Marianne Williamson – have not yet met the minimum thresholds.
* Biden’s campaign made it a priority to have strong fundraising right out of the gate, and as Rachel noted on Friday’s show, the former vice president and his team met their goal: Biden raised $6.3 million in his first 24 hours, which narrowly topped Beto O’Rourke’s $6.1 million first-day haul.
* On a related note, some of the former vice president’s supporters have launched a super PAC on his behalf, and while Biden cannot legally stop them, one of his aides said he “does not welcome assistance from super PACs.”
* And though it seems a little hard to believe, a new Emerson poll in Texas found several Democratic presidential hopefuls running competitively with Donald Trump, with O’Rourke tied with the president, and Biden actually leading the Republican, 50% to 49%. The same poll showed Biden leading O’Rourke among Democratic voters in the Lone Star State, 23% to 22%.

Trump's 'personal conversations' with Rod Rosenstein raise eyebrows | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trumps-personal-conversations-rod-rosenstein-raise-eyebrows,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump’s offensive against Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein seemed to reach its peak around Thanksgiving, when the president promoted a Twitter message calling for the imprisonment of his perceived political foes. The tweet included Rosenstein .
I’d assumed Trump would say it was just a joke, but when the New York Post asked the Republican why his own deputy attorney general belongs behind bars, the president replied , “He should have never picked a special counsel.”
Six months later, Robert Mueller’s investigation, which Rosenstein oversaw from his Justice Department perch, is over, and Rosenstein is exiting the stage. He submitted his resignation letter yesterday, and his last day is May 11.
His resignation was expected; he had been saying for a long time that he planned to leave the department once Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election, possible collusion by the Trump campaign and potential obstruction of justice by the president was completed.
“I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education and prosperity,” Rosenstein wrote in his resignation letter.
Apparently indifferent to the political implications, the deputy AG even included an “ America first ” reference in his letter.
It was an odd message, especially for someone who no longer has any incentive to flatter the fragile ego of the president. At least publicly, Trump has routinely showed Rosenstein disrespect, if not contempt, so praising the president’s “courtesy” struck a dissonant note.
But I was also struck by the reference to the “personal conversations” between Trump and Rosenstein. This comes on the heels of a related Washington Post report about their interactions:
Rod J. Rosenstein, again, was in danger of losing his job. The New York Times had just reported that – in the heated days after James B. Comey was fired as FBI director – the deputy attorney general had suggested wearing a wire to surreptitiously record President Trump. Now Trump, traveling in New York, was on the phone, eager for an explanation.
Rosenstein – who, by one account, had gotten teary-eyed just before the call in a meeting with Trump’s chief of staff – sought to defuse the volatile situation and assure the president he was on his team, according to people familiar with matter. He criticized the Times report, published in late September, and blamed it on former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, whose recollections formed its basis. Then he talked about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and told the president he would make sure Trump was treated fairly, people familiar with the conversation said.
“I give the investigation credibility,” Rosenstein said, according to an administration official with knowledge of what was said during the call. “I can land the plane.”
So let me get this straight. While the president was the subject of a federal investigation, he had multiple conversations with the Justice Department official overseeing the probe – including discussions about the investigation itself?
It reminds me of a point we first kicked around 14 months ago . In June 2016, Bill Clinton had a chat on a tarmac with then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, and according to everyone involved, it was a fairly brief and inconsequential social interaction.
The political world responded to the meeting with abject horror: because the Justice Department was examining Hillary Clinton’s email server protocols, Americans were told, it was wildly inappropriate for the former president to engage the sitting attorney general in conversation.
After all, according to those who saw the chat as scandalous, Bill Clinton might’ve used the opportunity to pressure a top Justice Department official about an ongoing investigation.
There was no evidence of such pressure, but that didn’t matter. Even the possibility was widely seen as scandalous.
Everyone who took that story seriously, or at least pretended to, should consider why Trump’s chats with Rosenstein are receiving far less attention.

New revelations lead to even more trouble for Trump's Fed nominee | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/new-revelations-lead-even-more-trouble-trumps-fed-nominee,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 4/1/19, 9:00 PM ET Obeisance to Trump may not be sufficient to save new Fed nominee Rachel Maddow reports on the mounting scandals plaguing Donald Trump’s nominee for the Federal Reserve Board, Stephen Moore, whose co-authorship of a book called “Trumponomics” may not be sufficient qualification to secure his confirmation. share tweet email save Embed Stephen Moore, Donald Trump’s controversial choice for the Federal Reserve’s board of governors, has already faced intense criticism, but as some of the pushback starts to come from Senate Republicans , his odds of confirmation are starting to fade.
The New York Times reported overnight that White House officials are doing what they should’ve done before the president threw his support behind the Republican pundit: they’re starting to vet his published works.
The White House is reviewing past writings by Stephen Moore, the conservative commentator whom President Trump plans to nominate to the Federal Reserve Board, amid criticism that many of his opinion columns denigrated women, and enthusiasm for his candidacy appeared to be waning among Republicans on Capitol Hill. […]
Mr. Moore apologized on Sunday for some, but not all, of his past writings in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” saying that he did not remember everything he had written over his career. “Frankly, I didn’t even remember writing some of these they were so long ago,” he said, adding that he was embarrassed by some of the pieces.
Mr. Moore has written that it may be dangerous for women to earn more than men and has criticized women’s athletic abilities. On Sunday, he tried to shift the focus from his writings to his critics, saying, “I think most fair-minded people think this has been kind of a sleaze campaign against me.”
If by “sleaze campaign,” Moore is referring to people quoting things he’s said and written, then his whining is well grounded.
Indeed, new revelations continue to come to the fore. The New York Times pointed to comments Moore made during a debate in 2016, in which he endorsed repeal of existing child-labor laws.
The article also highlighted comments Moore made in 2000, during a C-SPAN appearance. “It’s not a good thing that black women are making more than black men today,” Moore told a national television audience. “In fact, you know, the male needs to be the breadwinner of the family. One of the reasons you’ve seen the decline of the family, not just in the black community, but also it’s happening now in the white community as well, is because women are more economically self-sufficient.”
There’s no reason to believe this was intended to be funny.
All of this follows other recent revelations, including a 2017 incident in which Moore made absurd comments about Robert E. Lee and slavery.
Of course, each of these examples are just part of a vast collection of offensive and insulting quotes from the Republican pundit.
Moore seems to believe he has a credible response to all of this: none of it matters. The only thing he should be judged on, Moore has argued, is his perspective on economic policy.
“No one wants to talk about my economic ideas,” Moore complained last week. “They have not attacked me on my economic ideas,” he added .
If that were true, it’d still be unpersuasive. Moore’s bizarre record on a wide variety of issues raises important doubts about his judgment.
But just as important is the fact that Moore’s complaint in no way reflects reality. His economic ideas have come under intense fire from, among others, me .
The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampell has done fantastic work on Moore’s Fed nomination, and she added this morning, in a rather brutal column , “Stephen Moore wants the media to pay less attention to his idiotic comments about gender and more attention to his idiotic comments about the economy. Sure thing, bro. Happy to help out.”
For what it’s worth, the White House still hasn’t formally sent Moore’s nomination to the Senate for consideration. There’s still time, in other words, to end this fiasco before it proceeds in earnest.

"Targeting the ACA, Trump doesn't see his health care vulnerability | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/targeting-the-aca-trump-doesnt-see-his-health-care-vulnerability,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump was eager to brag about his perceived accomplishments at the NRA’s gathering last week and drew some applause when he turned his attention the Affordable Care Act. “[W]e got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated,” the president said . “Now we’re going for the rest.”
It was those last six words that stood out. Congressional Republicans, aware of the pitfalls for the GOP in the health care debate, have urged the White House to proceed with caution on the issue. Trump doesn’t seem to care.
He should. The latest Monmouth University poll , released yesterday, found health care as Americans’ top concern, far above issues such as taxes and immigration. The latest Washington Post /ABC News poll pointed in a similar direction :
Trump’s handling of health care appears to be a bigger liability in his reelection bid, with 38 percent of voters saying it is a mark against him, compared to 25 percent who say it’s a reason to vote for him.
Republicans are comparatively less enthused about Trump’s handling of health care than they are about other issues, with less than half – or 46 percent – of GOP voters saying his management of the issue makes them more likely to vote for him.
Among independents, Trump’s handling of health care is a negative attribute by an 11-point margin (36 percent to 25 percent).
The more the president boasts about his plans to take down “the rest” of the Affordable Care Act, the more the Republican reminds the public about an issue on which he’s very weak.
Complicating matters is the fact that Trump’s latest boast doesn’t appear to make a lot of sense. Look again at the quote from his NRA speech: “[W]e got the individual mandate, the absolute worst part of Obamacare, eliminated. Now we’re going for the rest.”
Who’s “ we ”? It’s certainly not congressional Republicans, who have no interest in relitigating the issue. It’s also not the White House, which still doesn’t have a plan , and has no plans to come up with one.
And yet, earlier this month, Trump spoke to the National Republican Congressional Committee – whose members are in the minority in part because of health care – and told his allies, “Republicans should not run away from health care. You can’t do it. You’re going to get clobbered. And I have an idea and I think it’s great.”
The idea, evidently, is to come up with a health care plan in 2021.
Soon after, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News, in reference to health care, “Oh, yes, we want to run on this.”
If Democrats are lucky, Republicans will follow through on this.

* In New Hampshire, a new Suffolk/ Boston Globe poll found former Vice President Joe Biden (D) leading the Democratic presidential field with 20% support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who easily won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, with 12%. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) was third in the poll with 11%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with 8%.
* For what it’s worth, the same survey polled Republicans in the Granite State and found Donald Trump with 72% support, followed by former Gov. William Weld with 16%. That’s obviously an overwhelming advantage, but 72% for an incumbent president in a swing state isn’t great.
* As for national polling, CNN’s new results show Biden receiving a significant bump in the wake of his formal announcement, and the former vice president now leads the Democratic field with 39%. Sanders was second in the poll with 15%, followed by Warren at 8%, and Buttigieg at 7%. The only other two candidates in the survey with support at 5% or higher were former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
* In his first public speech as a 2020 candidate, Biden yesterday started to share the outline of his platform, which apparently includes support for, among other things, a $15 minimum wage and scrapping Trump’s tax breaks.
* As Rachel noted on the show last night, Kamala Harris’ campaign made a significant new hire , picking up Jim Margolis as her media adviser. Margolis is generally seen as one of the Democrats’ top admakers, with experience in both of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns.
* Brad Parscale, Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, delivered a paid speech to Romanian politicians last month, which seems odd. “The appearances are terrible,” Richard Painter, a chief ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, told the Washington Post. “You would certainly think that a campaign manager would not take money from foreign nationals in this political environment.”
* If you’re looking for another Democratic presidential candidate whose name begins with a “B,” I have some good news for you: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) appears to be moving closer to a White House bid, including hiring staff in Iowa.

An excerpt from 'Mama's Boy',www.msnbc.com,Morning Joe staff,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/excerpt-mamas-boy,"By Morning Joe staff My mom now lived in Manassas Park, in a house built right on top of the bloodied Civil War battlefields of Bull Run, where more than twenty-four thousand soldiers gave their lives in the debate over whether all men are created equally—a scar on our nation, reminding us of how divided we once were, and in many ways still are.
I had added a three-day layover via Dulles Airport in Virginia to my next love-fueled flight to London to see the Brit I was fast falling head over heels for. It was a little surprise visit to lift my mom’s spirits, and a big birthday present to myself. My mom cried with joy and relief when I walked into her bedroom. I spent all three days with her there. We blew out candles. We ate cake. We ordered in from a local restaurant and enjoyed our dinners on her bedroom floor. Then I opened the presents she’d ordered off her laptop from her perennial perch atop her bed.
She wasn’t feeling well, but that was nothing new. For a variety of reasons, big and small, she’d long been forced to use her not inconsiderable strength to fight off this illness or that. We’d done this ailment dance many times. We simply took advantage of her sleepless nights to share stories, watch NCIS, check out the Home Shopping Network’s jewelry specials and buy a few pairs of earrings she couldn’t afford on a military retirement check, sneak far too many Oreo cookies, and witness a sunrise. Her spirits were lifted by the company. So were mine.
Just before I left, my stepdad arrived home from work to take her to the doctor for a checkup, and get her some antibiotics for what she felt sure was a bladder infection. Love hungry and London bound, I ordered a cab to the airport.
It was a markedly quiet ride. I don’t remember music ever even being turned on. But then my cell phone rang. The caller ID said “Mom.” Nothing unusual. This was her regular call to say she missed me already, and I would say the same, because it was true. Instead, when I said hello, my stepdad’s trembling voice rang in my ears: “Your mother collapsed. In the garage. Her heart stopped. The medics got here. They did CPR and revived her, but she isn’t conscious. It’s bad, Lance. It’s really bad.”
I couldn’t process it. My mom was the one who kept everyone else safe and strong. Her tough, stubborn heart didn’t need a stranger’s help to keep going.
Choking out the words, I told the cabdriver what I’d just heard, and bless his heart, he plowed right over the grassy center median and turned back the way we’d come. Soon we heard the siren. Then we saw an ambulance take a left turn off of my mom’s road, racing away from us toward the local Manassas hospital.
Just like my mom, when things get bad, I get quiet. The worse they get, the more silent I become. The cabdriver looked back. I hadn’t taken more than half a breath since I told him to turn around. I must have looked like a ghost. And with far too much peace in his voice for my comfort, he said, “What is meant to be now, will be.”
I started to shake. Until then, I hadn’t considered that she might die. Everything I’d ever built was thanks to that stubborn heart of hers, and there it was, racing away from me in the back of an ambulance. Suddenly, I didn’t know if I’d ever again feel the warmth of her hand, know the might of her will, or stand atop the foundation she’d built for our family with the strength of her steel-clad spine.
My mom had grown up in the South. Louisiana and Georgia. She had been deeply religious. Baptist, then Mormon. She had worked for the U.S. military. She had voted for Ronald Reagan and Bush Senior. I now had spent decades living in that wicked city she’d refused to let us set foot in when I was thirteen. I had gone into the arts. Heck, I’d outright fought for progressive causes like marriage equality. To outsiders, in this day and age, my mom and I should have been enemies. Our house should have been divided—North versus South, red versus blue, conservative versus progressive, coasts versus mountain or plains, or however you choose to name such tribes. Instead, my mom and I fueled each other. Her oil lit my lamp, and eventually mine lit hers. The tools I learned to wield growing up in her conservative, Christian, Southern, military home were the same ones I’d used to wage battles that had taken me from a broken-down welfare apartment where gunfire sang me to sleep to the biggest stages in the world, and to the front row of the United States Supreme Court to fight for LGBTQ equality.
Although my mom and I had often disagreed politically and personally, she’d led our family by example, instilling in us a can-do attitude that often defied reason—an optimism many would call foolish, ignorant, and naïve, but an optimism that occasionally shocked our neighbors and our world with its brazen veracity. She was my reason.
It’s not something I’ve shared until now, and I know it may sound silly to some, but I had often hoped our relationship was like a pebble thrown into a pond, breaking the surface and sending ripples to the water’s edge. If my mom and I could set foot on the bridges between us, then perhaps our neighbors and those closest to us could too. Perhaps our diverging Americas wouldn’t be doomed to destroy each other the way our news shows and politicians would have us believe. And perhaps more could find a higher plane than politics.
So I let the cabdriver know that I’d pay for any ticket he got, but that if he didn’t push his pedal to the floor, he was asking for a big old can of whoop-ass from yours truly. He didn’t need much convincing. My red eyes had already made the stakes abundantly clear. My mom had to live. Because deep in my gut, I feared a storm was coming. Beyond the headlines of the day, I could just make out the sparks of division catching fire in the disparate places we called home, and I knew that my mom and I had much more to discover and build if we were going to help our neighbors and family weather the terrible schisms this storm would bring.
So I held my zen-like cabdriver’s gaze until he looked back out toward the ambulance that was now racing away from us, and he hit the gas.

Voter enthusiasm isn't much of a problem ahead of 2020 race | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/voter-enthusiasm-isnt-much-problem-ahead-2020-race,"By Steve Benen There are plenty of interesting results in the new national CNN poll , but this was the question that stood out for me.
“How enthusiastic would you say you are about voting for president in next year’s election –extremely enthusiastic, very enthusiastic, somewhat enthusiastic, not too enthusiastic, or not at all enthusiastic?” Among registered voters:
Extremely enthusiastic: 45%
Very enthusiastic: 29%
Somewhat enthusiastic: 15%
Not too enthusiastic: 5%
Not at all enthusiastic: 5%
Just at face value, without any context, that looks pretty impressive. This survey found nearly half of registered voters are already “extremely” enthusiastic about voting in the 2020 presidential race, and when we add in those who are “very” enthusiastic, the total reaches 74%. That’s roughly three-quarters of the electorate.
But to fully appreciate those results, it’s important to compare against previous cycles. Apples-to-apples comparisons are a little tricky – CNN didn’t conduct the poll specifically in late April, the year before Election Day – but we can still get a rough sense of public attitudes from the last several cycles.
In October 2003, for example, more than a year before George W. Bush’s re-election race, 19% said they were “extremely” enthusiastic about voting in 2004, while 34% said they were “very” enthusiastic. Combined, that’s 53%.
In June 2007, more than a year before the open 2008 contest, 29% said they were “extremely” enthusiastic about voting in the next presidential race, while 25% said they were “very” enthusiastic. Combined, that’s 54%.
In March 2011, at roughly this point in the 2012 cycle, 29% said they were “extremely” enthusiastic about voting in Barack Obama’s re-election race, while 30% said they were “very” enthusiastic. Combined, that’s 59%.
And in July 2015, more than a year before the most recent presidential election, 22% said they were “extremely” enthusiastic about voting in Barack Obama’s re-election race, while 26% said they were “very” enthusiastic. Combined, that’s 48%.
In other words, when looking at the latest figures, voter interest in the 2020 race is massive , despite how much time remains in the election cycle.
Is this good news or bad news for Donald Trump? Well, that’s where this gets a little tricky.
The president’s critics might look at the unusually high percentages as evidence of an electorate eager to vote for someone new.
But that’s not quite right. Looking at the crosstabs, 53% of Republican voters are “extremely” enthusiastic about voting next year, while 27% said they were “very” enthusiastic. The same poll found 45% of Democratic voters are “extremely” enthusiastic about voting, while 33% are “very” enthusiastic.
Combined, that 80% of GOP voters who are eager to cast their ballots, while 78% of Dems feel the same way. That looks to me like a recipe for a very competitive race.
It’s easy to assume that Americans won’t care too much about an election until the months immediately preceding it, but this data paints a picture of an electorate that’s eager to cast some ballots.

* The crisis in Venezuela is intensifying: “Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó on Tuesday called for mass anti-government protests and military defections, announcing what he termed the ‘final phase’ in an operation attempting to remove President Nicolás Maduro from office.”
* Making matters a little worse for those seeking asylum : “President Trump on Monday ordered new restrictions on asylum seekers at the Mexican border – including application fees and work permit restraints – and directed that cases in the already clogged immigration courts be settled within 180 days.”
* Erik Prince : “Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday that he will make a criminal referral to the Justice Department for Blackwater founder Erik Prince, claiming that he lied to Congress.”
* I guess Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi isn’t dead : “On Monday, he reappeared, leaning on a cushion with an assault rifle at his side, in a video seeking to rally his followers after the loss of the group’s territory in Iraq and Syria and its execution of one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in years, on Easter in Sri Lanka.”
* Gag rule : “House Democrats moved Monday to block a new Trump administration rule aimed at restricting health-care providers from promoting abortions. Democrats included language in a newly released spending bill that would prevent the rule – termed a ‘gag rule’ by critics – from taking effect, although it was already stayed by a federal judge.”
* The NRA tries to find its footing: “The National Rifle Association’s board spent Monday huddled behind closed doors, capping off an annual meeting that has been plagued by a public power struggle, accusations of extortion and financial mismanagement and news that the New York attorney general is investigating the organization’s nonprofit status.”
* I find it remarkable that the Indonesian capital is sinking : “Indonesia is moving its capital city away from Jakarta, according to the country’s planning minister…. Jakarta, home to over 10 million people, is sinking at one of the fastest rates in the world.”
* It was quite hilarious to see Donald Trump call in to Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo’s show for an interview, only to have Bartiromo struggle to end the conversation – because the president obviously wanted to keep talking and had nothing else to do.

"Adding to Trump's troubles, his emoluments headache gets worse | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/adding-trumps-troubles-his-emoluments-headache-gets-worse,"By Steve Benen The U.S. Constitution includes a once-obscure provision known as the “Emoluments Clause.” As regular readers know , the law is pretty straightforward: U.S. officials are prohibited from receiving payments from foreign governments. Traditionally, this hasn’t been much of a problem for sitting American presidents – but with Donald Trump things are a little different.
After all, this president has refused to divest from his private-sector enterprises, which means he continues to personally profit from businesses that receive payments from foreign governments.
The problem isn’t theoretical: Saudi Arabia, for example, spent roughly $270,000 at Trump’s Washington hotel during one of the country’s lobbying campaigns last year. Some of that money benefited the president.
This legally dubious dynamic has been the target of multiple lawsuits, one of which, as of yesterday, is advancing in ways Trump won’t like. The New York Times reported :
A federal district judge in Washington ruled on Tuesday that congressional Democrats could proceed with a lawsuit claiming that President Trump was violating the Constitution by continuing to profit from his businesses while president.
The decision by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is at least a temporary victory for the president’s critics who assert that he is willfully flouting constitutional bans meant to restrict the ability of any federal official to accept financial benefits from foreign governments.
The specific question under consideration was whether the nearly 200 congressional Democrats who filed the case were right about a core question: does the Emoluments Clause apply to this kind of presidential private-sector venture? Sullivan said it does.
“The Court is persuaded that the text and structure of the Clause, together with the other uses of the term in the Constitution, support plaintiffs’ definition of ‘Emolument’ rather than that of the President,” the judge wrote.
The road ahead is far from clear. After all, there’s more than one legal challenge to the president’s business that’s ongoing, and while each one is testing a legal principle, they’re not all on the same track.
The case that’s the furthest along was filed by the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland, though conservatives on the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals may soon derail that effort. In the meantime, the Justice Department will have to appeal yesterday’s ruling to the D.C. Circuit, which isn’t as conservative, and which is less likely to side with the president.
With the prospect of two appellate courts possibly ruling in different ways on the same question, the odds of the case reaching the Supreme Court improve.
The Times ’ report added, “The consequences are potentially momentous. If either lawsuit moves ahead, Mr. Trump will be forced to disclose financial details of business operations that he has long fought to keep out of public view. If the Justice Department succeeds in stopping them, the president will be vindicated in his decision not to divorce himself from his business empire while in office.”

The Oath with Chuck Rosenberg | NBC News,www.msnbc.com,sports.yahoo.com,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.msnbc.com/theoath,LISTEN TO THE TRAILER What is this? 
Why does Trump keep following the advice of foreign autocrats? | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-does-trump-keep-following-the-advice-foreign-autocrats,"By Steve Benen Pentagon leaders, national security officials, Trump administration lawyers, and a variety of diplomatic officials have all warned the president about designating the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. As the New York Times reported yesterday, Donald Trump seems inclined to do it anyway.
The White House directed national security and diplomatic officials to find a way to place sanctions on the group after a White House visit on April 9 by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, for whom the Brotherhood represents a source of political opposition. In a private meeting without reporters and photographers, Mr. el-Sisi urged Mr. Trump to take that step and join Egypt in branding the movement a terrorist organization.
Such a designation imposes wide-ranging economic and travel sanctions on companies and individuals who interact with the targeted group. The president responded affirmatively to Mr. el-Sisi, saying it would make sense. Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have interpreted that as a commitment, officials said.
The motivations of the Egyptian president are obvious: persuading Trump to label el-Sisi’s opponents as terrorists would strengthen the leadership in Cairo.
The benefits for the United States, however, are harder to identify. So why would the American president signal his support for the Egyptian leader’s recommendation? Especially since officials in the Pentagon and State Department have said the Brotherhood “does not meet the legal definition of a terrorist group and that its designation could have unintended consequences in allied countries where the Brotherhood fields prominent political parties”?
Perhaps because Trump has no idea what he’s doing. As the Washington Post ’s Max Boot noted yesterday, “The paradox of President Trump, as I’ve noted before, is that he is both a supremely skilled con man – and a supremely gullible mark. He is notorious for acting on the advice of the last person he talked to…. Now he has gone from listening to fast-buck artists peddling get-rich-quick schemes to listening to dictators peddling fly-by-night geopolitical schemes.”
It would be less of a problem if this didn’t happen quite so frequently.
Ned Price, an Obama administration veteran and an NBC News analyst, took stock yesterday of how many times we’ve seen the gullible Republican make brash and reckless decisions at the urging of a foreign counterpart, and the list wasn’t especially short.
Price concluded , “The message the world over is clear: Get Trump alone on the phone or in a room and it’s carte blanche, America’s interests be damned.”
One of the foundational questions of the Trump presidency is who, exactly, the Republican is willing to listen to. We know, for example, that Trump has been comfortable ignoring the judgment of GOP leaders in Congress. We also know, because he’s been quite candid on the matter, that he doesn’t trust the judgment of American intelligence agencies.
So whose guidance does the president find reliable? He clearly places enormous value on what he hears from far-right voices in conservative media. Trump similarly loves conspiracy theories peddled by assorted websites on the right.
But perhaps most important is the Republican’s willingness to listen to whichever foreign autocrat happens to be whispering in his ear.

Release of Mueller's letter to Barr does the AG no favors | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/release-muellers-letter-barr-does-the-ag-no-favors,"By Steve Benen We learned overnight that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote to Attorney General Bill Barr in late March, complaining that Barr’s four-page characterization of Mueller’s findings were misleading. We had not, however, seen the full letter.
Now we have . The document, which is surprisingly brief, reached the public this morning, and it’s only four paragraphs long.
The first paragraph referenced some redactions applied to the executive summaries the special counsel’s office prepared, and in the second, Mueller requested that the attorney general release the information, prepared for public review, to everyone. We now know, of course, that Barr ignored that appeal.
The special counsel went on to write :
As we stated in our meeting of March 5 and reiterated to the Department early in the afternoon of March 24, the introductions and executive summaries of our two-volume report accurately summarize this Office’s work and conclusions. The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions. We communicated that concern to the Department on the morning of March 25. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations. See Department of Justice, Press Release (May 17, 2017).
While we understand that the Department is reviewing the full report to determine what is appropriate for public release – a process that our Office is working with you to complete – that process need not delay release of the enclosed materials. Release at this time would alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen and would answer congressional and public questions about the nature and outcome of our investigation. It would also accord with the standard for public release of notifications to Congress cited in your letter. See 28 C.F.R. 609(c) (“the Attorney General may determine that public release” of congressional notifications “would be in the public interest.”).
That’s it. Mueller than signed his name.
And after Barr received this letter, the attorney general proceeded to reject Mueller’s request, leaving Barr’s misleading summary, which “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” the special counsel’s work and findings, as the public’s only source of information, at least until we had access to Mueller’s actual report – at which time Barr’s apparent deceptions came into sharper focus.
I realize that there are some skeptics of the entire Russia scandal who argued in late March that if Mueller had concerns with Barr’s description of the investigation’s conclusions, he would’ve said something. What those skeptics had no way of knowing at the time was that Mueller did say something – in writing.
For their part, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee, responding to the latest reporting on Mueller’s frustration, said through a spokesperson last night, “Recent media reports give us more reason than ever to have confidence in the attorney general by providing insight into how the attorney general and the special counsel successfully collaborated to navigate a very difficult and historically momentous situation.”
There was no indication that they were kidding.

Lindsey Graham admits he hasn't yet read all of the Mueller report | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/lindsey-graham-admits-he-hasnt-yet-read-all-the-mueller-report,"By Steve Benen Attorney General Bill Barr, as you’ve probably heard, is spending the day testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which includes some members who believe the Republican lawyer misled Congress and the public about the contents of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia scandal.
There have already been plenty of fireworks and important exchanges, but there was something Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said – literally in the first minute of the hearing – that struck me as notable.
“The hearing will come to order, and the first order of business is to try to cool the room down. So we’ll see if we can do that. But the attorney general will be testifying here in a bit about the Mueller report. And I want to thank him for coming to the committee and giving us an explanation as to the actions he took and why he took them regarding the Mueller report.
“And here’s the good news; here’s the Mueller report. You can read it for yourself. It’s about 400 and something pages. I can’t say I’ve read it all, but I’ve read most of it.”
Perhaps Graham thought this brief moment of candor would be charming. That’s not how I saw it.
Graham isn’t just some random congressional back-bencher; he’s the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. For that matter, the Mueller report isn’t just some wonky GAO document that’s easy to overlook; it’s a document summarizing the results of one of the most important federal investigations in modern American history.
Indeed, it’s worth emphasizing the fact that only two members of Congress have reviewed a fully unredacted version of the special counsel’s findings – and Graham is one of the two .
And yet, by his own admission, he still hasn’t read the full report, which was made available to him and the rest of the world 13 days ago – a period that included two weekends, when an inquisitive senator with unique responsibilities could’ve caught up on his reading.
“I’m all good, I’m done with the Mueller report,” Graham said last week.
Perhaps, in hindsight, “ done ” was the wrong choice of words.
Look, I’m not unsympathetic. The Mueller report is a rather lengthy document and senators are busy. Lindsey Graham, in particular, has spent quite a bit of time doing television interviews (about the report he hasn’t finished reading), dismissing the importance of the report’s conclusions (despite not having finished reading it), and drawing conclusions about Mueller’s findings (before reading all of Mueller’s findings).
But when I say it’s Graham’s job to care about the details of the special counsel’s report, I’m being quite literal. The chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee has a responsibility to read the National Intelligence Estimate; the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee has to read the farm bill, and the chair of the Judiciary Committee has to read documents like the Mueller report.
Stuff like this is in the job description.
Except, Graham hasn’t gotten around to doing his homework in between interviews about his indifference to the document’s findings. (On CBS’s “Face the Nation” a few days ago, the South Carolinian repeatedly said, “ I don’t care ” about evidence of Donald Trump possibly having committed obstruction of justice.)
Graham specifically called a hearing with the attorney general to discuss the Mueller report. Was he really so incurious that he couldn’t bring himself to actually read the document?
