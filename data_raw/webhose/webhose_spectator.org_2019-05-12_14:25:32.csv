The Architecture of Self-Hatred,spectator.org,Matthew Omolesky,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-architecture-of-self-hatred/,"by Paige Lambermont When President Donald Trump described the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as “terrible” and “one of the ugliest buildings in the city,” as he reportedly did in the mid-summer of 2018, one could be forgiven for thinking that he had merely been giving voice to a commonly-held truism. After all, the J. Edgar Hoover Building that looms over Pennsylvania Avenue has routinely been excoriated in architectural circles, with Wolf Von Eckardt aptly describing it as “ a drab factory ” altogether “alien to the spirit of the capital,” owing mainly to its “overly dramatic and utterly miscarried play of forms.” Paul Goldberger deemed it “an arrogant, overbearing concrete form that dares the visitor to come close,” while Arthur Cotton Moore found that “given its elephantine size and harshness, it creates a black hole. Its concrete wall, with no windows or life to it, is an urban sin.” The FBI headquarters may be the epitome of “federal drab,” as its critics have persuasively argued, but its problems run deeper still, given its structural unsoundness. It is quite literally crumbling in places, with netting occasionally suspended on the Ninth Street facade to ensure the safety of pedestrians below. The building has proven harmful to its environs in an even broader sense, as evidenced by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts’ joint declaration that “the FBI’s security requirements have prevented street-level public uses around the entire block of the J. Edgar Hoover Building between 9th and 10th Streets. The building’s fortress-like presence is exacerbated by security installations, the moat that surrounds three sides of the building, the scale of its architectural features, and the absence of street-level activity.” The adjective “terrible,” it turns out, may not go nearly far enough. Yet the response to the president’s reported comments from members of the architectural and media establishment proved decidedly contrarian. Henry Grabar insisted that the building was being unfairly maligned, and that “in a world wrapped in glass that masks where weight really falls, a big chunk of concrete sometimes just feels honest,” while maintaining that “for liberals, buildings like Marcel Breuer’s headquarters for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington are period pieces that represent an idealistic vision of what government can and should take responsibility for.” Mark Pasnik and Chris Grimley similarly defended the merits of Brutalism, on the grounds that the movement “celebrates the realities of construction and the noble roughness of concrete, with a sense of weighty monumentality and an almost Puritan aversion to applied ornament.” Structures like the J. Edgar Hoover Building, they continued, were meant to express a socially conscious government and ideals of collective democracy that underpinned the Great Society and other political movements of the decade. Monumental architectural forms distinguished government facilities from the common commercial architecture around them, much like a classical building might have in its time. They were forward-looking visions, embracing a belief in the future, rather than miming a whitewashed past glory. Whether a sinister-looking, commerce-stifling Brutalist low-rise, erected at unprecedented expense only to come apart at the seams after a mere four decades in service, ought to serve as the architectural embodiment of the Great Society is a matter perhaps best left to Messrs. Pasnik and Grimley. A rather different image comes to mind, in the form of Jean-Antoine Alavoine’s infamous plaster Elephant of the Bastille, which stood in the French capital from 1814 until its unceremonious disposal in 1846. Originally a wellspring of revolutionary inspiration, the sculpture, like the revolution that inspired it, took a turn for the worse, moldering before the eyes of the increasingly discomfited Parisian populace. Victor Hugo observed that “every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it,” and “there it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded by a rotten palisade,” increasingly “unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker.” The selfsame process has been taking its toll on the J. Edgar Hoover Building — a similarly elephantine, hulking, and now decaying edifice — and whatever cause for self-congratulation it once inspired, whatever sense of a “forward-looking vision” it may have stimulated, all that surely must be exhausted by now, and the same can be said for Brutalism in general. However persistently those like Nikil Saval may assert that “it’s a solace to look back to an era of muscular, public-minded development,” and that the impulse “to shove your face in cement” is “refreshing,” it is hard to avoid the conclusion, when looking at ignoble piles like the increasingly dilapidated J. Edgar Hoover Building, that atrophy has long since set in. “Forward-looking,” “socially-conscious,” “collective democracy,” &c. — it is apparent from such phraseology that Brutalists were and continue to be wholly caught up in political, as opposed to merely aesthetic, considerations. This should not be surprising, given that, as Donald Olsen put it in his 1986 treatise The City as a Work of Art , “architecture is a deliberate artistic creation intended not merely to give pleasure, but to contain ideas, inculcate values, and serve as tangible expressions of systems of thought.” Those ideas, values, and systems become all the more consequential in the case of modern architecture, which ignores the alleged fripperies of pleasure, ornamentation, and often even basic comfort. Modernism is revolutionary at its core, based as it is on the rejection of ornamentation and tradition, and on the intention to reengineer and thereby improve public and private life, so to stand against the Modernist program must be, it is alleged, to stand against progress itself. It was in 1930, in the aftermath of the Werkbund Exhibition in Paris, that the Revue de l’art ancien et mode rne announced that The only really modern nation is that which, clearly understanding future conditions and necessities, has already purged its spirit of all that antiquated hotchpotch known as decorative art. This nation, as is well known, is Germany. A politics of intimidation, of a massive affirmation, the authoritative tone of which commands authority. There is therefore a drive, an economic and political agenda, at the basis of “modern[ist] aesthetic researches.” Such a perverse agenda would ultimately serve Germany — among other nations — very poorly indeed, but it nevertheless attracted a veritable host of architects in search of a new way of living. Five years later Anthony Bertram, in his unsentimental and vaguely sinister book The House: A Machine for Living In , grumbled that “the man who builds a bogus Tudoresque villa or castellates his suburban home is committing a crime against truth and tradition: he is denying the history of progress, denying his own age and insulting the very thing he pretends to imitate.” Never mind that Tudor is, in the words of the late, lamented architectural historian Gavin Stamp, England’s “only real national style,” an “expression of nationalism in architecture — our own national Romanticism — that precedes any equivalents in continental Europe.” On to the refuse heap it goes, for to do otherwise would be a crime against truth and (somehow) tradition, at least according to Bertram his fellow members of the Modern Movement. When the architect Ernest Gimson proved “more responsive to English tradition, and did not despise the forms invented in the past,” he was dismissed by the ideologue Nikolaus Pevsner as an “unrevolutionary spirit.” Likewise did Pevsner attack Sir Albert Richardson’s monumental work at Nos. 25-35 Grosvenor Place in Belgravia as “almost grotesquely reactionary,” while even Dykes Bower’s amiable red-brick Church of the Good Shepherd in Cambridge came in for similar criticism, being dismissed as “embarrassing” and “reactionary to a degree almost unbelievable in 1957-8.” The brilliant, lyrical Sir Edwin Lutyens, for the crime of (in his own words) hewing to the rule “that the measure of man’s architecture was man, and that the rhythm of a building should correspond to the rhythms familiar in human life,” was intentionally and unforgivably written out of Pevsner’s 1943 An Outline of European Architecture . Hence Sir Herbert Baker’s reasonable conclusion, voiced the following year, that the “young modernist, heedless that ‘ modernity ’ is not quality, is inclined to throw over the good as well as what there may be of bad in his heritage, and goes to excess, like all revolutionaries, in his desire at all costs to express himself.” For the zealots of Modernism, any adherence to architectural traditions necessarily threatened the dialectical and historical materialism undergirding much of their theory, and needed to be done away with straightaway. Adolf Loos, in his 1913 diatribe Ornament and Crime , compared architectural decoration to the “immoral” and “degenerate” tattoos of the Papuans — a racist conceit if there ever was one — while equating ornamentation to the scribbling on the walls of latrines. One struggles to imagine even one person of good faith and compos mentis who, upon viewing Sainte-Chapelle, or the drawing room at Arbury Hall, or the Alhambra, or the Ninomaru Palace, or the Khajuraho monuments, or Papuan centipede, frigate-bird, or lakatoi motifs for that matter, would experience such a puerile reaction to the mere existence of ornamentation. But Loos nonetheless concluded that “no ornament can any longer be made today by anyone who lives on our cultural level,” and therefore “freedom from ornament is a sign of spiritual strength.” Charles- É douard Jeanneret, dit Le Corbusier, sought out that same so-called strength, and it was in the grip of revolutionary foment that he declared “a great epoch” to have begun, one powered by “a new spirit,” a “mass production spirit,” with his fellow architects leading the way. Hannes Meyer, another Swiss architect, was prepared to go even further, proclaiming that all tradition was mere Historicism, and that “building is not an aesthetic process” but a “social enterprise,” the “collective affair of the nation.” The Soviets would go on to call this dystopian approach sotsyalny zakaz , or “social procurement,” an experiment which led, in the artist Józef Czapski’s summation, to “the total suppression of any attempt at personal expression of your own experience in your own way,” which in turn “destroyed everything in fine art that did not belong to the official aesthetic canon, or that was not wholly subordinate to the objective of politics.” The type of suppression and destruction Czapski described was not, however, limited to the Soviet sphere, but rather occurred most anywhere the Modern Movement took hold. These Modernist theoreticians, idealistic and misanthropic in equal measure, may have sown the wind, but the architectural whirlwind would only be reaped after the Second World War, and the bud would indeed yield precious little meal, particularly in Great Britain, which became a kind of laboratory for Brutalist architects. It was on April 24, 1942, less than a month after British Royal Air Force incendiary bombs had reduced the German port city of Lübeck, known for its distinctive half-timbered medieval buildings, to smoldering rubble, that the Nazi Baron Gustav Braun von Sturm declared that “We shall go out and bomb every building in Britain marked with three stars in the Baedeker Guide . ” Between April and June, the German Luftwaffe conducted its infamous “ Baedeker raids ” against Exeter, Bath, Norwich, York, and Canterbury, destroying some 50,000 buildings, while keeping up its more practical campaign against strategic locales like London, Southampton, Birmingham and Coventry. For William George Hoskins, an Exeter-born historian, there “could not be a more powerful illustration of the utter folly of war, of the fact that as any war goes on the barbarians always get the upper hand and the voice of reason and magnanimity is gradually shouted down by those warped beings who have the lust to destroy” than these symbolic tit-for-tat bombings. But Julian Huxley, the self-styled humanist internationalist, was inclined to look on the situation optimistically. “The blitz has been a planner’s windfall,” he declared , for “not only did it do a certain amount of much-needed demolition for us, but — more important — it made people of all walks of life realize that reconstruction was necessary, and what it might mean if it were properly planned. After long negative years of frustration, the whole temper of Britain has become positive and forward-looking.” The post-war reconstruction of British society would be achieved largely through the creation of a welfare state, via the Family Allowances Act of 1945, the National Insurance Act of 1946, and the National Health Act of 1948, but it would also be achieved through measures including the sweeping Town and Country Planning Act of 1947. The post-war property boom of the 1950s, enabled by cooperation between municipal authorities and private developers, would quickly transform British inner cities. Damaged buildings would not be repaired, and even intact heritage sites would be swept away in favor of cheap Modernist and largely repulsive Brutalist developments. Lionel Brett, 4 th Viscount Esher, an architect and town planner, advocated on behalf of the new ideal city, with its “inner relief road feeding multi-story car parks, a pedestrian shopping mall and lettable office slabs that paid for it all.” The downside, he acknowledged, was that such plans might “wreck a cathedral city like Worcester,” but the planners were not to be stopped. The “city of tomorrow” envisioned by the Le Corbusier, purged of the vestiges of the past, was at last within reach, and what Gavin Stamp called a “visceral and blinkered rejection of the dark but substantial legacy of the Victorians — fuelled in part by a crude Socialist vision — that… amount[ed] to little more than civic self-hatred” was given free rein. Soon Bauhaus-inspired architects like Sir Basil Spence, Richard Seifert, John Bancroft, Sir Frederick Gibberd, and Ernö Goldfinger were vomiting up monstrosities like the Knightsbridge Barracks. Though described in Country Life as “dramatically modern and uncompromising” — not necessarily a good thing — those infamous Barracks were more accurately captured by the words of A.A. Gil, who wrote that the architect Spence had “managed to construct vertical bomb damage out of horizontal bomb damage,” and that is the truly baleful legacy of Brutalism in Britain as elsewhere. It is unsurprising that architecture quickly became a topic of roiling public controversy, another front in the new culture war. As early as 1951, Winston Churchill was castigating the Modernist Festival of Britain site on London’s South Bank as “three-dimensional socialist propaganda,” but the restyling of Britain’s built environment only picked up speed. Colin Amery and Dan Cruickshank, in their 1975 The Rape of Britain , would lament the “officially-sponsored competition to see how much of Britain’s architectural heritage could be destroyed in thirty years,” an argument that appealed to the Prince of Wales, who later describe d a proposed addition to the National Gallery as “a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a well-loved friend.” Such sores would come to pockmark modern British cities, and the consequences were not merely aesthetic in nature. The year The Rape of Britain was published, J.G. Ballard likewise produced his novel High Rise , with its memorable depiction of that “huge machine designed to serve, not the collective body of tenants, but the individual resident in isolation,” a machine which soon breaks down, leading to “rival clans,” deserted concourses, and an architect obliged to sick Alsatians on his “rebellious tenants.” Within a decade Alice Coleman, in her magisterial Utopia on Trial , would breathe further life into the debate over post-war architecture with her account of the disastrous, and entirely non-fictitious, social consequences of post-war social housing developments. These traditionalist arguments were by no means novel. The Countess of Pomfret, back in 1740, wrote that she was always glad to hear of any remains of the old English grandeur; and am both amazed and provoked when I hear of people destroying those magnificent structures (made to last for ages) in order to erect some trifling edifice, whose chief merit consists in the vast expence, which often renders the builder unable to inhabit it when he has done; — whereas to repair an abbey or castle in the same way as it was first built, is a worthy monument both of the owner’s piety to his ancestors, and care to his posterity. But these are worn-out virtues, and hardly live in memory. (Naturally, the countess’s own Pomfret Castle, an extraordinary townhouse built in London’s Arlington Street in 1760, and designed by the wonderfully-named Stiff Leadbetter, was torn down in 1934 to make way for a block of flats done up in an unremarkable mock- Monte Carlo style.) But even a pessimist like the Countess of Pomfret could never have foreseen the end result of decades of “ruthless arrogance and blinkered ignorance,” to again cite Gavin Stamp, of “na ï ve utopianism fuelled by a mixture of self-interest and self-hatred,” which was an urban environment prone to decay, featuring a diversity of inarticulate, incoherent, and incongruous architectural idioms, each one more underwhelming than the last. For Peter Hitchens, British architecture, “which once was full of messages of authority and faith, is now lumpish and un-historical. If it embodies the worship of anything, it is the worship of money, power and technology, even of ugliness itself. Compare the Victorian Houses of Parliament to the curious birdcages, rhomboids and garages proposed for the new toy parliaments of Wales and Scotland.” It is easy to forget just how close London came to almost complete ruination at the hands of those post-war planners. Recall how in 1965 the Greater London Council’s development consortium decided to pulverize Covent Garden in toto , and there was, in the words of Alan Powers, “no doubt among the planners and designers that a dense tangle of walkways between megastructure-like blocks of housing and offices, with urban motorways running at intervals, was the only alternative to the existing built fabric.” Although the GLC failed to rip out the beating heart of the great metropolis, the planners did succeed in destroying such landmarks as the Philip Hardwick-designed Doric propylaeum that once graced Euston Station, an act of vandalism dubbed the “Euston Murder,” and one very nearly repeated when British Railways sought to demolish St. Pancras and King’s Cross, before being thwarted by the impassioned advocacy of Sir John Betjeman and the Victorian Society. One is reminded of Victor Hugo’s advice, upon being asked to support the razing of a medieval structure in favor of a modern development: “Demolish the tower? No. Demolish the architect? Yes.” Perhaps we are making some progress of that front. In late 2016 the UK Minister of State for Transport John Hayes announced a plan for the rebuilding of the Euston arch, on the grounds that “the overwhelming majority of public architecture built during my lifetime is aesthetically worthless, simply because it is ugly,” and that Brutalist structures “cling to a tired desire to shock, a sad addiction to the newness of things.” The resuscitation of the arch might then represent, according to Hayes, “the vanguard of a renaissance” in architecture. The fact that such a move is even being considered is in large part thanks to the unceasing work of Roger Scruton, the English philosopher who has so eloquently described the West’s “flight from beauty,” indeed the “desire to spoil beauty, in acts of aesthetic iconoclasm,” in a world “mired in kitsch and desecration.” It was Scruton who, in November of 2018, was appointed to head the UK Government’s Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, as part of a much-needed Tory effort to “promote better design and style of homes, villages, towns and high streets” while avoiding the “style-less vernacular, typified by the glass curtain-wall and the ferroconcrete cube,” that “purely functional idiom [that] gave rise to buildings that are no sooner built than they are on the way to dereliction.” Just as forceful an advocate has been James Stevens Curl, whose treatise Making Dystopia: The Strange Rise and Survival of Architectural Barbarism , published in late 2018, has done much to puncture Modernism’s “fabricated narratives that were swallowed whole by the gullible.” Curl’s exhaustive account was inspired in part by a classroom encounter, well worth quoting in its entirety: I recall reading essays by students, all of which claimed that the Glasgow School of Art contained nothing derived from period styles, something I knew was untrue. When I questioned the students it was clear they had all lifted this uncritically from Pevsner’s Pioneers , so I asked them each in turn if they had ever seen the building, or bothered to study pictures of it. One had “seen” the building, and a few admitted to having glanced at the photograph in Pevsner’s book, but none had actually studied it and tested the evidence of what could be viewed in the image against what Pevsner had claimed for the architecture. When I showed them good, comprehensive, clear photographs of the building, picking out details, comparing them with images of Art-Nouveau details and canted bay-windows from English vernacular buildings, and then displayed a photograph of Lutyens’s house known as Le Bois des Moutiers, they were profoundly shaken, but it taught them a salutary lesson: to check statements made against what could actually be seen, and not to take printed opinions by polemicists as truths without testing them. Many thanked me later for what to them at the time was a shocking revelation. Curl wonders whether this abject state of affairs has resulted from “having a word-based culture rather than a visual one,” or perhaps it is “intellectual idleness or mere cowardice in being unable to see facts for what they are,” or even “the result of brainwashing and indoctrination,” or some combination of all of these. The same factors are very much in evidence in other academic fields, and in most every other walk of life to boot, but it is all the more distressing in the case of architecture, given that we are obliged to look at, live with, or even live within the ghastly consequences. Rather than grapple in any meaningful way with the arguments being advanced by Stamp, Scruton, Curl, and other past or contemporary critics of Modernism, defenders of the architectural status quo seem to have settled for a particularly clumsy application of reductio ad Hitlerum . “The far right,” Henry Grabar informs us, “appears to be leading a broader backlash against architecture self-evidently built with 20th-century technology. Such structures, in addition to their perceived deviance from the ‘Western traditions’ venerated by American fascists, represent the tastes and lifestyles of America’s treacherous urban elite.” Hettie O’Brien, meanwhile, contends that the “laconic celebration of Anglo-European heritage descends into something more troubling – the protection of a nativist social order,” and that the notion of “beauty” is “is infused with connotations of blood, soil and a Volk . ” It hardly needs to be stated that any search through Stamp’s Anti-Ugly: Excursions in English Architecture and Design , or Curl’s Making Dystopia , or Scruton’s The Classical Vernacular: Architectural Principles in an Age of Nihilism , will produce absolutely no mention of Blut und Boden . Lumping preeminent figures like Betjeman, Stamp, Scruton, and Curl together with negligible fringe like Identity Evropa is a particularly egregious sleight of hand, and bad faith disputation of this type rather puts one in mind of the proverbial hit dog hollering. It should not even need to be stated that there is nothing remotely fascistic about lamenting the aesthetic shortcomings of London’s 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed “The Gherkin), or Kraków’s hideous Unity Tower (much derided as “ Szkieletor ,” or “Skeletor”), or Barcelona’s Torre Glò ries (better known as “ El S upositori ”). There is nothing fascistic about finding the humor, as Tom Wolfe did in his brilliant From Bauhaus to Our House (1981), in a Long Island summer home that has “so many pipe railings, ramps, hob-tread metal spiral stairways, sheets of industrial plate glass, banks of tungsten halogen lamps, and white cylindrical shapes” that it “looks like an insecticide refinery,” or that our children attend schools that distinctly resemble a “duplicating-machine replacement-parts wholesale distribution warehouse.” And there is nothing remotely fascistic in bemoaning the failure of experiments like St. Louis’ Pruitt – Igoe housing project (which had to be demolished in the mid-1970s), or the Espaces d ’ Abraxas , in Noisy-le-Grand (which was completed in 1983 and promptly, and appropriately, used as a shooting location for Terry Gilliam’s dystopian film Brazil ). How much more humane is the approach of Roger Scruton, who suggested in the pages of the Spectator (UK) in February of 2019 that Our need for belonging is part of what we are and it is the true foundation of aesthetic judgment. Lose sight of it and we risk building an environment in which function triumphs over all other values, the aesthetic included. It is not that there is a war of styles — any style can prove acceptable if it generates a real settlement, and the point is recognised by a great range of contemporary architects, and not only by those committed to some traditional grammar. The issue is no longer about style wars but about a growing recognition of the deep truth that we build in order to belong. It is an absolute calumny to brand such a laudable, beneficent, and open-minded initiative as “fascistic,” or “far-right,” or even as mere snobbish Nimby sentimentalism, and when one looks out at the various Mietskasernen , the “rental barracks” or “cemeteries for the living” thrown up over the course of the last century, one can also see just how counterproductive such a venomous response is. Yet bad faith may only account for one motivation for such insufferable argumentation. A guilty conscience is likely at work as well. We have already seen how Modernists saw the potential of the “politics of intimidation” and the “authoritative tone of which commands authority,” as well as the totalitarian tendencies of Le Corbusier, Meyer, and company. As Curl has demonstrated, Le Corbusier in particular had fascistic inclinations, and in his inaptly-titled book La Ville Radieuse (1935), “included a picture of a Fascist rally in Venice captioned ‘little by little the world approaches its destiny’. In ‘ Moscow, in Berlin, in Rome …the masses gather around a strong idea’, the ‘strong idea’ being kow-towing to an authoritarian r égime .” Even Pevsner was not immune to this impulse, having written of the Modern Movement that “because it is a genuine style as opposed to a passing fashion, [it is] totalitarian,” the latter word tellingly altered in a posthumous 2005 edition of his work to the more palatable “universal.” We know that fascist Italy wholeheartedly embraced Modernism, and the Italian Rationalists embraced Mussolini just as ardently; in fact, as Emily Zsarko has noted, “fascist architecture is reflectively modern,” and “of all branching styles of modern architecture, fascist architecture is most reminiscent of brutalism.” F.A. Gutheim, in his 1933 article “Architecture and the Nazis,” even saw evidence of Nazi architects shifting away from sentimentalism and fingerspitzengef ü hl , given that “the Bauhaus has been a great and steadily growing educational influence.” Taking it one step further, Léon Krier has argued that the “ barbaric crimes ” of the Nazis “were not committed in a monumental environment but in demeaning industrial barracks and camps,” with the lesson being that “industrial civilization is unable… to create meaningful and beautiful places. It erects suburbs, zones, transportation systems… and concentration camps. It is always concerned with mass housing… mass transport… and mass extermination. Auschwitz-Birkenau and Los Angeles have the same parents. ” It is simply not possible to maintain, against all evidence, the facile position that Traditionalism : Fascism :: Modernism: Liberalism, or some such analogy. Never forget that it was Philip Cortelyou Johnson, the distinguished Modernist architect and curator of MoMA, who was notorious for having embraced fascism earlier in life, writing in his disgraceful essay “A Dying People” that “the philosophy of individualism and materialism is eugenically bad,” for “it leads us only to the satisfying of the immediate physical desires of each individual, not to the satisfying of the imperatives of racial maintenance.” Horrifically, Johnson would find the bombing of Warsaw and Modlin as “a stirring spectacle,” and then later in life describe the inspiration for his renowned Glass House as “a burnt wooden village I saw once where nothing was left but foundations and chimneys of brick.” Once again, vertical bomb damage was resulting from the horizontal variety, but this did not stop Johnson from becoming, in his biographer Mark Lamster’s words, the “urbane public face of the American architecture Establishment,” just as Le Corbusier, who lauded totalitarianism and desperately courted the Vichy régime, became the face of the Congr ès internationaux d’architecture moderne , along the way advancing the cause of “architecture as a social art” in the most pernicious way possible. We are now being told in all seriousness that it is refreshing to have our faces shoved in cement, or that there is nobility in the roughness of raw concrete, but it is clear that Brutalism in particular is the architectural manifestation of Orwell’s “boot stamping on a human face — forever,” albeit in concrete and gabion instead of canvas and rubber. And yet somehow a profile of Roger Scruton’s role on the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission will invariably include paragraph after paragraph of waffle about fascism. Aside from bad faith and guilty conscience, such strident if unconvincing defenses of Modernism generally, and Brutalism specifically, may stem from a gnawing awareness that the decline of architecture, alongside the decline of the plastic arts and more besides, strongly implies that the “Arc of History” does not always bend towards beauty. As Victor Hugo — so helpful a guide in these matters — rightly held, “ le progrès est le moteur de la science; l’idéal est le générateur de l’art. ” Increasingly in thrall to kitsch and iconoclasm, we have thrown up dystopian structures all around us, many of which are barely fit for purpose. We have filled art museums with installations that, as Jonathan Meades put it in his 2018 documentary On Jargon , “have nothing to say” and are as “challenging as a poached egg,” but which “sell for millions” thanks to the patronage of the “international establishment,” that “super-haute bourgeoisie which is rich enough, gormless enough, and boastful enough” to do so. Across the board we have embraced what Milan Kundera called the progressive “uglification of our world.” Pointing out this devolution, however distressing its implications, does not make one a totalitarian. But forcing someone to reside in a dismal Mietskasernen, in a “machine for living in,” or G-d forbid in Pruitt – Igoe , all the while informing them just how delicious a concrete punch to the face can be — that actually does. There are some faint glimmers of hope in this regard. Curl notes in Making Dystopia how the 2017 Grenfell tower-block catastrophe in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea was brought about by the use of béton brut covered in a kind of dangerous cladding used to “hide stained, ugly concrete,” and how the Lord Palumbo, otherwise a friend of Modernism, afterwards admitted that the “deficiencies” of such structures “go far beyond the problem of cladding,” and that the planners and architects of these estate, whatever their intentions, have led us “to a hell of atomized communities and crime-ridden dystopias.” Roger Scruton, during a debate held at Central Saint Martins on January 24, 2019, put it rather more succinctly: “If it [Grenfell] hadn’t been so ugly to begin with, the whole problem would never have happened.” So perhaps the scales are indeed falling from at least some of our eyes, though it must be stressed that we have been here before. On May 16, 1968 the Ronan Point tower-block in East London, which had been shoddily thrown together out of pre-fabricated, pre-cast concrete, partially collapsed a mere two months after its completion, when a gas explosion took out a number of load-bearing flank walls. The event led to the Griffiths inquiry and the 1972 publication of the Department of Environment consultation report, “How do you want to live?” Here we arrive at the only question worth asking, and one wonders whether the collective answer truly was that we prefer to live and work in and amidst structures marked by “an almost Puritan aversion to applied ornament,” forever subject to the strict requirements of “ social procurement ” and “ social enterprise ,” which in a more sensible age would have been dismissed as “ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker.” The 19th-century architect Eug ène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc , who did so much to restore the landmarks of medieval France, once pondered whether art was barbarous in its youth or in its decrepitude, a question still worth asking given the subtitle of James Stevens Curl’s recent book. Individuals and nations, Viollet-le-Duc determined, may exhibit barbarian tendencies in their youth, but are likely to “fall back into barbarism when those springs are worn out which, while they serve to unite these bodies, establish harmony and an equal balance between their different parts; just as the old man, whose organs cease to perform their functions with regularity, falls into a second childhood and no longer enjoys the full use of his faculties.” As this civilizational dementia becomes more and more in evidence — a collective sinking giggling or scowling into the sea, as the case may be — at least there remain those like Curl, who rightly urge a “complete change of direction in architectural education” and architectural awareness, and those like John Hayes, who sees the restoration of Philip Hardwick ’s Doric propylaeum as the beginning of an architectural renaissance. D um vita est, spes est , and perhaps the best place to start would be a return to the source of the so-called “heroic age of conservation,” namely the manifesto of the Anti-Ugly Action, which was promulgated by students at the Royal College of Art in October of 1958. The famous clarion call of the Anti-Uglies, which demanded the “erection of lively modern architecture,” “the preservation of anything worthwhile, from the countryside to individual buildings,” and the “petitioning [of] councils etc. who erect rubbish,” is as reasonable and relevant today as it was three generations ago, though admittedly much has been lost and much inflicted in the meantime. If architecture is, as Robert Arthur Morton Stern has asserted, “a meditation of the present on the past but also a speculation of the present on the future,” then we have a great deal to be concerned about, but a great deal more upon which to draw. And if the choice that faces us is one between a world of ornament and a world of béton brut — the former in all its sublimity and fecundity, the latter with its structures so loathsome and dystopian that tongue, ink, and pixel can hardly suffice — then we should acknowledge what is at stake and strive all the more to organize our built world accordingly."
Father Hesburgh of Notre Dame: An American Patriot,spectator.org,James Thunder,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/father-hesburgh-of-notre-dame-an-american-patriot/,"by Matthew Omolesky
F ather Wilson D. (“Bill”) Miscamble has authored a 400-page biography, American Priest : The Ambitious Life And Conflicted Legacy of Notre Dame’s Father Ted Hesburgh . Catholic Hesburgh, born in 1917 a few days apart from Catholic John F. Kennedy, had the same ambition — to aspire to be the best, and to be accepted by the American public and establishment. Both men had achieved this goal by 1960.
It can be difficult in 2019 to bring to mind the world in which both men grew up. It was an America in which the WASP establishment (WASP is a term very rarely used these days; it means “White Anglo-Saxon Protestant”) had long discriminated in education (and jobs, etc.) against Catholics, Italians, Irish, Poles, Germans, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and African-Americans. Fr. Hesburgh’s long and broad acceptance by the public and establishment, his public service to the country he loved, started with his appointment by President Eisenhower in 1954, at age 37, to the National Science Board. Ultimately, he was appointed by nine presidents 16 times between 1954 and 2001. He appeared on the cover of Time (1962), LBJ awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1964), Congress awarded him its Gold Medal (2000), his portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery (2007), and he appeared on a postage stamp (2017).
Fr. Hesburgh’s 35-year tenure as president of the University of Notre Dame (1952-1987) and a life of 97 years (1917-2015), makes researching a biography daunting. The “essential basis” of this book are 30 hours of Fr. Miscamble’s interviews of the subject in June 1998. Miscamble had come to Notre Dame from Australia in 1976 for a doctorate in history, had entered Fr. Hesburgh’s religious Order (Holy Cross/CSC) in 1982, and had joined the history faculty at Notre Dame in 1988. He was chair of the History Department when he obtained Hesburgh’s consent in 1994 to a biography that would offer a critical evaluation of his life. His critical evaluation is not like the accolades Hesburgh received upon his retirement or upon his death or in the current 100-minute documentary film Hesburgh (showing, for example, May 3-9, in D.C. at AMC Georgetown) .
In the first half of the book, Fr. Miscamble evaluates Fr. Hesburgh’s presidency of Notre Dame. Here is an example of Fr. Miscamble’s positive evaluation. Looking back in 1977 after Fr. Hesburgh’s 25 years as president, Miscamble writes:
Somehow he had navigated Notre Dame through the student and sexual revolutions, the divisions over the Vietnam War, the challenges to authority of all sorts including within the university, the widespread disillusionment with most social and political institutions, and the upheaval in the [post-Vatican II] Catholic Church. It surely must be judged a bravura performance and one not equaled by any of his contemporaries. That he did this while maintaining a full range of outside involvements including with the [International Federal of Catholic Universities], the Civil Rights Commission, and the Rockefeller Foundation only adds to the virtuoso quality of his accomplishment.
I add the observation that, when other universities were shedding ROTC during the tumultuous campus unrest associated with the Vietnam War, Fr. Hesburgh kept all three branches of ROTC: at a high of 1,600 students in the late ’60s; and a low, but significant number, of 442 in 1974. Moreover, Notre Dame played all three service academies in football in 1969 and 1973, two in ’70 and ’72, and Navy every year.
The title of the book reflects Fr. Miscamble’s findings that Fr. Hesburgh provided a “conflicted legacy” for a university that holds itself out as Catholic. While Fr. Hesburgh aspired from day one of his presidency to make Notre Dame a great, indeed the greatest, Catholic university in the modern (that is, post-medieval) era, Fr. Miscamble describes in detail Fr. Hesburgh’s estrangement from Pope Paul VI and from Pope John Paul II. Furthermore, Fr. Hesburgh paid no attention to the undergraduate curriculum while those he appointed eroded its Catholic content and he failed to ensure that the faculty would support the university’s Catholic mission. Fr. Miscamble dissects Fr. Hesburgh’s leading role in promulgating two documents, both in 1967. One established the independence of the university from the religious Order that had founded it 125 years earlier in 1842. The other was the “Land o’ Lakes Statement” issued by a small group of Catholic university leaders he gathered at that university-owned site which asserted the independence of all American Catholic universities from their Catholic bishops (the hierarchy). (He did the same for all Catholic universities worldwide in the 1972 The Catholic University in the Modern World issued by the International Federation of Catholic Universities (of which he was chair, 1963-70).)
In the second half, Fr. Miscamble puts Fr. Hesburgh’s various roles off campus in historical context and describes the relationships he had with many people, including our presidents. He assesses Fr. Hesburgh’s effectiveness in his roles. (I mean his effectiveness in the work at hand. Hesburgh was always effective in networking to the benefit of his reputation and that of the university.) Of Fr. Hesburgh’s many off-campus activities, I count 14 (with the Civil Rights Commission being three of them) that Fr. Miscamble evaluated which involved service to the United States. (For the sake of limiting the scope of this essay, I am not including such activities as serving as founding co-chair of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics (1989-2001), member, and chair, of Board of Overseers of Harvard (1990-1996), and Catholic Church activities.) Here’s my recapitulation of Fr. Miscamble’s analysis. I provide the number of board or commission numbers because it seems to me Fr. Hesburgh did better with smaller groups. But then who wouldn’t?
Virtually Nonexistent Contribution Appointed by Carter: U.S. Ambassador, UN Conference on Science and Technology (1977-79). He headed an 80-member U.S. delegation to conference attended by 5,000. Fr. Hesburgh left “disillusioned.” Private citizen. He resigned in the early 1980s from various positions to allow him more time to focus on nuclear disarmament. This was the time of the “nuclear freeze movement” and the U.S. bishops’ pastoral letter. President Reagan took the wind out of their sails by successfully negotiating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in December 1987. (It is this treaty from which the United States withdrew this year due to a long history of Russian violations.)
Marginal Contribution Appointed by Eisenhower: National Science Board (1954-66). Appointed by Eisenhower: Charter Member, Civil Rights Commission (1958-1959). Much is made of how Fr. Hesburgh gathered the other five commissioners for fishing. Miscamble says the role of the chair, John Hannah, was more important in achieving consensus for the September 1959 report. The report provided “sobering factual confirmation” of the situation. Hesburgh filed a supplemental report with only modest effect. Appointed by Johnson: White House Conference on Civil Rights, June 1966. 2400 attendees. Despite his minimal contribution, the Conference led to the Fair Housing Act in February, 1967.
Effective Contribution Private citizen. He worked with Director Sargent Shriver to make the Peace Corps a reality by proposing the initial project, in Chile, and arranging for the first Volunteers to be trained at Notre Dame in the summer of 1961. Reappointed by Kennedy and Johnson: Member, Civil Rights Commission. The Commission’s second report, of five volumes on housing, transportation, education, employment, voting, and administration of justice, was submitted Nov. 22, 1961, to the “annoyance,” the “irritation,” of President Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Working with President Johnson, Fr. Hesburgh has been called the “architect” of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And he testified before Congress at length in favor of what became the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Appointed by Nixon: Member, President’s Commission on All-Volunteer Armed Forces (“The (Thomas) Gates Commission”) (15 members) (1969-1970). The February 1970 report resulted in legislation whereby the draft expired in 1973. Appointed by Nixon: Chair, Civil Rights Commission (1969-1972). He submitted a report on October 12, 1969. Because of this report, President Nixon fired him on November 13, 1972, less than a week after Nixon’s re-election. Appointed by Ford: Member, Clemency Board (for Vietnam Era Draft Evaders and Deserters) (1974-76). Board members included Charles Goodell, retired Marine Corps Gen. Walt, Vernon Jordan, and former HEW Secretary Finch. They reviewed 21,000 applications. “Hesburgh emerged as the board’s conscience, moving the [eight other] members by his eloquent please and commanding presence.” Private citizen. In August/September 1977 he stimulated Carter to mobilize support and the Panama Canal Treaties were ratified in spring, 1978. Appointed by Carter: Member, Presidential Commission on the Holocaust (24-member). Established in November, 1978, it submitted its report in September, 1979. Fr. Hesburgh was named to the much larger U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. The museum opened in 1993. Appointed by Carter: Chair, Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy (a/k/a “Hesburgh Commission”) (1979-1981). There were 16 members, consisting of four Cabinet heads and four presidential appointees including Secretary of State Muskie and Attorney General Civiletti, two Democratic senators (Ted Kennedy was one), two Republican Senators (Alan Simpson was one), and four Representatives, two from each Party. Its report of thousands of pages was submitted on the last day Carter was in office. He continued to work the issue during the Reagan Administration and the Immigration Reform and Control Act (Simpson-Mazzoli) became law in November, 1986. Private citizen. Cambodia humanitarian crisis after Pol Pot and Vietnamese invasion (1980). Fr. Miscamble says his work was “stellar.” He influenced Carter Administration to act.
Hesburgh believed that university presidents, and universities, should be involved in the great issues of the day, as he was with civil rights, science, immigration, the environment, ecumenism, nuclear disarmament, amnesty, election monitoring, and more (but not abortion). The current generation of university presidents, private and public, should be able to draw much inspiration from Fr. Hesburgh’s life.
Fr. Hesburgh was always a priest. Always wore his Roman collar. Always gathered people together. One of the most amazing stories Fr. Miscamble tells is when Vice President-Elect Nixon asked to attend the USC-Notre Dame game, November, 1952. Fr. Hesburgh hosted. After the afternoon game was over, Fr. Hesburgh spent some hours with him and his wife. Fr. Hesburgh asked him if he had ever seen a confessional. Since he hadn’t, Fr. Hesburgh invited him to walk over to the church (adjacent to the building in which they were conversing) where he showed him a confessional and invited Nixon to enter, and then to kneel, while Fr. Hesburgh, sitting in the booth used by priests, explained the process of Confession. No doubt, Nixon was more acquainted with Catholicism after that one conversation with Fr. Hesburgh than President Clinton was in four years at Georgetown.
Fr. Hesburgh said Mass daily wherever he was, inviting whomever he was with, including Soviet officials, to attend. He was always pastoral. Here’s my favorite example: You will recall that, on December 5, 2018, former President George W. Bush movingly eulogized his father, speaking of his fatherhood. It is no wonder that a quote of Fr. Hesburgh resonated with his father. When then-President George H.W. Bush delivered the commencement address at Notre Dame in May, 1992, he used it. I have not yet found a report of it earlier than a January 1963 issue of the Reader’s Digest: A married man, a student or alumnus, asked Father Hesburgh what was the greatest gift he could give his children. Father replied, “Love their mother.”"
"After Rapid Rise, Michael Avenatti Sees Inevitable Fall",spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/after-rapid-rise-michael-avenatti-sees-inevitable-fall/,"by Matthew Omolesky
Washington
Last week, federal prosecutors released a 61-page indictment against attorney Michael Avenatti, who allegedly bilked his own clients to bankroll his lavish lifestyle. Last month, federal prosecutors in New York charged him with trying to extort millions from Nike.
Avenatti says he is not guilty, and he is entitled to a presumption of innocence on criminal charges. Still, his rise and fall presents an apt moment to ask how such a feral figure was so quickly elevated in the public eye, before what seems to be an inevitable fall.
It’s not a long story. In 2016, porn actress Stormy Daniels accepted $130,000 in hush money meant to keep her quiet about what she says was a 2006 tryst with now-President Donald Trump, which he incredibly denies.
Around 2018, Daniels came up with a dubious excuse to break the contract, even though she already had pocketed the money — Trump never actually signed the document in which he and Daniels were identified under phony names.
That’s not the sort of case on which most lawyers would want to hang their reputations. But then Daniels found Avenatti, who excelled at lending a pseudo-forensic gloss to what essentially was a money-grubbing enterprise.
The exercise won Daniels a spot on CBS’ 60 Minutes last year, as well as on late-night comedy shows. She is glib, profane, and provides an excuse to air copious cleavage shots. She confirmed the media narrative about Trump’s predatory treatment of women. And her initial claim is believable because it’s hard to see why Trump would pay for her silence if nothing ever happened between them.
Avenatti provided the political-umbrage lipstick for the pig. He was happy to call the hush money an illegal campaign contribution — even if Trump personally bankrolled the payoff. And he seemed downright indignant that anyone might want to silence a client whose silence had been sold.
The shameless attorney quickly became a fixture on cable news because he fed many anchors’ desire to atone for elevating Trump in 2016 — never suspecting that Trump would win not only the GOP primary but also the general election.
But Avenatti didn’t make it on cable because he was so different from Trump, but because he was an anti-Trump, it-takes-one-to-beat-one Democrat who could double as a would-be social-justice warrior.
Indeed, Avenatti even flirted with the idea of running in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.
In August, Joy Behar of The View hailed Avenatti as “the only person Donald Trump fears more than Robert Mueller” and praised him for being “out there saving the country.” The possible primary contender also was introduced to a New Hampshire audience as “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare.”
Just to show how well he could out-trump Trump, Avenatti told Time magazine that Democrats better nominate “a white male” if they want to win in 2020.
That wasn’t the moment that killed Avenatti’s future in politics.
Avenatti overreached in the fall when he demanded an FBI investigation into allegations made by a new client, Julie Swetnick, that she and then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had attended parties where gang-rapes occurred when Kavanaugh was a high school student.
It was a bad story. A witness presented by Avenatti did not corroborate Swetnick’s account. With Swetnick’s accusation discredited, then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti for criminal investigation.
Democrats turned on Avenatti because Swetnick’s story was so clearly false that it tainted the unsubstantiated claims of other Kavanaugh accusers.
But first, according to NewsBusters , Avenatti appeared on CNN 121 times and MSNBC 108 times. Back in May, the Washington Free Beacon ’s David Rutz estimated that the two networks had given Avenatti almost $175 million in earned media.
Now Avenatti is getting heaps of earned media in newspapers — for other reasons.
One Avenatti victim, according to the indictment, was a paraplegic for whom Avenatti negotiated a $4 million settlement. But, the document charged, Avenatti kept all but some $124,000 of the settlement — forcing a paraplegic to live in deeply reduced circumstances.
Avenatti denies any wrongdoing. On Twitter, he blamed the “many powerful enemies” he has made representing “Davids vs. Goliaths.”
He came into public view trying to help an adult-film actress get out of a contract she signed with open eyes. He had little love for the presumption of innocence when he hyped fraudulent charges against Kavanaugh, at a time when the mainstream media seemed ready to run any shady story that ran down the nominee.
After the Nike indictment, Behar said she was sad because she had seen Avenatti as “somebody here who is going to tell some of the truth of this criminal we have running this country.” So don’t expect a lot of introspection from TV newsers.

Obama Judge Compares Trump to KKK | The American Spectator,spectator.org,David Catron,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/obama-judge-compares-trump-to-kkk/,"by William Murchison
When Chief Justice John Roberts pompously admonished President Trump last year, making the preposterous claim that we “do not have Obama or Trump judges,” Carlton W. Reeves evidently failed to get the memo. This Obama appointee to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi is a textbook example of a partisan jurist who ignores the law and the will of voters as expressed through their elected representatives. Indeed, Judge Reeves has now escalated his activism by attacking the President and comparing him to a long line of white supremacist Democrats and their partners in the KKK.
Late last week Reeves visited the University of Virginia to accept the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Medal in Law and used his acceptance speech to launch a thinly veiled attack on President Trump. What did the President do to incur the judge’s wrath? He had the temerity to say aloud what most Americans already believe — that leftist partisans like Reeves have presided over countless perversions of justice and seriously damaged the public’s trust in the judiciary. Evidently in an attempt to shield himself and his fellow travelers from further Trump criticism, Judge Reeves delivered himself of this Orwellian diatribe :
When politicians attack courts as “dangerous,” “political,” and guilty of “egregious overreach,” you can hear the Klan’s lawyers, assailing officers of the court across the South.… And when the Executive Branch calls our courts and their work “stupid,” “horrible,” “ridiculous,” “incompetent,” “a laughingstock,” and a “complete and total disgrace,” you can hear the slurs and threats of executives like George Wallace, echoing into the present.
Judge Reeves neglects to note that the Klan lawyers to whom he refers were, like the man who appointed him — Democrats. Likewise, he fails to mention that George Wallace was a lifelong member of that party (but for a brief stint as an Independent in 1968). Indeed, the Reeves rant is uniquely notable for its omissions, like his failure to mention that the authors of the Southern Manifesto whose echoes he allegedly hears in Trump’s criticisms were also Democrats. He then has the crust to reverently invoke Brown v. Board of Education , the landmark civil rights ruling handed down by a Supreme Court led by a Republican Chief Justice.
It will be obvious to any auditor of the Judge’s speech that he isn’t really worried about civil rights or his fictitious “third great assault on our judiciary” as he styles the President’s frequent criticism of the courts. It’s blindingly obvious that Reeves is far more concerned that the era of leftist judges legislating from the bench is at long last drawing to a close. And he is right to be worried. President Trump and the Republican majority in the Senate are reshaping the federal judiciary at a rate that is making the Democrats very nervous indeed. As Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, points out :
President Trump has delivered 93 federal judges so far, including two Supreme Court justices, 37 circuit court judges, 30 of whom were confirmed during his first two years, and 54 district court judges.… Under this administration, the number of circuit courts with Democratic appointed majorities has fallen from nine to seven. Last month, President Trump flipped the Third Circuit to a Republican appointed majority. He brought the Eleventh Circuit to an even split.
President Trump’s efforts to return the courts to their proper function of interpreting rather than writing statutes comes none too soon, as Judge Reeves’ partisan record demonstrates. An instructive example of his perverse jurisprudence came after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Mississippi legislature passed the Religious Liberty Accommodations Act (H.B.1523) to protect the rights of individuals and organizations to withhold services from such couples if doing so was consistent with “deeply held religious beliefs.” It was promptly signed into law by Governor Bryant.
Predictably, this precipitated a slew of lawsuits. One of these, Barber v. Bryant , landed in Judge Reeves’ court, whereupon he issued an injunction blocking the law the day before it was due to take effect. That an unelected Obama judge would thwart the will of the voters and their representatives was greeted with outrage. The ruling was challenged in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the Reeves injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs had not been personally harmed. Predictably, the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. But SCOTUS declined to hear it, resulting in Judge Reeves’ ambivalence regarding that tribunal:
And that brings us to the Supreme Court. It is no doubt overflowing with wisdom. But it is wisdom drawn from a shallow pool.… We have as many justices who have graduated from Georgetown Prep as we have Justices who have lived as a non-white person.… When our Supreme Court captures such a narrow set of perspectives, what truths will it overlook? What Dred Scotts and Plessys … will be handed down?
This was obviously meant to imply that the predominance on the Court by “persons of pallor,” to borrow a phrase from James Taranto, is a result of what Reeves sees as the President’s racism. The judge later makes this charge explicit: “This Administration and a bare majority of the Senate, walking arm-and-arm, are not stumbling unaware towards a homogeneous judiciary.” The Model Code of Judicial Conduct, as elucidated by the American Bar Association, is meant to uphold the “independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary.” It’s obvious that Judge Reeves falls short in all categories. Yet he has been appointed for life.
Reeves didn’t make his outrageous speech because he cares about racial justice or some imaginary assault on the judiciary. He’s part of the problem Trump and the Republican Senate are trying to fix by filling judicial vacancies with such alacrity. They want the courts to command the respect of the American people, and that will never happen while partisans like Judge Reeves remain embedded in the judicial woodwork. If President Trump can clean out that infestation of hacks, his place among the best Presidents will be secure."
Notre Dame Burns,spectator.org,Melissa Mackenzie,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/notre-dame-burns/,"by William Murchison
U PDATE: My dear editor asked me to add some context to this post.
First, the imagery of the beautiful sky, billowing smoke, shocked faces, and deep sadness feels like 9/11. It feels bigger than the loss of lives and two buildings, or, in this case, a church. It feels like it’s shifting history in real time.
The aforementioned feelings were there before I went and performed a web search of “churches burning in France.” I was stunned to read that there had been multiple desecrations of churches over the last couple of weeks. Had you heard about it? I hadn’t.
Second, I’m not saying that the cause of the Notre Dame fire is terrorism. It’s too soon to know that sort of thing and I wasn’t attempting to imply such. The thought hadn’t even occurred to me, but then I read about other church desecrations and it felt possible, which is terrible.
At the heart of the grief is this: As we approach Passover and Easter and consider how far Christendom has fallen, how few people believe, how secularized the world has become, the burning of the church feels portentous. A visual symbol of the rot. The Church and Christianity is under attack from without and from within. Christianity is viewed as bigoted, closed-minded, and mean. But Christianity is not that. It has been the catalyst for the most beautiful production of art and encouraged the freeness to pursue science. Christianity is self-sacrifice and charity and love toward God and man.
Christianity gives one the structure to lead a whole, happy life and a foundation to weather the worst personal storms. And yet it’s being maligned and true adherents are viewed with suspicion. In France, Jews and Christians, both, endure increased persecution.
And this progressive march to Judeo-Christian annihilation has resulted in nihilistic secularism that substitutes empty sex for love, selfishness for family, addiction for community, consumerism for peace, loneliness for connection. For knowing so much, our generation is woefully ignorant about what matters most and has little frame within which to build a meaningful life. That’s why sad substitutes like climate alarmism, veganism, abortion, and the rest are treated as sacraments. In a post-modern world, they are.
That’s what was going through my mind while watching Notre Dame burn. People are sad and I’m not sure they can even pinpoint why. Somewhere, there’s an echo of what we’ve lost in the West. It’s in the soul of the people, but the memory of it is ephemeral. It’s a feeling of something that was important but can’t be brought to the mind and it’s blowing in the breeze over Paris.
The church can be rebuilt. I’ve read that there are detailed laser plans for it that an art historian took. The antiquities within the church may have been saved and put aside because the church was being renovated. That’s encouraging. But what is more difficult to salvage is the hardened heart, the rotted spiritual corpse.
Western Civilization’s symbols are just that: physical representations that reflect the spirit of man. The church burning is indicative of a much greater loss and that’s what grieves me.
The images from the burning of Notre Dame provoke the same sort of heart-heavy dread as the 9/11 images. The beauty of the sun-shiny day contrasting with the conflagration; the feeling that the world has irrevocably changed for the worse. Loss, sadness.
It feels like we’re witnessing the end of Christianity and Western Civilization. Notre Dame is irreplaceable. No tower can be built in its stead. There will only be a time before and after Notre Dame.
Perhaps this sentiment seems melodramatic. I don’t think so. Look at how the world has changed after 9/11. Look at the civil liberties we’ve lost. We can’t travel without being molested. We worry in the back of our minds at every large gathering. Unthinkable violence is now thinkable, and even routine. We’re more callous to it and tired of it. Terrorism is a part of life in the West. The consequences of terrorism, have shaped all thoughts. Every bad thing that happens, we hope it’s not terrorism. Too often, it is.
How to convey Notre Dame’s cultural impact? It’s the heart of France. It’s a religious and artistic monument. It’s a place of worship. It’s iconic. And it’s gone.
The symbolism can’t be denied. This is the first day of Holy Week. If this fire was purposefully set, the arsonist couldn’t have picked a more perfect time.
As a measure of how little news this made, upon a bit of digging, I found that churches across France have been desecrated in the previous weeks. From Voice of Europe:
Since the beginning of 2019, France has seen a torrent of attacks which have included arson, vandalism, and desecration of a number of its historic Catholic churches.
The defacers have torn down crosses, knocked down tabernacles, smashed statues, and have destroyed the Eucharist, igniting fears of a rise in widespread anti-Catholic sentiment across the country.
On Sunday the 17th of March, just following midday mass, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set ablaze, Newsweek reported. Although nobody was injured, French authorities are currently still looking into the attack, which firefighters have attributed to arson.
Did you know about this? I didn’t. More from Breitbart :
In Lavaur, in the southern department of the Tarn, the village church was assaulted by young men, who twisted one arm of a representation of the crucified Christ to make it appear that he was making an obscene gesture.
In the peripheries of Paris, in the department of Yvelines, several churches have suffered profanations of varying importance, in Maisons-Laffitte and in Houilles.
Although commentators have been reluctant to attach a particular religious or cultural origin to the profanations, they all share an evident anti-Christian character.
In recent months, anti-Semitic gangs have desecrated Jewish cemeteries, signing their actions with swastikas. In the case of the desecration of Catholic churches, the vandalism has spoken for itself: ridicule of the figure of Christ on the cross and desecration of major altars.
The Catholic hierarchy has kept silent about the episodes, limited themselves to highlighting that anti-Christian threat and expressing hope that politicians and police will get to the bottom of the crimes.
Reports indicate that 80 percent of the desecration of places of worship in France concerns Christian churches and in the year 2018 this meant the profanation of an average of two Christian churches per day in France, even though these actions rarely make the headlines.
In 2018, the Ministry of the Interior recorded 541 anti-Semitic acts, 100 anti-Muslim acts, and 1063 anti-Christian acts.
It seems that Notre Dame being purposefully burned would not be out of the question. France is troubled and the church and political leaders seem to be in denial.
The cause of the fire will be found later. The results will be long-lasting and devastating."
America’s Left and the Confiscation of Wealth,spectator.org,J.T. Young,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,"by Veronique de Rugy
America’s conservatives should be those least amazed by our left’s calls for wealth confiscation. The only surprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left’s policies can survive.
As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressively seek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist” sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies.
Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly.
Calls for such blatantly confiscatory policies are still shocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally, such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new “progressivism.” In one sense America’s left is right in its calls: The only shocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them instead silently.
The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must.
The left always starts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and how stringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has.
Depending on place and parlance, the left’s enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of the state.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that’s where the money is.” Initially these strike a blow, but they also stake the left’s expensive spending policies.
But the more the left’s policies are implemented, the more they fall short. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself falls short. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up the shortfall.
The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues.
This observation can be applied to the left’s policies in toto . Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the product subsidized goes into short supply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable.
Given sufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is no shortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and no shortage of this happening economy-wide abroad.
It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left’s reach is unlimited. The only way to square this circle is to take more through confiscation.
Of course, even compulsion can swim only so long against the economic tide — as the drownings of so many socialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able to solve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more.
The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating his seed corn.
Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into the stock he should set aside for next year’s planting. When spring comes, he sows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is even shorter. Repeating the cycle, each year falls shorter and shorter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant.
So it is with the left. It must make up its shortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all fall short. If this sounds preposterous, look back to the left’s own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China’s Great Leap Forward — or simply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation and see their inability to meet demand or be self-sufficient. Without external subsidization, they fail.
This is only new to America. Here, the left’s programs are subsidized from the general budget and the budget shortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incremental steps, accepts its subsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation.
However, America’s New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened it seeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit.
To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left — such confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in the sense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19 th century and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving those subjected to them in misery.
Far from being “progressive” — today’s trendy attempt at rebranding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically.
America has not known this in the sense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not the same. To America’s collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here.
America’s only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact with some crank running for president as a communist or socialist. At best, such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifully shows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time, she has brought friends.
We have emotionally felt that socialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now being so candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance.

The Fleeting Feeling of Freedom,spectator.org,Eric Peters,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-fleeting-feeling-of-freedom/,"by Veronique de Rugy
Every now and then, I do something “risky” and illegal, to remind myself what it was like when we were still relatively free.
I roll one of my old bikes out of the garage and take it for a ride around the backroads near my place without a helmet on.
This used to be legal, once upon a time — on the sound premise that it was your head to break and so your business to risk it. Then it became the business of busybodies and control freaks — aka, “the government,” which passes laws that assert the contrary.
It is important to keep this in mind. That there is no such beast as “the government.” It is a term of manipulation only; a technique for getting people not to think about what government actually is — which is a proportionately small number of busybodies and control freaks who have acquired control over mechanisms — physical and economic punishments — which they use to busybody and control us.
They are — for those who get the reference — Mrs. Kravitz, the nosey next-door neighbor from the ’60s TV sitcom, Bewitched . Only armed and very dangerous. Mrs. Kravitz was the object of ridicule; the armed busybodies and control freaks who constitute “the government” are a mortal threat if disobeyed.
My riding around the backroads near my house on my ’76 Kawasaki Kz900 — one of several bikes made long before the country went on regulatory lockdown and people were still largely free to do as they liked in terms of everyday life — is in and of itself now an offense .
Which is to say, actionable .
Even though I have harmed no one — and even though my riding sans a helmet poses no conceivable threat of harm to anyone else — an armed government worker (the agent of the control freaks and busybodies who constitute “the government”) will fix his sights on me and use the threat of murderous violence to interrupt my ride and then filch my pockets — the proceeds going to fund “the government,” including the salary paid to the proxy enforcers of the control freaks and busybodies who constitute it — to punish me for having the audacity to not place a helmet on my head.
Thus it gives me a very special kind of illicit pleasure to ride without one. To feel not just the wind on my face but the load off my back. What it Used to be Like is brought back to life, however fleetingly. It is very much like the smell of something triggering an ancient memory only better because rather than a memory this is actuality .
There was an effort to dole back just a little of the freedom Virginians once enjoyed — a measure that would have made it legal once again for those over 21 to decide for themselves whether to wear a helmet, very much as those over 21 also get to decide whether to eat their veggies without being nagged — or ticketed — by a government-badged busybody.
Of course it failed.
And so I ride illicitly.
One of my favorite writers was H.L. Mencken and among my favorite sayings of his was that every normal man, at least once in his life, must spit on his hands and hoist the Jolly Roger — i.e., the skull and bones pirate flag. His meaning wasn’t pillage and plunder; it was to spit in the face of Authority — the busybodies and control freaks, who were just getting started in his time.
Mencken never placed much stock in the virtue or intelligence of the average person but I imagine even he would be stupefied into sputtering speechlessness to learn that we now live in a country run by Mrs. Kravitzes, control freaks and busybodies who have become so emboldened by their success that it probably won’t be long before they tell us just how much we’re allowed to eat and what we’re allowed to eat as well as when to eat it.
Indeed, the what part they already do.
This is what comes of not kicking them off our property — and if need be, in their hind parts — if they won’t go away after being told to.
For my part, I rebel when and where I can.
On the ancient Kawasaki, I am free. It is still quicker than most cars — and I am a better rider than most armed government workers are drivers. A blur of green and gold, polished aluminum and chrome. The moan of the four Keihins, gulping air and fuel — and I am gone.
Once upon a time, it wasn’t necessary.
Because once upon a time, Americans were still relatively free.
There were taxes, certainly. And regulations. But in terms of everyday life, the degree of freedom the average person enjoyed as recently as 30 years ago is almost unreal compared with the suffocating, relentless nagging, nudging and micro-managing of everything by control freaks and busybodies.
Those people, that is, who are “the government.”"
Rescue Border Towns and Taxpayers With ‘Remain In Mexico’,spectator.org,Betsy McCaughey,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/rescue-border-towns-and-taxpayers-with-remain-in-mexico/,"by Veronique de Rugy President Trump scored a win on Friday, when a federal appeals court gave a temporary green light to the president’s program called Remain in Mexico . The idea is to keep asylum seekers south of the border until they get their day in court. It’s urgently needed to help border towns like McAllen, Texas, and Las Cruces, New Mexico, which are being overwhelmed. The same critics pouncing on Trump’s call to transport these asylum seekers to sanctuary cities are also opposing his Remain in Mexico program. For these cynical critics, nothing matters but politics. They have no real interest in providing relief to the border towns, American taxpayers, or migrants caught in the chaos. Over 100,000 migrants , including a record number of families with children, were apprehended sneaking across the border in March, many claiming asylum. The border towns are dumping grounds for them once they’re released from detention facilities. They lack food, shelter, or the ability to speak English. Las Cruces city officials put out a call on Saturday for donated blankets, clothing, food, and diapers. Shelters and churches are full, bus stations chaotic, and charities tapped out. McAllen Mayor James Darling begged for a “ solution that does not involve simply dropping them off onto the streets of our city .” But like every option Trump has tried, including detaining migrant families in shelters until their claims are heard, the Remain in Mexico program is being challenged by a cadre of left-wing, open-border lawyers. Its future hinges on a ruling by the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later this week, and perhaps a final decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, migrants scrape together bus fare to escape the mess. If they don’t have family already here, they pick a destination they’ve heard is immigrant-friendly. Word spreads fast about which communities will welcome asylum seekers, house them, and shield them from immigration enforcement. For example, Portland, Maine offers migrants cash welfare, housing, and job training, and is considering letting them vote in local elections. That information has traveled all the way to McAllen’s shelters. Migrants hear Portland is the place to go . Now that Portland’s shelters are overflowing , the same city politicians who boast about welcoming migrants whine that Portland shouldn’t bear the cost. Portland wants all of Maine to pay . Lesson: It’s easy to be big-hearted using somebody else’s money. Cost is behind a lot of the opposition to Trump’s sanctuary city proposal. San Francisco Mayor London Breed denounced Trump’s proposal as “ just another scare tactic ,” implying that anyone opposed to busloads of migrants must be a racist. But race isn’t the issue. What’s actually scary is the cost of sheltering busloads of needy people. As left-wing icon Cher tweeted Monday, “ I Understand Helping struggling Immigrants, but MY CITY (Los Angeles) ISNT TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN .” And why should taxpayers foot the bill, when only about ten percent of migrants from Central America actually qualify for asylum? The rest are scammers. They sneak across the border, tell a border agent they’re afraid to return , and get released inside the U.S. Half never even complete an asylum application . They’ve gotten what they want, jumping ahead of those who wait years to enter legally. Word about how to game the system has spread, and now migrants are coming through the southern border from as far as Angola and the Congo . One Texas resident asked why “ non-border states ” can’t “ help support ” the immigrants with free emergency room services, schooling, and other costly benefits. Truth is, towns across the U.S. already doing that are strained by the cost. Trump’s Remain in Mexico program is designed to alleviate that problem. The more asylum-seekers Mexico shelters, the more money stays in American taxpayers’ pockets. So far only a few hundred have been returned to Mexico . Litigation stalled the effort. Fortunately, the Supreme Court has twice recognized a president’s authority to limit who enters the country, including under the guise of asylum. Trust the high court to uphold the Remain in Mexico program, bringing relief to border towns and U.S. taxpayers everywhere."
Stephen Moore and Herman Cain Are Just What the Fed Needs,spectator.org,Ralph Benko,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/stephen-moore-and-herman-cain-are-just-what-the-fed-needs/,"President Trump’s nomination of Stephen Moore and Herman Cain (full disclosure, both are friends and Moore an occasional professional colleague) to the board of governors of the Federal Reserve has become something of a cause célèbre in Washington.
Moore’s and Cain’s attackers outnumber their defenders. But their defenders have the better argument.
The Cain/Moore mutiny of the Establishment is a perfect microcosm of the existential crisis of modernity. Canadian public intellectual John Raltson Saul called this persistent existential crisis, in his eponymous book, Voltaire’s Bastards . (Penguin Books, 1992.)
That’s shorthand for a misplaced veneration of reason. Venerated reason has not performed nearly as well in practice as in theory. Better call Saul:
The official Left would put most of our problems down to uncontrolled self-interest, as if they still had a clear idea of how to harness self-interest for the general good. The official Right would shrug its shoulders manfully, that is to say cynically, as if to imply that reality is tough. But manful cynicism is probably a disguised form of confused helplessness. And none of these contradictions have anything to do with reality.
…
We are now more than four and a half centuries into an era which our obsession with progress and our servility to structure have caused us to name and rename a dozen times, as if this flashing of theoretically fundamental concepts indicated real movement. The reality is that we have not moved beyond the base ideas of the sixteenth century which, for want of any better description, should be called the concepts of reason. This Age of Reason will soon have been with us for 500 years. With each passing day more ideas, structure and beliefs are hung upon the fragile back of these few concepts.
And yet, even in their early days, they were not ideas of great breadth. What’s more, from birth they were based upon an essential misunderstanding — that reason constituted a moral weapon, when in fact it was nothing more than a disinterested administrative method. That fundamental error may explain reason’s continuing force, because centuries of Western elites have been obliged to invent a moral direction where none existed.
Knowledge, of course, was to be the guarantee of reason’s moral force — knowledge, an invincible weapon which would ensure that society was built upon considered and sensible actions. But in a world turned upon power through structure, the disinterested consideration of knowledge simply couldn’t hold and was rapidly transformed into our obsession with expertise. The old civilization of class was replaced by one of castes — a highly sophisticated version of corporatism. Knowledge became the currency of power and as such as retained. This civilization of secretive experts was quite naturally obsessed not by the encouragement of understanding but by the providing of answers.
This obsession with the providing of answers calls to mind an infamous anecdote about Montagu Norman, the first celebrity central banker, as recalled in Jim Grant’s review of Till Time’s Last Sand , a history of the Bank of England, from its founding in 1694 to the financially turbulent present:
“We have appointed you as our economics adviser,” Montagu Norman, the longest-serving governor of the Bank of England, said to a brainy new hire in the early 1930s. “Let me tell you that you are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it.”
Here within the microcosm of Trump’s announcement of Moore and Cain the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome manifests in two main criticisms. The first horrified indictment is that these candidates would undermine the independence of the Fed. The second is that they lack sufficient academic qualifications for the job.
Neither criticism holds up under scrutiny.
The independence of the Fed is one of the most durable tropes in Washington. It is also almost pure pretense. As Steven Solomon wrote in The Confidence Game: How Unelected Central Bankers Are Governing the Changed World Economy (Simon & Schuster, 1995):
Although they strained to portray themselves as nonthreatening, nonpartisan technician-managers of the status quo, central bankers, like proverbial Supreme Court justices reading election returns, used their acute political antennae to intuit how far they could lean against the popular democratic winds. “Chairmen of the Federal Reserve,” observes ex-Citibank Chairman Walter Wriston, “have traditionally been the best politicians in Washington. The Fed serves a wonderful function. They get beat up on by the Congress and the administration. Everyone knows the game and everyone plays it. But no one wants their responsibility.”
This claim of Fed independence has, to cite Saul, nothing to do with reality. It’s just a shibboleth of a misplaced veneration of what passes for rationality, a rationality that has failed for a generation to contribute to sustained robust equitable prosperity.
When not in the grip of partisan frenzy, the left, the right, and the center (Wriston) actually agree on this point. As a center-left commentator for the Washington Post, Matt O’Brien, trenchantly wrote in “ Yes, the Federal Reserve has enormous power over who is president ”:
The arc of the political universe is long, but it bends towards monetary policy.
That’s the boring truth that nobody wants to hear. Forget about the gaffes, the horserace, and even the personalities. Elections are about the economy, stupid, and the economy is mostly controlled by monetary policy. That’s why every big ideological turning point — 1896, 1920, 1932, 1980, and maybe 2008 — has come after a big monetary shock.
Think about it this way: Bad monetary policy means a bad economy, which gives power back to the party that didn’t have it before. And so long as the monetary problem gets fixed, the economy will too, and the new government’s policies will, whatever their merits, get the credit. That’s how ideology changes.
Center-right John Tamny, editor of Real Clear Markets , argues that “Presidents get the dollar they want. Always.” At RCM :
The Carter and Bush presidencies weren’t certain failures as much as the dollar policies from both administrations ensured economic malaise. What’s crucial is that all this could have been avoided. Presidents get the dollar they want. Always. Will President Trump realize this before it’s too late?
A second knock on Moore and Cain is that they lack the professionalism requisite to serve. To provide some context let’s take a good look at the Fed’s own track record.
Ylan Q. Mui, then writing for the Washington Post, wrote in “ Why nobody believes the Federal Reserve’s forecasts ”: “Even the government’s official budget forecasters are dubious of the Fed’s own forecast.”
This was a reprise of a note she had previously sounded,“ Is the Fed’s crystal ball rose-colored? ” “The big question is whether Fed officials can get it right after years in which they have regularly predicted a stronger economy than the one that materialized.”
The Fed’s economic predictions are consistently wrong. Thus, what can one really expect of policy based on those predictions? It is not wrong of the president to express concern that monetary policy is too tight and strangling economic growth.
Mui was not merely exercising journalistic cheek. In the New York Fed’s own flagship blog, Liberty Street Economics , we find — speaking for themselves and not the Fed — an admirably candid observation by an assistant vice president in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group, Marco Del Negro, Wharton Ph.D. student Raiden Hasegawa, and University of Pennsylvania professor of economics Frank Schorfheide, “ Choosing the Right Policy in Real Time (Why That’s Not Easy)” :
Model uncertainty is pervasive. Economists, bloggers, policymakers all have different views of how the world works and what economic policies would make it better. These views are, like it or not, models. Some people spell them out in their entirety, equations and all. Others refuse to use the word altogether, possibly out of fear of being falsified. No model is “right,” of course, but some models are worse than others, and we can have an idea of which is which by comparing their predictions with what actually happened.…
…
In the end, we have shown that policy analysis in the very oversimplified world of DSGE models is a pretty difficult business. Contrary to what it may sometimes appear from listening to talking heads, deciding which policy is best is very rarely a slam dunk.
This can only be interpreted as an admission of the fundamental unreliability of the Fed’s core analytic. Bravo for the dose of honest candor!
Prof. Reuven Brenner has called our current system to account :
[M]acro-economics is now [astrology’s] modern incarnation: Only instead of stars, macro-economists look at “aggregates” gathered religiously by governments’ statistical agencies — never mind if the country has a dictatorial regime, be it left, right or anything in between, or has large black markets, as Italy and Greece do, where tax evasion has long been the main national sport. So let us first forget about this “macro” stuff, whose beginnings are almost a century old, and offer a simple alternative for shedding light on the situation today and on possible solutions, hopefully demolish this modern pseudo-“science” once and for all.”
No less than Hayek, in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech titled The Pretence of Knowledge , acidly criticized the economics profession for something he called “scientism,” meaning emulating the style but not the substance of the natural sciences. The Fed, with its many hundreds of PhD economists on staff is operating a pseudoscientific model.
This is the sine qua non of the Voltaire’s Bastards syndrome.
Is there a problem with this pretense? Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase, recently went on record as proclaiming that the U.S. economy should have grown 40% in the last decade, not 20%. The policies emanating from the Fed, with all of its impressive expertise, have not gotten the growth job done. We’re stuck in a “Little Dark Age” of economic stagnation.
This upsets President Trump. As well it should.
Whether or not one accepts Moore’s commodities-index target (I do not) or Cain’s belief in the gold standard (I do), their appointment and confirmation would be consistent with President Trump’s reported desire for better equitable prosperity.
Moore calls himself a “growth hawk.” Herman Cain is a sure-enough pro-prosperity supply-sider. Bring it on.
Confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain would not undermine the Fed’s independence. There’s nothing innately partisan about equitable prosperity. Some of prosperity’s greatest champions, such as the late President John F. Kennedy and the former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, have been Democrats. President Reagan was a Democrat until his party left him.
So was I.
Confirmation of Moore and Cain would position two vital voices to challenge the Fed to up its game by adopting a monetary rule better calculated to restore equitable prosperity than its current, beleaguered “Voltaire’s Bastards” louche practices. The United States Senate should not flinch from confirming Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board.

The Congresswoman From Somalia,spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-congresswoman-from-somalia/,"by Eric Peters
Washington
If a politician of Japanese extraction were addressing a “largely Japanese-American audience” and characterized the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor as “some people did something,” would you think that those words diminished the loss of life and of property suffered by our country 78 years ago in the Pacific Ocean? I would, but apparently Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) would not.
She thinks it is a perfectly respectful — and accurate! — way to refer to the 9/11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. by 19 Muslim terrorists in 2001. She characterized the 9/11 attacks in this way just last month to a largely Muslim audience saying, “some people did something.” What the terrorists did, for those who might have forgotten, was murder 2977 people, injure countless thousands more, and cause billions of dollars of property loss.
The Hon. Omar who is Muslim spoke of the 9/11 attacks in this vague and anodyne way for a political purpose. She was speaking to a meeting of CAIR (the Council on American-Islamic Relations) and she went on to say that, “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something [italics added] and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” As a matter of fact, CAIR was founded — for whatever reason — 17 years before 9/11 and since 9/11 there has been no discernible loss of “access to our civil liberties,” by which I assume she means Muslim Americans. Incidentally, CAIR is not a widely recognized humanitarian group, as its name would have you believe, but an unindicted co-conspirator in a terrorist financing case involving the Holy Land Foundation.
Now, of course, the Hon. Omar is not a very well-informed person. Not only does she not understand what she is talking about, but when she talks she mangles the English language. She is a perfect representative of the Democrats’ core constituency, the moron vote.
Nonetheless Democrats are scrambling to Omar’s defense. They are claiming that “the right” and President Donald Trump have incited violence against her. That they are guilty of Islamophobia and of politicizing a grave tragedy, that being the cowardly 9/11 sneak attack against not a military target but against unarmed citizens going about their peaceful business. It was even more treacherous than the Pearl Harbor attack. All the Democrats said pretty much the same thing, but my favorite is Pocahontas. She, sometimes known as Senator Elizabeth Warren, said, “The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman — and an entire group of Americans based on their religion.”
I have not seen that the President said anything about “an entire group of Americans” or about inciting violence against any individual. All he did was send out a tweet showing the Hon. Omar addressing CAIR with her now famous line, “some people did something,” which the President repeated between clips of the burning towers, of the highjacked planes hitting the towers, and of survivors staggering from the destruction, many of whom were destined to die of toxic inhalation later, often years later. That day meant tragedy for thousands, perhaps millions. Whoever edited those clips has a talent for dramaturgy, as did President Trump when ended his tweet with this comment: “We will never forget! Bravo!
Yet obviously the Democrats have already forgotten. They see nothing wrong with the Hon. Omar diminishing one of America’s great tragedies. Let her go on with her anti-Semitic posturing and her ignorant trivialization of American history. What does she think of Valley Forge and the sinking of the USS Maine ? Is it all ancient stuff from a faraway irrelevant past?
The millions of Americans to whom 9/11 matters greatly do not count in the eyes of Hon. Omar’s defenders. And apparently President Trump ought not to have responded with his tweet. The Democratic defenders of the Hon. Omar will tell us all how we are to respond to her outbursts. They will dictate for us what we can say and cannot say.
I am not the only American who has had enough of this Congresswoman from Somalia and her defenders in the Democratic Party. We shall see you Election Day 2020. "
When a Hamas Front Lobbies Congress,spectator.org,Oren Litwin and Samantha Rose Mandeles,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/when-a-hamas-front-lobbies-congress/,"by Roger Kaplan
Mere days after the United States Council of Muslim Organizations (USCMO, an Islamist umbrella coalition), descended upon Capitol Hill for National Muslim Advocacy Day, one of USCMO’s founding groups, the virulently anti-Semitic American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), returned to lobby Congress yet again. AMP and its partner organization, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), claim to be motivated by universal human rights , but the truth is more alarming; as a recent court case has made clear, AMP is the direct successor organization to the Islamic Association for Palestine (IAP), which was sued into oblivion for being a propaganda front for the terrorist group Hamas.
While the USCMO lobby day focused on domestic issues of concern to Islamists, AMP’s fifth annual Palestine Advocacy Day focused on eroding American relations with Israel — complete with two days of training, and presentations from Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Arizona state representative Athena Salman — and an entire day of Hamas-connected activists holding meetings with members of Congress.
Ms. Salman is a relatively new addition to the AMP scene. She was first elected to the Arizona legislature in 2016 and is already serving as minority whip. Salman is an avowed atheist, but her father is Palestinian and Salman publicly defended the movement to Boycott, Divest and Sanction the state of Israel (BDS) during a contentious debate on an anti-BDS bill in the Arizona legislature in early April. (She had voted against the earlier version of the bill as well in 2016, which earned her the endorsement of the Arizona State chapter of SJP.)
Participants in the event seem to be more extreme. One example of excellence is Joe Catron — a blogger at the viciously anti-Semitic site Electronic Intifada — who calls himself a “reluctant citizen of the American empire.” Catron maintains a Twitter account emblazoned with images glorifying terrorists from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PLFP), such as a map of Israel inside crosshairs, with an Arabic caption that reads, “Hell awaits you.”
Unfortunately, Mr. Catron fits right in with AMP. As has been established in court and in Congressional testimony , AMP’s board is composed of alumni from not only the Hamas front IAP, but also the terror-finance charities KindHearts for Charitable Development (shut down by the Federal government) and the Holy Land Foundation (its executives convicted in court), both of which laundered donations to Hamas.
Indeed, one major player in the event was AMP’s National Policy Director, Osama Abu Irshaid. Abu Irshaid previously served as the editor of Al Zaytounah , the official newspaper of Hamas front IAP. Abu Irshaid has written that the terrorist group Hamas is “an army for liberation” whose fighters “rise up for the blood of martyrs.” In another post, Abu Irshaid praised Hamas’s “steadfastness and sacrifice.”At a May 11, 2018 AMP speaking engagement, he parroted an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory by telling his audience that most modern Jews are “not [real] Jews.”
Also looming large in the crowd were activists from the infamously Islamist Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), including Jinan Shbat , CAIR’s national outreach manager. Like Abu Irshaid, Shbat is an avowed supporter of the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas, having tweeted her preference for that organization over the Palestinian Authority. As a spoken-word performer, she has delivered her poems at several Islamist events — including a 2017 “ Muslim Law Symposium ,” where she claimed credit for violence against Israeli Jews with the line, “My first act of defiance — a rock thrown.”
Shbat’s Twitter feed is replete with openly anti-Semitic statements. In one instance, she responded to a simple news headline about Israel’s Holocaust remembrance day with outrage, tweeting , “Wow. The nerve! Palestinians are now in a Holocaust!” In another instance, she responded to a photo of the Emirati cycling team’s training in Israel by tweeting, “You should burn in hell along with Israel.”
Shbat doesn’t reserve her ire for only the Jewish state. After the judge ruled in favor of Florida police in the case of the mismanaged Parkland shooting response, Shbat tweeted simply, “I hate my country.” That doesn’t stop her from maintaining a friendly relationship with some of its leadership, at least if you count Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Shbat was recently the subject of some internet buzz when a CAIR video showed her in an altercation with Muslim reformer Asra Nomani, who was attempting to record a group of Islamists visiting Tlaib’s office.
According to AMP’s website, the lobbying event drew more than 500 attendees, who held meetings with 191 members of Congress. That is disappointing. AMP attracts overt supporters of Islamist terrorism and provides them with a sheen of legitimacy. American lawmakers should be cautious about lending credibility to Islamist supremacists — especially those connected to the terror group Hamas.

What ‘Free Money’ Means to Me,spectator.org,Steven Greenhut,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/what-free-money-means-to-me/,"by Roger Kaplan
Sacramento
Officials in Stockton, Calif., a hard-pressed agricultural and industrial city 75 miles northeast of San Jose, are enjoying the glow of media attention from their ongoing, first-in-America program to provide residents with a Universal Basic Income, or UBI. The city’s no-strings-attached stipend garnered widespread bemusement when it was rolled out in February, but it is back in the news again as some recipients burnish their new role as “storytellers.”
After more than 100 lower-income Stockton residents start receiving $500 monthly payments for 18 months, 25 of them will be telling the public about what it has meant for them to have more cash. Those stories will be disseminated by the program’s backers. Academic researchers will provide data by 2021 that no doubt confirms people who receive extra money can buy extra stuff. Stay tuned for the thrilling details. (Or roll your eyes as you watch a documentary about the “Mincome” program in Manitoba.)
Apparently, if city officials come up with a sufficiently asinine idea, and then promote the heck out of it, they can be portrayed as progressive beacons leading the way to a brighter future. This is the lead paragraph from the Los Angeles Times ’ recent coverage of the program: “Young, sincere and raised on the edge of poverty, Sukhi Samra has a mother who worked two minimum-wage jobs when she was a kid — days at a gas station and nights at a Subway. Her father is disabled. She knows what an extra $500 a month would have bought her family.”
The 23-year-old Samra runs the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which is the name for this pilot program. It is led by the city and the Office of Mayor Michael Tubbs, whose other “innovative” idea was to pay (with private money) gang members subsidies not to shoot one another. In fairness, the Stockton income program is not funded by taxpayer dollars either, but by private donors who want to study its effects. Hey, if rich people want to roll up hundred-dollar bills and burn them in the fireplace, that’s their prerogative. Still, 500 bucks a month isn’t a “basic income,” even in a lower-cost city in the San Joaquin Valley.
The motivating force for UBI is not altruism, but political activism. The Times notes that “what happens in Stockton is likely to inform the national political conversation in the years ahead” — and that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has “tiptoed up to the edge of basic income” and that Pete Buttigieg says he takes the idea seriously. One of the leaders of the group funding SEED, The Economic Security Project, told the newspaper , “We are in a moment where big ideas are important and politically people are ready for them.”
This is about more than helping a few residents in a mid-size city pay medical bills, buy groceries, repair the car, or spend the weekend in the Sierra foothills gambling at the Jackson Rancheria Indian casino (there are no limits on how the money is spent, after all). It’s about setting the stage for a national political “discussion” that might eventually involve large, direct taxpayer payments to lower-income residents. The research and storytelling will be used to soften us up for the hard sell, which will come in various state or federal proposals, and will sometimes be linked to plans for reparations .
Thinking about these coming stories, I thought of that Monty Python skit about the four wealthy Yorkshiremen recalling their impoverished childhoods and one-upping each other on how bad they had it: “You were lucky to have a house! We used to live in one room, all 126 of us, no furniture. Half the floor was missing; we were all huddled together in one corner for fear of falling!” You’ll see from the research and stories — the recipients were worthy, the money was well spent, and it enabled people to escape a life huddled near that missing floor.
As SEED explained in its vision paper , “We hope to challenge entrenched stereotypes and assumptions about the poor, and the working poor, that paralyze our pursuit of more aggressive solutions.… In sum, we believe that SEED provides an opportunity to imagine a more fair and inclusive social contract that provides dignity for all.” And the only thing it will require is a massive infusion of cash to pay for this new social contract . Can you really put a price on human dignity?
Universal Basic Income is one of those ideas that has percolated among academics for decades. Those on the Left see it as a way to boost the economic situation of the poor, bolstered by the progressive belief that poverty is only about a lack of money rather a lack of skills, proper work habits, or life choices. Some on the Right like the idea, too, because giving direct cash payments would circumvent those wasteful, nanny-ish bureaucracies and might promote personal responsibility.
Getting rid of ill-performing union-controlled agencies is a dream of mine, but UBI sounds better at an academic conference than in reality . There’s no evidence the concept’s backers are interested in replacing existing income-transfer programs or shuttering bureaucracies. This would be another benefit ladled on top of existing benefits. It seems naïve to think that giving people cash rather than in-kind services necessarily will improve their sense of responsibility.
Wrong, too, are the Silicon Valley types who are intrigued by the idea because of their concerns about automation. The Economic Security Project features an interview with one academic who became interested in UBI in 1965 after a retreat with a futurist who “thought that automation was going to eliminate jobs, and the solution was a guaranteed income.” To ensure social peace, it may be easiest to give handouts to those left behind by the economy rather than to help them become employable. That strikes me as cynical, though.
Oddly enough, I find myself in rare agreement with two California organized labor officials quoted by the Times . “This concept of universal basic income is a surrender to a kind of grim Dickensian view of the future, frankly, in which people are robbed on the dignity of work,” said Barry Broad, who heads the California Employment Training Panel. Another called the Stockton program public relations, which is exactly what it is. Amen on both counts.
I regularly spend time in Stockton. It’s a nice, historic, formerly bankrupt city that needs fewer newsworthy ideas and more of the basics: better public services, less wasteful spending, lower taxes, and a regulatory climate that promotes business development and job creation. Then the city’s poor can get better jobs, improve their lot, and have too little time to tell their sob stories.

The Politics of Notre Dame,spectator.org,Larry Alex Taunton,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-politics-of-notre-dame/,"by Roger Kaplan
When you heard Notre Dame was ablaze, did you think Islamic terrorism might be involved? I did. And with the origin of the fire still uncertain , that remains a valid avenue of inquiry. Muslim extremists have attacked the landmark before , have threatened to attack it again , and are now gloating over the destruction of this symbol of Christendom . It may well be that the fire was an accident — let’s hope so — but no thoughtful investigator would rule out the possibility of arson with this religious motivation. It’s not like attacks on national symbols are contrary to the rules by which Islamic terrorists have played. Has the whole world forgotten 9-11?
But don’t mention any of this to the Washington Post . In a column titled “ How the far right spread politically convenient lies about the Notre Dame fire ,” columnist Talia Lavin, leaning heavily on BuzzFeed as if it were one of Notre Dame’s flying buttresses, finds the mere suggestion that Islam might have played a role in the fire nothing short of racism. (Note to the WP : Islam is a religion , not a race.) Lavin is right to condemn genuine racists or those who have attributed the cause of the blaze to Muslim extremists without any proof to support that claim. Insofar as she does this, Ms. Lavin is correct. But she goes well beyond her stated thesis.
In a bit of journalistic sleight-of-hand that is so characteristic of the Left, she uses outrageous tweets by racist Richard Spencer and claims published by the conspiracy theorist website InfoWars to de-legitimize any thoughtful critique of Islam. She goes on to dismiss the idea of a “civilizational conflict” between Islam and the West and, in an ignorant jab, criticizes conservative commentator Ben Shapiro for calling Notre Dame “a monument to Western Civilization and to Judeo-Christian heritage.”
At this point, I had to ask how this article got past the Washington Post editors. There is a civilizational conflict, and while things might seem rosy in Ms. Lavin’s Brooklyn — aren’t the Twin Towers visible from there? — I assure you that things look much different in other parts of the world. I have debated Muslims on Al Jazeera, CNN International, in London’s Hyde Park, and I have covered that conflict in Nigeria where Christians are being slaughtered by Muslims for their faith. Yes, the conflict is real. Ms. Lavin and her publisher would do well to remember — if they ever knew it — that Islam is a religion founded in violence, with a history of violence, and with many representatives who advocate violence. To wit: according to 2015 BBC poll, 25 percent of British Muslims — roughly 750,000 people — were sympathetic with the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
As for Notre Dame being “a monument to Western Civilization and to Judeo-Christian heritage.” Uh, it is , Ms. Lavin.
Recently, I visited the sites of the Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan terrorist attacks in Paris. It was my third visit to these places in the last year. Somehow, whenever I am in Paris, I feel that I should pay my respects to the victims of Islamic terrorism who seem to have been so thoroughly forgotten. No, that is not quite accurate. They have not been forgotten. The reason for their murders has been deliberately obscured and legitimate dialogue on the topic of Islam has been suppressed. This is no conspiracy theory, it is codified in EU law. According to the European Court of Human Rights , disparaging “The Prophet” Muhammad is punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.
And this brings me to the point — the real point — of Ms. Lavin’s column: the suppression of free speech. She would have us believe the Notre Dame fire is, in effect, akin to the Reichstag fire of 1933. In that instance, the Nazis used the fire, which they likely set, as a pretext to persecute their political opponents and, most of all, German Jews. It was Jussie Smollett on a national scale, but with a different demographic in mind. Ms. Lavin sees the “far right” using the tragedy of Notre Dame to persecute Muslims. She ends her column with talk of “misinformation” and “conspiracy” raging “through our information sphere unchecked.” Then she says this: “It is past time that those who stoke inflammatory rhetoric, knowing its potential to catalyze racist violence, were made to stop playing with fire — before it’s too late to control the inferno.”
That misinformation rages through our “information sphere” is not in question. What is troublesome is that Ms. Lavin and the Washington Post , like all would-be censors, do not see themselves as occasional contributors to that misinformation but instead see themselves as arbiters of truth, the high priests so to speak, who will determine for the rest of us what we should or should not have access to. In the end, they are guilty of the very thing they condemn — they have leveraged a tragedy for political capital against their opponents.

Mueller Report: Dems Bash Barr to Keep Hype Alive,spectator.org,David Catron,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/mueller-report-dems-bash-barr-to-keep-hype-alive/,"by Roger Kaplan
Thursday morning, the Justice Department will release the 400-page report outlining how special counsel Robert Mueller squandered $34 million to conclude that an implausible conspiracy theory was unsupported by objective evidence. Even at $85,000 per page, it’s unlikely that this document contains anything of substance that we didn’t already know after Attorney General William Barr distilled it down to 4 pages last month. Yet the Democrats and the “news” media continue their desperate attempts to keep hype alive with new conspiracy theories about a “cover-up” as well as demands to see parts of the report to which federal law forbids them access.
The DOJ has announced that Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein will hold a joint news conference Thursday at 9:30 a.m. to discuss Mueller’s investigation. Presumably, they will attempt to make it clear — even to the “reporters” of the legacy media — why it isn’t possible to release an un-redacted copy of the Mueller report. Rosenstein’s planned presence at this news conference also suggests that they will endeavor to explain why, as Barr wrote in his March letter to Congress, “The evidence developed during the special counsel’s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction of justice offense.”
That letter has been used by the Democrats to level charges of dark doings in the Justice Department under the new Attorney General. Barr is well known in Washington, having served in a variety of high-profile DOJ positions, including Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush administration. And, until he replaced the acting A.G. in the Trump Justice Department, Barr was highly regarded by intelligent Beltway insiders across the ideological spectrum. All that changed when the Mueller report killed the collusion hoax and Barr reported that fact to Congress. Now, it would seem that Barr himself is in league with Russia, as Newsweek breathlessly reports :
This much is known: On Barr’s public financial disclosure report, he admits to working for a law firm that represented Russia’s Alfa Bank and for a company whose co-founders allegedly have long-standing business ties to Russia. What’s more, he received dividends from Vector Group, a holding company with deep financial ties to Russia.… Much of the information is public, but it has so far been unreported in relation to Barr.
Oddly, this issue was conspicuous by its absence during Barr’s confirmation hearings. At that time, the Democrats were far more interested in what they styled his “audition letter,” written in June of 2018 to Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein. This 19-page memorandum contained what the “get Trump” crowd saw as brazen heresy. Specifically, Barr objected to the special counsel’s demand that the President submit to an interview pursuant to possible obstruction of justice: “Mueller is proposing an unprecedented expansion of obstruction laws so as to reach facially-lawful actions taken by the President in exercising the discretion vested in him by the Constitution.”
What Barr is talking about here, if it’s not obvious, is the President’s termination of FBI Director James Comey. It’s obvious that Mueller wanted to get Trump into a room and question him about his reasons for doing so in the hope that he could somehow connect it with thwarting the investigation into alleged dealings with the Russians. Barr’s point is that it doesn’t matter why Comey was fired. If giving that weird character the boot constituted “a facially-lawful action taken by the President,” it cannot be obstruction of justice. Firing Comey isn’t the same as destroying physical evidence. Barr went on to say that Trump should not submit to any such interrogation.
This thought crime caused every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote against Barr. Only three Democrats voted for his confirmation in the full Senate. Since then, Barr has further incurred the wrath of the Democrats by making it clear that he plans to look into well-documented spying on the 2016 Trump campaign, including an FBI wiretap of Carter Page as well as surveillance of George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. This inevitably resulted in denunciations by the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The latter brayed, “I don’t trust Barr.” The “news” media dutifully chimed in with Barr’s alleged Russia connection :
On his financial disclosure report, Barr notes that he earned anywhere from $5,001 to $15,000 in dividends from the Vector Group.… The company’s president, Howard Lorber, brought Trump to Moscow in the 1990s to seek investment projects there. The trip is widely seen as the first of many attempts to establish a Trump Tower in Moscow.… Lorber has extensive ties to Russia.
Wow… Barr had stock in the Vector Group and earned a whopping $5001 to $15,000. Quite a haul, eh? That’s almost enough to buy a used car (as long as you don’t insist on a drive train warranty). And what about all those nefarious ties with Alfa Bank? Barr was employed by a law firm, Kirkland & Ellis LLP, which occasionally represented that particular financial institution. During his two years at that firm, Barr earned about $500K annually. This is not minimum wage but it isn’t exactly a killing these days for a heavy hitter whose résumé includes the title, U.S. Attorney General. And there’s one more minor inconvenience with this heinous catalogue of crime:
Investigators found no evidence that the Trump Organization had communicated with Alfa. Still, the bank is partially owned by Russian oligarch German Khan, whose son-in-law, the London-based lawyer Alexander van der Zwaan, was indicted by special counsel Robert Mueller for lying to investigators about a report his firm had written for Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort.
So, just to make sure you followed that: Barr once worked for a law firm that represented a bank with which the Trump campaign had no dealings. And this constitutes a conflict of interest because the son-in-law of a “Russian oligarch” (who evidently owns shares in the bank) was indicted for lying to investigators about a report he had written for Paul Manafort at a time when the latter was not connected to the Trump campaign. And the editors of the “news” outlet that published this shaggy dog story actually believe it means “Barr’s potential conflicts could face further scrutiny as Democrats in Congress fight to have the Mueller report released to the public.” Really?
If this is the best the Democrats and the media can do to damage Attorney General Barr’s credibility, they had better give up the “get Trump” routine and go back to what they do best — moronic policy proposals like the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, open borders, sanctuary cities, reparations, gun control, infanticide, lowering the voting age to 16, free college tuition for everyone, a guaranteed income for people who can’t be bothered to work, ad infinitum. If the Democrats are betting on the demise of Attorney General William Barr and crazy demands to see redacted portions of Mueller’s $34 million report to keep the Russia hype alive, President Trump wins."
Bipartisan Support for Electric Vehicle Handouts Betrays Taxpayers,spectator.org,Veronique de Rugy,04-18-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/bipartisan-support-for-electric-vehicle-handouts-betrays-taxpayers/,"by Steven Greenhut
Excessive partisanship and endless acrimony are common complaints lodged against the political class. There’s a lot to be said in favor of this narrative, but bipartisanship isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be, either. As evidence, consider the latest attempt to extend corporate handouts for electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers.
The Driving America Forward Act was recently introduced to extend the existing EV tax credit well beyond its current limits. Unsurprisingly, its sponsors include both Michigan Senators, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, as well as Republican Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine. A companion version was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Dan Kildee, also a Democrat from a district in Michigan.
Under current law, a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 is available to consumers of the first 200,000 vehicles sold by each manufacturer, after which the credit is phased out. Both Tesla and General Motors have exceeded the cap, a fact that has driven a lobbying frenzy to extend the benefit. This wouldn’t be the first time the credit was expanded, as the original incarnation of the credit applied only to the first 250,000 electric vehicles sold across all manufacturers.
This new legislation will allow for the purchase of an additional 400,000 vehicles to be eligible for a $7,000 credit, but it might as well be permanent. If Congress passes the bill and it’s signed into law, Washington will be sending a clear signal to manufacturers that the gravy train may never end. All the EV makers must then do is flood Washington with lobbying and campaign donations once the next deadline approaches and the cycle could no doubt continue.
The current credit is expected to cost $7.5 billion in federal revenue from last year through 2022, according to the Congressional Research Service and the Joint Committee on Taxation. The costs of the newly expanded credit are not yet available but would be considerably higher.
Almost 80% of those utilizing the EV tax credit have incomes over $100,000, making it not just a corporate handout but also a transfer from all workers to wealthier Americans. And despite its advocates’ claims, the EV tax credit fails to reduce the alleged threat of climate change.
Because all personal vehicles in the United States account for only a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, even an unrealistic influx of electric vehicles would prove to be negligible. Besides, standard internal combustion engines emit far less pollution today than they have in the past. Simply replacing older cars can do as much or more to benefit the environment than even entirely switching over to electric vehicles.
This is at least the third major push to extend EV tax credits over the last year. The persistence of the issue is indicative of a political reality less obvious than the typical Republican versus Democrat framework. In economic parlance, it’s called concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. The benefits are conveyed to EV manufacturers and those few consumers (most of whom make over $100,000), but the costs are spread out across the larger population.
While the manufacturers and relatively wealthier consumers of electric vehicles have a strong incentive to support the tax credits, the average cost per taxpayer is low and thus of little political concern. Yet, when all the crony handouts that come about because of this same dynamic are added up, it represents a more significant sum and is a more obvious problem. But translating that burden into a political force that’s capable of resisting the well-funded pleading of special interests is extremely difficult.
In this case, the fact that the handouts are already set to end if Congress just does nothing should benefit the taxpayers. That’s often not the case, and it explains why the special interests have failed several times already in their attempts to preserve their benefit. Unfortunately, it’s readily apparent that they’re going to keep trying again and again to enrich themselves at the expense of the taxpaying public.

Radical Environmentalism and Transhumanism: Symptoms of the Same Disease,spectator.org,Wesley J. Smith,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/radical-environmentalism-and-transhumanism-symptoms-of-the-same-disease/,"by Steven Greenhut
Oh my. Two of contemporary society’s most prominent anti-human utopian movements — radical environmentalism and materialistic transhumanism — appear on the verge of a bitter showdown.
When you think about it, that makes sense. Both movements see themselves as the future’s only hope . But their core purposes are incompatible. Radical environmentalists — “nature rights” activists, deep ecologists, Gaia theorists, and their fellow travelers that elevate nature above humanity — hijacked and refashioned traditional environmentalism into a mystical neo-earth religion that disdains homo Sapiens as a parasitical species afflicting the earth. These radicals hope to thwart our thriving off the land in order to “save the planet.” Indeed, I sometimes believe that if they could, they would forcibly revert our species to hunter/gatherers — without the hunting part.
In contrast, transhumanism denigrates both the natural world and normal human life as irredeemably limited, and worst of all, ending in death! They yearn to possess extraordinary capacities without having to work to attain them. Rather than pursue virtue, transhumanism expects to overcome human nature through applied technology. Indeed, movement prophets predict the coming of “Singularity” — a discreet moment in time when unstoppable cascading technology will enable transhumanists to “seize control of human evolution” and reengineer themselves into an immortal “post-human species.”
The intellectual peace between these competing social movements was recently breached by Zoltan Istvan, one of transhumanism’s most creative apologists, who ran for president in 2016 on a plank of defeating death and garnered scads of earned media by touring the country in a bus fashioned to look like a coffin. In an all-out frontal assault on the hallowed presumption of contemporary environmentalism, Istvan not only writes that “nature isn’t sacred” (can you hear the gasping?), but he committed an even worse anti-environmentalist sin by arguing that “we should replace it.”
Istvan’s essay effectively flays the misanthropy of contemporary environmentalism. He writes:
Starting with the good-intentioned people at Greenpeace in the 1970s but overtaken recently with enviro-socialists who often seem to want to control every aspect of our lives, environmentalism has taken over political and philosophical discourse and direction at the most powerful levels of society. Green believers want to make you think humans are destroying our only home, Planet Earth — and that this terrible action of ours is the most important issue of our time. They have sounded a call to “save the earth” by trying to stomp out capitalism and dramatically downsizing our carbon footprint.
Istvan worries about contemporary environmental challenges (some of which, I think he also exaggerates). But he slaps green ideology square in the face by writing, “the last thing we need to do is put the brakes on consumption, procreation and progress.” Even more heretically, he writes: “Salvation is in science and progress, not sustainability or preserving the Earth. To argue or do otherwise is to be sadistic and act immorally against humanity’s well-being.”
Istvan clearly understands that prosperity attained through free market enterprise is far more likely to bring about a cleaner and more humane world than fanatically stifling human thriving as radical environmentalists propose (for example, by promoting human-style “rights” for “nature ”). He writes:
The tools transhumanists use — science, technology, and reason — to accomplish its watershed aims rely on thriving economies, free markets, and innovation. These mostly come from competitive countries trying to become powerful and make money — a lot of it. Increased economic output is nearly always responsible for raising the standard of living, something that has been going up a lot in the last 50 years for just about every nation on Earth. But that could change quickly as governments increasingly enforce strict pro-environmental regulation which slows down industry and commerce. When you force companies to operate inefficiently for lofty ideals, it hurts their bottom lines, and that in turn hurts workers and everyday people.
Yes. That’s precisely what too many greens seek, a poorer world in which the “rights” of nature are given at least equal consideration to the needs of people.
Istvan also “gets” that environmentalism has become a means of stifling freedom through centralized control:
Modern environmentalism is a fabricated deceit of and for the rich and powerful. It’s especially prominent in liberal places like New York City and my home town San Francisco. Sadly, environmentalism is often just a terrible tool to wield power over those of lesser means.… Despite the imperfections of capitalism, I continue to support it because it remains the best hope for the poor to improve their standard of life — because at least the individually poor can work hard, be smart, and eventually become rich themselves. This rags to riches phenomenon is not something that can happen in socialist or communist environments, where nearly everyone loses (except the corrupt) — and those losses often lead to starvation and eventual civil war.
If Istvan had left it there, there would be little to contest. Alas, Istvan is a religious fanatic attacking the religious fanaticism of a competing faith. His transhumanism cure is, in many ways, worse than the radical environmentalist “disease” against which he inveighs.
Transhumanism ideology is based on the abject terror of death and an impotent rage against the all that is natural. Thus, Istvan writes:
Transhumanists first and foremost want to live indefinitely, and they are outraged at the fact their bodies age and are destined to die. They blame their biological nature, and dream of a day when DNA is replaced with silicon and data.
Their enmity of biology goes further than just their bodies. They see Mother Earth as a hostile space where every living creature — be it a tree, insect, mammal, or virus — is out for itself. Everything is part of the food chain, and subject to natural law: consumption by violent murder in the preponderance of cases. Life is vicious. It makes me think of pet dogs and cats, and how it’s reported they sometimes start eating their owner after they’ve died.
Where radical environmentalists unduly romanticize the natural world, transhumanism nihilistically scorns it:
I don’t believe in evil, per se, but if there was such a thing, it would be nature — a monster of arbitrary living entities consuming and devouring each other simply to survive. No omnipotent person would ever have the hate in them to create a system where everything wants and needs to sting, eat, and outdo everything else just to live. And yet, that’s essentially what the environment is to all living entities. Environmentalists want you to believe nature is sacred and a perfect balance of living things thriving off one another. Nonsense — it’s a world war of all life fighting agony and loss — of fight or flight, of death today or death tomorrow for you and your offspring.
Good grief. Tennyson may have been right that nature is “red in tooth and claw,” but it is also the fount of life, the underpinning of beauty, and the source of artistic inspiration in the face of which we can only stand in awe. As Van Gogh stated so well, “I have nature and art and poetry, and if that is not enough, what is enough?”
Where radical greens would impede human thriving to “save the planet,” Istvan longs for an indefinite and, one must say, depressingly sterile existence. Transhumanists “want to rid their worlds of biology,” he explains. “They favor concrete, steel, and code.”
[A]s we become transhumans, with perfectly functioning ageless bionic organs and implants in our brains connecting us to the cloud… let’s create new environments that fit our modern needs. These will be virtual, synthetic, and machines worlds. These new worlds will be far more moral and humanitarian than that of nature. They will be like our homes, cars, and apartments, where everything in it is inanimate or no longer living, and that’s why we find sanctuary and comfort in it.
Good grief, no thank you. Give me a golden sunset, the song of birds, the scent of a rose, the soft kiss of my beloved, and the sure knowledge of my eventual end that inspires me make the most of every precious moment!
Enough. Radical environmentalism and transhumanism appear to be mirror opposites, but they are really varying symptoms of the same decadent disease. i.e., the rejection of human exceptionalism. The former identifies us merely as animals, of no greater value than any other species, and hence, they would willingly sacrifice our thriving on the great green altar. The latter denigrates us as so many meat machines, allowing them to hubristically presume the right technologically remake us into a “better” species — essentially, high tech eugenics. Both social projects reject the time-tested road in which we thrive from nature’s bounty and protect its preciousness in the humble understanding that as transitory beings, environmental stewardship conserves our descendants’ heritage as our continuing prosperity enables our posterity to one future day do the same.

Mueller’s Despicable Parthian Shot,spectator.org,David Catron,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/muellers-despicable-parthian-shot/,"Mueller’s Despicable Parthian Shot No one’s calling the lowly Robert Mueller a boy scout now. by Victor Gaetan
W hen special counsel Robert Mueller finally finished his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, he produced a report that confirms much of the criticism President Trump has leveled at him during the past two years. It clearly reveals that Mueller’s partisan investigators were determined to “get Trump,” and that they were frustrated by their inability to do so. This is most obvious in the section dealing with obstruction of justice. As it is phrased in the Introduction to Volume II, “[T]his report does not conclude that the President committed a crime.” An honest evaluation would have stopped there.
Mueller’s team, however, were loath to pursue the honorable course. Their partisan bias compelled them to gratuitously add — after taking eight full paragraphs to explain why they didn’t conclude that Trump had obstructed justice — that they nonetheless would “not exonerate him.” This is the cheapest of cheap shots. It is obviously a cowardly attempt to damage the President with innuendo rather than an actual accusation of obstruction that would eventually have to be supported with proof of “conscious wrongdoing” that Mueller couldn’t produce. Mueller and his minions opted, instead, for good old-fashioned calumny.
This is particularly disgraceful considering the restraint Trump demonstrated during the probe. He could, for example, have asserted executive privilege to prevent investigators from gaining access to all manner of documents as well as several witnesses. Trump is the first president since Jimmy Carter not to invoke that well-established prerogative. Trump also resisted the temptation to simply halt the probe, a power that he does possess under Article II of the Constitution. Mueller ignored this cooperation and chronicled 10 examples of unobstruction in the Executive Summary of Volume II. Below is a summary of each:
The Campaign’s response to reports about Russian support for Trump: When “questions arose” about Russia’s support for Trump, and WikiLeaks released damning DNC emails, “Trump publicly expressed skepticism that Russia was responsible.” Trump denied having Russian business partners, “even though as late as June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia.” But would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn: Trump asked then-FBI Director Comey to show a little mercy to Michael Flynn after the latter got snagged in a perjury trap: “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go… He is a good guy.” Trump asked his Deputy National Security Advisor to draft a letter stating that he “had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Ambassador Kislyak.” Again, would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
The President’s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation: This is nothing more than Trump’s anger pursuant to the desire of then-Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself from the investigations, and that he “reached out to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort.” What would be the point in obstruction if Trump wasn’t guilty of collusion?
The President’s termination of Comey: This goes back to the claim that firing Comey somehow amounted to obstruction of justice. “The day of the firing, the White House maintained that Comey’s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation.” Why would he engage in obstruction if innocent of collusion?
The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him: Obviously, Trump didn’t regard this news as the high point of his day. “On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating whether the President had obstructed justice. The President reacted to this news with a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel’s investigation.” Can Trump’s tweets be considered obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Efforts to curtail the Special Counsel’s investigation: Now we’re back to AG Jeff Sessions. “The President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski… and dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions.” The message was that the Special Counsel investigation was unfair to Trump and should be focused on election meddling in future elections. Why would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence: This involves the tall tale of Donald Trump, Jr. meeting with a Russian lawyer who was allegedly offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton. The President “directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not leak and that the lawyers with access to them should be limited.” Again, would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation: Trump once again pleaded with Sessions to unrecuse himself: “The President said, ‘I’m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.’ Sessions volunteered that he had never seen anything ‘improper’ on the campaignand told the President there was a ‘whole new leadership team’ in place.” Sessions remained firm on recusal. Why would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Efforts to have McGahn deny that he had ordered him to have the Special Counsel removed: In response to an early 2018 press report that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed and that McGahn had threatened to resign rather than carry out the order… “The President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the reports.” McGahn presumably demurred. Once again, would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
Conduct towards Flynn, Manafort: Flynn eventually withdrew from a joint defense agreement with Trump and began cooperating with the government. Trump’s personal counsel “left a message for Flynn’s attorneys reminding them of the President’s warm feelings towards Flynn.” Meanwhile, “the President praised Manafort in public and declined to rule out a pardon.” Yet again, why would Trump engage in obstruction if he wasn’t guilty of collusion?
In the end, the Mueller probe was an investigation looking for a crime. Thus, it produced nothing but a few process crimes and useless indictments of foreign nationals who will never be brought to trial. It was also conducted by partisan hacks, like Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, whose primary goal was to bring down the President. That failed. So, like all cowards in retreat, Mueller and his minions attempted to do as much damage as possible to the President as they departed. That’s why they refused to exonerate him despite finding no real evidence for obstruction of justice. The whole exercise was utterly despicable."
From Russiagate to Ukrainegate: Poroshenko’s Imminent Fall Might Change the Discussion,spectator.org,Victor Gaetan,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/from-russiagate-to-ukrainegate-ukraine-presidents-imminent-fall-might-change-channel/,"by David Catron
T he anticipated defeat of Ukraine’s incumbent president, Petro Poroshenko, on Easter Sunday is evidence that the Obama Administration’s interventionist schemes backfired as consistently as Bush era meddling failed.
Comic actor and challenger Volodymyr Zelenskiy is so far ahead, even Ukraine’s kleptocratic elites and Western-financed NGOs can’t possibly steal enough votes to give Poroshenko a second term.
This outcome will, hopefully, benefit Ukraine’s miserable citizens, impoverished by a profoundly dysfunctional failed state.
It should be a plus for rooting out corruption, including new evidence that the U.S. Embassy colluded with Ukrainian law enforcement to influence the 2016 presidential election while protecting George Soros’s political interests.
More information about former Vice President Joe Biden’s abuse of power — namely, turning Ukraine into a slot machine for his son — might also become available under a new government.
Comedy vs. Corruption
A poll released in Kiev last week showed Zelenskiy, age 41, with 61% support compared to 24% for the incumbent, known as the “Chocolate King” because his billion plus fortune includes ownership of a high-profile confectionary firm. A solid 83% of survey respondents said Ukraine requires “radical changes.”
In first round voting on March 31, Zelenskiy led a pack of 37 candidates, garnering 30% to the president’s 16% — putting the two into a second round.
Poroshenko is one of a handful of oligarchs for whom post-Communism brought unimaginable riches, while condemning the country to a stagnant state of discontent and opaque political machinations.
While most other zillionaires have seen fortunes slashed or schemes outlawed since he won election in May 2014, the Chocolate King continued to make money, despite telling the electorate he would abandon business for public service.
According to financial data revealed by the Panama Papers , Poroshenko stashed over 450 million euros in an Amsterdam-based company registered in Cyprus. So instead of paying 18% taxes in Ukraine he only pays 5% in Cyprus.
In disgust, Ukraine’s voters are turning a popular TV sitcom, “Servant of the People,” into reality: Zelenskiy plays a history teacher whose rant against corruption catapults him to the presidency. The show kicked off in 2015; its eponymous political party launched only last year.
Few are sure what a Zelenskiy presidency would mean precisely, because his platform is inchoate. Both men agree the country should strive to integrate with Western institutions. The challenger says he would use a referendum to gauge popular support for NATO membership, for example.
Corruption is the Pivotal Issue
For Zelenskiy, ending large-scale theft of State resources is his campaign’s raison d’être. He supports term limits, removal of judicial immunity for politicians, and strict independence for prosecutors.
Poroshenko has accomplished little. Worse, a respected TV journalist’s exposé in February revealed the president’s close association with men defrauding the government in military hardware procurement. (This budget has more than doubled in the last five years, multiplying opportunities for graft.)
The 22-year-old son of a former Poroshenko business partner, who, until recently, held a government post supervising the defense industry, was allegedly part of a group selling weapons parts to the army at massively inflated prices — faulty goods smuggled from Russia despite an embargo, to boot.
The only shadow over Zelenskiy is his link to a Poroshenko rival, magnate Igor Kolomoyskiy, who owns the TV station running “Servant of the People” and provides lawyers, security, and vehicles to the actor’s campaign. Kolomoyskiy lives in exile, threatened by Poroshenko’s moves against a bank he owned.
Catalogue of Humanitarian Disasters
Looking at Poroshenko’s performance, it’s no wonder a neophyte is trouncing him.
He has presided over a war with separatists (backed by Russia) on the eastern border, a slow bleed more than a constant military contest. Yet it has taken a tremendous human toll.
Over 13,000 people — about 3,500 civilians — have been killed and 30,000 injured over the last five years, according to the United Nations.
Morale among soldiers is low, based on the high number of suicides and desertions . Since the nation has been hovering near bankruptcy, the availability of military equipment, uniforms, and food is inadequate.
Ukraine is now Europe’s poorest country, the International Monetary Fund announced late last year.
Millions have fled. Although statistics are not firm, an estimated two million flocked to Poland, another three million are in Russia, and half a million left for the Czech Republic.
Indisputable is the massive amount of money sent back home to support families and friends: Remittances ran about $9 billion last year: The diaspora and the IMF float the Ukrainian economy.
Meanwhile, some 1.5 million people are refugees within Ukraine’s borders.
Ukraine’s health care is in the toilet. For example, it has one of the world’s lowest rates of newborn vaccinations against measles: only 54%. The Red Cross is now coping with a major measles epidemic across the country that has impacted 75,000 people.
Poroshenko’s Total “Ukrainian-ness”
Besides divergence in their ferocity on corruption, the two men differ in their attitudes toward Russia. Zelenskiy says he would engage with President Putin, while more of the same from Poroshenko means “nyet” to diplomacy.
The political novice is a native Russian speaker. Most of his acting success, before “Servant of the People,” was in Russian-language productions. His parents are Jewish, although he has not talked about his own beliefs. And he grew up in Ukraine’s southeast, an ethnically Russian area neighboring the conflict zone.
One of Zelenskiy’s clear stands is against the Ukrainian language-exclusive law approved by the country’s parliament in 2014 and the 2017 restrictions on education in non-Ukrainian languages — strongly affirmed by Poroshenko.
Almost half of Ukraine’s population uses Russian at home and four of the country’s five largest cities are majority Russian. Yet, the language’s use is banned in schools after fifth grade.
Other minorities — Hungarian (150,000), Polish (80,000), Romanian (500,000) — have had linguistic rights reduced as well, thus adding to regional disaffection and instability.
Ukraine’s education law is “semi-fascist,” said Gergely Gulyas , an official in the Hungarian prime minister’s office. He said Budapest hopes it can “communicate with the next Ukrainian government because it failed” to see eye-to-eye with the current one.
Poroshenko has wrapped his campaign in a Ukrainian flag. His slogan is, “Army, Language, and Faith.”
He is often depicted wearing military fatigues , although the conflict is a stalemate and the armed forces are having trouble keeping ranks full.
The incumbent’s big idea in 2018 for regaining popularity — despite the country’s glaringly poor record in economic growth, justice reform, healthcare, poverty reduction, and diplomacy — was inserting himself into an Orthodox Church dispute. He helped engineer the creation of a new Ukrainian national (“autocephalous”) Orthodox entity, despite non-existent support in Church law or tradition for such a political move.
So, a fascinating aspect of Zelenskiy’s popularity is that it affirms pluralism against identity politics, which has already stoked virulent nationalism.
Growth of Nationalist Vigilantes
What has been the upshot of advancing nationalist rhetoric over national well-being? Sadly, the rise of extrajudicial thuggery.
For example, the Azov Battalion, formed in 2014 to fight alongside Ukrainian regulars, has morphed into a nationwide vigilante group . While confronting illegal loggers might sound laudable, members have also been known to bust into local council meetings to make specific demands, march through Kiev in military formation (600 people strong), and assault activists they don’t like.
Azov functions as a unit of the National Guard, a nationwide street-level militia, and a political party — with close ties to the current interior minister.
It also trained and radicalized four misguided American supremacists, according to an unsealed FBI indictment regarding the agitators who went to Ukraine for further training. An investigative reporter with Haaretz documented the battalion’s links to neo-Nazi groups across Europe.
Last year, the Atlantic Council explored the dangerous trend of Ukrainian law enforcement relying on nationalist groups (Azov and several others) for muscle in a weak State. An article on the council’s website pointed out that the array of extrajudicial attacks on events and people weakens the Ukrainian State, hurts its international reputation, and contradicts the values of the 2013-14 Maidan Square protests.
Did U.S. Embassy/Kiev Plot to Help Hillary?
The Obama Administration helped Poroshenko’s ascent in 2014, through its “loud and proud” support for a new government in Kiev, even before pressure from the Maidan protests provoked President Viktor Yanukovych into exile.
Who can forget Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland brazenly telling U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt (on a bugged phone) to “F**k Europe!” if the EU was not keen to clinch a coup d’état . In a transcript of the call , Vice President Joseph Biden is part of the small American group deciding who will rule Ukraine.
But it appears American political support came with strings attached.
A detailed investigation by John Solomon for the Hill last month demonstrates the U.S. Embassy intervened in 2016 to block Ukrainian prosecutors from investigating U.S. government funding of $1 million to the Anti-Corruption Action Center , an NGO financed by George Soros, as well.
The same NGO steered Ukrainian officials to target locals with whom Paul Manafort was associated and it worked with the FBI to unearth dirt against Manafort.
(Interestingly, although the center’s website prominently declares it “does not support” a presidential candidate in the upcoming election, it also declares, “Poroshenko Supported the Anti-Corruption Agenda,” while news on Zelenskiy is about 13 visits he made to meet oligarch Kolomoysky — an accusation Poroshenko has been trumpeting.)
Ukraine’s current prosecutor-general announced last month that the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine presented him with a list of people not to prosecute — during the run up to the U.S. presidential election.
He also told the Hill that his office intends to open an investigation into whether Ukrainian law enforcement, working closely with the U.S. Embassy, leaked information to American media about Manafort’s financial ties in Ukraine in order to help Clinton and undermine Trump.
Soon after revelation of so-called “black ledger” records, Manafort resigned from the Trump campaign; the relationship became a key element in accusations of Russian collusion too.
Biden Protected a Dubious Energy Company — for His Son
As the U.S. government was organizing the new Ukrainian government in April 2014, Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, began an eyebrow-raising gig : He took a seat on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of Ukraine’s largest natural gas companies.
What’s fishy is the timing of Hunter Biden’s lucrative appointment. The owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky,served as ecology minister in Yanukovych’s government, which fell when the president jumped ship in February 2014. So the company needed new patrons, especially because it was under investigation by British authorities for money laundering.
The same month Biden was brought on board, the British froze $23 million of money Zlochevsky claimed as his own. When Ukrainian prosecutors refused to play ball with British investigators, Burisma’s owner got it back — money many felt belonged to Ukrainian taxpayers.
Oddly, at a public event in 2018 , the former Vice President bragged that he pressured President Poroshenko, threatening to withhold a $1 billion U.S. loan if he did not fire a top prosecutor then investigating Burisma.
Biden recalled telling the president, “If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired.”
Hunter Biden was making $166,000 per month from Burisma while his father was acting as the government’s rainmaker, according to research by Peter Schweizer. That is quintessential, Ukrainian-style dealing.
So, get ready to turn to Zelenskiy’s channel. You ain’t seen nothing yet."
Domestic Terrorist Paroled Despite Unresolved Cases,spectator.org,Daniel J. Flynn,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/domestic-terrorist-paroled-despite-unresolved-cases/,"by David Catron
T he New York Board of Parole announced on Wednesday the decision of Governor Andrew Cuomo not to run for president. They did this by opting to release Judith Clark, a domestic terrorist convicted of three counts of murder. The oblique manner of the governor revealing his political plans follows a blunter decision in 2016 to commute her sentence of 75-years-to-life to 35-years-to-life, making her eligible for parole, which the board initially denied in 2017 but granted this time around.
Clark, a red-diaper baby who lived in the Soviet Union for three years as a child, served as a getaway driver in an armed robbery of a Brink’s truck to fund the revolutionary activities, and the drug addictions, of the various players involved. The action resulted in the theft of $1.6 million and the deaths of three men, Brink’s guard, Peter Paige, and two Nyack, New York, policemen, Edward O’Grady and Waverly Brown, and the wounding of two other Brink’s guards and a cop. When Clark crashed the getaway car after a chase, cops recovered $800,000 and a gun under her seat.
The combined action of the May 19th Communist Organization and the Black Liberation Army on October 20, 1981, followed more than a decade of criminal activity by Clark. In 1969, Chicago police arrested Clark for participating in the Days of Rage, a Weatherman-organized orgy of violence that resulted in paralyzing an aide to Mayor Richard Daley. Later that same year at the Weatherman’s “Wargasm” in Flint, Michigan, where Weathermen spoke approvingly of Charles Manson, Clark, along with future Brinks co-conspirator Kathy Boudin and Diana Oughton, who died in a Greenwich Village townhouse-turned-bomb-factory just months later, created a poster spelling out murdered actress Sharon Tate’s name in bullets. While many of her Weatherman comrades hid underground during the 1970s, Clark continued her revolutionary activities.
“We had suspicions that they, the May 19th Communist Organization and the FALN (Armed Forces of National Liberation), had participated in the escapes of Assata Shakur and Marilyn Buck,” Donald Wofford, the FBI case agent assigned to the New York portion of the FALN investigation, tells The American Spectator . “Judy Clark was totally involved with the FALN terrorist group and the Black Liberation Army. She was a main player in those escapes and a whole series of armored car robberies.”
One such robbery occurred in the Bronx four months before the Nyack heist. This June 1981 robbery left Brink’s workers William Moroney dead and Michael Schlachter disabled. Upon Clark’s conviction for the Nyack murders, law enforcement regarded her prosecution for the Bronx case, and other alleged violations of the law, as unnecessary given that her sentence made her eligible for parole years past her 100th birthday.
“From a criminal perspective, she was a trusted member of ‘The Family,’ which they called themselves,” Kenneth Maxwell, one of two FBI case agents assigned to the deadly Nyack robbery, tells The American Spectator . “She was not a peripheral player. She was a major player. She was a principal in several indictments, including her role in the June [Bronx] robbery and murder, and the armed escape of Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) and [FALN bomber] Willie Morales. If you look at the circumstances of her arrest, she was reaching under the seat of the car in which she was driving, she was reaching under the seat for a nine-millimeter, clearly intending to use it against the arresting officers who prevented that from happening.”
Before a lineup viewing, Clark spit at, bit, and kicked her captors, necessitating them putting her in a straitjacket. At trial, Clark petitioned for prisoner-of-war status, demanded a change of venue to another nation, and asked potential jurors, “Do your children play cowboys and Indians?” Clark told the court, “The D.A. calls what happened on October 20, 1981, a robbery and murder. We say it was an attempted expropriation because revolutionary forces must take from the powers that be to build their capabilities to struggle against this system.” A thwarted, 1985 escape plan meted out time in solitary confinement, and two years added to her sentence.
Whereas fellow Brink’s robber and Weatherman David Gilbert remained a committed revolutionary, Clark, for show or for real, mellowed. She apologized for her actions, earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree, trained guide and service dogs, and educated inmates about AIDS.
“As a human being, I have some empathy,” Maxwell notes, “and I’m really encouraged by the way she turned her life around to do good things in prison. But granting her parole is certainly not true justice. She should continue doing good deeds but behind prison walls.”
Retired FBI agent Wofford worries that the authorities missed an opportunity to glean valuable information from Clark before her release.
“If she had agreed to tell what she knew about all these different groups,” Wofford explains, “it would have substantially helped to establish what players in these groups were responsible for what. For instance, the Fraunces Tavern bombing—there’s not any doubt in my mind she knows who put that bomb down.”"
"Shep Smith, Boy Reporter",spectator.org,Roger Kaplan,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/shep-smith-boy-reporter/,"by David Catron
Shep Smith, a popular announcer on Fox News, had Philippe Karsenty, a French businessman and politician who is known as a media critic somewhat in the way of Reed Irvine, on his show the other day, on the subject of the Notre Dame de Paris fire. It did not go well, because M. Karsenty put the event in the context of anti-Catholic violence in France, which has spiked in recent years.
The Saint-Sulpice Church — in the Saint-Germain district, not far from the Ile de la Cité, site of the cathedral — was damaged a month ago, reportedly by what has been determined to be arson. As Melissa Mackenzie noted earlier this week , following Breitbart News, the attacks on church property have become a frequent occurrence. A priest, Father Jacques Hamel, was murdered while celebrating mass at his church in Normandy in January of 2016.
In the nation historically known as the eldest daughter of the Church, this is big news. But the only media that have reported on with anything close to the attention one would expect — I as an old newspaperman, for one — it are Valeurs Actuelles , a weekly newsmagazine of which our friends Philippe d’Ormesson and Michel Gurfinkiel are the publisher and the recently retired editor, and Causeur , an online daily news-and-commentary site whose monthly print edition is one of the most serious and open-minded publications in France, carrying refreshingly intelligent, and witty, essays on the political and cultural transformations taking place in France.
Mr. Smith has every right to feel, as he evidently did, that it was in poor taste to suggest an evil deed where none has been identified. It could be that one will be found after due and diligent investigation. M. Karsenty — full disclosure, whom this author met some years ago — did not claim the fire was due arson. He only said that the context was such that you could be forgiven entertaining the thought it might be.
He went on to write a short piece, in Causeur , right after Mr. Smith abruptly pulled him out of the broadcast, to ask why we should accept “ready-to-wear thinking” before we know for sure what happened. He offered no facts of his own, only noted that the media, broadly, did not have any either yet, but were already assuring its audiences that the fire was due to an accident.
The media, and not only the French media, certainly are derelict in failing to cover anti-Catholic violence in France and the persecution of Christians generally.
A tragic fire and a failure to cover religious news are not self-evidently connected; yet if you were aware of anti-Catholic violence and troubled by the media’s indifference to it, you might indeed, in responding to a television reporter’s question, say something not logically coherent but emotionally understandable: “The core of our history is constantly violated and denigrated or simply ignored, and now this — there must be some connection!” (I am loosely translating what I think he meant to convey.)
A reporter would have used this outburst to elicit a deeper insight into a Frenchman’s shock and sorrow, not score points with a woke audience by shutting him down.
To be sure, there is something to be said for maintaining a certain reserve on the Notre Dame tragedy, at least during the Holy Week and, arguably, until the official reports by the police and fire departments come out. Then, as with all such reports, criticism is welcome, backed, one would hope — in vain? — by investigative work by journalists.
On the other hand, keep in mind Mr. Smith invited M. Karsenty to speak a few words. Did he know whom he was dealing with? M. Karsenty is a serious man, a man of strong views and political positions, and known for confronting conventional wisdom, notably in the media. If Mr. Smith wanted a non-controversial commentator, which in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy it was certainly within his rights to want, he could have picked from the thousands available in Paris or environs.
Was it a case of sand-bagging? Or was Mr. Smith seizing a facile chance to show how sober and non-judgmental his news program is?
The Notre Dame tragedy already has brought out an almost daily stream of anguished commentary — some quite intelligent, mind, including in our pages at TAS — about what it all means, symbolically (in terms of rebuilding a viable religious, and specifically Catholic, France), as well as materially (in terms of physically rebuilding the cathedral).
Just recently, one of France’s leading demographers, Jerome Fourquet, published a book, The French Archipelago , that presents the thesis, backed by facts, that France is on the brink of irreversible de-Christianization, turning into a free-form multicultural society (the “archipelago” of the title) with no unifying faith or institution. The Church as recently as 50 years ago provided the framework of national unity, even for non-Catholics.
It may be worth noting, however, that Victor Hugo, whose novel Notre Dame de Paris (in English, The Hunchback of Notre Dame ) included eloquent observations about the erosion of faith and the decline of Catholicism, had it all down, with all that it implied for the French identity.
And this was some 70 years before France officially separated church and state in 1901. The shabby condition of the ancient cathedral, he observed, could not surprise, given the state of the faith. He said it so well, however, and the novel was so popular, that a major restoration project was launched and, with it, a kind of marketing campaign which led to Notre Dame Cathedral becoming the best known church in Europe, and the emblem of France.
Naturally, today, critics are heard who allege that the French state’s paltry budget for the upkeep of the cathedral is indirectly to blame for the disaster. A better maintenance program would have precluded whatever accident occurred, is what they mean. That may be arguable; but as with the suggestion of arson, it seems more appropriate to mourn and wait for the facts, while hoping and working for the spiritual and national revival that tragedies have been known to carry in their wake.
M. Karpenty’s cri de coeur may have been uttered at the wrong time and in the wrong medium, but a shrewd and curious reporter would have seized it to ask a real question or two on the fate of France and its Church. Unfortunately, Mr Smith deflected this and turned a faux-pas , if that is what it was, into an example of the media’s dereliction in favor of its own self-importance."
‘Orange Man Bad!’,spectator.org,Robert Stacy McCain,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/orange-man-bad/,"by David Catron
F or approximately 3 million people, nothing in the Mueller report could exonerate President Trump of “Russian collusion,” obstruction of justice, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors of which they are certain he is guilty. For those 3 million people (a number reflecting the combined average weekday primetime audience of CNN and MSNBC ) Trump’s guilt is an indisputable fact, his presidency an ongoing crime against humanity, his 2016 election a fraud. In a nation of 325 million people, of course, 3 million is less than a single percentage point. However, that hard-core audience of obsessive Trump-haters includes every Democrat in Washington and the vast majority of our nation’s journalists, university faculty, and other such members of the intelligentsia. Therefore, their deranged idée fixe has enormous influence, calling into existence a sort of anti-Trump industry that manufactures a constant output of rage-inducing propaganda. The CNN/MSNBC bubble is the cable-TV equivalent of a cult compound, where dissent from their political religion is forbidden. For the past two years, the fanatics have been told every night by Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon, et al., that the final destruction of Trump was at hand — “the walls are closing in!” — and the left-wing faithful awaited their deliverance from the evil man in the White House.
“Orange Man Bad” — that’s a shorthand label for the anti-Trump mentality, coined by an anonymous contributor on a Reddit forum in 2017, mocking the robotic mindlessness of the president’s enemies. No fact that might contradict their Trump-hating beliefs has any validity to them, because Orange Man Bad . By obverse principle, anything done to harm Trump or his supporters, including libel and violent assault, is considered legitimate, because Orange Man Bad . Living inside a media-generated echo chamber where everyone shares their simplistic worldview, the Trump-haters tune in nightly to their MSNBC/CNN religious revival and are catechized, so to speak, with the latest reiteration of the Orange Man Bad gospel.
What else can explain what happened Thursday, after Mueller finally delivered his 448-page “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.” The delivery of the special counsel’s report was preceded by a press conference at which Attorney General William Barr summarized the result of the investigation. Barr “made clear that, after two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and endless media speculation, the ‘Russian collusion’ story was, as some of us had noted all along, a story about nothing,” as Professor Glenn Reynolds observed . “No member of Trump’s campaign — and in fact, no American anywhere — colluded with the Russians to influence the campaign.” Contrary to what MSNBC and CNN viewers had been told night after night for month after month, Trump is not a Kremlin stooge and yet: “Orange Man Bad!”
Proven wrong on the matter of “Russian collusion,” the anti-Trump media sifted through the Mueller report in search of evidence of other wrongdoing by the president, who of course must be guilty of something . The Twitter feeds of media types filled up with excerpts of the report proving… what? Well, Trump was very angry about being falsely accused of “collusion,” and he didn’t enjoy watching his former associates being investigated and prosecuted as part of what he considered a partisan witch hunt, inspired in large measure by the phony Steele dossier paid for by the Clinton campaign. But we already knew that. Trump’s animus toward the Mueller investigation was certainly no secret, but being angry is not a crime and, however angry he was, nothing Trump did amounted to obstruction of justice. Because there was no “collusion,” and thus no crime to conceal, it would be hard to figure out how or why justice could be obstructed in such a case. The innocent don’t fear justice, and if Trump was innocent of “collusion” (as Mueller concluded) why should he engage in obstruction? Never mind basic logic, cried the Trump-haters, because Orange Man Bad!
CNN went into complete meltdown mode Thursday afternoon, led by the network’s chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin , who declared the Mueller report was “pretty bad” and “very damaging” for Trump. CNN commentator Ana Navarro ranted on Twitter that Barr is “complicit… duplicitous” and “disloyal to the Constitution,” and harrumphed: “I don’t know how anyone can read [the] Mueller Report and conclude Trump did not attempt time and time again to obstruct justice.” Things were no better on MSNBC, where Chris Matthews reacted to Trump’s written answers to Mueller’s questions: “My God, it was like he had failed an Alzheimer’s competency test.” MSNBC commentator and former CIA director John Brennan , who’s spent two years promoting the Russian collusion narrative, claimed that the Mueller report, which effectively exonerated Trump, nonetheless contained “really quite extensive” information supporting his own view. Brennan said the Mueller report showed Trump’s “conduct was unethical, unprincipled, dishonest and I would say it really does back up political corruption.”
Their minds are made up, and mere facts cannot penetrate their ironclad certainty about Trump’s maliciousness. Thus, a 22-month, $25 million federal investigation that disproved their Russian conspiracy theory was really just a waste of time and money; The anti-Trump media and Democrat politicians in Washington continue to believe what they have always believed: “Orange Man Bad!”
On Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program last night, the Wall Street Journal ’s Kimberly Strassel said bluntly, “It’s over.” No collusion. No obstruction. No more indictments. The whole Russians-stole-the-election narrative has been conclusively debunked, and despite the Mueller report’s detailed accounting of Trump’s angry outbursts about the investigation, justice was never obstructed. Yet the 3 million viewers of CNN and MSNBC may not realize this, because those networks are still saying the same thing they’ve been saying since 2016: “Orange Man Bad!”
What can be done about the anti-Trump cult? It’s obvious that they cannot be persuaded by rational argument to abandon their paranoid delusions, and they’ll still be ranting about Russia until the day Trump leaves office. They never believed he could win the 2016 election, and the Russian “collusion” theory was a way to deny the reality of his victory. Now we are barely a year-and-a-half away from the next presidential election, and Trump’s chances of winning a second term have significantly increased. The nearly 63 million Americans who voted for Trump seem to be sticking with him — his job approval numbers have gained about 7 points in the Real Clear Politics poll average since December 2017 — and the Democrat field for 2020 is a clown car full of left-wing crazies. Despite what his enemies in the media might believe, the end of the Mueller probe is a clear victory for Trump, and if the economy keeps roaring along like it is now, the odds of him being re-elected are quite good.
None of these facts matter to the 3 million who watch CNN and MSNBC, the cable-TV echo chamber defined by the anti-Trump cult mentality of Maddow and Matthews, Joe Scarborough and Erin Burnett, Chris Hayes and Chris Cuomo. The good news is that this alternative universe appears to be shrinking. Maddow has lost nearly a third of her audience since last April, and CNN recently recorded its worst ratings week of the year. It has been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results, and this is exactly what Trump’s media enemies seem to be doing. The more often the president mocks them as “fake news,” the more determined they become to destroy him, and the more they limit their audience to the most fanatically deranged Trump-haters. However, it never seems to occur to them that they might be mistaken, no matter how often they find themselves humiliated in the ratings. They know only one thing, and they are completely committed to it: “Orange Man Bad!”"
Slimy Group Therapy for the Trump Haters | The American Spectator,spectator.org,George Parry,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/slimy-group-therapy-for-the-trump-haters/,"by Victor Gaetan
T he Mueller Report is a 448 page-long primal scream of rage by the frustrated Hillary Clinton acolytes who wrote it and who utterly failed in their anointed mission to (a) lure President Trump into a General Flynn-style perjury trap and/or (b) goad him into obstructing their faux investigation of non-existent Trump campaign collusion with Russia.
Unable to find any evidence of actual criminality by the president, Team Mueller resorted to dirtying him up as much as possible for the benefit of their mainstream media and Democrat party fan clubs. This extra-prosecutorial exercise in character assassination was undoubtedly good group therapy for them and most likely will help them retain their social acceptability in progressive circles. But it had nothing to do with law enforcement as that term is understood in America.
In order to lay the predicate for criticizing the president, Team Mueller invented a whole new standard of criminal liability. In a real criminal investigation, the prosecutor makes an up or down decision. If there’s sufficient evidence supporting criminal charges, charges are brought. If the evidence is insufficient, none are filed, and the prosecutor keeps his or her mouth shut. That’s how the adults do it in real prosecutors’ offices. But with Team Mueller traditional adult ethical and legal standards of conduct appear not to apply.
When they couldn’t by hook, crook, trickery, or megathreats drum up enough evidence to justify charging the president with obstruction of justice, they saw fit to include this bit of creative writing in their report:
[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.
Apparently these Clinton sycophants believe that, unlike normal prosecutors, they have been endowed with super powers not only to decide whether or not a crime was committed, but also to exonerate the president if they so elect. Say what? Just who do they think they are and what body of law — including the special counsel statute — confers on them either the duty or power to exonerate anyone? Frankly, this arrogation of unprecedented extra-legal authority smacks of megalomaniacal insanity. Or maybe it’s just part of Team Mueller’s grieving process as they sift the ashes of their failed effort to destroy the hated Trump.
In any event, they report in excruciating detail the “evidence” that they say justified their withholding of exoneration. As they spell it out, Trump was very angry about being investigated and privately and publicly complained about it. Although he made it clear that he believed the investigation to be a witch hunt and that he wanted it to be curtailed, the investigation was not shut down and never obstructed. In fact, just the opposite happened. The White House completely cooperated with the investigation by not asserting executive privilege, allowing staff to speak with the special counsel’s office, and by producing over one million documents including memoranda that put the president in an unflattering light. In short, there were no steps taken to impede or interfere with Team Mueller’s efforts.
Now plug that unprecedented voluntary cooperation into the context of what was supposedly being investigated, i.e . , Trump-Russia collusion. According to Team Mueller, there was no evidence of such collusion. So what was Trump supposedly obstructing? Was he obstructing an investigation into something that never happened?
So, there was no evidence of an underlying crime and no evidence of material acts taken to obstruct the investigation of that non-existent crime. But that’s not enough for Team Mueller to exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. To do that, Trump would have to achieve the logically impossible by proving a negative, i.e., that no obstruction occurred.
The Mueller report is not the work of real prosecutors. It is the work of political operatives. Indeed, some congressional Democrats are even touting the report as a roadmap for impeachment. But what high crime or misdemeanor has the president committed? We know that it wasn’t obstruction of justice. So what exactly did he do?
For almost a full year before the appointment of the Special Counsel, Trump-Russia collusion had been investigated by James Comey’s FBI and Loretta Lynch’s Justice Department. In May 2017, when he was debating whether to join Team Mueller, FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok (who had participated in that investigation) texted FBI lawyer Lisa Page that, when it came to Trump-Russia collusion, “my gut sense and concern is there’s no big there there.” Nevertheless, Strzok and Page joined Team Mueller to continue the previous collusion investigation.
This, of course, raises the question of why Team Mueller took so long to re-investigate what had already been investigated for a year by the FBI and DOJ. Was it because they wanted to draw out their investigation in the hope that, under the barrage of baseless media and Democrat accusations of treason, Trump would crack and close down their investigation? Were they hoping to goad the president into taking the fatal step of blocking or shutting down their interminable investigation that could justify obstruction charges?
If so, they failed. And that failure appears to be one of the motives behind their poison pen report and their speculative musings about the obstruction that could have been if only Trump had taken the bait.
Moreover, in looking at the composition of Mueller’s handpicked team — which included Strzok, Page, a lawyer who previously represented the Clinton Foundation, lawyers who had contributed to Clinton’s presidential campaign, and a host of other Clintonistas — it appears that Trump correctly concluded that the special counsel’s investigation was a slanted, politically motivated continuation of the deep state’s efforts to undermine his campaign and, failing that, to remove him from office. This impression would have been further reinforced by the fact that the special counsel was a friend and former colleague of the treacherous James Comey under whom the FBI had launched its effort to clear Hillary Clinton of clearly warranted criminal charges and to frame Trump.
So, when Trump complained bitterly about the Mueller investigation and sought to derail or curtail it, he was, in reality, addressing what we now know was a continuation of the deep state plan to defeat Trump at the polls and, failing that, to undo the result of the 2016 election.
Consequently, as Team Mueller passes the get-Trump baton to the Democrats in Congress, it is fair to ask exactly what was Trump supposedly obstructing? To anyone willing to look at the evidence, the answer is clear. Trump’s anger and efforts were directed at the deep state’s ongoing attempted coup d’état.
So, to all those congressional Democrats threatening impeachment, here’s a news flash:
If you are looking for a high crime and misdemeanor to justify impeachment, there is no such crime as “obstruction of coup”. As a matter of fact, obstruction of coup would seem to be a patriotic act for which the president should be praised not impeached.
That’s the bad news, and, for Democrats, it only gets worse. Now that we have a sentient adult running the Justice Department, the true facts about the state sponsored coup are about to be unearthed. And, when that happens, Team Mueller’s shameful report will become an insignificant albeit sleazy footnote to the exposure and massive cleansing of the deep state that is about to occur.

Paul Kengor: The Burning of Notre Dame Is Symbolic of Something Much More Tragic,spectator.org,Paul G. Kengor,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/frances-failure/https://www.faithandfreedom.com/frances-faith-frances-loss,"Share on Facebook Share Tweet Print
The image of the Cathedral of Notre Dame engulfed in flames will remain seared in memories. I was made aware of it when a student burst into my office shouting that the magnificent church was on fire. I was about to head into my Major European Governments course, where we read George Weigel’s prescient work, “The Cube and the Cathedral.” The Cathedral in the book is Notre Dame.
As the ensuing minutes proceeded, the conflagration only worsened, captured by the cataclysmic moment when the towering spire collapsed. It took me back to watching the collapse of the World Trade Center tower on 9/11, though that was worse because you knew you were witnessing not just the death of a structure but a significant number of human beings.
With Notre Dame, we figured there was probably no one trapped inside. The fire proceeded slowly enough for people to get out — in fact, so slowly that I was surely one of countless millions watching on a computer, a TV, a phone, yelling in frustration: What are the French authorities doing? Can’t they stop this? Meanwhile, the flames encroached upon the relics, the artifacts, the windows, the paintings, the irreplaceable — upon what is believed to be the actual crown of thorns of Christ. On Holy Week no less. Advertisement - story continues below
It was a feeling of helplessness. And in that sense, it was a frustration similar to what many of us have felt toward the French authorities for a long time, as they’ve eagerly embraced secularism and rejected the very Christian patrimony represented by the Cathedral of Notre Dame. The burning cathedral, and the state’s seeming inability to stop the blaze, seemed a harsh symbol of France’s vanishing religious heritage.
Angela Merkel, one of the few European leaders unafraid of tradition, observed that Notre Dame is “a symbol of France and of our European culture.” It certainly is. Its erection was just that, as was its survival through centuries of struggles, as is its smoldering now. TRENDING: Holy Week: Did You Ever Wonder Why They Call It ‘Maundy Thursday’?
Hilaire Belloc said that “the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith.” Well, the Christian faith is in worse shape in Europe than at any time since the first stones of Notre Dame were laid eight-and-a-half centuries ago. And in many respects, France has led the way in the aggressive secularization. Numerous glorious Parisian churches today stand mainly as tourist attractions.
Recall a defining moment at the turn of this new century. In the early 2000s, a battle raged within the European Union over whether to include a reference to God in the EU constitution. It was a natural acknowledgment, a critical reminder to Europeans of where their rights come from. Advertisement - story continues below
The God opponents were the predictable European progressives: leftist Eurocrats in Brussels, Labor Party atheists in Britain, German socialists, Scandinavians, and, of course, the French leadership. The God supporters included new EU member states that had escaped godless communism — with Poland in the forefront, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic — and the continent’s preeminent religious figure: Pope John Paul II.
The pope, suffering from advanced Parkinson’s, took up the fight with vigor. In the summer of 2003, he devoted a series of Sunday Angelus addresses to this political issue that transcended politics.
He made arguments akin to those made by the American Founding Fathers: It is crucial for citizens living under a constitution to understand the ultimate source from which their rights derive: their rights come not from government but God. What government gives, government can take away. What God gives, government cannot take away.
“European culture cannot be understood without referring back to Christianity,” explained John Paul II. “Christianity is at the very roots of European culture.” He said that “an explicit recognition of the Christian roots of Europe” would represent “the principal guarantee for the continent’s future.”
The pope was countered by French president Jacques Chirac, who sniffed: “France is a lay state, and as such she does not have a habit of calling for insertions of a religious nature into constitutional texts.” The “lay character” of France’s government and public institutions, according to Chirac, simply did “not allow” for a reference to God in a constitution. Advertisement - story continues below
Nope, no room for God, insisted the president of France in spearheading the continental revolt. It was predictable Jacques Chirac, who in retrospect seems like Joan of Arc compared to Francois Hollande or Emmanuel Macron. So goes France.
In the end, the EU compromised on a gutless statement grudgingly conceding the continent’s “cultural, religious, and humanist inheritance.” It was a nod to God that George Weigel described as “so bland as to be meaningless.” RELATED: France Protests Should Be a Warning to American Politicians Who Ignore the Forgotten Man
But, in an important way, it was not meaningless. It was sadly symbolic. Again, Belloc: “the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith.” Well, the state of the faith in much of Europe is in flames.
That brings us back to the Cathedral of Notre Dame, Anno Domini 2019, the day after Palm Sunday. We do not yet know what caused this tragic episode, nor whether the authorities and responders could have done a better job preventing the sickening level of destruction. Advertisement - story continues below
Let me repeat: I don’t know whether the authorities and responders could have done a better job. Maybe they did a great job. Maybe what was saved was spared because of its original architecture. I don’t know.
Nonetheless, this seems, at the least, an undeniable symbol of France’s loss of its Christian heritage and its failure to protect its Christian heritage. In this case, the pinnacle of its Christian heritage.
The Easter season is about hope, about a Redeemer who rises again. If there’s a particular hope for Europe this Holy Week, it’s that the Cathedral of Notre Dame will be resurrected. And yet, given the state of modern France, it’s hard to be hopeful about what will replace it.
We can’t go wrong placing our faith in the inspiration of that cathedral, but we will always find disappointment in the secular authorities who seek to replace it. The former stood strong for over 800 years; the latter will fail us again and again. Advertisement - story continues below

"Losers, Welded Together | The American Spectator",spectator.org,Scott Mckay,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/losers-welded-together/,"by William Murchison
There is a quite obvious conclusion to be drawn from the release Thursday of the Mueller report — namely, that the entire investigation undertaken by special counsel Robert Mueller over the allegation that President Trump’s campaign was in cahoots with the Russians and therefore engaged in treason was a made-up ruse for the purpose of weaponizing the government against the candidate of an opposition party.
Mueller found no evidence not just of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, but between Russia and any American citizens. The report did uncover evidence of meddling by Russia in the 2016 election, which was anything but surprising — there has been Russian meddling in American elections since the Russian Revolution of 1917. But after almost two years and millions of dollars spent, the lack of any substance behind the Trump-Russia meme the Democrat Party has staked its political future on should shock every American to the core.
We now know that the Obama administration engaged in an abuse of power which makes Watergate look like a third-rate burglary. It colluded with Hillary Clinton’s campaign to use paid-for opposition research the latter knew or at least highly suspected was a pack of lies to fraudulently obtain FISA warrants to spy on guiltless American citizens, and it participated in a counterintelligence frameup to provide a pretext for prosecuting an unwitting Trump adviser named George Papadopoulos, who was fed a rumor that Russia hacked Clinton’s emails and ultimately spent 14 days in jail after being caught in a perjury trap over his having regurgitated the rumor to another party.
It’s not an overreaction to see this horrific and dastardly abuse of power as the most dangerous scandal in American history. Watergate, Teapot Dome, Iran-Contra — none of them cut so deeply into the framework of our constitutional traditions with so much corruption at the highest levels.
It is this recognition which should dominate the reaction to the Mueller report. Not just that it found no evidence of collusion but the abusive attempt at a frame-up lying under the entire investigation, which is now laid bare for anyone willing to see it.
And yet the NeverTrump faction within the Republican Party refuses to recognize the frightening corruption of the Obama-Clinton axis it’s now impossible to ignore. On Friday, Mitt Romney — the junior senator from Utah and the failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee — issued forth his reaction to the Mueller report:
It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on.
Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russian — including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine.
Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders.
Hogwash and balderdash, with decency preventing a more descriptive term to describe Romney’s perfidious scoldings of a Republican president.
Yes, the Mueller report contains lots of embarrassing stories about Trump’s reactions to the Russian collusion frame-up as it was presented to him, and yes, those stories indicate a president driven half-mad over the lengths his political adversaries would go in an effort to destroy his presidency.
For Romney to focus on those breaks from decorum — actions which did not follow from Trump’s intemperate words thanks to the success of his staffers in keeping him in check — rather than the true nature of the Trump-Russia hoax shows that he’s learned nothing in political life. He’s intentionally missing the forest for the trees, and this after he was beaten by a political movement and an administration which shamelessly slandered him as a racist and sexist despiser of the poor. You would think Romney would have commiserated with Trump over the treatment both shared at the hands of the Obama cabal.
But no.
And Romney’s friend William Weld, who like Romney was a mediocre Republican Massachusetts governor with a poor record as a candidate for federal office — Weld was the vice-presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party in 2016, a ticket faring a whole lot worse than Romney’s GOP slate in 2012 — followed up Mitt’s ankle-biting of Trump with his own attack on the president’s poor form. Weld took to MSNBC and in true pet-conservative fashion called Trump a “ one-man crime wave ,” something more in keeping with his status as a wannabe primary challenger with no more chance to become president than he had as Gary Johnson’s sidekick three years ago.
Republicans are the party of people who want politics to play a smaller role in our lives. But that doesn’t excuse having such pantywaists and losers carrying its standard. If Romney and Weld can’t defend a Republican president, even one as crude as Trump with his Irish up, under such vicious and abusive attack from the Obama administration and the Deep State, then they deserve not a shred of loyalty or deference from conservative Americans.
Sickened? Romney’s sanctimony is sickening. That’s why he isn’t president and never will be. That’s an office not for the weak. It’s too bad Senate seats in Utah aren’t similarly restricted. "
The Tom Perez Hypocrisy: No One Is Above the Law — Except Hillary,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-tom-perez-hypocrisy-no-one-is-above-the-law-except-hillary/,"You just have to love the boldness of it all.
There is Democratic National Chairman Tom Perez — on Fox News no less — saying this :
Tom Perez: No one — not even President Trump — is above the law following Mueller report revelations
Says Mr. Perez:
History will not be kind to this president, nor will it forget the cowards and criminals who enabled him.
But history will also remember the courage of those who stood for the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy. It will remember leaders who put country over party, activists who march and make their voices heard, and voters who use the power of the ballot box to hold this administration accountable.
Justice is blind and no one is above the law.
Catch that last sentence? This one? “Justice is blind and no one is above the law.”
Right.
Let’s take a stroll down memory lane. Beginning with this headline from Roll Call in September of 2015:
Cornyn: DOJ Should Assign Special Counsel to Clinton Emails
The No. 2 Republican in the Senate wants a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of State.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, entered the fray over the emails Tuesday in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
“Secretary Clinton denied publicly that she transmitted classified information and violated government policy, both of which proved untrue. Secretary Clinton’s lawyers made their own determinations as to which of the emails on her server were government records and deleted the remainder — tens of thousands of documents,” Cornyn wrote Tuesday. “And the former campaign staffer who set up the server, who would subsequently be employed both by the State Department and Secretary Clinton privately, has invoked the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to avoid providing information to government investigators.”
Then there was this headline in the Washington Post in July of 2016:
GOP congressmen call for new independent counsel, to probe Clinton again
Reads the story:
Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) became the first Republican to call for a new, independent investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of email during her years at the State Department, saying in a statement that the defunct independent counsel statute should be revived to “make an independent and impartial decision” about whether Clinton should be charged.
“The investigation by the FBI is steeped in political bias, especially considering that former president Bill Clinton met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch just days before the FBI announced its decision,” Turner said. “The role of the independent counsel is to keep investigations honest and prosecutorial decisions independent of the political, personal and financial conflicts of interest that undermine accountability in government. It is time for Secretary Clinton to be held accountable for her extremely careless actions.”
Not an hour later, Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), who is retiring this year, made a similar request.
A full year later in July of 2017 there was this headline at CNBC:
House Republicans call for a second special counsel — to investigate Clinton, Comey and Lynch
This story began:
House Judiciary Committee Republicans on Thursday called for a new special counsel — to investigate Hillary Clinton , James Comey and Loretta Lynch.
In a letter addressed to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Republicans said they were writing to “request assistance in restoring public confidence in our nation’s justice system and its investigators, specifically the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).”…
“The unbalanced, uncertain, and seemingly unlimited focus of the special counsel’s investigation has led many of our constituents to see a dual standard of justice that benefits only the powerful and politically well-connected,” the letter said. “For this reason, we call on you to appoint a second special counsel to investigate a plethora of matters connected to the 2016 election and its aftermath, including actions taken by previously public figures like Attorney General Loretta Lynch, FBI Director James Comey, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.’”
Then there was this headline over at Fox from a November, 2017 Sean Hannity show:
Congressmen call for a special counsel to probe Clinton
Said Hannity that night:
HANNITY: To me, Congressman (Matt) Gaetz, it is this serious. Are we going to have an America today, a dual justice system, or will we have equal justice under the law? Because if I deleted 30,000 emails that were subpoenaed by Congress, if I used BleachBit, if I’d destroy devices with a hammer, if I — how does the FBI Director Mueller at the time, no Russian agents of Putin are trying to corner the uranium market?
GAETZ: Sean, you are absolutely right, and this is what makes the American people sick. This notion that there is one set of rules for the Clintons and another set of rules for everybody else.
Move on to just last month, March of 2019, and here is the headline in the Washington Times :
Special counsel demanded to probe FBI handling of Hillary probe.
This story begins:
Sen. Lindsey Graham called Thursday for Congress to create a special counsel to probe the FBI and Justice Department, saying evidence is mounting that they treated Hillary Clinton more leniently than they did President Trump during the 2016 election campaign.
Mr. Graham made the call as newly released documents show the extent of anti- Trump sentiment among FBI employees who were instrumental in handling the investigation into Mrs. Clinton ’s secret email server and in launching the Russia investigation that turned into Robert Mueller’s special counsel probe.
There’s more out there like these stories that stretch over the last four years — oh so much more. And what do every single one of them have in common?
That would be the silence of now-DNC Chair Tom Perez. The very self-same Tom Perez who now goes to Fox News to ostentatiously proclaim:
History will not be kind to this president, nor will it forget the cowards and criminals who enabled him.
But history will also remember the courage of those who stood for the rule of law and the integrity of our democracy. It will remember leaders who put country over party, activists who march and make their voices heard, and voters who use the power of the ballot box to hold this administration accountable.
Justice is blind and no one is above the law.
As an example of sheer, bold hypocrisy, Perez is Oscar-worthy material. Time after time after time one senator or congressman after another — not to mention Sean Hannity and so many others — have made the exact case that Perez claims to be making: that “justice is blind and no one is above the law.” And yet Perez has been quieter than a church mouse under anesthesia. The real Perez message: investigate Donald Trump and everybody that surrounds him — family, friends, business associates.
But leave Hillary Clinton alone.
In short, Tom Perez, in the most cynical style possible, has just vividly illustrated that he doesn’t believe a single word he says when saying that “Justice is blind and no one is above the law.”
Sean Hannity had it exactly right when he asked this question:
“Are we going to have an America today, a dual justice system, or will we have equal justice under the law?”
If Tom Perez gets his way, the answer is crystal clear. There is one set of rules for President Trump — and another set of rules entirely for Hillary Clinton and all of Tom Perez’s friends.
The Perez message has been received.
And it will backfire. Big time.
Thanks for the assist, Chairman Perez."
Time to Ban Irving Berlin’s ‘White Christmas’,spectator.org,Paul Kengor,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/time-to-ban-irving-berlins-white-christmas/,"Time to Ban Irving Berlin’s ‘White Christmas’ Why stop with Kate Smith? by Brandon J. Weichert
Kate Smith, legendary singer of “God Bless America,” has been blacklisted in New York and Philadelphia, and surely in more liberal bastions to come. The Yankees have banished her from the seventh-inning stretch, killing an inspiring tradition at Yankee Stadium since September 11, 2001. As for Philadelphia, home of the First Amendment, self-proclaimed city of freedom and brotherly love, its progressives have covered their statue of Smith , and the Flyers will no longer boom Kate’s rallying voice during must-win hockey games. Surely it’s only a matter of time before the wrecking ball comes for Kate.
One wonders if New York and Philly liberals can scare up any photos of Kate to airbrush, including those pictures from World War II, where she helped sell $600 million worth of war bonds to defeat the Nazis.
What did the long-deceased Smith do to earn such ignominy? Kate’s offense is a racial one. As the New York Post put it , it has been discovered that Smith in the 1930s performed two songs that “contain racist language and references,” namely “That’s Why Darkies Were Born” and “Pickaninnies’ Heaven.”
Thus, the left’s Torquemadas of tolerance have henceforth proclaimed Kate Smith anathema. Not only must Smith be punished, but her “God Bless America” must be banned. She falls into the New Left’s Orwellian category of non-person. She’s finished.
In no time, the left will demand that Smith’s Presidential Medal of Freedom be revoked, too. President Donald Trump should do so pronto. If he refuses, then he’s an unregenerate racist.
There must be zero-tolerance and no place in public life for singers with racially offensive lyrics in their past, no matter what the era.
Hence, this being so, I’m here to help liberals in this crusade. I’d like to submit for trial the great Irving Berlin, and especially his “White Christmas.”
What? You’re confused? Well, allow me to assist these sages of history and culture.
Kate Smith’s “God Bless America” was written by the wonderful Irving Berlin. Here’s Berlin singing it on the Ed Sullivan Show . Watch it. Beautiful, eh? It brings tears to my eyes. Yours as well?
Well, if so, that’s unacceptable. You need to be enlightened.
You see, Berlin is likewise guilty of musically racial insensitivities.
I happened upon a Berlin heresy by accident. For several years, since my family was given a copy of the DVD as a Christmas present, we’ve watched the classic movie Holiday Inn . This is the original where Bing Crosby first sings Berlin’s magical “White Christmas.” Berlin did the entire score.
Among the musical numbers in the show is a clownishly awful “blackface” routine, where Bing and Marjorie Reynolds dance and sing a piece called “Abraham.” For the record, I don’t like the piece, and neither do my kids. Personally, ever since I was a kid in the 1970s I’ve been baffled by the old blackface routines. I hated them and never understood their appeal. (Of course, I better here say that, and say so emphatically, covering myself in sackcloth and ashes, lest a cabal of progressive priests and priestesses from the Ministry of Truth show up at my door with torches demanding I publicly repent.)
The “Abraham” piece uses the word “darkie” (one of Kate Smith’s sins) along with many other stereotypes that will make a modern snowflake melt. Watch it here .
And yet, what’s interesting about that number is the civics lesson it aimed to teach at the time. The lyrics celebrate Abraham Lincoln for freeing the slaves and liberating African-Americans. It’s a glowing tribute to Lincoln’s signature accomplishment. It’s why Lincoln is remembered as one of our top presidents. Joining in the singing is the African-American woman who plays the role of cook at the Holiday Inn , along with her two little children. That actress is the legendary Louise Beavers , a civil rights fighter in her own right, later inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.
My youngest son, who is black (half-black), looked at that scene attentively the last time we watched it. When we haven’t skipped past the scene, I’ve paused to explain to my kids what Lincoln did, how blacks were oppressed, and why we should honor Lincoln. Indeed, there’s much irony in the scene: Typically, in our current politics, the blackface offender is expected to be a southerner touting the Confederacy and denouncing Lincoln. Here, we have Bing Crosby, northerner, celebrating (with three African-Americans) the North’s victory over the South in freeing black Americans from bondage. Much as I don’t like the whole performance, and that Bing and Marjorie Reynolds look ridiculous, the original civics lesson was undeniably meant to be positive.
As for the actors and actresses, the producer, the director, the composer, the choreographer, they surely thought they were doing a good thing. I doubt that deliberate racism was intended, certainly not by the three African-American performers. But we now know better. They must all be considered racists.
Thus, the same, we must suppose, shall be asserted for the person responsible for the music. And who was that? Well, again, that’s where this gets especially intriguing — in light of the left’s blacklisting of Kate Smith. The music and lyrics were composed by the iconic Irving Berlin, who in 1943 received his one and only Academy Award for his musical work on the film. As one of my Jewish friends often fondly notes to me, the most famous Christmas song ever, “White Christmas,” was written by Berlin, a Jewish man. It was a testimony to Berlin’s true ecumenism and respect for others. Irving Berlin was a great American. God bless him.
Of course, that’s how we used to think in the old America — before the wheels of progress surged forward to enlighten us in 2019. Now I need to seize that DVD and tell the kids it must be banished from our home. We can’t watch it anymore. Maybe we can ceremonially burn it. I do have some Mark Twain books around here that we could use as kindling.
I hope that the good progressives at Netflix, Amazon Prime, Turner Classic Movies, etc., will likewise do their due diligence and remove this film from not only their offerings but their archives. As they do, they will hopefully be vigilant in searching out and purging other classics with blackface renditions. Hollywood’s liberals should also get to work in removing Irving Berlin’s one and only Academy Award for this affront. No excuses! Take it away!
And New Yorkers especially need to take swift action against Mr. Berlin.
Of course, needless to say, “White Christmas” is a song that has nothing to do with race. Yes. But neither does “God Bless America.” Remember, the sin being charged here by the Church of Liberalism is not against “God Bless America” but against Kate Smith. She sang songs (none of which she probably wrote) that included racially insensitive language. Thus, her version of “God Bless America” must be torched. Well, then, the same reprisals must be levied against Irving Berlin, who actually sang and wrote such songs (as did Bing Crosby). If Kate’s “God Bless America” thus can’t be aired, then neither should Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas.”
In fact, I bet if we look harder, we might find more offensive songs not only by Berlin but by other legendary composers. Let’s start digging, shall we? Perhaps some ambitious inquisitor at Comrade Bill de Blasio’s or Angry Andrew Cuomo’s Office of Tolerance and Diversity can begin the research. They can post a blacklist outside their offices. Better start immediately. We need to know which persons are acceptable.
Various times I’ve stepped off the train at Penn Station at Christmas time and heard Berlin’s “White Christmas” piped into the air. It has always been so touching. But that was the Old America. In the New America, New Yorkers will hopefully spring into action to ensure that Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas” is no longer played in public places.
(Incidentally, are there any Irving Berlin statues anywhere?)
Whoa, what is that I hear? Protests by liberals? Second thoughts? Too bad. Sorry, liberals, but these are your rules, not mine. Live by them.

SAFED, ISRAEL The burning of “chametz” on morning prior to Passover. (Pesach) (Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by Brandon J. Weichert
A guy is waiting for his date to get ready so they can go to a baseball game. She knows nothing about the sport and takes forever, and they arrive at the stadium horribly late. As they settle into their seats, the fellow next to them exclaims: “I have never seen anything like this! It is the top of the fourteenth inning, and neither side has had a runner on base — two perfect games going. Not a single run. Not a single error. Not a single hit. Not even a single walk. Nothing!” The date looks at the angry guy who brought her and says: “See! We haven’t missed a thing!”
These past ten days I have been deeply immersed in preparations for the Pesach (Passover) holiday, then conducted two public community Seder events, conducted prayer services, and observed the first two holy days of Pesach week. Through these ten days I have followed the news but have had no time to write. And what did I miss?
Not a damned thing.
It has been Mueller for two years, and it will be Mueller for another two years. It has been Democrats trying for two years to destroy the President, and it will be Democrats trying for another two years to destroy the President. Nothing new under the sun. “That which hath been is that which shall be, and that which hath been done is that which shall be done; and there is nothing new under the sun.” Eccl . 1:9. If one were to give a name to this story, my suggestion would be: The Mueller, the Sun, and the Donkey .
While nothing changed these past ten days or so, lots seems worth observing:
1. The Democrats Never Will Be Able to Wrap Their Heads Around the Reality That Other People Live Outside Their Echo Chamber.
When I attended Columbia University as an undergrad in the 1970s, the students’ daily newspaper polled the university campus shortly before the impending 1972 Presidential elections. George McGovern, the Democrat, got something like 90 percent of the vote. Gus Hall, the Communist for whom Obama’s CIA chief, John Brennan, voted (talk about treason and colluding with the Russians!), came in second. Richard Nixon did not do too well. Nevertheless, when the rest of the country voted in the real election, Nixon won the biggest landslide in American history. So how did the Columbia Daily Spectator poll get it so wrong?
The poll was not wrong within the leftist echo chamber… echo chamber… echo chamber of Columbia University. But others live outside the leftist bubble.
Democrats and their Left appendages — the Mediacracy, Hollywood, and Broadway, academia — are suffused with totalitarian Leftist dogma, doctrine, and dominance. A conservative cannot get hired beyond “spot work” in most of these fields, and will not get re-hired if too vocal about what he or she believes. Even Harvard Prof. Emeritus Alan Dershowitz got canned by CNN after he expressed sensible views questioning the Mueller probe; he was replaced for expert legal analysis by Michael Avenatti, whose expertise has been augmented in recent weeks as he continues learning about all kinds of new criminal charges. Thus, journalists speak to each other, and they all vote Democrat. Hollywood, and Broadway award shows — Oscars, Emmys, Tonys — are dominated by virtue-signaling speeches condemning the President and mocking wholesome traditional American values. At universities, free speech is shut down so completely that, beyond efforts to keep Ben Shapiro and Ann Coulter off campus, the few conservative faculty who are hired need to keep their opinions to themselves for professional survival.
Against that backdrop, Democrats cannot figure out how Trump got elected in 2016. Everyone they know voted for Hillary or Jill Stein. Everyone who knows anyone they know voted that way. How could Trump have won unless there was massive cheating?
Nothing ever will convince Democrats and their Left appendages that half the country thinks differently from them, thinks Trump has Made the White House Great Again, and voted for Trump because Trump was a good choice, and Hillary was a loathsome choice.
2. The Democrats Will Not Stop Hounding, Harassing, and Persecuting Trump Until Election Day 2020.
Mort Sahl once said: “All because I am a paranoid, that does not mean that they are not out to get me.” And all because Trump is made of the strongest mettle and toughest emotional exterior, it does not mean that he is not being persecuted. They are persecuting and trying to break him, just as fictional characters in Atlas Shrugged tried to break Hank Rearden, as others tried to break Howard Roark in The Fountainhead and Kira Argounova in We the Living . They are intent on destroying him because the Democrats cannot accept that Trump won fairly.
No one has a right to see his taxes. No American law requires it. At the time the Constitution was ratified, there were no income taxes. No Constitutional amendment ever has added a requirement for anyone to release taxes. Rather, it devolves onto candidates to weigh costs and benefits, risks and rewards of releasing their private tax filings for public scrutiny. Trump took the risk in 2016, and the Democrats made that financial opacity a campaign issue. It was litigated thoroughly. Yet Trump was elected President — end of story.
All that matters is whether Trump is a great President. Hillary’s decision to release her taxes in 2016 did not make her less a crook or any less pathological a liar who lied even about how her mother named her. Obama’s release of tax returns did not negate his corrupt real-estate dealings with Tony Rezko, a convicted felon. Bernie Sanders, millionaire, is a hypocrite. Irish-Scottish Robert O’Rourke is a liar who gives almost no charity. We knew that without their taxes.
Trump lawfully refuses to disclose his personal and corporate taxes. The law does not and should not deter other quality corporate CEOs from running for President in the future.
3. There Was No Collusion.
There was no collusion.
4. There Was No Obstruction of Justice.
Attorneys know that certain clients ask whether they may do certain things that should not be done. In each case, competent attorneys counsel that such misbehavior is improper or illegal. That advice typically nixes the thought.
A person does no wrong when asking a lawyer to act, and the attorney educates the client when such request is improper or inadvisable. That is what lawyers — other than the “Cash Cab” Cohens and Avaricious Avenattis — are there for. Attorneys study to acquire a deeper knowledge of the law and life experience in actual practice matures their judgment. When a client inclines towards an inadvisable step, he will be steered away by competent counsel. If he then proceeds to act foolishly on his own, that is his bad. To the degree that President Trump asked anyone to do anything that conflicts with Robert Mueller’s sense of justice, the President never proceeded to countermand his attorneys and act unilaterally against their advice. Thus, he kept saying he would agree to a Mueller interview, but his lawyers wisely steered him otherwise. And so it was when he sought to have Mueller removed or Sessions “un-recused.”
Nor would there have been anything legally wrong if he had fired Mueller. Yes, it would have been politically hazardous, but legally permitted. He is the President. He is the chief executive officer. He can fire Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, Omarosa, Ryan Zinke, Kirstjen Nielsen, Sean Spicer, Jeff Sessions, James Comey. If he fires foolishly, voters will replace him after a term. History now demonstrates that Comey was a duplicitous bad player and had to be fired. The President had every lawful right to fire Mueller. Mueller had conflicts and assembled a team of pro-Hillary “hit men” and other Democrat donors. That is not obstruction of justice. It would have been bad politics to fire Mueller, and Trump was persuaded so.
Nor was it illegal for a novice in the law like Trump to ask Jeff Sessions to “un-recuse” himself. For lay people, all it takes is a few episodes of “Billions” to suggest that a United States Attorney can recuse himself from a case, then secretly un-recuse. Trump is not a legal expert; that is why he hires attorneys. He consistently deferred to them. Nothing he did obstructed justice.
5. This All Is a Good Thing.
In preparation for Passover, Orthodox Jews are bidden to remove all “ chametz ” from our homes, offices, and possessions. “ Chametz ” includes breadstuffs, pastas, and a wide variety of grain-based leavened products. Even non-grain products are forbidden if produced in contact with “ chametz .” Through the entirety of Pesach, “ chametz ” may not be seen or found in our possession. So we “carb up” and consume the stuff in our pantries, we clean and vacuum our homes like OCD poster kids, and we sell whatever “ chametz ” remains to a non-Jewish friend.
Despite all that, we go on our hands and knees the night before Passover, assuring the place is pitch-dark, light a candle, and then crawl along all walls throughout our homes, looking into crevices — whatever — in one final search for any last crumbs we might have missed. If we find crumbs, we burn them the next morning. For that one moment each year, it is Atkins/Keto Diet Nirvana. And then we bring out the matzo.
For the past two years, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings, Robert Mueller, Jerrold Nadler, Maxine Waters, CNN and MSNBC and the New York Times and Washington Post and all the rest of those dregs have been searching for the chametz in Trump’s cabinet. They bounced Sessions, imported Mueller and Weissman, got Clapper and Communist Gus Hall’s John Brennan who was Obama’s CIA chief, brought in Avenatti and Cash Cab Cohen, Omarosa here, James Comey there, Strzok and Page and McCabe — dreck in and dreck out — and they have not found a morsel. They will not stop.
If President Trump, his family, and associates can hold the fort, this persecution will become a blessing. The House Democrats were elected to pursue an agenda, and they utterly have become consumed with taking down Trump. Like a bee that knows instinctively that it will die if it stings — but stings anyway because it just cannot help itself — these Democrats will waste the next year searching for chametz in the Mueller report, in taxes, in cupboards, and in crevices. They are incapable of focusing on anything else.
They lost the House in 2010 (242-193). Lost it in 2012 (234-201). Lost it in 2014 (247-188). Lost it in 2016 (241-194). Since being given a chance in 2018 to show their stuff, the Democrats have continued reminding voters daily why they got thrown out for a decade. Even a moronic electorate will not reelect representatives who consume themselves with their own little inside games while neglecting the public weal.
Let the Democrat Left totalitarians search for crumbs to their hearts’ content. Accept that this is what the next year will be. In time, they will turn on Biden. They will turn on each other. They finally will expose O’Rourke as an Irish-Scottish Fake Mexican. They will expose Bernie as a millionaire hypocrite who also is a White male unworthy of the party of Stacey Abrams. They will get nauseous every time Klobuchar holds a comb. One by one, they will fall — if not all like Ten Little Indians, certainly Lizzie Warren. Meanwhile, Nadler and Waters and Schiff will keep searching.
It will catch up with them. And it will be a good thing."
Refusing to Admit When We Are Wrong Has Become an American Crisis,spectator.org,Greg Jones,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/refusing-to-admit-when-we-are-wrong-has-become-an-american-crisis/,"by Andrew Harrod
Reading the headlines these days, it seems America is besieged by countless threats.
China, deficits, a broken educational system, there’s no shortage of monsters under our proverbial bed intent on doing us in. But lurking in the shadows, virtually unnoticed, is a cultural trend that has become so ensconced in our national dialogue that it borders on scientific law.
I’m referring to the refusal of politically passionate Americans to admit when they are wrong; whole sectors of American society now prefer to simply ignore the mountains of evidence contradicting claims they hold dear or, more commonly, to insult the messenger.
For proof look no further than social media. The comment sections of major publications are filled with vitriolic debates in which participants double down on their disproven assertions and viciously label their detractors as somehow deceitful for questioning a claim. Personal posts often evolve into all-out war.
Quotes and statistics are met with rebuttals of “Fox News” or “racist,” source-shaming and accusations of bigotry being the last refuge of the weak-minded (I myself have been accused of being a Russian bot no less than a thousand times).
Not so long ago ceding the point was considered the mark of a decent human being. But the times they have a’ changed, and these days decency sadly plays second fiddle to a dent in one’s pride or, more likely, one’s political perspective.
In America’s current hyperpartisan state, the thinking seems to be that so long as your cause is just, the truth is irrelevant.
Perhaps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez put it best when she lamented that “… there’s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.”
“Lot” is a subjective term, but regardless of the actual number there is little doubt it’s a population in stark decline. And politicians and their co-conspirators in the mainstream media are doing the poaching.
Consider Candace Owens’ recent exchange with Representatives Ted Lieu and Jerry Nadler, in which the former purposely misrepresented Owens’ views on nationalism, after which the latter scolded her for courageously calling out Lieu’s deception.
As the footage clearly shows it was Owens who was factually correct, but because her morals contradict the modern left’s the two “gentlemen” representatives felt no need to acknowledge their disingenuity.
But what do we expect? After all, Lieu and Nadler are both members of the same Democrat cabal that assured us, for two years, that Robert Mueller’s report investigating foreign interference in the 2016 Presidential election would bring down the Trump administration. When it failed to do so Mueller’s former cheerleaders transformed, overnight, into naysayers.
They knew well that their minions in the media wouldn’t hold them accountable for their flip floppery, as they too were instrumental in the long con.
From MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow to CNN’s Don Lemon , primetime talking heads insisted that perhaps the most thorough political investigation in American history, which they once championed, was somehow botched.
Despite stringing along the American people for ratings and pushing partisan propaganda as fact, there have been no major mea culpas. No apologies. No promises to do better. Just accusations of a cover-up and demands to see the full report, all of which resulted in more nothingburgers and yet more failure to admit their entire narrative was just a very sad, and very expensive, conspiracy theory.
In fact, the collusion investigation itself was almost certainly the product of Democrats’ refusal to admit they simply ran a poor candidate; rather than fess up to their own poor judgement, however, they went low and invented their Russian boogeyman.
Other examples abound. It took a $250 million lawsuit for the Washington Post to admit any wrongdoing in its coverage of the Covington High School kids. And despite skyrocketing premiums and fleeing insurers, some still feel the need to defend Obamacare.
If the media, and our leaders, drive opinions, as they clearly do, citizens need them to come clean when they are clearly wrong. But the partisanship of our pundits and politicians has justified a Machiavellian strategy adopted by millions of Americans in the name of justice.
To be fair, this isn’t just a liberal phenomenon. Even today some conservative pundits stand by the decision to invade Iraq which, while guided by bad intelligence, was a clear mistake in hindsight.
But liberals’ reliance on identity politics, and their hatred for the man who defeated their beloved Hillary, has disproportionately affected their ability to realize their own biases. Or, more importantly, to acknowledge them.
After all, we are a country built on the “marketplace of ideas,” in which all ideas are welcome but only the best win out.
But what is even the point of robust debate if half the population refuses to acknowledge the evidence that some ideas are indeed better than others? Or that some “facts,” no matter how strongly one wants them to be true, aren’t facts at all?
Being wrong occasionally is no sin; If there’s one thing we can surely all agree on, it’s that no one is infallible, and shouldn’t be expected to be.
You might think I’m being naive, and all of this is simply politics as usual. But the state of our discourse is such that families and friendships have been torn apart over online political arguments and pundits on both sides of the aisle are openly contemplating a Second Civil War.
If that’s “politics as usual,” we need to do better. It’s past time we cede the point to those who deserve it and make our discourse great again. "
The Good of Impeachment Would Be…?,spectator.org,William Murchison,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-good-of-impeachment-would-be/,"by Scott McKay
All right, then, impeachment — a matter resting on the national dining table in plain view. Who wants to cut into and serve it?
Rep. Maxine Waters does. “What more do (Democrats) need to prove?” she inquires in the aftermath of the Mueller report’s release. The value of impeachment, a double-edged weapon — no less likely to cut the wielder than the victim, the purpose of a national row louder and more divisive than we’ve been in for decades — here’s what needs proving, it seems to me. We have some ways to go here.
Notice the progression of moves when it comes to impeachment.
First, the House of Representatives, controlled by Waters’ party, draws up and introduces articles of impeachment. The real fun begins here. Battle over the articles commences, Democrats accusing Donald Trump of Lord-knows-what all by the time the cannonading commences, Republicans answering in kind.
Then the call for a vote. All in favor! All opposed! Either the thing passes or it doesn’t. If it doesn’t (due to Democratic defections from the Waters enterprise), the Democrats gain nothing from the whole circus. They’ll have wasted their own time as well as the nation’s.
Say it does pass, consequently winding up before the Republican-controlled Senate, which has (I wouldn’t say “enjoys”) the constitutional power of making the final decision — to convict or not convict.
How would we reckon the chances of conviction and removal of the president, after a Senate debate of boiling intensity, marked by mud-slinging both on the pro-Trump and the anti-Trump side? I myself would put the chances at something like minus-25. This is notwithstanding the anti-Trumpian virulence of Mitt Romney — lusting, perhaps, for the redemptive opportunity of another go at winning the White House. Who can truly tell?
Then, in any event, where are we? What are we trying to do here? Clean up the presidency — only a few months before the constitutionally scheduled election of 2020? When the voters can make their own choice — Trump or Biden or Harris? Even O’Rourke, Castro or Buttigieg? — it couldn’t be, could it, that the proponents of impeachment just desire to smear some egg on Republican faces?
In that event, or in any other event that intersects the impeachment brouhaha, we would have to ask how America comes out on top in this thing. Is the president’s personal behavior any less edifying than that of Bill Clinton the last time we went through this regurgitating exercise?
The substantive worth of such a controversy as Waters desires to engage us in is, I would venture, marginal. The Mueller report sweeps aside imputations of disloyalty and possible treason based on supposed collaboration with the Russians in 2016.
From the pile of accusations about Trumpian rants and rages over “witch hunts” staged by “fake news” outlets, and the resistance put up by White House staffers to potentially damaging presidential initiatives, no really damning details emerge — just more evidence that Donald J. Trump is a piece of work; more self-promoter than crook; nobody’s model of Aristotelian virtue; in some sense, a man for his time and place; a not unreasonable representative of a public not noticeably in love with Aristotelian virtue and the Higher View of Life.
Indeed, it strikes me, after two years of teeth-gritting over various doings in the Oval Office, that Trump is a caricature of us: of those who jointly and severally put him in office, whether we voted for or against him. This on account of how, purposefully or not, we shaped these present, loose-jointed times — loosening norms, ditching standards. Trump could not have beaten FDR. He could not have beaten Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, or even Jimmy Carter. He beat Hillary Clinton. Q.E.D.
Whether we impeach Trump or scratch around for a Washington or Adams to put in his place — a doubtful enterprise, it must be said — is obviously a question of import. It’s one I would be hard put to assign to congresspeople who resemble Trump more than they either suspect or fear.

Fossil Fuels Phobia | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Ron Ross,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/fossil-fuels-phobia/,"by Hunt Lawrence and Daniel J. Flynn
T he Democrat Party’s Green New Deal is nothing but a pipe dream. Its only value is to serve as a reminder of the party’s fossil fuels’ lunacy.
Fossil fuels are an issue that sharply distinguishes Democrats from Republicans. Republicans consider fossil fuels a blessing, Democrats consider them a curse. Democrats openly advocate leaving our fossil fuels in the ground beyond the reach of humans. The radical environmentalist group Greenpeace is waging a “keep it in the ground” campaign.
The Democrats protest every attempt to increase the supply and reduce the prices of oil and gas. They fight fracking, pipelines, offshore drilling, and development of ANWR (Arctic National Wildlife Reserve). They have advocated special taxes on fossil fuels (the “carbon tax”), and arbitrary mileage requirements for cars and trucks. Fracking is banned in the entire state of New York. They guilt-trip everyone for their so-called “carbon footprints.”
Fossil fuels provide a wide array of benefits to humans. Those benefits are nothing short of profound — warmth, mobility, illumination, cooking, air-conditioning, just to name a few of the more obvious ones. Fossil fuels are not a minor blessing, they are a gigantic blessing. Without them our living standards would be a fraction of what they are now.
Fossil fuels are the raw materials for a mind-boggling array of products. Natural gas, surprisingly, is the primary ingredient in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, a major factor in “the green revolution.”
When oil and gas prices are low the benefits reverberate throughout the economy. Oil and gas prices can be thought of as “super prices,” prices that affect thousands of other prices. (Other examples of super prices are exchange rates and interest rates.)
Energy is a major cost for businesses and industries. For individuals low oil and gas prices are the equivalents of a pay raise or tax reduction. Democrats claim to be champions of low and middle income groups. Their disdain for the enormous benefits of low prices shows them for the frauds they actually are. Judging by their policies Democrat politicians are economic sadists.
California is an example of what happens when Democrat policies are pursued without opposition. Gasoline prices in the state are typically a dollar per gallon higher than those prevailing in the rest of the U.S.
Another way fossil fuels are a blessing is their sheer abundance. Humans have been enjoying the benefits of fossil fuels for over 200 years and yet the known recoverable reserves are greater than ever before.
Although the physical quantity is no greater than it was at the beginning of that period, our ability to identify and recover what’s there has increased exponentially, basically because human knowledge and technology have increased exponentially. As R.W. Emerson put it, “invention breeds invention.” Amazingly, known reserves are increasing faster than they’re being depleted. The once common concern known as “peak oil” looks silly in hindsight.
The two main factors contributing to the abundance of oil and gas are fracking and horizontal drilling. Fracking makes possible the recovery of oil and gas from shale formations which are common across the globe under both land and sea.
For example, the Permian Basin in southwest Texas is now responsible for a third of all the oil and gas produced in the U.S. Although once a major source of production, it had reached a peak in the early 1970s. With the advent of fracking it is now the world’s most productive oil field, recently surpassing Saudi Arabia’s Ghawar field. A bonus is that oil from the Permian is “sweet” (meaning low sulphur), making it less costly to refine.
Three new pipelines connecting the Permian Basin to the Gulf are scheduled for completion next year. Their combined capacity will be more than 2 million barrels a day.
The abundance of oil within our borders provides us foreign policy flexibility. We can get along just fine without Iranian and Venezuelan oil.
An often underappreciated advantage of fossil fuels is that they are “energy dense.” Solar and wind energy are anything but energy dense because sunlight and wind are not energy dense.
Relying on solar panels to power a thousand homes requires 32 acres of land. Additionally, that land will be taken up for as long as the power is generated. The grotesque solar panels and windmills will be visible for who knows how long. Windmills kill more birds every year than oil spills ever have or ever will.
A major challenge with so-called renewables is storability. The electricity generated by solar and windmills often does not match when it’s needed. Oil, gas, and coal are relatively easy to store and match availability with need. For automobiles, gas tanks are cheaper and last longer than batteries. Filling a gas tank is more time efficient than charging a battery. Time is the scarcest resource.
An oil or gas well requires an opening in the ground approximately one foot in diameter. After the well is completed the drilling rig can be taken away and used again elsewhere. Horizontal drilling reduces the necessary footprint even further by increasing the area reachable from a single well.
Fossil fuels are relatively easy to transport. Oil is a liquid, natural gas is, of course, a gas. Because of those characteristics both can be transported to ports and refineries via pipelines. Pipelines are much cheaper and safer than the alternatives, e.g. trains, ships, and trucks.
Unfortunately, protesters and lawsuit filers do everything in their power to obstruct pipeline construction. Completion of the famous Keystone Pipeline that goes from Canada to the Mississippi River is currently on hold because of one judge’s order. Fortunately, the Trump administration recently submitted a new permit application for the pipeline so it may once again be back on track for completion. Democrats love talking about the need for more investments in “infrastructure,” but anytime it goes from talking to doing they’re missing in action.
So why do Democrats think that fossil fuels are a curse and that we should even cease using them altogether? There is only one reason they offer — the possibility of man-made climate change.
The choice we face is between enormous current benefits that are 100 percent certain compared to the possibility of climate disaster decades in the future. Keep in mind the disaster is a prediction, not a certainty. It is not even a probability, at least not one that has been quantified. Something in the future cannot be certain, especially not decades in the future.
At this point the possible connection between CO2 and climate change is a theory, not a proven fact. The predictions are based entirely on computer models which have been dismal failures in predicting past climate changes. Climate alarmists don’t even offer a clear definition of “climate change.”
Democrats believe that all the benefits we derive from fossil fuels can be derived by developing “alternatives,” the so-called “renewable resources.” Renewable and non-renewable are how they define good and bad. It’s not that simple. In the real world every choice has advantages and disadvantages.
The Democrats’ hostility toward fossil fuels leads them to all kinds of counterproductive policies. Their ethanol mandates result in forty percent of all the land used to grow corn being devoted to ethanol production. Currently that’s over 34 million acres in the U.S. alone. That has the secondary effect of reducing the supply and increasing the prices for food available for humans and other animals, once again exposing the Democrats willingness to punish those they profess to care about.
Ethanol does serious harm to small gasoline engines. (Do not put it in your lawnmower.) Gasoline is oil-based, ethanol is water-based. Mixing them and keeping them mixed is problematic.
Ethanol produces only about two thirds as much energy per gallon as does gasoline. That difference reduces mileage about one to two miles per gallon, ironically at the same time the government is increasing mileage requirements. In light of the abundance of fossil fuels, using farmland to produce energy is a terrible idea.
To deny humanity the enormous blessings of fossil fuels is ridiculous. The Green New Deal proves that the Democrat Party is not serious. The party that was once serious has detached itself from reality."
The Past Is Imperfect | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Ed Morrow,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-past-is-imperfect/,"by Hunt Lawrence and Daniel J. Flynn I remember listening to Kate Smith with my parents. I think it was on the Ed Sullivan show. You could tell, even with our TV’s tinny speaker, that her fulsome voice could reach the far seats of the largest venue and rattle the teeth there like castanets. Her big voice was matched by a big body. I’m certain I wasn’t the only wise guy kid who, when she sang the signature line of her hit, “When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain,” imagined the next line should be, “Kate Smith will hide it from view.” Another Smith standard became a fixture at Yankee Stadium till just a few days ago — “God Bless America.” If the wokelings among us have their way, it will be banished forever from the ears of Yankee fans and, indeed, from any other public performance. Smith, they say, was a racist . All around us the oh-so-woke guard the less enlightened from damaging things like statues of guys who died a century and a half ago or Founding Fathers who weren’t Democratic Socialists before Democratic Socialism was conjured up. Thomas Jefferson, for example, was key to creating the first nation to put things like freedom of religion and freedom of speech into a constitution that guaranteed them as fundamental rights. He would have been hanged by the neck, if George Washington had caught a bullet on one of his many battlefields. Tom, however, owned slaves, so anything associated with him should have his name removed and his every sin should be trumpeted. That was the practice employed by Joseph Stalin back in the days of Communist Russia. When some official who’d been dutifully executing state enemies by the bushel fell foul of Uncle Joe and was himself executed, it was embarrassing for the boss to have photos of the dead guy standing side-by-side with him smiling in official documents or books. The solution was to blot out the fellow from all those images, not a small task in the days before Photoshop. The now-despised was also cut out of all records as anything other than a louse. It may be more difficult to expunge and revise Thomas Jefferson but don’t count out the know-best horde. They dream big politically correct dreams. Meanwhile, Kate Smith makes an easier target. In the 1930s, Smith recorded two songs with racist lyrics and was drawn accepting a “mammy” doll from a fan in a racist cartoon ad for the baking powder company that sponsored her radio show. Smith probably had little or nothing to do with creating the ad , but she did sing the songs. One was “Pickaninny Heaven,” which she sang in the 1933 film Hello Everybody to African-American children playing orphans. The song, which is dated to at least 1918, described a happy afterlife featuring such offensively stereotypical rewards for the children as gigantic watermelons. A second song was her 1931 version of “That’s Why Darkies Were Born,” which came from the Broadway revue George White’s Scandals and included the lyrics, “Someone had to pick the cotton.… That’s why darkies were born.” This song has been described as a satire on racist attitudes toward African-Americans, for it emphasized the unfair burden they carried in life. There’s reason to believe this is true, as it was also recorded in the same year by the African-American artist Paul Robeson , best known for his role in the musical Showboat. He was hardly anyone’s Uncle Tom. Robeson was an advocate for civil rights and so liberal that he was a supporter of the Soviet Union, even when the above-mentioned Uncle Joe was killing all those enemies, including some Robeson knew personally. Smith was born in 1907, just 42 years after the Civil War. Stereotypical representations of African-Americans were routine in song, literature, theater, radio, and film during the early years of her career. While African-Americans got the worse of it by far, many other ethnic groups also got rough treatment. It would be decades before such crude entertainment was no longer tolerated. An examination of the biography of any entertainer of that time, including many African-American performers, is likely to reveal something that can be called racist. Does this make racist claptrap from the past okay? Not at all. Smith, however, died in 1986 and isn’t around to defend herself or apologize. No other evidence of racism in her life has become public. Others, for whom there is abundant evidence, have received better treatment. Smith didn’t block statehood for Alaska for fear its congressional delegation would support civil rights legislation like Bill Clinton’s mentor Sen. J. William Fulbright . She wasn’t an Exalted Cyclops in the Ku Klux Klan like Sen. Robert Byrd . Sen. Hillary Clinton called him her mentor . Those guys supported segregation and worse racist sins that had far more impact than a couple of forgotten repulsive songs and an even more obscure offensive ad. Despite this, Fulbright’s name remains on the scholarship named for him that students eagerly pursue. No one is chiseling Byrd’s name off the countless buildings and the other pork gifts to West Virginia he stuck his name on. Smith, however, is getting the boot out of Yankee Stadium. Perhaps we should recall why Smith’s “God Bless America” was being played there. Composer Irving Berlin, a Jewish immigrant who deeply loved the United States, wrote “God Bless America” in 1918 while serving in the U.S. Army during World War I. He set it aside till 1938 when, fearful of the rise of Hitler, he brought the song out for Smith to perform for Armistice Day as a reminder to Americans that we should pray for our country. Perhaps he chose her because he was confident she could belt it out with the gusto he desired for his message. She sang it on her radio show, and it was so well received that during the 1940 presidential race both Democrat Franklin Roosevelt and his opponent Republican Wendell Willkie used it as their campaign song. During World War II, Smith sang the song at war bond rallies. It helped spur patriotism during the hard struggle. After the war, the song remained popular, and she was routinely called to sing it at public gatherings. The general public, including a generation of Baby Boomers, also sang it on patriotic occasions. Smith’s recording of her singing “God Bless America” sold thousands of copies. She, with Berlin, signed over their royalties to the Boy and Girl Scouts of America. The National Hockey League’s Philadelphia Flyers began playing a Smith recording of the song before their games in 1969 and came to believe it gave them luck. This appeared to be true for when they brought Smith in to sing it live before Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals, the Flyers won the cup. A statue of Smith was erected outside the Flyers’ arena, the Spectrum, to honor their good luck charm and permanently lend good fortune to the team. Following the 9/11 terror attacks, “God Bless America” was commonly sung or played during the seventh inning stretch at major league baseball games. The New York Yankees chose to play Smith’s recording of the song while occasionally switching to different versions. That stopped when some diligent PC enforcer investigating what he must have considered a dangerous demonstration of patriotism discovered Smith’s racist recordings. The Yankees immediately announced that “erring on the side of sensitivity” they were ditching Smith for other performers. The Philadelphia Flyers did, too, and in a gesture Smith fans may hope brings them lots of bad luck, they draped a black tarp over her statue then removed it. When looking at the past, we need to balance the good with the bad. Kate Smith sang a couple of ugly songs and her sponsor ran an ugly ad, but she sang nearly 3,000 other songs and one particularly good song that has encouraged our nation during times of crisis. After Pearl Harbor, Smith clocked an amazing 520,000 miles traveling to entertain troops. She also sang at war bond rallies. Her spirited rendition of “God Bless America” so stirred the patriotism of her audiences that, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica , she helped sell more war bonds than any other entertainer, $600 million worth . That’s in 1940s dollars. It did a lot to defeat Imperial Japan and destroy the Nazis, history’s greatest racists. No doubt, there were many happy hearts in PC-town, where dwell the pure by self-proclamation, w hen the Yankees and the Flyers unceremoniously degraded Kate Smith. To them, we can say, provided the clay leaves off at the ankles, heroes with clay feet are better than no heroes at all. The imperfections you decry are serious and regrettable, but, believe it or not, you aren’t perfect, either. Someday, if your way of thinking succeeds, someone may dig up sins in your past then remove your statues and silence your voices."
Williamson Nears Qualifying Threshold for DNC Debate,spectator.org,Robert Stacy McCain,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/williamson-nears-qualifying-threshold-for-dnc-debate/,"Williamson Nears Qualifying Threshold for DNC Debate Who says the Democratic field is set? by Andrew Harrod
M arianne Williamson’s campaign is nearing a crucial fundraising milestone to qualify for participation in the Democratic presidential primary debates. As of Friday evening, Williamson’s campaign site reported she needs fewer than 9,000 more contributors to reach the 65,000-donor threshold the Democratic National Committee has established to be on the stage for the first round of debates June 26-27 in Miami , to be televised on MSNBC and Telemundo. With more than 56,000 donors, Williamson is at about 87% of the 65,000 number.
In its first-quarter fundraising report, the Williamson campaign reported raising more than $1.5 million, which was more than the total raised by former Obama administration HUD Secretary Julian Castro. Most of Williamson’s total came from small donors, with 60% giving $200 or less, and she entered April with more than $500,000 cash on hand.
Williamson got an important boost April 14 when she appeared in a town hall event televised by CNN , demonstrating among other things her ability to throw red meat at the Trump-hating Democrat primary voters : “This president clearly has fascist leanings, and I think that all of us, conservatives as well as liberals, need to stop pretending that this isn’t true.” She also endorsed reparations for slavery , saying: “It’s simply a debt we owe. This country will not heal until we take a serious moral inventory.”"
America’s President,spectator.org,Wlady Pleszczynski,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/americas-president/,"by Jeffrey Lord
F ile this under Hope Springs Eternal: When Donald Trump somehow emerged victor on Nov. 8, 2016, I soon enough predicted that he would turn out to be America’s most beloved president since Ronald Reagan. I still think that. For one thing, simply as a personality there’s so much more there than in his four immediate predecessors. What’s more, with him what you see is what you get. For all his alleged sins and sinning he can never ever be accused of hypocrisy. In this day and age, that’s reason enough to canonize him.
My mind always goes back to October 2013 when Trump stole the show at our annual dinner, much no doubt to the dismay of our keynote speaker that night, Sen. Ted Cruz, whose earnest speech really did not go over well, following as it did Trump’s warm and witty remarks. But what I remember most is Trump before dinner, mingling at the general reception and joshing and schmoozing with one and all. One woman right in front of me tried to give him a hard time about something, to no avail. He quickly disarmed her, with a smile and an eye roll and maybe a few faux grimaces. I think I was supposed to try to get him to go over to the VIP reception, but he wanted no part of that. He was happy to be right where he was and the VIPs never did get to visit with him up close. In case you haven’t noticed, he’s always his own man even if that’s no longer allowed.
For his troubles he’s been savaged and dehumanized by a crazed, bigoted opposition that refuses to play by any rules once thought the norm in our politics and culture. Even before his election he was being sabotaged by his opponent, the ruling administration, U.S. intelligence, and the FBI. Same thing in the two and half months leading up to his inauguration. And ever since, by the permanent fruits of bigger government and the cockroaches scurrying along its corridors, including commissars under the control of a so-called special counsel who’s destroying America’s rule of law. And all this with kneejerk media encouragement and approval — unconstitutionality as we’ve never seen in the U.S. before, by forces that depict themselves as a “resistance” and who argue that Donald Trump’s constitutionally protected presidential actions are a sure sign of tyrannical intent. I suppose we owe an apology to Barack Obama. He knew what he was doing mandating universal mental health coverage.
The most amazing thing, though, is that in the face of such unprecedented cruel and unusual hostility, Trump has nonetheless thrived and delivered on numerous fronts, whether the economy, foreign policy, deregulation, entrepreneurship, the courts, trade and China, and the incompetence of “experts.” He has brought more energy to the executive than any president since FDR, and put it to better use than any president since — okay, we’ll fill in the blank when his second term ends. Best of all, he shows up for work every day, day after day. He never rests, and he’s apparently the first national leader immune from the effects of jet lag. This is a man in his 70s, remember. No one can keep up with him.
As I write, Joe Scarborough has just said Trump has caused more harm to the U.S. than 9/11 did. In the New York Review , which I thought will be the last liberal organ to retain its senses, Garry Wills calls for stepped-up resistance to Trump, because “If we wait until the tyrant kills six million Jews before tyrannicide is contemplated, we are actually facilitating tyranny.”
Thank God for children, the best check on adults who are out of their mind. Our cover this issue is inspired by a number of photos from the White House’s annual take your kid to work day. For all we know, one of the children depicted there belongs to the New York Times ’ Anonymous op-ed writer. But what jumps out in those pics — not that the spiteful media has given them any play — is how happy and playful they all are in Mr. Trump’s company and how even more delighted he seems to be to be in theirs. As Dubya might have said, “He’s a good man.”"
Words Make the Man,spectator.org,Thomas H. Crown,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/words-make-the-man/,"by Larry Thornberry
T he language we choose tells others a great deal about us. For example, my wife jokes that I’m one of the few living speakers of American English who visibly suffers real pain when he accidentally dangles a preposition, or says, “To who?” or really, any of a litany of offenses against a perfectly-useful Latin-infected Germanic tongue. This suggests that, at best, I’m a pedant fighting a romantic rear-guard action to preserve a particular state of a living tongue; at worst, it suggests I’m a prig; and likely, it suggests something between the two.
Similarly, people who refer to a single person as “they,” or cannot bring themselves to accurately describe another person by sexual characteristics also broadcast important things about the durability of their connection to reality.
The importance of language in how we define and perceive reality is of inordinate importance to those in my profession, who have a bad tendency to see the world as a series of word-locks (often of our own creation) to which we fashion word-keys and word-lockpicks as needed. It is also singularly important to politicians, because except at war, their entire job is to [effect things/change things/spend money/take money/make pretend money/pretend the existence of money/create or destroy relationships] through words. This is why, to take an easy example, former Senator Tom Coburn would return to his obstetrics practice every weekend and eventually fled The World’s Greatest Deliberative Body: Only truly awful people like lawyers and politicians would want to live in a bubble in which we pretend that our words make the world anew.
(One can also tell a great deal about a person from the length of his throat-clearing; taking, purely for example, 261 words, not including a parenthetical, to begin to get to a point suggests that the writer is perhaps too enamored of his own prose.)
The words our governing class of the moment uses to communicate with what it perceives as its subjects has long been one of my favorite bugaboos, precisely because it tells us a great deal about how our would-be rulers see us and them. As I said three years ago :
But what Islam and immigration have in common is not so much race (though they can both be proxies for race) or xenophobia (though again, this does influence at least some fraction of those concerned by these things), but rather a well-deserved reputation for being untouchable subjects by our political elites.
The language we are allowed to use to describe these problems — and the language we are not allowed to use — is a both a symptom and a signal of the larger issues.
Let us take the word alien . Alien derives from the Latin alius , other ; skipping the usual French transmission of Latin to English, it originally had nothing to do with extraterrestrials and simply meant strangers to one’s land .Thus, early American laws on foreigners — even ones who would become American — referred to them as aliens . Over time, this usage persisted so that until very recently, we referred to legal aliens (strangers here legally) and illegal aliens (strangers here not-legally). To call someone or something alien is not to engage in racism or any actual sin; it is simply to describe a thing using slightly arcane language.
Starting a few decades ago, it became more fashionable to refer to these strangers as immigrants , a word that is technically both accurate and inaccurate.
An immigrant (Latin: migrare , to depart , which then became migrans , one who departs , combined with im which prefix means into as opposed to e , from) is one who departs his place to come into ours . The connotation of immigrant, however, is somewhat more permanent than alien , which refers to one who is a stranger for any length of stay. Nevertheless, Americans are not all Latin buffs, so we ran with it.
In the last decade, someone decided that immigrant sounds racist and othering (a portmanteau that a just God will punish with the Fires of Hell), and that illegal immigrant is somehow worse; and all of a sudden, American politicians of both parties explicitly or implicitly declared that calling strangers who come into our land outside of our laws either of those words was racist thoughtcrime.
Similarly, over the last decade and a half, American political leaders have been at great pains to pretend that Muslims who kill people in the name of Islam and subscribe to a system of Islamic belief that has roots at least in the 18th if not 8th century, and whose actions are supported by between ten and fifty percent of Muslims worldwide, are not, in fact, Muslim; and to call them Muslim is that great of American sins, racism . (Islam, like Christianity, perceives itself as a universal faith, which means one open to all races, but it is thoughtcrime to note that, as well.)
Americans may not be amateur etymologists, but they are not actually fools; they understand that this is not an attempt to be polite — something that even Yankees unconsciously do — but rather an attempt to control conversation, thought, and action. It is nothing new to remark on how the left likes to control thought through the control of language; a clever fellow named Orwell remarked on it in a nearly eponymous essay decades ago. It is something new to see the nominal right engaged in it as well. It suggests that at some point, solving problems became less important than not making people upset that you recognized them.
But not only does this convey a profound sense of unseriousness — anyone of even minimal intelligence knows that it’s hard to fight a thing if you won’t call it by its right name — it is also a subtle but profound announcement that We are not like (by which we mean, “are better”) than you rabble . It says, We do not worry about the same things that you do, and to worry about those things, to call them by their right names and express concern, is racist and honestly isn’t nearly as important as making sure politically-connected individuals and corporations get rich . It also says, Trust your betters, morons .
Despite (and arguably because of) the amazing swamp-clearing powers of Bad Orange Man and his surprisingly survival-adept band of competent people and situationally-competent nitwits, this condition has not merely not improved, it has worsened.
Thus, let us speak of Christians, by way of speaking about English.
A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE has said one can tell a lot about a people based on how their language sounds when yelled out on a battlefield. A great language, whatever the virtues of its people and their martial prowess, is capable of eloquence and pithiness by turns, but by its own rhythm . Attempting an English version of Cicero or Leonidas only works insofar as one can abide by — or even stretch — English’s rules of construction and formation. This is why children’s insults, which are by turns elaborate and abrupt, often sound so amusing to adult ears, and why so many portmanteaux and neologisms die aborning every day in this great land.
This is no less true for politically-correct speech, a concept that regained currency in the 1980s and 1990s (and fueled the brief, too-short careers of Andrew “Dice” Clay, Morton Downey, Jr., and other leading lights), disappeared for a while, and made a roaring comeback in time for an orange buffoon and the antagonist of The Wizard of Oz to face off for the Presidency. “Gender non-confirming bi person of color,” for example, is the sort of code to which college students (marked generally by immature brains and an excess of free time) might thrill, but the rest of us are basically fine with “woman.” On the other side of that coin, “mozzarella head,” might suggest “pasty person with soft if delicious brains and no real integrity,” but it really just sounds like you’re trying for insults and cannot create them.
“Christian” is an easy word with a well-defined meaning: It means “someone who worships [Jesus] Christ.” It is succinct and carries a definition on which, broadly, everyone agrees, even if the particulars sometimes cripple that agreement quickly.
It is not uncommon, especially in older texts, to see the archaism “Christ worshiper,” which conveys the same meaning. This is because in English, a sufficiently specific noun may act as the direct object of a gerund or verb-based noun. Lotus eater , for example, means “one who eats lotuses.” “Christ follower” means “one who follows [the teachings of] Christ.” And so on.
It is very hard to change this structure, which while archaic, is well-rooted in our mother tongue. For example, referring to someone as a “flesh eater” does not mean “one who eats in the presence of or on top of flesh”; a “devil worshiper” does not pray to the God of Hosts while surrounded by the angels He evicted to darkness and emptiness for all eternity; and “Easter worshiper” does not mean “one who worships [something] on Easter.” Were this otherwise, we would refer to the poor souls killed in New Zealand some weeks ago as “mosque worshipers” or “Friday worshipers,” when the proper term is Muslims ; this is because either of those terms would suggest they were worshiping a place or a day, rather than God as they perceive Him.
The massacre of Christians in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday was thus an opportunity to publicly emote for politicians who ordinarily couldn’t give a rat’s anus for anyone they cannot see in their own mirrors. Their response was not to mourn dead and wounded “Christians,” but instead “Easter worshipers.”
I do not care what convoluted newspeak a group of apostates, atheists, agnostics, and Obamaists use to describe Christianity, so long as they don’t follow up that description with weaponry, and neither should you. The Church teaches that without Christ’s freely-chosen Grace, Hell awaits, Jews being the only notable exception on the theory that God keeps His promises; the supermajority of this crowd has made their choice and they’re in for one Hell of a surprise when the actuarial tables catch up with them.
But given that the damned involved are former Presidents, incompetents who would have stepped over their own mothers to be President, and major media cretins, you should care what they think about you, because the consequences are coming soon to a policy decision near you.
AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 11 attacks, then-President George W. Bush reassured the nation that true Muslims could not have perpetrated those mass killings, because Islam means “peace.” Those of us who had paid attention in any of our world history classes from birth through college scratched our heads and more or less as one, said, “Wait, doesn’t Islam mean submission ?” Not to be outdone by a Republican executive, both parties began offering that Islam is a (possibly the ) religion of peace, pace all those two Christians bombing abortion clinics and that one Jewish guy who killed a bunch of people at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Also the Crusades. This became a mantra to the point of mockery in conservative circles.
And rightfully so. I was (and am) a fan of the former President’s, but this struck me as one of the most insulting possible things to say at that moment. It belittled Islam — a faith that whatever its merits, quite logically postulates that if that conception of the Divine is accurate, face-to-the-ground submission is the only rational response — and it belittled the American people, because it suggested that some large fraction of us were ticking time bombs, one bad translation of Arabic away from gunning down a mosque.
There’s a lot to unpack there, but let’s start with the numbers.
As Pew put it in an accompanying blog post , assaults were only about a quarter of the 400 hate crimes perpetrated on Muslims in 2001, almost all of which were in the last quarter. Harm to an innocent, whatever the motivation, is by definition a terrible wrong, so there are 400 real wrongs on display in this data; but for perspective on the awfulness of the plague of violence with which our political class was faced, in January of 2001 alone , in Los Angeles only , there were 230 felony assaults . In the People’s Republic of New Jersey in 2002, there were 433 carjackings — that is, more carjackings in a single state (granted, the Capital of Carjacking and Superfund Sites) than there were anti-Muslim hate crimes of every kind in the heat of the post-9/11 trauma.
It is by definition impossible to prove a counterfactual, but even taking arguendo the highly questionable and still-mysteriously-unproven assertion that words inspire borderline and not-so-borderline people to go kill a lot of people, it appears that at least 400 times, someone overcame our ruling class’s word choice and committed mortal sins on the basis of the (at times perceived) religious belief of their victims; and yet, it was only 400 times, a number roughly equal to the number of homicides in Detroit in 2001. The operational theory was therefore that the ordinary, non-violent humans and the borderline-violent humans are too stupid to understand circumlocution, but the marginal number of violent thugs can see right through it, and if we’re not careful, the majority will join the margin.
There is and was a great deal to be said for neither antagonizing nor insulting predominantly or exclusively Muslim allies whose territory we would need for staging grounds and whose intelligence operations, however unsavory, would make our own more effective; but there is even more to be said for not treating the people who put you in office as itchy-fingered psychopaths eager to burn their doctors and neighbors alive because M slim.
As much as has changed since 2001, this has not.
THIS LEADS TO THE CRUX of the problem with “Easter worshipers.” Our governing class is composed of people of fading religiosity, increasingly tenuous connections with their Christian countrymen, and all of the noblesse oblige and class awareness of a stereotypical-if-historically-ridiculous movie medieval monarch and none of the fear that sent kings crawling across their islands on pilgrimage to save themselves and their subjects from excommunication. I use the phrases governing class and ruling class tongue-in-cheek; they do not use those terms at all, except to try to live them.
The term “Easter worshiper” is detached, analytical, jarring, silly, clumsy, and more likely to incite than calm; but it’s the sort of thing a group of would-be technocrats would say while analyzing the subjects on whose dial settings they’re working. Hm, careful, mustn’t let Group A know that the mice who died in Group S are Christian mice, they might riot or refuse to eat the infused pellets.
Put very simply, our representatives — our public servants — are increasingly our rulers, in their perception if not always in fact. Representatives or servants will feel a connection to those who put them in power, and will understand that acting in the governed’s interest is acting in their own. Rulers will do what they feel right for their subjects, knowing that they themselves need never feel those policies or the consequences. A representative fears for his own skin, on the day he rejoins the governed; a ruler fears the mob.
Standing alone, “Easter worshipers” is jarring, weird, and a one-off. As part of a larger data set, it suggests that the people who govern and imagine they govern us increasingly believe they rule us."
The ‘What If’ Question for the White House,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-what-if-question-for-the-white-house/,"by Larry Thornberry
Washington
The “what if” question of President Donald Trump’s presidency is this: How would Trump have entered office if then-FBI Director James Comey had not told him about a “dossier” on Trump’s ties with Russia — which major news organizations declined to report on because their crack reporters could not substantiate it — when they first met in Trump Tower on Jan. 6, 2017?
Is it possible that instead of delivering his dark “American carnage” inaugural address, Trump would have taken the oath of office with the optimism he displayed on election night? In the warm glow of victory, Trump told America, “It is time for us to come together as one united people.”
But after the Comey reveal, after U.S. intelligence had failed to tell Trump about Russian attempts to interfere in the presidential race during the 2016 campaign and most of the three-month transition period, Trump had reason to be wary. Especially because, within days of his talk with Comey, BuzzFeed published the lurid “dossier” — which confirmed Trump’s suspicions that the FBI and intelligence community were intent on discrediting him.
As the saying goes: Just because you’re paranoid, it doesn’t mean they aren’t out to get you.
And it’s hard not to feel that those who wrote the Mueller report believed they had evened the score when they wrote, “On June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel’s Office was investigating whether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this a ‘major turning point’ in the investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following Comey’s firing, the President now was under investigation.”
So, after establishing that the “Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion” — but also failing to “establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” — the Mueller team took after Trump’s attempts to politicize the Department of Justice.
Of particular interest were Trump’s laments that Attorney General Jeff Sessions would not act as a political enforcer in the model of Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder, top lawmen to former Presidents John Kennedy and Barack Obama, respectively. Trump denies he told former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Sessions. But according to the report, Trump told McGahn, “You’re telling me that Bobby and Jack didn’t talk about investigations? Or Obama didn’t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?”
It was an odd juxtaposition — the Mueller team exposing Trump for wanting to use the attorney general’s office to stop an investigation while using the report on the investigation to get even with the president.
Was it a “coup,” as Trump has charged last week? No. Call it a prolonged feud between the FBI and the president that entailed mutual bullying — turf in which Trump himself is no angel.
But it’s not clear that it had to begin as it did — in Trump Tower with Comey telling the president-elect information the feds should have told him months earlier about the dossier that linked Trump to prostitutes in Moscow.
“There was a real chance that Donald Trump, politician and hardball deal-maker, would assume I was dangling the prostitute thing over him to jam him, to gain leverage,” Comey wrote in his book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership . Comey added: “He might well assume I was pulling a J. Edgar Hoover, because that’s what Hoover would do in my shoes.”
And still, that’s how the head of the FBI handled a story that spawned an investigation for something Mueller could not establish as having occurred.
Trump, of course, is responsible for how he overreacted to Comey and the probe. The probe would have been over much sooner if the undisciplined Trump hadn’t fired Comey and hadn’t given contradictory reasons for the firing.
But you have to wonder: Would Trump have been a different president — even a little different — if Comey hadn’t poisoned the well so close to the inauguration?

Diversity and The Death of Free Speech,spectator.org,John Glynn,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/diversity-and-the-death-of-free-speech/,"Diversity and The Death of Free Speech Once again, Middlebury College plays the role of killer.
� ��If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.” — George Orwell
This is an age of trigger warnings and safe spaces . The notion of free speech is an illusion. This is especially true on college campuses. However, this wasn’t always the case. There was a time, not that long ago, when college students were encouraged to expand their minds further. To do so, students were encouraged to open their minds, to consider and debate controversial opinions. After all, the world is an unpredictable place, full of beliefs that are as divisive as they are varied. College was designed to prepare you for the real world. Please note that I use the word was for a very specific reason.
For millions of Americans, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are inviolable principles. An attack on any of these ideals is an attack on democracy.
On the other hand, millions of others are enamored by the idea of conditional free speech . Those of a sensitive nature must be provided with trigger warnings and safe spaces, maybe even an emotional support animal . Free speech is encouraged… but only if the speaker subscribes to a very specific ideology. Unfortunately, like the worst hostage negotiators in the world, college administrators around the country are acquiescing and giving into the demands of the Social Justice Stasi.
Of all the colleges in the United States, perhaps Middlebury is the most spineless. On the 24 th of April, Ryszard Legutko, a Polish philosopher and member of the European Parliament, was scheduled to speak at the invitation of Middlebury’s Alexander Hamilton Forum. Interestingly, the forum’s site states the following:
We seek to offer students an opportunity to think critically about the relevance of political and constitutional theory to a range of contemporary debates in American public life.
Essential to this mission is our aspiration to contribute to a culture of reasoned, civil discussion and debate across political and intellectual differences.
Clearly, these rules didn’t apply last Wednesday. Legutko, a renowned scholar of classical political philosophy, once served as both Minister of Education and Secretary of State in his home country of Poland. Somewhat ironically, Legutko planned to deliver a lecture on the subject of totalitarianism. Little did he know that his talk would be derailed by tantrum throwing tyrants.
Then again, Legutko must have known that the talk was never going to take place. Two years ago, faculty members and students at Middlebury invited Dr. Charles Murray to speak. Leftists protested, arguing that Murray, a right-wing speaker, posed a threat to student safety. The talk was canceled. Murray and his staff were physically threatened. By allowing such despicable behavior, Middlebury opened the doors to totalitarianism.
In a recent piece for Fox, Alexander Kahn noted:
The Legutko cancelation represents the culmination of an anti-free speech agenda which was implemented in the wake of the Murray incident. In an attempt to recover the reputation of the school after the Murray event riot, the administration instituted a new speaker policy which included a provision that the administration would consider canceling an event if it posed a “credible threat to the community.”
Legutko, in their eyes, posed a credible threat. The lunatics are now running the asylum. The normally peaceful campus of Middlebury College, with its mountainous backdrop, once had a pristine reputation. Those days are long gone.
The irony here (yes, even more irony) is that the very people that managed to stop Legutko’s talk are also the same people promoting the idea of diversity on campus.
What does it mean when colleges and universities talk about “diversity”? Those on the left use it to describe the presence of people on a campus who differ in terms of race, culture, ethnicity, religion, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and ability. However, “diversity” also means the presence of people with diverse opinions, political views, and academic passions, including the likes of Charles Murray and Ryszard Legutko.
This brings us on to the paradox of diversity . On college campuses across the land, the very notion of diversity appears to be a moral end in itself. Nevertheless, when a member of the “oppressive” majority comes to town, the doors of diversity are closed quicker than you can say ‘white man bad.’ In the world of social justice warriors, diversity of opinion is forbidden: opposition to the doctrines of social justice is never reasonable opinion, but malevolent “hate speech.” The extreme left’s idea of diversity is narrowly defined ; it has only the slightest of connections with the actual definition of the word.
This shouldn’t surprise us. The wheels of madness have been in motion for quite some time.
In 2016, for example, students at the University of Pennsylvania removed a portrait of Shakespeare. Why? Because Willy Shakespeare is not sufficiently diverse. The disgruntled students replaced the portrait with another portrait of a black lesbian poet.
In this age of diversity, an increasing number of third level institutions have committed themselves to dogmatic, all too myopic ideologies. After all, only the most ignorant fails to recognize that structural discrimination against all members of victim categories must be addressed.
Then again, in this age of the Oppression Olympics , everyone appears to be a victim. Ideas such as merit and excellence, clearly white-male constructs, have been discarded. Instead, they have been replaced by “diversity” of everything, including gender, race, sexual inclination, ethnicity, economic class, and religion.
Of course, “diversity of everything” does not include diversity of opinion.
When it comes to college campus opinion, I am reminded of Henry Ford’s utterance, “ any color so long as it is black .” College campuses and universities were once bastions of knowledge. They were sanctuaries of sagacity, not sanctuaries of sanctimony. They once subscribed to the belief that it makes sense to try to understand the world before attempting to change it. To understand the world meant listening to different opinions and philosophies. However, such an approach appears to be outdated, instead replaced by postmodernism and emotive calls to action.
The ostensibly liberal take on diversity is wholly illiberal. Reductionist in the extreme, such myopia undermines basic human rights, such as freedom of speech, by silencing any speech that “upsets” anyone of a sensitive/stubborn disposition.
Remember, academia is not a vacuum. These people will graduate and go on to occupy roles of real significance. Maybe they will end up teaching YOUR children, or maybe they will be responsible for implanting policies that will impact YOUR neighborhood. That is why it is more important than ever to not only have a voice, but to use your voice in a constructive manner."

W illoughby Run is a stream too small to be called a creek. Trickling southward through the hills of Adams County, Pennsylvania, it runs between two low ridges and crosses U.S. Highway 30 east of what is now a golf course, but which on the morning of July 1, 1863, was farmland. On the ridge west of Willoughby Run was a tavern owned by Frederick Herr and on that ridge, two brigades of Confederate infantry assembled, having marched some seven miles from Cashtown that morning. These brigades belonged to a division commanded by Maj. Gen. Harry Heth, part of the III Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, the vanguard of Robert E Lee’s force invading Pennsylvania. They marched that July morning toward a memorable clash near a crossroads town less than a mile east of Willoughby Run, a place called Gettysburg.
Heth and his men had little trouble brushing back the Yankee cavalry that had sought to obstruct their march toward Gettysburg where, it is said, Heth believed he might capture a supply of shoes for his ragged troops. As the Confederate brigades lined up on Herr Ridge west of Willoughby Run, the blue-coated cavalrymen pulled back to the ridge on the east side of the stream, on the farm of a man named McPherson. The Union cavalry, commanded by Brig. Gen. John Buford, kept up a desultory fire with their carbines, with little effect on the Confederate infantry at a distance of nearly a quarter-mile, concealed by trees on Herr Ridge. Buford’s troopers were supported by a six-gun battery of artillery, and Heth brought up his own artillery to return fire, as he reconnoitered the position. The Southerners believed the main Union army was still far from Gettysburg, and that they faced no more than cavalry, perhaps supported by some local Pennsylvania militia. Heth gave the order for an advance, with the two brigades deployed on either side of the road leading east. On the north side of the road was a brigade of Mississippi troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Joseph Davis, nephew of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. South of the road was a brigade of troops from Tennessee and Alabama, commanded by Brig. Gen. James J. Archer, a Maryland native and an alumnus of Princeton University.
Archer’s brigade was one of the best in the Confederate army, having led the charge that broke the Yankee line at the Battle of Chancellorsville. One of Archer’s regiments, the 13th Alabama, was led by Col. Birkett Davenport Fry, a West Point dropout whose career had included volunteer service in the Mexican War and the notorious “filibuster” expedition to Nicaragua. And in the ranks of the 13th Alabama that July morning were two young privates from Randolph County, Winston Wood Bolt and his brother Robert, whose fate is of more than passing interest to me. When Heth ordered the advance from Herr Ridge, Archer’s brigade marched down to Willoughby Run and waded across the shallow stream then up the hillside beyond. The 13th Alabama was near the right flank of the brigade, and their attention was focused toward the woods on their left near the road, where Union troops were putting up a spirited resistance. Someone on the Confederate line noticed that these Yankees were wearing a distinctive style of hat they’d seen in previous battles and called out: “Ain’t no militia. It’s them black-hat fellows again. It’s the Army of the Potomac.”
Indeed, those “black-hat fellows” were Western troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith, destined to be famous as the Union army’s “Iron Brigade,” and their appearance on the field proved to be a turning point in the Battle of Gettysburg. The Iron Brigade had rushed cross-country to the sound of the guns near Willoughby Run, and they arrived on the field in a somewhat disorderly way. By the time their lead regiment was fighting Archer’s men in the woods near the road, the trailing regiments were just coming over McPherson Ridge further south. This proved decisive in that opening clash at Gettysburg, as the Iron Brigade’s 24th Michigan regiment, the last to arrive on the field, came in at an angle that completely overlapped the right flank of Archer’s brigade. As one Tennessee survivor recalled, the Confederates were suddenly confronted with the choice either to run for the rear or surrender. Archer was among those captured, along with about 75 of his troops, including Pvt. Winston Bolt, my great-grandfather.
My direct personal connection to what Southerners sometimes used to call “The Late Unpleasantness” necessarily informs my opinions of more recent events, including Joe Biden’s insulting and dishonest attack on President Trump. In announcing his candidacy for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination, Biden falsely accused Trump of sympathizing with neo-Nazi extremists who helped turn an August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, into the site of senseless and deadly violence. Propaganda claims surrounding that episode have obscured the facts behind the wild mob scene in which Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when 20-year-old white supremacist James Fields rammed his car into a crowd of left-wing protesters .
A local politician in Charlottesville named Wes Bellamy had proposed removing a statue of General Lee from a park in the city, and this sparked a series of protests in opposition to Bellamy’s plan. A local activist named Jason Kessler issued the call for the so-called “Unite the Right” rally and, in the climate of political division following Trump’s 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, this rally attracted violence-prone extremists both Left and Right. The night before the rally saw a creepy torchlight march of neo-Nazis through Charlottesville, and on the day of the rally, a massive crowd of left-wing counter-protesters showed up, including dozens of masked “Antifa” thugs looking for a fight. Many have blamed Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe for the failure of law enforcement to prevent the violence that predictably erupted that day, but nothing that happened at Charlottesville could fairly be blamed on President Trump.
In last week’s video announcing his third bid for the presidency , however, Biden repeated a smear that left-wing activists have promoted, when he claimed Trump “shocked the conscience of this nation” with his response to the Charlottesville violence. “He said there were, quote, ‘some very fine people on both sides.’ Very fine people?” Biden asked in the video. “With those words, the President of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.”
This is simply false. Trump’s comment about “very fine people on both sides” referred to the controversy over Lee’s statue, and not to anyone “spreading hate.” On the same day the rally happened, Trump made a public statement lamenting “the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,” and condemning “in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.” He continued: “It has no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society.… I just got off the phone with the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and we agree that the hate and the division must stop, and must stop right now.” Three days later, when Trump took questions at the White House, reporters repeatedly asked him for further comment. You can read the entire transcript of that press conference , and see that the president specified he was speaking of the Lee statue when he said there were “very fine people on both sides” of the dispute. Furthermore, Trump asked, if memorials to Lee and other Confederates were now subject to destruction, “I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after?”
Indeed, such controversies are not moot speculation: Radical students at Hofstra University insist that a statue of Jefferson be removed from their campus, and at George Washington University , campus activists assert that the “Colonials” nickname of the school’s sports teams is “extremely offensive” and “glorifies the act of systemic oppression.” What is apparent from such claims is, first of all, that America’s schools have failed to properly teach history, and second, that we are living in an era of frightening radicalism, in which ignorance and rage walk hand-in-hand. As tragedies like Charlottesville demonstrate, political polarization is dangerous. And as Joe Biden’s remarks demonstrate, there are unscrupulous politicians who seek selfish advantage from this polarization.
We have seen this before. How was it that my great-grandfather, a simple Alabama farm boy, ended up on that hillside in Pennsylvania, captured by farm boys from Michigan? Years of escalating crises, fomented by radicals and exploited by politicians, led finally to the division of America and the deadliest war in our nation’s history. More than 600,000 soldiers died in that four-year war, and when I ponder the fate of my ancestor Winston Wood Bolt, I recognize what a miracle it was that he was not among the dead. Had he not been captured on the first day at Gettysburg, he may well have been killed on the third day, when his brigade took part in the final assault known to history as Pickett’s Charge. His regimental colonel was grievously wounded in that charge; Winston Bolt’s brother Robert, who survived Gettysburg without being captured or killed, lost an arm the next spring in the Battle of the Wilderness. Meanwhile, my great-grandfather spent two years as a prisoner of war at Fort Delaware before being paroled when the war ended.
Private Bolt signed his parole with an “X.” He was completely illiterate, you see, and it is therefore impossible for me to know what my ancestor’s opinions were on the controversies that led to the Civil War. However, I can form an estimate of his character from knowing his daughter Perlonia, my grandmother, a stern but kindly Christian woman who lived to be 94 years old. It should not be necessary to explain why I bristle at any insult to my grandmother’s family, to hear them smeared as “racists” by people who never knew them. Some people like to display their imagined superiority by impugning my Southern ancestors in this manner, and I’ve learned to restrain my temper about such insults. Had such men as Alabama’s William Lowndes Yancey been better able to restrain their tempers, there might never have been a Civil War, but we must live with the consequences of history as it actually happened , rather than in whatever fictional alternative anyone might fondly imagine. Wishing that slavery or secession never happened is as futile as wishing that J.E.B. Stuart’s cavalry had been present to protect the advance of Lee’s army toward Gettysburg on that fateful July morning in 1863.
Joe Biden seems to imagine that he can rewrite his own history, and that the rest of us are too stupid to notice. As has been pointed out, Biden was still opposing school desegregation efforts in Delaware more than a decade after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, in 1975, he was among the senators who voted unanimously to restore Robert E. Lee’s citizenship . Biden’s positions in the 1970s were, arguably, defensible given the political realities of that era. The kind of school busing programs Biden opposed had led to violent riots in Boston and other communities, and he might defend his stance as an effort to avoid such conflicts. Similarly, the Civil War was once understood as resulting from a tragic failure of the democratic process, and the restoration of Lee’s citizenship was a gesture of national unity by statesmen seeking to heal the ancient rift between North and South. It is absurd to imagine that the Biden of 2019 might use a time machine to travel back four decades and advise a younger Biden to adopt a radical posture to serve his future presidential ambitions, because a radical Biden never could have been elected to the Senate in 1972 nor re-elected in 1978. Speaking of elected leaders, what about Jefferson Davis? In 1978, a congressional resolution restoring the Confederate president’s citizenship was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter . And it is also necessary to mention, in this context, that the official celebration of Robert E. Lee’s birthday in Arkansas was signed into law in 1985 by Gov. Bill Clinton .
History cannot be changed according to our wishes, and there is no reason to believe that politicians of the 21st century are morally superior to the politicians of the past, whose faults and failures now seem so easily apparent. Shall we condemn Joe Biden, Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter as racists for their pro-Confederate past? Or should we instead suspect that Democrats like Biden are now simply seeking political advantage by smearing Trump and other Republicans as racists?
A few months after my great-grandfather was captured at Gettysburg, a Republican politician showed up there to give a speech — perhaps you’ve heard of it — about the importance of preserving “government of the people, by the people, for the people.” In 2016, the people of Adams County, Pennsylvania, voted by more than a 2-to-1 margin to elect Donald Trump president and, much like the election of 1860, many Democrats seem unwilling to recognize this result as legitimate. Hillary Clinton condemned as “deplorables” the nearly 63 million Americans who voted for Trump, and now Joe Biden would seem to be praising the “courage” of violent Antifa thugs who played a significant role in the Charlottesville riot. If there were “very fine people on both sides” that day in August 2017, there were also some dangerously violent people on both sides. Trump did not hesitate to condemn violence by neo-Nazi extremists, but have you seen any reporters asking Biden to condemn the violence of the radical Left? Or would it be “spreading hate” to ask tough questions of a Democrat?
Why are Americans still arguing about a war that ended more than 150 years ago? Shouldn’t we have learned the lessons of history and forgiven our grudges by now? Because my own ancestor was illiterate, I have no direct guidance from him in this matter, but there was another Confederate survivor of Gettysburg who wrote a letter with some useful advice: “My experience of men has neither disposed me to think worse of them nor indisposed me to serve them; nor in spite in spite of failures which I lament, of errors which I now see and acknowledge, or of the present aspect of affairs, do I despair of the future. The truth is this: The march of Providence is so slow and our desires so impatient; the work of progress so immense and our means of aiding it so feeble; the life of humanity is so long, that of the individual so brief, that we often see only the ebb of the advancing wave and are thus discouraged. It is history that teaches us to hope.”"
The Perez Principle,spectator.org,Scott McKay,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-perez-principle/,"by H. Sterling Burnett
Y ou’ve no doubt heard of the Peter Principle, which holds that in any large organization individuals will rise in the hierarchy until they ultimately reach a level beyond their competence to adequately perform their jobs.
The theory, first put forth in a 1969 book by Laurence J. Peter, was intended chiefly to describe corporate structure — but it surely also applies to politics.
And particularly in the Democrat Party, which puts the principle on steroids by turbocharging it with identity politics.
Consider the case of that party’s current chairman Tom Perez, a former hardcore leftist lawyer from the Department of Justice who ended up as the Labor Secretary in the second term of the Obama administration — you remember that time, right? That was when the president assured us that manufacturing jobs and rising wages were a thing of the past and we had to accept the New Normal of sclerotic economic growth and increasing welfare dependency.
Well, after the Democrats blew the 2016 election through the signature incompetence of its chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who did a poor job of masking the party’s rigging of the Democrat primaries and sprinkled a major IT scandal involving what looked a lot like a cell of the Pakistani ISI spy service on top, the party was looking for some new, fresh talent to lead it out of the political wilderness.
And since there is scant little new, fresh talent in the Democrat Party, the vote for a new chair came down to the hilariously inappropriate former Louis Farrakhan disciple Keith Ellison and Perez, who offered three things — vicious, hardline leftism, a background in the Obama rackets, and his Hispanic heritage.
What Perez didn’t offer were the two things a party chair has to have to sustain any electoral success — talent in winning political arguments with the other side, and the ability to raise money.
In the latter, Perez isn’t really a success. The Republican National Committee outraised the Democrat National Committee $45.8 million to $6.3 million in the first quarter, and the RNC stands without any debt compared to the over $4 million the DNC carries. While the DNC has a cash-on-hand advantage over the RNC ($74.9 million to $31.1 million), a number left over from last year, the Republicans are beating Perez’s Democrats to a pulp in fundraising so far in the 2020 cycle.
And Perez’s weak leadership at the DNC is creating a vacuum being filled by so many presidential candidates it’s difficult to keep count of them all — and those candidates are cannibalizing the presidential fundraising process. Meanwhile President Trump has raised $30.8 million in the first quarter, which is more than the top two Democrat candidates (Bernie Sanders at $18 million, followed by Kamala Harris with $12 million).
But Perez is attempting to make up for those deficiencies with verbiage — and lots of it. The problem is, he’s no better at communication than he is at organization.
Take, for example, the peculiar demand Perez made last week …
Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Tom Perez told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on Wednesday that Republicans should not use any ill-gotten information against the Democrats in the upcoming elections, but, when pressed, did not seem to think that Democrats should be held to the same standard.
“And what we saw in the 2016 election, a foreign adversary — and not just any foreign adversary, our — our most — our fiercest foreign adversary attempted to interfere with our election to help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton,” Perez said. “And what we said in 2016, and my predecessor asked her counterpart at the RNC back then to do the same thing, don’t use stolen information. That’s what we’re saying again.”
“It sounds like they’re saying that,” Camerota responded. “I mean when they say it’s an affront to all of us, any breach of political organizations, and we come together to prevent it, it sounds like they’re saying that.”
“We are at war right now. It is a cyber war. Unfortunately, because our commander in chief is compromised, the federal government is asleep at the switch,” Perez claimed without evidence. “And that is why the DNC and others in the Democratic Party ecosystem are working tirelessly to make sure that we are protecting our data, making sure — we’re working with every campaign to provide cybersecurity training because we can’t expect help from the — from this administration.”
How rich is that? First of all, there is the continuing reference to the Russian collusion narrative — which has been thoroughly debunked and is a colossal political loser in the making, especially given the future legal backlash to come against some of Perez’s former colleagues in the Obama administration. The smart DNC chairman would be working to steer his party away from that iceberg, but not Perez.
And second, it doesn’t seem very smart to talk about cyberwarfare and how Trump is “compromised” in that respect when your party’s 2016 candidate was literally the most compromised politician in the history of cybersecurity. Hillary Clinton transacted government business on an unsecured illegal private server in a bathroom closet, and in doing so allowed state secrets to be accessed by hostile foreign powers. Furthermore, the DNC’s email server was hacked and embarrassing information released to Wikileaks as a result of its carelessness.
Remember — the hackers attempted to break into the RNC’s server but couldn’t because it had better security.
If anybody is compromised with respect to the cyber war, and if anybody is asleep at the switch when it comes to cybersecurity it’s the Democrat Party. You would think Perez would steer the conversation away from such an obvious weak point in his argument, but you’d be wrong.
And here’s another golden example of sophomoric messaging. From a Tuesday night MSNBC appearance …
What’s clear from this administration, and what’s clear throughout the entirety of his business practices, is that they will lie, cheat, and steal. They’ll do anything to win. They have so eroded institutions of democracy, that is why there is health care on the ballot and we will continue to point out that the Democratic Party is the party fighting to save your health care. The Republicans are fighting to take it away. So many other things on the ballot. Our democracy is on the ballot.
Lying, cheating and stealing? From the people who brought you the Brett Kavanaugh circus and the Russian collusion hoax? How is this statement going to hold up when the investigation of the FISA warrants starts spitting out indictments?
There are ways to spin the Democrats’ narrative which are less laughable than this.
Last week here at The American Spectator Jeffrey Lord nailed Perez to the wall for his clownish hypocrisy. It appears as though that’s going to be quite the hobby for conservative pundits in the coming weeks. He makes an outstanding punching bag — at least for now, until someone at the DNC decides it’s time to pull the plug on the Perez Principle.
…
If you’re looking for evidence that the whole climate change/global warming narrative is a hoax, this item from CNBC last week isn’t a bad place to start…
At a small church meeting house this month in a Louisiana farm town, a tiny community was making a very big decision. Residents were fed up with increasingly intense and frequent flooding, so they are moving to higher ground. Together.
The residents of Pecan Acres are some of America’s first climate refugees. The plan to move them could become a blueprint for other towns, as increasingly extreme weather and rising sea levels force more and more residents from the homes they’ve known for decades.
Pecan Acres, a subdivision of New Roads, Louisiana, was built in the 1970s along a canal. While it was always prone to flooding, in the last decade the floods have gotten much worse and much more destructive. The area levee is no longer adequate to hold the heavier rainfall. Back-to-back floods in 2016 and 2017 drew the governor’s attention, and a plan was hatched to buy out about 40 homeowners and move them to a new plot of land, barely 2 miles away, but 10 feet higher.
This literally couldn’t be more of a Fake News report. The fact is, Pecan Acres was built in a flood plain with no drainage, with all of the houses built as slab on grade. And not surprisingly, the place has flooded 17 times since it was constructed.
Those residents aren’t climate refugees. They’re proof that if you live in a house at the bottom of a bowl, and your house is not raised, you will flood.
For the Fake News media to be working this hard to find “climate refugees” is a good indication that those don’t really exist.
…
Is there any truth to the rumor that Catherine Pugh, Baltimore’s scandal-ridden mayor on the lam , will be playing the part of Toad in an upcoming remake of The Wind in the Willows ? If so, that’s perfect casting.
…
Finally, remember when the Democrats screamed about how the government shutdown was going to kill economic growth?
First-quarter gross domestic product expanded by 3.2%, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its initial read of the economy for that period.
Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the U.S. economy increased by 2.5% in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product for the first quarter was the best start to a year since 2015.
At some point, we do get to tell these so-called “experts” who are more Democrat political operatives than actual legitimate forecasters to shut up, do we not?"
Census and Citizenship: The Wrong Question,spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/census-and-citizenship-the-wrong-question/,"by H. Sterling Burnett
E ver notice how we so often ask the wrong question? Which usually leads to the wrong and/or the irrelevant answer. Sometimes I think our public discourse is one long non-sequitur. We’re currently roiled by the question of whether or not the 2020 census form should ask if the person filling out the form is a citizen of the United States. The nerve of those census guys.
The Trump administration says the question is necessary as an aid to complying with some of the more arithmetic requirements of the Voting Rights Act. (Whether these requirements still make sense — or ever did — are questions for another day.) These requirements oblige us to sort citizens from gate crashers. The Blue Birds from the Cow Birds. Democrats are against including the question, claiming it would make it less likely that citizens of other countries here illegally — a major Democrat constituency — would fill out and return the form. This would make the population count less accurate, thereby, and here’s the real point of their opposition, lessening the number of Democrat-majority congressional districts. (Funny how Democrats have not been moved to object when the census long form has asked far more buttinsky questions than “Are you a citizen?” How it’s a legitimate concern of the federals how many toilets I have in my house, I’ve no clue.)
Those old white guys writing our constitution in Philadelphia these many years ago got an amazing number of things right. Many things righter than they have been got before or since. But just as God had His inattentive moments during Creation when He gave us radishes and Brussels sprouts, so did the Founders commit an unforced error when they decreed the census should count all U.S. “inhabitants” rather than all U.S. “citizens.” E-Founders, if you’re keeping score.
As is so often the case with Democrats, they’re attempting to sell this one on the basis of principle, when it’s about power and nothing else. Congressional districts are apportioned on the basis of the census count, which includes illegals. So not counting citizens of other countries in the census means fewer Democrats in Congress. Population — of Americans and otherwise — is also the basis for handing out federal grant money. (Why this money should be extracted from localities and sent on a two-way trip to Washington — with 30 percent taken out for administration — and returned with federal strings attached, is also a question for another day.) These are the only reasons why Democrats don’t want to scare off Mexicans and Colombians and Salvadorans and Guatemalans from participating in the census. They also explain why when Democrats say they too want border security, they’re lying. They don’t. It’s not in their power interest to in any way slow the flow of undocumented Democrats from south of the border. This also explains why a white-as-rice Irish guy named O’Rourke, who fetched up in Texas, is pleased to be called “Beto.”
I’m sure by now nimble TAS readers have seen that the question we should be asking is: Why the hell should Mexicans, Colombians, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans be represented in the United States Congress? A corollary to that one is: Why should we believe what any Democrat says on anything having to do with immigration?"
Aloha Snackbar: Getting Serious About the Ideological War on Terror,spectator.org,Jed Babbin,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/aloha-snackbar-getting-serious-about-the-ideological-war-on-terror/,"by H. Sterling Burnett
A ccording to the Hill newspaper, President Trump has, on sixteen occasions, said that ISIS had been defeated or soon would be. U.S. and allied ground forces have ended ISIS’ claim that it had established a caliphate in Syria by seizing its territory. But ISIS is as much an idea as a terrorist network. It has not by any means been defeated.
The Easter Day bombings of Sri Lankan churches, which killed about 250 Christian worshippers, were claimed by ISIS as one of their attacks in a video reported by Asia Times . Regardless of whether ISIS’s claim is true, it has seized the murderous success of those attacks as an ideological weapon to prove its continued existence.
Similarly, al-Qaeda has not been defeated. Osama bin Laden was killed by SEAL Team Six but bin Laden’s deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is still at large, rebuilding what has been destroyed since 9/11. Bin Laden’s son, Hamza, may be ready to take command of the resurgent al-Qaeda. There’s already a U.S. bounty of $1 million for the capture of Hamza.
The Taliban have not been defeated, nor have Hizballah and the many other terrorist networks that are at war with us.
We can capture and kill terrorists endlessly but we cannot seem to deter more from joining their murderous ranks. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote that is true because we are suffering from “terrorism fatigue.” He prescribes precisely the wrong cure for that affliction.
Ignatius says that the wars on terrorism are part of a past that people and politicians want to escape. That may be true, but that’s not the reality of war. War is a binary function: either you’re winning or you’re losing. We’re not winning.
He says we have failed because although we killed a lot of terrorists, we achieved no tangible gains. That’s true. Nothing we established in Iraq or Afghanistan has lasted long enough to change the conditions in either country for any length of time.
Ignatius’s conclusion is that the alternative to costly wars is the “… slow and unglamorous work of preventing weak states from collapsing to the point that they’re terrorism havens. It’s about building governance and economic development, rather than night raids by Special Operations forces.”
His prescription is the same admixture of neoconservative interventionism and liberal piety that failed us under George W. Bush and Barack Obama and which Donald Trump seems unable to shake off. It’s that America should shoulder the burden (in lives and dollars) of nation-building in Islamic states and take the blame when that fails as it always has and will in the future.
Terrorist attacks around the world are no more than one-day stories to the media. Al-Qaeda will soon rise again while Hizballah and dozens of other terrorist networks continue to thrive. And that’s not because the worst of the terrorists are poor and underprivileged.
Islamic terrorists aren’t the downtrodden poor who turn to terrorism as a rebellion against economic or political oppression. They come from many walks of life, many among them the best educated and most privileged members of their societies.
We know Mohammed Atta was not unusual among the 9/11 hijackers. He was college educated and very much a member of the middle class. Inshaf and Ilham Ibrahim, two of the Sri Lankan suicide bombers on Easter Sunday, were the wealthy sons of a spice trader. Ilham, according to the Financial Times , ran a thriving copper factory. Eight of the so-far identified Sri Lankan suicide bombers were members of the middle or upper-middle classes of their nation.
They aren’t driven to terrorism by America’s actions — though they claim to be — so why do so many believe so fervently in the destruction of the West, of our culture and history? They are driven by the ideology of Islam. Make no mistake: Islam is as much an ideology as it is a religion, and its most prominent believers wage an ideological war against us every day.
In both aspects of the terrorists’ ideological war — one aimed at the population of Muslim nations and one aimed at the West — we see the same glorification of terrorism and denigration of everything the West is and stands for.
Virtually every Western media outlet, cowed by political correctness, engages in self-censorship in respect to Islamic propaganda. Almost none is sufficiently courageous to challenge statements by even the most radical of Islamists. You can see that at work whenever CAIR, Ilhan Omar, or any other Islamist makes a statement.
If you take the time to read the output of the Middle East Media Research Institute ( www.memri.org ) you find four common themes that are expressed in Arab and Iranian media: America is the most corrupt and evil influence in the world; that every Muslim has a duty to the global Islamic community (“ummah”) to fight against the West, by jihadi terrorism and in every other way; that Islam is the supreme religion which every person will inevitably believe in or be dominated by; and that terrorism must be accompanied by a political campaign to overthrow the West.
Those thoughts make up much of the ideology of Islam. It is deeply embedded in Muslim societies by more than a thousand years of teaching and worship.
The main reason that we have not won any of the wars we have fought against terrorism is that we have refused to engage in the essential war against Islamist ideology. President George W. Bush proclaimed Islam as the religion of peace because he feared angering every Muslim nation. President Barack Hussein Obama surrendered the ideological war preemptively and President Donald Trump — who has said that we need to fight the ideological war — has not even begun doing so.
To win any war, the enemy needs to understand it is defeated and conclude that further fighting is useless to its cause. We have defeated terrorists on the battlefield, killed Osama bin Laden and other terrorists by the thousands, but they have not been defeated because their ideology still promises them success if the fight continues.
No ideology can be contained as if it were a nation such as the Soviet Union. History proves that ideas — even the most evil of them — spread across national boundaries as quickly as their messengers can carry them. The fact that the Islamist ideology has caused its believers great harm is not credible to those who believe in it.
In July 2014, a liberal British newspaper, the Economist , wrote that “Islam, or at least modern interpretations of it, is at the core of some of the Arabs’ deep troubles. The faith’s claim, promoted by many of its leading lights, to combine spiritual and earthly authority, with no separation of mosque and state, has stunted the development of independent political institutions.… But only the Arabs can reverse their civilizational decline, and right now there is little hope of that happening.”
That is because of the grip the Islamists’ ideology has on its adherents, which is both religious and political. In that respect it’s unlike communism and Nazism, ideologies we have fought against and won.
As I have written many times, beginning in 2006 , the only way to win this war, and have any lasting effect on the terrorist networks and the nations that support them, is to discredit and defeat their ideology. It will require us to assemble the best psychologists and psychological warfare experts to craft — and continuously adapt — the strategies and tactics of our ideological counter attack.
Part of those strategies and tactics can be derived from the late William F. Buckley, Jr.’s delightfully obscure instruction about defeating liberalism: “Don’t let them immanentize the eschaton.” That means, if you substitute fifty-cent words for Buckley’s fifty-dollar words, don’t let the adversary transform spiritual beliefs into earthly politics.
That strategy will require an “all government” effort that will last for years, perhaps decades. The tactics will require everything from mockery — substituting “Aloha Snackbar” for the jihadi war cry, “Allah Akbar” — to sophisticated attacks on the idea that adherence to Islam is the inevitable fate of all men.
Unless we make the ideological war a lasting priority it cannot succeed. We have waited almost eighteen years from 9/11 to begin counterattacking in the ideological war. It’s long past time that we did."

The New York Times ? How about more accurately calling it Der New York Stürmer ? This despicable anti-Semitic publication has been attacking Jews mercilessly for more than half a century. Now its Jew-hatred has been translated into pictures for those neo-Nazis of the Left and Right who have difficulty keeping up with words that are spelled with letters.
In a vicious, unforgivable cartoon over the Passover holy season, the international edition of Der New York Stürmer published a cartoon depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog — a dirty Jew dog — with a big Jewish Star of David hanging from its neck. Get it? Jew dogs? Get it? A Star of David? Get it? Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) surely got it. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) certainly got it. In fact, lots of Democrats running for President would have gotten it: Irish-Scottish Robert “Play-Doh” O’Rourke, Princess Speaking Bull Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders.
Just recall the outrage when Roseanne Barr, in one of her idiot moments on Twitter, tweeted that Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett was the offspring of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes. Hold the presses! African Americans and apes? End of the “Roseanne” show. End of the Roseanne career. No apologies accepted. No matter whether she was drug-induced, alcohol-induced, stress-induced. She. Is. Permanently. Finished.
But compare Jews with dogs? Well, tomorrow is another day.
There is a rabid strain of new anti-Semitism now rife throughout the Left, permeating well into the Democrat party’s lowest and highest echelons and their media wing. It is a raw Jew-hatred that masks itself as “anti-Zionism.” Anti-Zionism? Baloney. It is raw Jew-hatred. It holds Jews to standards that no one else is held to. It creates insane stereotypes of Jews that are so crazy that they actually generate self-fulfilling prophecies. Take a look and listen to this recent “anti-Zionist” conference sponsored by universities including the University of North Carolina and Duke University, with a $235,000 grant from the United States Department of Education. When you go to this link , focus at 2:20 and following. Your tax dollars at work.
We soon shall return to the Jew-haters now running for President on the Democrat side, but first back to Der New York Stürmer ’s cartoon. The Jew Dog is pulling along a big fat blind man with a yarmulka — a Jew cap like the one I wear — bearing the face of Donald Trump. Get it? The Jews are pulling Trump along. He does not know they are pulling him because he is stupid and blind. And besides he wears a kippah , a yarmulka . Like, what, he is secretly a Jew? How did the Nazi Ilhan Omar once put it ? Oh, yes: the Jews of Israel are hypnotizing the world.
Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel. #Gaza #Palestine #Israel

If ever there has been an “America First” President it has been Donald Trump. Whether in dealing with protecting our southern border or confronting NATO or imposing devastating tariffs on foreign goods coming from international trade cheaters from China and Europe and Asia, or turning America into a net exporter of energy — this President is not led by his nose by anyone . His support for Israel is because he knows, as do the vast majority of all Americans and the almost-unanimous predominance of Republican conservatives, that Israel stands in lockstep with America, while every other entity in the Middle East has had one foot in with the former Soviets or the present-day Russians, one foot here, one foot there.
Israel is the one place in the Middle East where the United States reliably can station weapons for use elsewhere as needed to protect American interests in the region. It is the one country in the region that never would deny American air force access to air space. Every time Israel destroys a Russian-made tank or plane, it shares the lessons learned with the American Defense Department. As Russians develop new weapons to shoot down American fighter planes, Israel is the laboratory in its wars with the Arab Muslims where American-made counter weapons are employed and tested. Often, Israel’s experience in combat then leads the Israelis to upgrade the American weapons from battlefield lessons drawn, and all those upgrades then are shared with America. That is the reason that, from one American Administration to another, Israel often has had problems with America’s State Department and foreign diplomats who imagine they can curry favor with terrorists like Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) and the Saudi Wahhabis, but Israel always enjoys the strongest of its backing from America’s Defense establishment. Because they have access to the guarded military secrets that protect our nation — and they know.
That is why this President stopped sending hundreds of millions annually to the Palestine Authority for them to pay lifetime annuities with our money to families of terrorists who have murdered Americans and other civilians. Why this President recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem — a promise that even Obama made, as did Bush 43 and Clinton before him. The President pulled out of the Iran Deal because “America First” means not having crazy Shiite mullahs with nuclear missiles pointed at Washington, D.C. He pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council because it is anti-American no less than it is anti-Israel and is comprised of blood-thirsty cut-throat regimes.
Donald Trump does what he believes is best for America First. The Left — even Der New York Stürmer — regularly attack him for just that. And although Netanyahu and Israel would have loved for America to remain highly engaged militarily in Syria, President Trump made clear that “America First” means changing course to pulling our troops out of Syria, much as we have to get our boys home from all those dirt holes. No one pulls this President around.
Back to Der New York Stürmer. The message of that cartoon came straight out of Nazi Germany’s Der Stürmer , whose cartoons were the same . The implication of the all-powerful International Jew. The ones who run the world with their money. How did the Nazi Ilhan Omar put it? “It’s about the Benjamins, baby!” (By the way, since she took her Nazi tropes public, Ilhan Omar has raised $1 million. When using Nazi stereotypes to attack Jews, it’s about the Benjamins, baby.)
Many observers will wonder: Are you saying that Jews are anti-Semitic? Isn’t Der New York Stürmer owned and operated by Jews, the Ochs-Sulzberger family? Well, if a century and a half of Karl Marxes (actually, the anti-Semitic son of a father who converted to Christianity) and Leon Trotskys and Lev Kamenevs and Grigory Zinovievs and George Soroses and Bernie Sanderses have not yet made it clear, here is a cup of coffee — smell it and wake up to it: some of the worst anti-Semites in every generation are Jews . They are there to give cover to the haters, to clear the air and pave the way for the White Nationalists at one extreme and the rabid Communists at the other extreme to go after the Jews.
Remember how Ilhan Omar was going to be condemned for being the Nazi she is? Remember how a resolution was going to call her out for saying that Jews hypnotize the world, dominate the world with their money? And then along came Bernie Sanders — an anti-Semite who honeymooned in the most anti-Semitic place on earth, Communist Russia; a Communist who praised Soviet breadlines and admired the Soviet Union — and he gave the all-clear to Ilhan Omar. That is all it took. A Jew came out to clear her, so now the rest of the Democrats could line up with her.
Before long, we found Elizabeth Warren whitewashing Omar while calling Netanyahu the racist. Irish-Scottish Play-Doh O’Rourke, who does not have a Mexican or other Hispanic bone or gene in his body, suddenly paused from his skateboarding and free-falling in the polls to call Netanyahu a racist. One by one, led by the anti-Semitic Bernie Sanders, they each now defame Netanyahu as a racist while giving the Nazi Omar a free pass. It always begins with a Jew. Just as the same Sanders led the fight in the Senate against the bill to punish the “BDS” campaign against Israel. Just as Sanders led the way to bring into the Democrat party certain anti-Israel individuals who never before could gain entry at that level. Just as Sanders’s own campaign staffs have included people so anti-Semitic that even he had to fire them. Like Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev, Soros, so it is that Sanders does not fight all Jews. Only those who comprise the majority of Israel’s Jewish electorate, only those who oppose BDS, only those who stand for Torah principles, only those who believe that Israel has a right to defend itself as it sees it must.
And so it is with Der New York Stürmer . A “Jewish” newspaper? During the Holocaust, they white-washed the Nazi murder machine, giving it almost no coverage, just as their Walter Duranty white-washed Stalin’s Holodomor , the Ukrainian Holocaust. By and large, they refused to report on the unfolding Nazi Holocaust of six million Jews. Between 1939 and 1945, they published more than 23,000 front-page stories. Of those, 11,500 were about World War II. Only twenty-six — in six years — were about the Holocaust.
Next, as a country named “Israel” became a possibility after World War II, Der New York Stürmer led the American media effort to prevent the country from ever rising. They gave undue coverage to a minute, meaningless group called the “American Council for Judaism,” an utterly irrelevant organization comprised of some Reform Jews who opposed a Jewish country. And for the past seven decades since Israel’s founding, they have given disproportionate coverage and attention to every Israeli flaw while whitewashing the full destructive reality of Hamas on Israel’s southern border, Mahmoud Abbas’s Arab terrorism on Israel’s eastern border, and Hezbollah terrorism on Israel’s northern border. In covering Israel’s wars, they report civilian casualties without giving the context that Hamas sets up its weapons and terror infrastructure in school buildings, hospitals, mosques, and apartment buildings to force Israel to choose between allowing the terror a free sanctuary or bombing those buildings while imperiling civilians.
And they create a myth of some kind of illegality in Jews living in Judea and Samaria.
The people of Israel are tired of being told by anyone where Jews in Israel may live and where Jews may build. For two thousand years Jew haters have been telling Jews where not to live. England expelled all Jews in 1290. France expelled its Jews in 1182. As their economy started collapsing, they allowed the Jews back in 1188. Then they expelled Jews again in 1306. As the French economy started collapsing again, they invited Jews back in 1315. They expelled Jews again in 1394. Spain, at the height of their world power, expelled all Jews in 1492. Within a hundred years, their Spanish armada collapsed in 1588, and now Spain is a charming destination for a nice cruise to visit once-important historic locales. Portugal, once the greatest world power alongside Spain, even leading along with Spain in exploring the New World, expelled all Jews in 1497. Today Portugal make a nice side excursion during the cruise of Spain historic sites, perhaps to pick up a bottle or two of Port wine. And so it goes. For purposes of space, we will omit the history in Germany.
For two thousand years Jew-haters have told Jews they may not live here and may not live there, ending with the refrain: “Why don’t you damned Jews just get out of Europe and go live in Israel?” Now in the modern era, Jews have been driven there by haters in Europe, and by others in the Soviet Union who drove out a million, and by an entire Arab Muslim world who expelled 800,000 Jews from North Africa in the 1940s and 1950s to go to Israel. And now they would be telling Jews in Israel that they may not build homes for themselves even in Israel , even in Biblical Judea and Samaria, even in Jerusalem? As recently as the Obama Wasted Decade, Obama demanded that Israel not build Jewish homes in East Jerusalem. Hillary screamed that Israel not build Jewish homes in East Jerusalem. And Joe Biden blasted Israel for building Jewish homes in East Jerusalem. Yet, for all Biden’s endless recent apologies over other public policies that he legitimately and properly advocated in the past, his vulgar opposition to Jews building homes in Jerusalem remains a true crime for which Biden never has apologized.
So Der New York Stürmer finally has shown its true colors: red, white, and black — the colors of Hitler’s swastika flag. Not merely because of one hateful anti-Semitic cartoon it published on the holy seventh day of Passover. But because of a century and more of attacking Jews, whitewashing the Nazi Holocaust, over-emphasizing the American Council for Judaism and fighting the rise of Israel, and tilting its coverage towards Arab demands against Israel. Whether they are publishing op-eds insanely arguing that “ Jesus was a Palestinian ” or editorializing against Jewish rights to live in East Jerusalem, Kiryat Arba , elsewhere in Judea and Samaria, or just publishing Jew-hatred in pictures, they now are exposed: All the Jews That Can Be Hit in Print."
Listen to Joe diGenova,spectator.org,George Parry,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/listen-to-joe-digenova/,"by Betsy McCaughey
N ow that the Russian collusion hoax has been debunked, and not even the Hillary Clinton acolytes who comprised Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office saw fit to charge the president with obstruction of justice, the party is about to get very rough for the FBI, Justice Department, and CIA leaders who concocted the hoax and who illegally spied on American citizens. On April 10, 2019, Attorney General William Barr testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee that Donald Trump’s presidential campaign had been spied upon by U.S. intelligence agencies. According to Barr, the “question was whether it [the spying] was adequately predicated.” Barr was careful to state explicitly that he had made no determination as to whether there was an adequate justification for the spying, but that he was going to investigate to resolve the issue.
Clearly Barr was talking about the eponymous and unverified Steele dossier which was used by the FBI and Justice Department to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page and, by extension, everyone in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated.
Predictably Barr’s testimony resulted in a tidal wave of apoplectic outrage by Democrats and their media adjunct. Some denounced Barr as a shill for Trump while others called for his impeachment.
Now it appears that Barr was only hinting at the enormity of what is actually being investigated.
Joseph diGenova is the former U. S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and a former legal counsel to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. He has also been a frequent commentator on Fox News and Washington’s WMAL Radio. Throughout the Trump-Russia collusion fiasco and Team Mueller’s investigation of the president, diGenova has proven to be a reliable source of information as to what was happening behind the scenes. His pronouncements and predictions have consistently proven to be true.
On April 24, 2019, diGenova appeared on the Ingraham Angle and made his most explosive predictions yet. Here’s the link to the video . What follows below is a partial transcript of his remarks starting at 27 seconds into the broadcast.
It has been evident from day one that there was a brazen plot to exonerate Hillary Clinton illegally, and then, if she lost the election, to frame Donald Trump. This [Steele] dossier was a knowing part of that. It was created by Hillary Clinton. It was created knowingly by [former CIA Director] John Brennan as part of a scheme to do everything they could to harm Donald Trump.
The problem for Brennan and [former Director of National Intelligence] Clapper and [former FBI Director] Comey and [former FBI General Counsel] Baker and all of them now is, is that the FISA Court has already communicated with the Justice Department about its findings. And their findings are that from more than four years before the election of Donald Trump, there was an illegal spying operation going on by FBI [private] contractors — four of them — to steal personal information, electronic information about Americans and to use it against the Republican Party.
There are going to be indictments. There’s going to be grand juries. John Brennan isn’t going to need one lawyer. He’s going to need five!
After the discussion turned to the upcoming report by the Justice Department’s Inspector General, diGenova made another stunning prediction, to wit:
There’s another report that everybody has forgotten about that involves James Comey alone. That will be out in two weeks. That report is going to be a bombshell. It’s going to open the investigation on a very high note.
The FISA Court abuse is the center of this entire abuse of governmental power. The Chief Judge of that court [Rosemary M. Collyer] has already ruled that the FBI broke the law and that the people at the head of the [Obama] Justice Department — [ former Deputy Attorney General] Sally Yates, John Carlin, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, all knew about it and lied to the court, the FISA Court, about it.
Near the end of the show, diGenova concluded his remarks as follows:
There is a hero in this entire story, and it’s not a lawyer. All the bad people in this story are lawyers. There’s a hero. His name is Admiral Mike Rogers. He was the head of the National Security Agency. He discovered the illegal spying. He went personally to the FISA Court and briefed the Chief Judge and worked with her for months to uncover the people who did it. The FISA Court has already told the Justice department who lied to that court and that has been given to [Attorney General] Bill Barr already.
Much of what diGenova said is partially supported by Chief Judge Collyer’s heavily redacted April 26, 2017 Memorandum Opinion, which is linked here . Reading and understanding the opinion is very difficult due to its use of technical and legal terms and extensive redactions at strategic points. The opinion states that it was the National Security Agency that brought the abuses to the court’s attention and that raw intelligence data from FISA intercepts had been illegally disseminated to “private contractors” working for the FBI. If you make the effort to read it, the juiciest parts start at page 82.
So, there it is. If diGenova’s track record holds, a legal rain of ruin is about to befall the deep state operatives who tried to steal the 2016 election and, failing that, to unwind the result. And if, in fact, the enormous surveillance powers of our intelligence agencies were usurped by the Obama administration to spy for years before the election on the opposing political party, then the implications go far beyond just one election and one presidential candidate. If that happened, then there can be no doubt that, when candidate Obama promised to “fundamentally transform America,” he really meant it. If Obama’s “fundamental transformation” involved not only the atrocious harassment and intimidation of the Tea Party patriots by his Internal Revenue Service, but also included surveillance state spying on the Republican Party generally, there must be no question about whether the deep state actors should be punished for their actions.
Think about it. The Watergate burglary was a bungled attempt by the Committee to Re-Elect President Nixon to break into Democrat headquarters to plant listening devices in the telephones. The burglary failed, but the national outrage at the mere attempt drove Nixon from office and sent members of his administration to prison. As bad as that was, at least the Nixon campaign didn’t corrupt the FBI and CIA to do its dirty work. So it is that, if our official law enforcement and intelligence agencies were co-opted by the Obama administration to illegally spy on American citizens and the opposition party, this will be the worst governmental scandal and threat to our civil liberties in the history of the nation.
If Joe diGenova is right, the very survival of the rule of law and our constitutional republic mandates that these treasonous thugs — no matter how highly placed in the Obama administration — be exposed, charged, and imprisoned.

Elizabeth Warren: Going Big Bailing Out the Higher Education Lobby,spectator.org,Doug Bandow,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/elizabeth-warren-going-big-bailing-out-the-higher-education-lobby/,"by Betsy McCaughey
W ith President Donald Trump seemingly vulnerable politically, you would expect the Democratic presidential nomination process to attract the best and the brightest. Here is one of those fabled political inflection points, a moment the next president might engineer a major ideological alignment. Imagine joining Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson on the progressive pantheon.
So far, alas, the Democratic contenders fail to impress. They are visiting the usual interest groups and making the usual promises, with those little radical twists so beloved by activists. But intellectual heft has yet to make its entrance. Elizabeth Warren is supposed to be the policy heavyweight, but consider her grand initiative to bail out the bloated, over-funded, highly politicized higher education lobby.
This is a winning idea?
Consider it a Marshall Plan for university administrators and professors. Warren would lavish another $1.25 trillion — why start at a billion when you can add another three zeroes?! — on the college sector, which few people mistake as productive or needy. Everyone involved would be invited to belly up to the federal trough.
Washington would eliminate tuition at public colleges and universities. Government grants for student living expenses would increase by $100 billion. A special fund of $50 billion would be created for historically black schools. Write off most student debt, estimated to be about $640 billion worth. Up to $50,000 in student loans would be eliminated for students earning up to 100k a year. A portion would be eliminated for those earning up to a quarter of a million a year.
“This touches people’s lives,” Warren exclaimed. But it would be easier to touch them by simply loading up some B-52s with cash and bombing the countryside!
How to pay for it? Tax the rich, of course.
As giveaways go it’s a great plan. More than 42 million Americans would benefit. About 75 percent of student debtors would get a free ride. And the usual suspects employed by the educational blob would get guaranteed jobs.
What’s not to like?
First, Sen. Warren appears to be spending her “tax the rich” proceeds multiple times — she also wants universal childcare, increased affordable housing, and, of course, Medicare for all. That’s just to start before the first debate and candidates in the rear begin throwing policy long-bombs to get attention. As the European welfare states well know, everyone has to pay more taxes to underwrite generous social benefits. As a result, the European tax systems are less progressive than America’s revenue structure. Thus, the rich wouldn’t pay off the university sector under Warren’s plan. All Americans would do so.
Second, most people do not go to college and there is no reason they should. For many people higher education is a default, something they feel they are expected to do. As more people did so without much of a plan, job requirements naturally increased. A university degree now is expected for many jobs even if it not particularly useful.
Contrary to Warren’s claim, much higher schooling provides few or no useful work skills. It is a credential, perhaps representing some level of commitment and discipline, but even those depend on the student’s own commitment and experience. And as more people with little interest in more schooling per se get the degree, employers have little choice but to add other credentials, further increasing job requirements.
Making it easier for everyone to go to school for no reason is not the way to generate those heart-warming anecdotes of the disadvantaged kid reaching the stars. The Warren program has nothing to do with intent, need, or benefit. It would just toss money at something which is presumed to be a good thing, without any evidence of the claimed benefits. Other than for politicians, who would be buying votes and hooking even more people on government subsidies.
Third, the ambitious politico from Massachusetts would reward bad decisions and punish good ones. Want to go to college to punch your ticket? Mark time while you figure out what to do with your life? Enjoy a little more subsidized time at your parents’ and Granddaddy Uncle Sam’s expense? This is the plan for you.
What if you decide to eschew college as not for you? Seek a two-year rather than a four-year degree? Choose technical training over a university? Go to college but look for lower cost options? Work while in school to limit student debt? Once employed, pay down your debt more quickly than necessary? Then Warren plays you for the sucker. You get to pay for everyone else.
Fourth, the Warren plan is reverse income distribution at its worst. She complained that student debt is “the result of a government that has consistently put the interests of wealthy and well-connected over the interest of working families.” How is that, exactly? Most students go to college as a means to increase their future earnings. That is, they capture most of the benefits of attending.
Surely Warren knows that her comparison of college to K-12 schooling makes no sense. The social benefits of education are strongest at the most basic levels — learning reading, writing, and arithmetic! — and fall sharply at higher levels. The value almost certainly turns negative at schools which promote left-wing esoterica, like providing coloring books to students to soften the impact of hearing views different from their own.
Indeed, two-thirds of Americans don’t go to college. Warren would have them underwrite their mostly better-off neighbors. Give South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg credit for his response: “Americans who have a college degree earn more than Americans who don’t. As a progressive, I have a hard time getting my head around the idea of a majority who earn less because they didn’t go to college subsidizing a minority who earn more because they do.”
But this is what interest group liberalism is all about. Public school systems are favored over students. Corporate behemoths are protected from fiscal irresponsibility courtesy the taxpayers. Incumbent businesses are shielded from competition at consumer expense. Interest group liberalism is predicated on aiding the worthy — if politically influential — against everyone else.
Fifth, higher education is awash in cash, and that influx has inflated the very tuition costs which Warren denounces. Schools are aware that federal taxpayers are tossing billions of dollars in loans at students. Which means more kids can afford to pay more. Thereby reducing resistance to rising tuition.
Of course, students and their families are big losers from this process. They pay higher tuition and with loans that must be paid back. The total cost of education rises, hobbling students’ financial future. The problem is not government policy favoring the “wealthy and well-connected,” but designed to benefit the university complex. Which has made many of its members wealthy and well-connected. Academia may be the highest, most jealously guarded progressive redoubt in American society.
Sixth, the logistics of such a program would get messy very quickly. Once established, subsidies would become sacrosanct. The pushing and shoving at the federal trough would become fearsome to behold. Would money be distributed by formula? Who would get to set the numbers? Does anyone imagine Congress staying out of the porkfest?
Warren explained that “The federal government will partner with states to split the costs of tuition and fees and ensure that states maintain their current levels of funding on need-based financial aid and academic instruction.” How precisely would she do that? Uncle Sam can’t force states to subsidize education. Would she punish students if their states cut back by reducing federal subsidies? What if states chose not to increase funding as new students, attracted by the prospect of a freebie degree, flooded in? Would influential Congress stand by members’ districts and states were penalized?
Obviously, Washington could easily cancel the student debt that it owns. What about privately held loans? Paying off banks would be a subsidy to them, as if they need it. Warren apparently realizes that, having said the feds would “work with the borrower and the owner of the debt” to encourage its elimination. Which means what? Tell bankers they should write off the loans? Good luck with that! Make them see the wisdom of that course by adopting a Corleone approach? Even most liberal judges wouldn’t square that with the Constitution. If more coercive approaches were successful, consider the consequences for the health of the financial system and future of employees and shareholders, who are not as well off as Sen. Warren, and many of the students she wants to aid.
Seventh, reducing competition in higher education isn’t likely to improve the quality of schooling. There is no reason to presume that Americans get their money’s worth from all the private and public money spent on colleges and universities. Insulating government-funded schools from competition would not improve any of them.
Yet Warren’s plan would put private schools in a deep financial hole, making them even less competitive economically. It hardly seems fair to use the taxes paid by their administrators, professors, graduates, and students’ parents to underwrite competing schools. And doing so would render an entire echelon of competitors too expensive. That would be a gift of monopoly to the public sector.
Of course, private schools might thwart Warren’s public preference. No doubt, they would clamor for their place on the federal teat, to gain a subsidy at least equivalent to that delivered to public institutions. And who believes progressives willing to saddle working stiffs with the cost of sending kids of privilege to public university would stop there? Especially if private schools promised to adopt whatever progressive mandates Warren’s colleagues were inclined to impose. Then her budget estimates would fall by the wayside, and the tax burden would have to be increased even more on those working families Warren claims she wants to protect.
Eighth, once the formulas are established for doling out the loot to colleges and universities across the nation, administrator and professors alike could look forward to the good life with even fewer worries about accountability. Today schools sometimes don’t attract enough students and fail. If cash is available for even the most unsuitable student to attend the least effective school, would even the worst institution ever have to close its doors?
Bankruptcy is painful, but it performs an important public service: it frees up potentially productive resources for use elsewhere. That applies to the education sector no less than elsewhere in the economy. Once provided, subsidies would be virtually impossible to end, as legislators lined up to protect institutions in their districts and states. Colleges and universities would become welfare dependents.
Ninth, the economic benefits of Warren’s plan to enrich higher education are imaginary. There’s no free money: paying tuition and canceling debts means diverting resources from other people and uses. If writing off debt really would create the wonderful “economic stimulus” that she predicts, then why not apply the principle more broadly?
Many people are burdened by high mortgages, which helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis. Why not wipe the mortgage slate clean? Some people go into debt to purchase vehicles necessary for work and life. Why not eliminate all auto-related debt? People accumulate personal debt for all sorts of good and important reasons, providing social as well as economic benefits. Why not free people from these debts? The feds could create a tsunami of economic stimulus by getting rid of all debt now and forever more!
Warren’s educational lobby bail-out is a bad idea. But the biggest problem is principle, not practical.
Warren calls college “a basic need that should be available for free to everyone who wants to go.” But why stop there? Food is a basic need. Housing is a basic need. Clothes are a basic need. Health care is a basic need. Transportation is a basic need. Even culture is a basic need. For progressives, what isn’t a basic need? Why not make them all free for everyone? For Warren, “basic need” is living your dream at someone else’s expense.
Moreover, she says this is a great deal since “we can fully cover the costs of these ideas with revenue from my Ultra-Millionaire Tax on the wealthiest 75,000 families in the country — those with fortunes of $50 million or more.” Granted, most people, me included, would like to live at someone else’s expense. However, why does having more money obligate someone to underwrite everyone else?
The rich earned their cash. If the system was unfair — and our own is permeated by the seemingly endless looting and pillaging in Washington — then it should be reformed. But wealth per se, no matter how “excessive” it might seem to social engineers like the former academic turned Massachusetts politician, does not belong to Sen. Warren, and the other well-connected, influential, and pampered members of the political class.
The Democratic presidential contest has barely started and candidates are spewing forth their worst nightmares as their electoral platforms. The race for November 2020 is likely to be even longer and more painful than the worst pessimists imagined.

The Sheen Center is located at 18 Bleecker Street, on the corner of Bleecker and Elizabeth. The marker on the base of the building has the year of construction (1926) etched in stone with a cross. The cross harkens back to the days when the building was a Catholic school. Abutting the Sheen Center is what used to be Our Lady of Loreto Church, where the likes of Scorsese would have attended Mass, among numerous other parishes within a stone’s throw, such as the historic Old St. Patrick’s Cathedral , where Scorsese was an altar boy and where the cemetery wall remains that once nearly served as a barricade for Irish Catholics to defend not only their church but their religious freedom during a time of violent anti-Catholicism.
Sharing that same block, abutting the Sheen Center, is the original Planned Parenthood center founded by Margaret Sanger. The address is 26 Bleecker, where the clinic sits on the corner of Bleecker and the famous Mott Street. A sign informs passersby that this is Margaret Sanger Square.
This was a haunt of Maggie back in the day, when she would have rubbed shoulders with numerous Irish and Italian Catholics. Her mother had been a devout Irish Catholic, and if her mom had followed Margaret’s fanatical obeisance to birth control, Margaret might have never been born.
Back in the day, Margaret also would have crossed paths with Dorothy Day, whose Catholic Worker offices still sit right up the street.
Today, Day’s Catholic Worker is not nearly as prolific as it was, but Sanger’s Planned Parenthood is as prolific as ever. It leads America in not only contraceptives but abortions.
They reportedly do abortions at the Planned Parenthood shop on Bleecker, with occasions of women being escorted out in wheelchairs because of botched procedures. I noticed many African-Americans in the neighborhood. As every liberal knows, or should know, unborn black children are far and away disproportionate victims of Planned Parenthood’s abortion business. Planned Parenthood clinics are almost always located in or near black communities.
That visit to Bleecker got me thinking about the column I posted here at The American Spectator last week, on how New Yorkers (as well as people in Philadelphia) have banished Kate Smith’s “God Bless America” because of the discovery of Kate having sung two songs that contained racial references that we today consider offensive. I find this most ironic: Kate Smith’s songs cannot begin to compare to the sheer offensiveness of what Margaret Sanger did racially.
Sanger preached a gospel of “race improvement” and denounced what she called “human weeds” and “morons” and “idiots” and “imbeciles” and the “dead weight of human waste.” She took that message to some outrageous audiences. In May 1926, Sanger spoke to the women’s chapter of the KKK in Silver Lake, New Jersey, which she wrote about on pages 366-367 of her 1938 autobiography.
Yes, the Ku Klux Klan. The founder of Planned Parenthood accepted an invitation to and spoke to the KKK. She was a smash-hit .
Do liberals complain about this today? No. Liberals revere Sanger. If there was a Progressive Mt. Rushmore, they’d have long ago chiseled Maggie’s mug on the mountain.
Hillary Clinton glows that she is “in awe of” Sanger. She said so in 2009 upon receiving Planned Parenthood’s “highest honor” that year: its coveted Margaret Sanger Award . Likewise effusive was Nancy Pelosi when she proudly accepted the award in 2014 .
Speaking to Planned Parenthood a year earlier, Barack Obama, America’s first black president, hailed the organization founded by this racial eugenicist committed to creating a “race of thoroughbreds” and purging America’s “race of degenerates.”
That phrase, “creating a race of thoroughbreds,” once beamed across the masthead of Sanger’s Birth Control Review . Writing in her Birth Control Review in October 1921, Sanger celebrated: “Today eugenics is suggested by the most diverse minds as the most adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political, and social problems.” She lamented “the inferior classes, the fertility of the feeble minded, the mentally defective, the poverty stricken classes,” and insisted that “the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over fertility of the mentally and physically defective.” (Margaret Sanger, “ The Eugenic Value of Birth Control Propaganda ,” The Birth Control Review , October 1921, p. 5.)
This was cruel albeit typical of Sanger’s acid-tongued rants and musings, from her numerous articles in her Birth Control Review to her foundational book, The Pivot of Civilization , not to mention Lord knows what the woman said in her KKK speech.
All of which brings me back to Kate Smith.
We can certainly criticize Smith for racially insensitive songs from the era. That said, I don’t know of Kate Smith advocating anything as offensive or damaging as what Sanger and her Planned Parenthood abortion mills have done to black Americans.
I don’t know of Kate Smith ever addressing a Ku Klux Klan rally.
I don’t know of Kate Smith writing and lecturing on “race improvement” or ever being involved in a Negro Project to limit and manage the biological reproduction of black women, as Sanger did.
And yet, while Smith’s “God Bless America” (a song with no racial references, of course) has been blacklisted from New York Yankees (and Philadelphia Flyers) games, liberals name streets and squares and awards after their beloved Sanger. While the marvelous progressives of Philadelphia are covering Kate Smith’s statue, the bust of Sanger in the Smithsonian remains, despite vigorous protests by black pastors.
An enterprising conservative ought to do an internet search to find out just many places and things (start in New York and Philadelphia) are named for Margaret Sanger. In keeping with liberal notions of fairness and equality, it would seem that these places should immediately be pressured, petitioned, hounded to remove references to Sanger.
Fat chance. Liberals find astonishingly creative ways to bend over backwards to defend Sanger on race , in ways they’d never do for someone they don’t like, certainly not for a conservative, and obviously not for Kate Smith.
Margaret Sanger continues to provide a constant reminder that liberals really aren’t against racial insensitivities. A Sanger devotee like Hillary Clinton can even crack jokes that black men “all look alike ” and elicit howls of laughter from liberals. Liberals, it seems, aren’t entirely against racially offensive statements and actions. It simply depends on the offender."
The Russian Collusion Hypocrisy of Northeast Democrats,spectator.org,H. Sterling Burnett,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://spectator.org/the-russian-collusion-hypocrisy-of-northeast-democrats/,"by Betsy McCaughey
T he Mueller report is in, and one thing couldn’t be clearer: Mueller’s team, despite its best (or worst) efforts, found no evidence Donald Trump or anyone on his campaign team colluded with Russia to undermine the 2016 U.S. election.
Despite Mueller’s clear conclusion on this point, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) — who, not coincidentally, is running to be her party’s presidential nominee — and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) continue to lead an inane crusade to nail Trump for imagined crimes.
However, if Warren and Nadler are truly worried about efforts to further Russian interests at the expense of the United States, they should look closer to home for active co-conspirators. For example, Democratic politicians from their home states of Massachusetts and New York, although likely not colluding with Russia, are directly promoting policies that further Russian President Vladimir Putin’s interests — and all at the expense of the United States.
Massachusetts and New York have declared war on domestic production and transportation of fossil fuels. Many Democrats in those states have made it clear they would rather import fuel sources from Mother Russia than from the United States.
Lawmakers in Massachusetts and New York have blocked construction of critical pipelines to carry U.S. natural gas to and through their states. New York has even banned fracking to produce domestic natural gas.
These policies have prevented the creation of thousands of jobs related to construction and oil and gas production in their states, increased energy costs for their residents, reduced local and state revenues, and increased air pollution — benefiting, directly or indirectly, Russia’s government.
For several years, the Russian government has worked to disrupt U.S. energy markets through social media, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space, and Technology . In addition, Russian operatives encouraged, and possibly funded, environmental groups’ protests to block pipeline construction and prevent new oil and gas extraction projects, among other activities.
“The Kremlin manipulated various groups in an attempt to carry out its geopolitical agenda, particularly with respect to domestic energy policy,” the report stated.
Russia’s efforts paid off in Massachusetts and New York. Despite abundant domestic natural gas supplies, residents and businesses in the Northeast pay residential electricity prices that are 44 percent higher than the U.S. average. This is primarily due to political prohibitions on new natural gas pipelines. It doesn’t matter how affordable natural gas is if politicians block the cheapest, safest way to deliver it to market across the region.
As a result, from December 2017 to February 2018, utilities across the Northeast used more expensive fuel oil and even imported liquefied national gas (LNG) from Russia to generate electricity and heat homes.
In Massachusetts, where the state’s pipeline prohibitions have forced utilities to inform residents they would not allow new natural gas hook-ups, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) bragged she’d rather get natural gas from Russia than from the United States.
“LNG is a more efficient and economical way to meet energy needs during instances of high winter demand than building high-risk and costly pipelines that are not needed to maintain reliability,” said Chloe Gotsis, senior deputy press secretary for Healey, in a widely reported email . “Continuing to rely on pipelines is too risky for ratepayers and our climate.”
In April 2018, the Boston Globe debunked Healey’s tall tale. Russian LNG is neither cheaper, nor better for the environment. Anti-pipeline policies in Massachusetts and New York spiked energy costs across the region by $700 million in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
Additionally, pollution increased , as pipeline restrictions forced utilities to burn more than two million barrels of oil and rely on imported Russian LNG. Oil emits more pollution than natural gas when burned to heat homes and produce electricity. And turning gas into LNG and then back into its normal gaseous state and shipping it across the ocean from Russia emits a lot of additional pollutants that aren’t emitted when natural gas is transported through pipelines directly from U.S. gas fields in states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, or West Virginia.
It’s also important to note that the money Massachusetts and New York spent on Russian LNG went directly to support Putin’s regime, a fact the Boston Globe failed to highlight.
While northeastern Democrats have worked tirelessly to help the Putin regime, Trump has consistently promoted policies that put American workers and U.S. economic and national security interests first. To help drive American energy independence, Trump rolled back Obama-era regulations hampering coal, natural gas, and oil production on public lands, rewrote Obama regulations prematurely shuttering coal power plants and hampering coal mining, and withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.
Trump’s efforts have paid off. America is experiencing the highest economic growth rate in more than a decade, the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, and the United States is becoming the world’s leading oil producer. Soon, America will be a net energy exporter which, by making our allies in Europe and around the globe less dependent on energy from Russia, will improve U.S. national security, as well as national security for our allies.
Most recently, Trump, on April 10, signed two executive orders to expedite approval of multistate pipelines, liquefied natural gas export terminals, and cross-border infrastructure projects. One order Trump issued directs the federal government to make all permitting decisions on pipelines or other energy infrastructure projects that cross international borders within 60 days. It also gives the president the exclusive responsibility to “issue, deny, or amend” such permits.
“The president — not the bureaucracy — will have sole authority to make the final decision when we get caught up in problems,” Trump said at the signing event in Texas .
Trump’s second energy executive order directs the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review and modify what the order refers to as an “outdated” section of the Clean Water Act. The section in question requires applicants requesting federal permits for energy infrastructure projects that might affect federally protected waters to get certification from states in which any potential contamination could occur. Under the order, EPA is expected to limit the amount of time states have to consider pipeline and infrastructure permits, as well as the reasons states can give for blocking permits.
“Under this administration, we have ended the war on American energy like never before,” Trump said. “But too often, badly needed energy infrastructure is being held back by special interest groups, entrenched bureaucracies, and radical activists.
“This obstruction does not just hurt families and workers like you; it undermines our independence and national security,” Trump said, explaining the need for his executive orders.
Through these executive orders, the Trump administration is taking a direct shot at politicians in the northeastern United States who have blocked domestic oil and gas development and pipelines. Massachusetts’ attorney general and New York’s governor may not care if their anti-pipeline policies help Russia or about the economic and environmental toll paid by their constituents as a result of their decisions, but Trump certainly does.
Unfortunately, some politicians are undermining U.S. interests and furthering Russia’s economic and foreign policy goals, but one thing is apparent: Trump isn’t among them.
Energy exports are the lifeblood of Russia’s economy and its corrupt government. Perhaps, rather than bloviating about Trump’s imaginary ties to Russia, Warren and Nadler should investigate their respective states’ support of Russia’s energy industry.

‘Children Aren’t Sh*t’,spectator.org,Larry Alex Taunton,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/children-arent-sht/,"‘Children Aren’t Sh*t’ When the lines are blurred between animal and human life. by Steven Greenhut
L ast week, a woman in Coachella, California was caught on surveillance video tossing a sack full of puppies into a dumpster at a local NAPA Auto Parts store. The footage then shows a homeless man finding the puppies and retrieving them from the trash heap. The video went viral and a host of media outlets poured out abuse on the woman. TMZ called her “sick” and a “bitch.” The social media tribunal called her much worse.
Law enforcement, which often loves to capture headlines, went into overdrive and enlisted the public’s help in identifying the woman, and identify her they did. She was arrested at her home and video (why is there video?) shows her being led away in cuffs like Charles Manson. She currently faces seven felony charges .
The Daily Mail declared the homeless man a “hero” and a “Good Samaritan” for saving the puppies. People reported on the progress of the puppies and expressed sadness when one of them died. Last Sunday all NAPA Auto Parts stores throughout the Coachella Valley hosted fundraisers for a local shelter.
At this point, you’re thinking: How nice! They are going to provide shelter for the homeless man!
Nope.
According to local news , “All financial contributions will be donated to the ASK foundation, the non-profit partner of Riverside County Animal Services. The foundation will then distribute funds between the puppies, the 38 shelter dogs and other special-needs animals.”
And with that — the video, social media’s verdicts on the woman and the homeless man, the community search for her, the arrest and charges, and the fundraisers — society, self-satisfied, dusted off its collective hands and declared justice served.
Does any of this strike you as a bit over-the-top? It should. It is hard to imagine a greater misapplication of sympathy, energy, and resources.
Every day, all over America, children are discarded with government assistance and without felony charges of any kind. This is done casually, dumpster style. Well, that’s not exactly true. While it is true that few objections are raised and there are no NAPA fundraisers to save these children, there is, as with the puppies, a great expenditure of sympathy, energy, and resources.
At shoutyourabortion.com abortion is celebrated. Here, women tell “giddy” stories of how their abortions inspired them, gave them freedom, made them love themselves more. They proclaim abortion as a liberating and righteous act. If the URL doesn’t make that sufficiently clear, the t-shirts you find for sale in their shop dispel any remaining illusions you might have had. They have slogans like: “Abortion is Freedom” and “Shout Your Abortion” and “I Love People Who’ve Had an Abortion.”
Can you imagine a similar website called, say, killyourpuppies.com where puppy killers cheerily tell their stories about how they killed their puppies? “It was so liberating!” and “I am not ashamed!” they say to the approbation of all. How about a shop on that site selling t-shirts saying, “I Love People Who Kill Puppies”? Of course, you can’t imagine it because our society would never tolerate it. But children? You’ll get everything short of a ticker-tape parade from some quarters of our society.
In 2015, I debated prominent atheist Michael Shermer before a packed house in downtown Seattle. In one exchange, Shermer asked me my view of abortion and, as this article makes clear, I said that I was against it. But Shermer wasn’t going to let me get off with that. So, he did what most pro-choice types do in these discussions — he focused on the one percent of abortions:
Shermer: “[What about] instances of rape or something like that? Or even just a drunken night’s mistake? I mean, stuff happens. S**t happens , alright? Let’s just say it [he chuckles], and people make mistakes …”
At this point, I interrupted.
Me: “With all due respect, Michael, I don’t consider children s**t.”
To my surprise, this Seattle audience erupted with applause and Shermer never really recovered. This wasn’t a case of scoring cheap rhetorical points. Shermer had revealed, unwittingly, his casual disregard for human life. (You can watch the full exchange here .)
But he’s not alone.
I want to be clear that I love animals, dogs most of all. As I write, I sit on my deck and my German shepherd, Ranger, sits at my feet. He is a clever, noble creature. Together we look out on a field where my horses graze, and, when he is not looking, I feed a feral cat that wanders our ranch in search of rodents. One of the things I like about Ranger is that while he is certain that I and my fellow human beings sit atop the created order, he is equally certain that all other animals are beneath him. He treats my granddaughter with dignity, but looks down his angular nose at cats, horses, and goats most of all.
How is it that a dog has the good sense to make these distinctions when we, who are made in the image of God, often do not?

Mathgate: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Caught in Massive Grade Fraud Scandal,spectator.org,Deroy Murdock,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/mathgate-new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-caught-in-massive-grade-fraud-scandal/,"by Steven Greenhut
A s education-reform activists prepare to demonstrate at New York’s City Hall on Wednesday, a massive grade-fraud scandal has been exposed in America’s largest public-school system. SOS NYC, an organization that fights the under-education of Gotham’s children, released middle-school ratings using its nascent School Grade Fraud Index (SGFI). The Index divides the percentage of a school’s students who pass their math classes by the percentage of students who pass their New York State math tests. The higher the Index, the greater the fraud. If 100 percent of a middle school’s students pass their math classes and 100 percent of students also pass the state math test, the school would have an SGFI of 1.0. Conversely, if 100 percent of students passed their math classes, but only 1 percent of students passed the state exam, the school’s Index would be 100.
SOS NYC found one Bronx middle school, P.S/I.S. 224, in which 93.5 percent of students passed their math classes, but only 2 percent passed the state math exam. This yielded an SGFI of 46.75.
New York’s five worst schools, by this measure, include P.S./I.S. 224, three others in the Bronx, and one in Manhattan: The Bronx’s Academy for College Preparation had a math-class-pass rate of 90 percent, but only 4 percent passed the state math test, yielding an SGFI of 22.5. The Bronx’s East Fordham Academy for the Arts: Class rate – 80.3 percent, test rate – 4 percent, SGFI – 20.08. The Bronx’s Academy of Public Relations: Class rate – 97 percent, test rate – 5 percent, SGFI – 19.4. Eagle Academy for Young Men of Harlem: Class rate – 93.9 percent, test rate – 5 percent, SGFI – 18.78. Two dozen schools have SGFIs above 10.0. The best of these is Brooklyn’s P.S. 308: Class rate – 70.5 percent, test rate – 7 percent – SGFI 10.07.
Campuses with the highest SGFI scores are concentrated in The Bronx, Upper Manhattan, Central Brooklyn, and Southern Queens — all predominately black and Hispanic communities. SOS NYC’s 3-D heat map represents each middle school’s fraud index with a colored bar. The redder and taller the bar, the higher the index. Thus, a map of the Bronx is clogged with statistical red skyscrapers.
Thousands of NYC students are graduating high school without the academic skills to be “college ready.” A majority of Gotham’s eighth graders lack the foundational education to study a rigorous high-school curriculum. Bronx ninth graders try to learn math from Dan Fendel’s Interactive Mathematics Program Year 1 . It contains only one equation and zero “solve for X” problems. But this textbook is stuffed with social-justice propaganda. One homework assignment involves graphing Native American Indian acreage versus how much time it took to break treaties and force these indigenous people from their land. Another assignment explains how to divide supplies with a family of escaped slaves.
“How much longer are we going to permit the NYC Department of Education and NYC Mayor to pull the wool over our eyes when it comes to the education of our children?” demanded activist Katherine James, a three-term former school board member from southern Queens, where grade fraud is pervasive. Her recent e-mail to fellow education reformers included this battle cry: “Join with others to take the crucial action required to correct this plague rampant in our public schools. Do not permit our children and families to continue to be victims of fraudulent reports perpetrated by government leaders in NYC. Save Our Schools/Save Our Children! End the School-to-Riker’s-Island Pipeline Now!” (Riker’s Island is the Big Apple’s largest local prison.)
Little if any of this has registered with Mayor Bill de Blasio (D-New York). He has been busy lately, running for president. He had breakfast in April with a whopping seven Democrat leaders in Pahrump, Nevada. Earlier, he told voters in Las Vegas that he wants a “program of actual redistribution which includes much heavier taxes on the wealthy.”
Too bad de Blasio doesn’t move permanently into Sin City’s New York-New York Hotel & Casino. That might stymie his anti-meritocratic bid to scrap the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) for Bronx Science, Brooklyn Tech, Stuyvesant, and other high-performance Specialized High Schools. Ironically, de Blasio has proposed admission standards that rely heavily on middle-school grades. Since few children on campuses with rampant grade fraud enter these beacons of opportunity, one wonders if de Blasio is changing their admission criteria to cover up his failures nearly everywhere else.
De Blasio also is embroiled in scandal over his mismanagement of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). In January, U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson ordered a U.S. Court monitor to settle federal litigation over the quixotic presidential aspirant’s spectacularly deceitful abuse of NYCHA’s 392,259 public-housing residents.
This suit was triggered by de Blasio’s bogus “lead-paint inspections.” With de Blasio at the helm, HUD ordered NYC to test public-housing units for lead. NYC failed to conduct those tests, then lied to Washington about the tests it never performed. If de Blasio used the same fraud he is pulling in NYC’s schools, he could have abandoned traditional lead tests and, instead, allowed inspectors to give buildings passing grades, despite their failing marks.
De Blasio’s vicious fraud against the children of NYCHA will have lifelong consequences. As the de Blasio administration’s analysis eventually conceded, “1,160 children living in public housing have tested positive for lead poisoning since 2012,” the New York Post reported. “NYCHA has come under scrutiny since [2017], when it was revealed that the agency failed to conduct required lead inspections since 2013 (the year de Blasio was elected) and lied to the feds about it.” The Post added, “Since then, Mayor de Blasio’s Health Department has repeatedly revised its figures on lead-poisoning cases, previously citing just 820 positive tests and, before that, acknowledging a mere 19.” If this is how Gotham’s slumlord-in-chief treats overwhelmingly Democrat, low-income, blacks and Hispanics — his political base — what’s in store for his enemies?
Rather than improve the health and education of local children, de Blasio just launched a jihad against glass-and-steel skyscrapers, all to battle ever-elusive “global warming.” This boneheaded move would be like the mayor of Venice banning canals, filling them with cement, and converting them into bike lanes.
“The power of [mayoral control] is, everyone here, and all the parents of New York City, get to hold me accountable,” de Blasio told state lawmakers in Albany in February, while lobbying to extend his grip on local schools. For once, the “Dope from Park Slope” got it right. City parents need to hold him accountable for his epic fails on education. Alas, most parents are unaware of their children’s under-education until it’s too late, due to fraudulent report cards. De Blasio and Richard Carranza, his equity obsessed De-education Chancellor, must end this duplicity so city parents can keep their feet to the fire. Maybe then, New York City’s government-school students will have a fair shot at the American Dream.

"Sorry, Biden. America Doesn’t Want a #MeToo President",spectator.org,Betsy McCaughey,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/sorry-biden-america-doesnt-want-a-metoo-president/,"by Steven Greenhut
P residential contender Joe Biden is under attack from fellow Democrats for how he treated Anita Hill in 1991, after she accused Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment.
#MeToo advocates are warning that Biden had better apologize if he wants the women’s vote in next year’s election. Biden’s an expert panderer. He’s already expressing contrition for how he, as chairman, handled the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on Hill’s accusations. “ To this day, I regret I couldn’t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved .”
Sorry, Joe. That’s rewriting history. The hearing was fair.
Hill’s testimony was full of holes, and devoid of evidence to back up her claim that Thomas harassed her by talking about porn and other vulgar subjects at work. Thomas categorically denied it. When testifying, she embarrassed herself, flip-flopping on a key question between her morning and afternoon testimony. She had to back track on repeated statements that Thomas asked her to his apartment to watch porn, finally admitting it was an “ inference ” she drew.
At first she denied initiating calls to Thomas after leaving her job with him, but she had to recant and admit she made several . The hearing and an FBI inquiry failed to demonstrate Thomas did anything wrong.
Last week, Biden expressed mealy-mouthed regrets that he had allowed Senators to ask Hill “ inflammatory questions .” Justice required nothing less than tough, piercing questions. Hill’s accusation threatened to wreck Thomas’s life, but her claim didn’t hold up under scrutiny.
Now, twenty-eight years later, Biden is struggling to appear sympathetic to Hill. On The View , he asked “ how do you stop these character assassinations ?” He meant Hill’s character, but it’s Thomas whose name was dragged through the mud without evidence.
The public, watching on television in 1991, believed Thomas over Hill by a 2-1 margin, according to Gallup polling . Yet following Thomas’s confirmation, Democrats turned Hill into a feminist icon and made believing her a litmus test.
Last year, Dems doubled down, insisting they believed Christine Blasey Ford , who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of groping her when both were teenagers. Never mind that Ford couldn’t even say where or when, or provide corroborating evidence.
Senate Democrats, including presidential wannabes Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, declared they believed her even before hearing her testimony .
Hill herself piled on Kavanaugh, demanding that the “ burden of persuasion ” should borne by him, not his accuser.
Now Hill wants an unambiguous apology from Biden for what happened in 1991. Caving to Hill will get Biden points with the far left, but not with most people, not even with most women. They have fathers, sons, brothers and husbands they don’t want skewered by the #MeToo movement. One accusation of sexual harassment can cost a man his education, job, or entire future, even if the accuser has no proof.
Unfortunately, top Democrats could care less. One of the biggest differences between Republican and Democratic pols right now is their attitudes about #MeToo. Republicans value time-honored principles like due process and the presumption of innocence. Democrats have no patience for it.
Voters need to keep that in mind in 2020. America doesn’t need a #MeToo president. We already had one — Barack Obama. Thanks to his policies, college men accused of sexual harassment are often stripped of their rights by campus courts rigged to benefit women accusers. Fortunately, President Trump’s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is reversing the Obama policies and restoring due process protections such as the right to cross-examine one’s accuser. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are resisting these reforms .
Trump says “ it’s a very scary time for young men in America .” He added, “ You could be somebody that was perfect your entire life, and somebody could accuse you of something .”
If it happens to you, know that most of the Democrats running for president, including Joe Biden, won’t have your back. Sexual harassment is a grave matter, and accusations need to be taken seriously. But both the accused and the accuser deserve fairness. Sadly, that’s not on the Democratic Party agenda."
CAP’s Capitalist Revolt Spreads,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/caps-capitalist-revolt-spreads/,"CAP’s Capitalist Revolt Spreads Another revolution begins at Philadelphia’s Carpenters’ Hall. Carpenters’ Hall in Philadelphia (Pbjamesphoto/Creative Commons) Top Stories by Steven Greenhut
T he Citizens Alliance of Pennsylvania (CAP), the leader in a capitalist revolt in Pennsylvania, is now spreading its message beyond the state’s borders. And it has gained a receptive audience. That audience gathered a few days ago for a conference held in a place that could not be more symbolic of CAP’s efforts — Carpenters’ Hall in Philadelphia.
Recall the historic significance of Carpenters’ Hall.
The year: 1774.
The event: What would become known to history as the First Continental Congress.
The delegates: Representatives from 12 of the 13 British colonies — all except Georgia. Among them were names that would become famous in the unfolding events: John Adams, his fire-breathing cousin Sam Adams, John Jay, Patrick Henry and George Washington.
The First Continental Congress had been convened to protest the Intolerable Acts that had been passed by the British Parliament as punishment for Massachusetts and its defiance of the tea tax. A defiance that included the Boston Tea Party, with rebellious colonists dressed as Indians and boarding British ships to toss their cargo of tea into Boston Harbor.
The main accomplishment of the First Congress was an agreement by the colonies to band together to boycott all British goods — and to set a date for a Second Continental Congress the following year. There was also a “Petition to the King” to repeal the Intolerable Acts — a petition the King ignored. The rest, as they say, became serious history. With the First Continental Congress marked as the beginning of what would eventually become the United States of America — the Declaration of Independence was declared two years later just up the street from Carpenters’ Hall in the Pennsylvania State House — Independence Hall.
This time the gathering at Carpenters’ Hall was what can only be called a spreading capitalist revolt — and as in 1774, 12 of the original 13 colonies were represented, plus others from what were called the “swing states” of modern America — Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin. Texas showed up too. Curiously, both in 1774 and 2019 the missing state was the same state — Georgia. This time the attendees included a Delaware state senator, a former Ohio Congressman, think tank veterans, political consultants, grassroots activists, business leaders, and a leader in mobilizing youth activists.
In this space in 2012 I wrote up what was called at the time Pennsylvania’s Capitalist Revolt in which I noted a growing spirit of rebellion by Pennsylvania capitalists at what they called the “bi-partisan collusion of career politicians, labor unions and trial lawyers that has mired the Commonwealth in corruption and economic stagnation.” Also noted was just who was the force behind this movement:
Specifically, they are banding together under the banner of a group they are calling the Citizens Alliance for Pennsylvania — CAP. (CAP’s website can be found here .) And CAP is now roaming the state with all the subtlety of Allied forces storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.
As the new gathering the other day demonstrated vividly, CAP has not only been a serious success, the movement is now spreading across the country. Under the leadership of John Kennedy, a serious capitalist himself who built his Kennedy Railroad Builders from scratch, then served eight rebellious years as a Republican in the Pennsylvania state legislature — CAP has focused like a laser on what the Harrisburg Patriot-News , the state capital’s newspaper, describes as replacing “those (Republican state legislators) who stray from their definition of party principles.”
There is a pattern with what CAP describes as “The Iron Triangle of career politicians, bureaucrats and lobbyists for Big Government special interests.” Republicans campaign for the state legislature as conservatives who believe in limited government and low taxes. Once elected, however, those principles mysteriously evaporate as they themselves quietly become part of that Iron Triangle. Unlike Kennedy, who left the legislature voluntarily after serving four terms and refused to take his generous state pension, too many Republicans become what they said they opposed. They abandon the concept of the citizen legislator to become career politicians. And all too frequently if and when they leave, the legislators become, but of course, lobbyists.
This is exactly why Washington has acquired its well-deserved reputation as “The Swamp.” But the same problem is at play in state legislatures, and CAP exists to defeat the creatures of the Harrisburg Swamp and elect more employers — capitalists. Kennedy says that the state legislature while he was there “hardly had any employers” — and now Pennsylvania leads in “all the wrong things — taxes, unfunded liabilities,” and more. The only way to correct the problem, he says, is to have men and women who have their hearts in changing the system by taking the time out from their private sector careers to serve for a limited time and take on the Iron Triangle. Says Kennedy:
It is CAP’s job to “train them, fund them, to get them elected, to serve, serve without pension, serve limited terms, improve the business climate, clean up the legislative process and then go back home. We’re the centerfold for that.”
Indeed they are.
The interesting fact here is that CAP, after ten years, has had such success in Pennsylvania that it has now reached out to like-minded Americans in other states to, as it were, nationalize this movement. As was observed at the CAP conference, it is state legislatures that frequently serve as the stepping-stone to seats in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate — where, of course, the Iron Triangle problem is at work on a massive scale.
To make this work, as was noted at the conference, there has to be a mix of the intellectual policy base with the aforementioned political and legal allies.
This being 21st century America, a considerable part of the gathering was devoted to the realities of political organizing courtesy of the IRS. It is simply not possible to discuss the ideas underpinning this kind of modern day rebellion without plunging into the morass of IRS regulations — 501(c)(4)’s and 501(c)(3)’s — not to mention any and all other legalities that must be carefully adhered to. From the legal basics to IRS compliance issues CAP had organized a serious seminar on the do’s and don’ts of modern political organizing. The basics of fundraising were covered — with a special concentration on getting other capitalists to step up and lend a hand to organizations that are out there to carry the capitalism and entrepreneurial flag into state legislatures. Not to be forgotten were political tactics — dealing with state or local political party leadership that has become part of the Establishment.
In CAP’s case, Kennedy’s allies in this effort include a roster of fellow Pennsylvanians all with considerable across-the-board experience themselves. They include, alphabetically: Matt Brouillette, the former President of the Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives and the Founder, President and CEO of Commonwealth Partners Chamber of Entrepreneurs, Inc. Commonwealth Partners describes itself as a “membership organization for state and local business and community leaders, philanthropists and successful entrepreneurs” whose focus is on economic and educational policy. Lowman Henry, the Chairman and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Public Opinion Research, Inc., a “non-profit public affairs foundation based in Harrisburg.” He also serves as the host of the American Radio Journal that appears on over 200 radio stations across the country, and another show focused on Pennsylvania that airs on 90 Pennsylvania radio stations. On top of this Henry is the president of the annual Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, the state version of CPAC, which brings together Pennsylvania conservatives for several days of conferences, workshops and speeches. Leo Knepper is the former state director for Heritage Action for America, the “political affiliate of The Heritage Foundation.” He serves as CAP’s the chief executive officer and has spent his career building grassroots networks in the state, including a notoriously infamous legislative pay grab known as the “midnight pay raise.” Charles Mitchell, is Brouillette’s successor as CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation. A graduate of Bucknell University he a graduate of the Koch Associate Program and the Claremont Institute’s Publius Fellowship. Josh Nulph who learned of the hands-on the impact of government regulation while working in his family’s small business. Meeting the minimum age qualification to serve in the State House, Nulph jumped into a race to take on a 28-year veteran Democrat who was also the House Minority Leader for the Democrats. He scored 45% of the vote in a hot battle in a Democratic district, forcing Democrats to shift resources to protect their leader. Nulph is now CAP’s Public Outreach Director. Ryan Shafik is the founder and principal in his own political consulting firm, Rockwood Strategies and serves as CAP’s political director. He has much hands-on experience working on winning Pennsylvania campaigns from races for Judge, County Commissioner, the State House and Senate and Congress.
The importance of having team members or allies like these is crucial. Every base is covered — from the intellectual and policy base to polling to communication to finances to dealing with the inevitable sea of legal issues that surround modern election law.
All of which was presented and discussed with the out-of-state visitors all interested in executing some version of CAP in their own states — if they weren’t already active on that front, as most of them were. The idea of it all was — ideas. Ideas that lead to action. Not unlike the original 1774 meeting in Carpenters’ Hall
There is plenty of reason for all of this. On top of the Iron Triangle fights that are standard features in state capitals, as if that weren’t enough the rise of socialism that has gripped the American Left and the Democratic Party has in fact reared its head in Pennsylvania.
The 2018 elections produced two Pittsburgh area state legislators who are, exactly like New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, members of the Democratic Socialists of America — the DSA. And tellingly, like fellow DSA member AOC, they won their seats by defeating incumbent non-socialist Democrats in the primary. Notably the co-chair of the Pittsburgh DSA chapter said this after the results were in: “We’re turning the state the right shade of red tonight.” Meaning, the “right shade of red” as that which once was the symbol of Communism. You can’t make it up.
Perhaps one of the ironies of the rise of socialism is that, as was crystal clear from this 2019 meeting in Carpenters’ Hall, more and more Americans are standing up for capitalism — and eager to take on not just socialism but those Republicans and Democrats in their state legislatures who are seen as part of the Iron Triangle problem, using the legislature as an opportunity to spend an entire career on the state payroll — and when leaving taking a considerable taxpayer-funded retirement.
In 1774, Patrick Henry took the floor in Carpenters’ Hall to say this:
“The distinction between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.”
It is safe to say that was very much the same sentiment in this CAP meeting that was taking place a full 245 years after that first gathering of delegates in Carpenters’ Hall. There are growing numbers of Americans — as was evident in the victory of Donald Trump in 2016 — who have had it with the status quo of the nation’s political class. They are prepared to step up and fight back — and most importantly, they are determined to win."
"Once Again, Steve Moore’s Law",spectator.org,"R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/once-again-steve-moores-law/,"by Jeffrey Lord
Washington
Steve Moore, one of the oracles of free market economics, is President Donald Trump’s choice for the Federal Reserve Board, and the long knives are out for him. Yet I am told by conservatives everywhere not to worry. He is a shoo-in.
It all reminds me of July 1, 1987 when President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Robert Bork for an opening on the Supreme Court. He had it made in the shade, said my complacent conservative friends. The result was brutal. But we do not have to look back 32 years to see how unruly the leftwing mob can be. Recall the recent fate of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Only his courage and unscotchable determinate saved him. The simple fact is that the conservatives are often slow on the draw against the American left. Only the Wall Street Journal and the intrepid New York Sun have come out swinging for Moore. It is time for the conservatives to rally around him. He can probably win with the President on his side. He apparently has the votes. Yet the coming battle would be a lot less bloody if the conservative movement were to take the field on Moore’s behalf — and make it clear that from now on they are going to wage war for the President’s nominees.
Defending Moore on economic grounds ought not to be that difficult. The Trump Administration is presiding over an economic boom that Moore has been calling for for years. With the President’s tax cuts and deregulation — two of Moore’s favorite panaceas for an anemic economy — we have historically low unemployment, certainly for blacks and for Latinos. Growth is now robust. It has actually outpaced predictions. Most economists predicted 2.5% growth for the first quarter. Friday we learned that the economy grew at 3.2%.
That is the first time since 2015 that the first quarter GDP topped 3%. Most economists were wrong. Moore and those like him were right on track. As Jeremy J. Siegel said in Monday’s Wall Street Journal , “… somehow, though unemployment is at a 50-year low, inflation is still below the Fed’s 2% target.” He is the rare economist for Moore.
Ahh, but his critics say Moore is no economist. He lacks a Ph.D. He is a writer, at times a clever writer, at other times a strenuously serious writer, on economics and politics. Well, I have a long memory. He writes with authority on economics and politics much as Henry Hazlitt wrote on economics and politics for some 60 years, from the early 1920s until the late 1980s. Hazlitt had no Ph.D. either. In fact he had no college degree at all. Hazlitt would have been an excellent choice throughout his long life to stir up the Fed. Now we have a President in place to stir up the Fed. So let us get on with it.
Yet the New York Times , the Washington Post , and CNN are opposed to Moore. Of course they are also opposed to Trump. When Trump came into office they predicted a world-wide recession of great severity.
Allow me to quote one of mainstream media’s economic gurus. A certified economist, a winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, Paul Krugman, Ph.D. On November 9, 2016 he greeted Trump’s election with this dirge: “Under any circumstances, putting an irresponsible, ignorant man who takes his advice from all the wrong people [Moore!] in charge of the nation with the world’s most important economy would be very bad news.” And he persisted, “What makes it especially bad right now, however, it the fundamentally fragile state much of the world is still in.” Finally he concluded, “So we are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight.” Clearly having made hysterical pronunciations such as the above Guru Krugman could not see Friday’s growth rate of 3.2%.
So now the long knives cannot share Professor Doktor Krugman’s contempt for the Trump economy. How are they going to defame Steve Moore? They are going to get personal. They are going to Brett Kavanaugh him. As I have said, he is a “clever” writer and has been writing for more than 35 years. Because he is a lively fellow, he has naturally indulged in a little jocosity from time to time. Some fifteen years ago women athletes were a target for his wit and also women bartenders. Now because of the crime of joking about woman leaping in the air and standing behind a bar he is to be denied a role at the Fed, the assassins boast.
Well, I say to fellow conservatives, leap to Moore’s defense. And remember the example of Congressgirl Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She too was a bartender before the mainstream media made her the Lioness of the House of Representatives. Senator Jodi Ernst and Senator Lindsey Graham, do the decent thing and stand by our man!"
"Biden, Bernie: It’s Not Their Age — It’s the Age of Their Ideas",spectator.org,William Murchison,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/biden-bernie-its-not-their-age-its-the-age-of-their-ideas/,"by John Glynn
H ey, lay off that geezer stuff when political talk turns to the fitness of Bernie Sanders ( aetas 77) and Joe Biden ( aetas 76) to fill the considerable office of president. I find such talk both unnecessary and disagreeable.
The generic reason for this is that senior-citizen status was long seen as a political qualification rather than a disability. For instance, the Latin root of the word “Senate” is senex, for old; meaning venerable, wise, experienced, all that stuff.
Then there’s this. Save for the accidents of geography, I could have gone to high school with Bernie and Biden. Our birth dates differ by mere months. By some strange historical design, we might have graduated in the same class. I do not know that we would have ever double-, or triple-, dated: say, at a showing of The Big Country , with Gregory Peck. Bernie might have come unglued at the contemptuous treatment visited by Charles Bickford’s upper-crust cattle baron upon his ruffian of a rival, Burl Ives. Bernie might have stalked from the theater and organized a picket line. Biden would have been oblivious as he chatted up, or embraced, whole rows of popcorn-crunching viewers. Yet surely there is something to be said for those who saw Dick Clark in his sleek and smiling prime, and know how to drive a stick-shift Chevy; who perhaps acknowledge growing misty upon hearing the opening bars of “Earth Angel.” I tell you, we have been around the block a few times and sipped a few soda fountain Cokes. We have some idea of what’s what.
The problem with the notion of my contemporaries, Bernie and Joe, either one of them, as president of the United States isn’t really their physical age. It’s the age of their political ideas. They appear not to have learned a whole lot during the tumultuous years since, oh, 1965, 1966, along in there. Bernie, the glib socialist, I would assume to have learned less than Joe, whose political creed could be classified as standard 1970s common-guy liberal.
There are worse things, I can tell you. Such as socialism. Among the worthless, moss-encrusted notions that deface political understanding, socialism stands in the front rank: proof that no bad idea really ever dies. To indulge in a 1950s reference, socialism is the Christopher Lee — the Count Dracula, that is, Hammer Films-style — of political creeds. It keeps coming back, with fangs bared — most recently under Bernie’s patronage.
It’s not entirely clear what variety of socialism Bernie embraces: not public ownership of the means of production. He may have no trouble with public ownership as a concept, but he knows the voters aren’t buying. What he loves, by whatever name, is government direction and supervision: possibly a handier way of doing socialism than outright ownership. You don’t pay for what you don’t own. You tax others and let them pay. We call these unfortunates “the elite” — “the one percent.” Their vulnerability consists in having, like Charles Bickford, in The Big Country , made Burl Ives resentful of another’s power and glory.
We understand Bernie better — along with my other “classmate,” Joe, not to mention Elizabeth Warren, AOC, and such like — by reflecting, not unkindly, on how really ancient socialism is as an idea; as an obsession; as a heresy, if truth be told. Way back when Bernie and I — I’m guessing — were negotiating House of Wax , in 3D, and popping Grapettes, the socialists already had a long and ancient rap sheet.
“You’ve got it; I want it.” Such is the eternal, and enduringly fatal, idea behind doctrines of redistribution and punishment for the secular sin of doing well. At the root of the matter: Envy, fourth of the Seven Deadly Sins. “You’ve got it; I’m taking it.”
Bernie, ah, Bernie! — how I wish you and I and Joe could have sat down, c. 1959, and parsed the world’s problems, possibly to mutual advantage. Maybe life was dicier and more complicated back in the ’50s than it seemed. Durned if it’s not now.

Medicare for All,spectator.org,Dov Fischer,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/medicare-for-all/,"by Veronique de Rugy M edical coverage for all — guaranteed. Income for all — guaranteed. Six months’ paid vacation for all — guaranteed. Ph.D. degrees conferred on all — guaranteed. Lifelong annuities of one million dollars per year for all — guaranteed. Couture clothes for all — guaranteed. Kids who behave for all — guaranteed. Everything for all — guaranteed. And — at that rate — America bankrupt in less than six months — also guaranteed. Likewise, with an America brought to her knees: (i) Chinese ascendancy — guaranteed; (ii) Rise of Arab terror caliphates — guaranteed; (iii) Putin impacting elections — guaranteed; and (iv) The end of American freedom as we have known it for more than two centuries — guaranteed. Reality imposes limits. Ever since we were kids, we all hated limits. Parents imposed limits. We could not have more than twelve milkshakes daily or more than eight twelve-ounce glasses of whipped cream with dinner. Never could understand why. The chocolate milk had to have some milk in it, too. Cholesterol? What’s that? Sugar? Diabetes? But, Mom — it tastes good! Teachers imposed limits. When class was boring, we could not “go to the bathroom” every ten minutes. We had to raise our hands first. Limits, limits. A world of limits dictated by a world of reality where there are no big rock candy mountains . There is no question that our medical system needs improvement. If a person employed at Job 1 enjoys health coverage but contracts a severe chronic illness during the years working there, it is wrong and economically inefficient for a great capitalist enterprise like the United States that she thereupon must resist changing employment to a accept a better job elsewhere because the great health coverage at Job 2 will not cover her pre-existing condition. That is wrong and just-plain inefficient, causing skilled workers to contribute less productivity and to earn less than they can contribute and earn, and then they truly are motivated to contribute and earn. Within our medical-coverage system, we can create economically sensible efficiencies for covering the health care needs of the comparative few who always responsibly have maintained health insurance but who subsequently, through no fault of their own, find themselves stricken with a severe disease: ALS, cancer, organ failure. The economic structure can be adjusted to externalize costs incurred by those relative few, spreading the coverage and risk among the greater population. Such a safety-net concept always has been at the heart of American kindness and decency, whether offered as crisis aid to states impacted by unexpected hurricane flooding, earthquake disaster, wildfire devastation. We cover such unexpected “Acts of God” when they strike people overseas. And we can and should find a formula for providing safety-net coverage for those stricken unexpectedly with perilous illnesses at home. But the notion of providing free guaranteed wall-to-wall health coverage for everyone, though it sounds enticing, is a prescription for disaster. First, under existing law, hospitals in the United States may not turn away seriously ill patients in peril. When a penurious patient is stabilized, private hospitals then may transfer the destitute uninsured patient to a public hospital. The American system as it now exists under capitalism does not allow people to drop dead in the streets. No private hospital will dare knowingly discharge an indigent patient who cannot be stabilized and safely transferred to a public facility; the liability and punitive damages it would incur for doing so deter them all. On the other hand, if the Government institutes a system of free health care for all, there will be a huge increase in demand for health care because it then is free. That is human nature. Especially among elderly retired people with time on their hands, among hypochondriacs, and among others with empty days, such free care will populate doctors’ offices regularly with people who will burden medical workloads. The doctors will bill the Government, and the Government will reimburse. Middle-class taxpayers will foot the ever-spiraling costs with ever-spiraling taxes. “The Rich” always will enjoy access to skilled and clever tax attorneys and financial advisers who will assure that they escape the crux of the burden. As doctors’ calendars fill with appointments, it will become harder for truly ill patients to get an appointment to see that same doctor promptly when more urgently needed. Longer scheduling times will result in more illnesses among the public as minor ailments become more serious. In time, people will be compelled to give up long-standing personal health relationships they have enjoyed with their doctors and to seek appointments with less qualified doctors who, because of their generally weaker skills or more hostile “bedside manners,” are less in demand, less desired, and therefore can offer more calendar openings. In time, even their calendars will fill without their having to improve their skills or manner. Because of the increase in medical appointments, and because the Government will be paying doctors at a rate lower than that of private insurance, doctors will have to see more patients each day to aggregate the same income, resulting in their providing less face time with each patient. The more timid patient who needs some extra time to explain a malady, a family history, or medications now being taken will not have the time to do so if perceiving that the doctor is in a rush. The doctor will be less curious to pause and inquire because she or he will have to move on. The quality of personal care will be compromised severely. It will take longer to schedule a surgery date when needed. It will be harder to line up the surgeon desired. The quality of follow-up care will be compromised. More medical procedures and diagnoses will be delegated to less skilled physicians’ assistants and nurses’ aides. Because the Government will be paying, more necessary procedures will be denied arbitrarily by bureaucrats as medically “not needed,” more necessary pharmaceuticals will be denied as unnecessary or as not compatible with an idiosyncratic government list of approved uses. This is how the world actually works, even in current Medicare for the elderly. As the Government’s costs continue to skyrocket, new cost-cutting measures will be needed. More procedures will be denied, more medicine prescriptions denied, and older people will be deemed financially untenable to maintain alive with as much effort. Practical cost-cutting requirements will result in allowing octogenarians to die sooner, with less effort, denying many of them ten or more additional years of quality life. One day, you will be as old as they. If the goal of Medicare for All is to provide the “Non-Rich” with the same coverage provided to “The Rich,” that goal will fail as it always does. “The Rich” will not be disadvantaged for long. A private medical economy will develop, whether as an illegal underground “black market” or in transparent broad daylight. Concierge doctors will provide the best of private care for “The Rich” who will pay out of pocket for government-denied medicines, just as the cosmetic-surgery industry now works for those who can afford optional tummy tucks, cosmetic laser, and liposuctions. As but one example, certain lung ailments used to be treated with medicines likecyclosporine, tacrolimus, and cyclophosphamide. Those medicines cause severe side effects but then were the best known treatments. In time, the pulmonary medical community learned from medical science that an immunosuppressant that helps deter body rejection of organ transplants also sometimes offers an effective treatment for the lung ailments — only with substantially fewer adverse side effects than caused by the prior meds. Nevertheless, pulmonologists are furious that Medicare will not cover that drug, Mycophenolate Mofetil, when prescribed for treating interstitial lung disease because a government bureaucrat has determined that the drug is approved exclusively for organ-transplant patients. The Medicare list of approved uses of that drug has not been updated for a decade. Those in the medical community can offer dozens of similar examples where government-run medicine sabotages best treatment practices. Despite best intentions, Government never works as well as private enterprise. That is why people turns to UPS, FedEx, and local mailbox stores at a mark-up even though the Government runs post offices. That is why people register their automobile documents at the Auto Club whenever possible even though the DMV exists for that purpose. I personally lived under state-run medical socialism for two years in the mid-1980s. We were the laboratory for today’s vision of “Medicare for All.” We could choose from among a small number of political-party-affiliated health plans. But, really, it all was the same. Two images stand out these three decades later:
Whenever any of our family had to go to the doctor for any reason, we always saw this same elderly couple among patients in the waiting room. I once asked the doctor about them. He explained: “Oh, they are perfectly healthy. They just like to come by every day. Since it costs them nothing, and the Government pays for their doctor’s visit, why not?”
The Government was paying, and my income-tax rate was 70 percent for an income of $30,000 a year.
My other memory — far more serious . There was an outbreak in our community of Hepatitis A. The indicated vaccine to protect against Hepatitis A was gamma globulin . Everyone sought the vaccine. The doctors explained, however, that the Government saved money under socialized universal health care by restricting who may receive a gamma globulin vaccine. Under the guidelines of socialized medicine, the gamma globulin vaccine could not be administered until the percentage of local residents who contracted Hepatitis A reached a certain percentage of the population. Only then would the Government guidelines regard the situation as “epidemic,” thus eligible for community vaccination. As soon as the required number of outbreaks was reached, only then could he administer the vaccines under the rules of universal health care. However, he assured us — small comfort — that we soon would hit the outbreak threshold, raising us to “Epidemic” status, and then everyone could be vaccinated.
We endured the grim daily ghoulish ritual, waiting each morning to learn who next had been infected. Only 18 more to go. Only 13 more. Only 9. Only 7.
My friend and neighbor, Dan, flew his entire family to the United States of America to visit with his wealthy parents — and to get everyone a gamma globulin injection that his parents would pay for. Others who could afford to do so hired private doctors, paying in black-market American dollars for the vaccine. And those who, like most of us, could not afford private care in an economy where the cost of government health care led to such high taxes that we had no spare cash, just waited. Only 4 more to go.
Someone very dear to me was one of the last three to get infected before the magic “epidemic” number was hit. That person got hit with it hard. It was not life-imperiling, but it was debilitating for several months. That person had been earning a very good salary, was a star employee at work. For the next several months that person no longer could work. Under the impact of Hepatitis A, that person could not make the long daily commute to work, nor work the long hours. After consuming vacation days and sick days, that star performer was terminated. That person’s income ended. The entire family was financially devastated and needed to go on the public till. One Government program feeding into to the next, all taxpayer funded.
That, too, is the reality of Medicare for All. Compassion leading to epidemic and depriving dignity. Socialism always results the same."
Muslim Power?,spectator.org,Oren Litwin,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/muslim-power/,"by John Glynn
A s we at the Middle East Forum monitor the activity of Islamist political groups, we have started to notice a new and puzzling trope in their public statements. At first in a few places, but now repeatedly, Islamist groups have been triumphantly discussing the growth of “Muslim power” in America.
To cite a few examples: MPower Change attended the recent ICNA/MAS convention and trained over a hundred attendees in political-mobilization techniques; they later crowed that “we can’t wait to work with them to build power!” Jetpac’s current fundraising efforts have the tagline, “Our path to power.” And CAIR-Washington State is holding a fundraiser on May 25 featuring Rep. Ilhan Omar, titled “Unapologetically US: Building Muslim Power for 2020 & Beyond.”
To be fair, “building power” is what most political groups seek to do, when you get down to it. But in the United States, we tend to cloak the will to power in a blizzard of euphemisms, many of them beloved by the Progressive groups that Omar et al. associate with. We make our voices heard, or advance our agenda, or defend our priorities, or build alliances, or support our friends in Congress. But “power”? In American politics, the term is considered gauche. Our opponents are powerful; we represent the people. Our opponents are powerful; we protect American industry. And so on.
Surely the Islamists know this. They have become politically sophisticated enough to win elections at the local and national levels, using careful messaging and PR. So why this sudden, public — one might even think, coordinated — obsession with Muslim power?
The question is perplexing, and there is no definite answer. But there are a few possibilities.
One is that the term “power” is meant to tap into the internal narratives of the Islamist community, to inspire a surge of new energy and activism that would be well worth the minor PR risk with regard to outside audiences (such as ourselves). Islamists are not shy about fantasizing about a gradual takeover of the United States through democratic means; perhaps this is a dog-whistle aimed at such fantasies, never mind that they are very far from being carried out.
Or are they? Since the 2018 election, Islamist activity has become increasingly reckless. Ilhan Omar in particular seems intent on provoking a political conflict over American support for Israel, even though she is being opposed by the entire Democratic leadership. What makes this confrontation surprising is that if they had simply waited another two or four years, the Islamists and anti-Israel Progressives would probably have been in a much stronger position within the Democratic Party than they are now. By launching this fight early, progressives risk incurring an avoidable defeat from liberal Democrats, who are belatedly realizing the terrible danger they are in.
Our read on the situation is that giddy with their growing successes, some Islamists are prematurely dropping the mask. In some circles, Islamists actually imagine that the time of Muslim ascendancy in the U.S. is at hand — never mind that Muslims make up only 1% of Congress and some 2% of the populace.
This might explain some of the baffling rhetoric of “Muslim power”: in a few cases, the speakers might actually believe that the term is a mere expression of fact, and that there is no risk in using it in public. On the contrary; Islamists might believe that weak, impressionable American voters might “follow the strong horse” and support the rise of Islamism even earlier than they would have, if they are convinced that it is already happening.
If so, this is a bad misreading of American mores.

"When the Left Talks About Packing the Courts, It Wants Political Judges Like in Kansas",spectator.org,Doug Bandow,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/when-the-left-talks-about-packing-the-courts-it-wants-political-judges-like-in-kansas/,"When the Left Talks About Packing the Courts, It Wants Political Judges Like in Kansas A scandalous abortion ruling by the Kansas Supreme Court. by Jeffrey Lord
K ansas adopted its constitution in 1859. Abortion was largely illegal then, as it was in most of the country.
Who counted as a person mattered then. The state was born in violence, as pro-slavery forces unsuccessfully attempted to impose their constitution on the territory’s free settler majority.
This blatant disregard for democratic consent, opposed by Illinois Sen. Stephen A. Douglas, effectively sundered the Democratic Party, guaranteeing Abraham Lincoln’s victory in the 1860 presidential election. Kansas became a battleground: in August 1863, William Quantrill led mix of guerrillas and ruffians to the town of Lawrence, where they committed one of the Civil War’s worst atrocities.
Those opposed to democracy, law, and life have reappeared in Kansas. But they are not insurgents. Instead, they are serving on the state supreme court. Last week in Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt, six members of the Kansas Supreme Court discovered what had been missed for 160 years: the good citizens approved a constitution which legalized a practice that they simultaneously banned. Such is the amazing versatility of liberal jurisprudence, freeing citizens from the straightjacket of a constitution interpreted to actually mean something, something that reflects the will of those who drafted and approved it and does not change to match the latest legal fashions current in the halls of academia.
Of course, Roe v. Wade had already done this to the federal Constitution, conjuring out of permutations and emanations a “right” unknown when the document was promulgated and amended, most importantly, with the 14 th Amendment. However, as two Trump nominees have joined the high court panic has set in in some progressive precincts. The widely shared nightmare is that a Supreme Court majority might rediscover serious jurisprudence and overturn Roe .
In fact, a Roberts-led majority seems more likely to further erode than completely eliminate the landmark ruling. In any case, not a lot would change in practice, since full reversal would merely free states to make their own laws. And many would do nothing, leaving abortion legal. Most people would live at most a state away from access to abortion. Everyone would be within a couple hour plane ride of an abortion clinic, with activists busily fund-raising to ensure that no unwanted baby survived.
However, progressives used to relying on federal judges are now shifting to the state level. In states dominated by the Left, such as New York, legislators approved expansive abortion legislation. In states less inclined to ignore the lives at stake, liberal activists are enlisting state judges as their champions. As in Kansas.
In Hodes & Nauser, the majority opinion relied on the state constitution’s bill of rights: “All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” From this language of the Declaration of Independence the justices extracted “the right of personal autonomy,” which included “a woman’s right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy.”
Hence, goodbye baby.
Certainly, early Americas believed in personal autonomy. Indeed, they imagined a government far less intrusive than what exists today and would be shocked that jurists routinely baptize all sorts of government abuses, especially at the federal level, as constitutional.
Yet they also recognized that abortion was different, which is why it was often prohibited across the country. The simple fact is that the development of a baby inconveniently means there is something more than a woman’s body involved. Which in turn means the status of abortion requires balancing competing interests. And the memorable phrase which makes up the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights speaks of life before it mentions liberty. Without life, liberty is meaningless.
Nevertheless, the Kansas justices cheerfully decided that those who approved the clause meant to protect broader rights than at the national level, empowered judges to decide what those rights were, and decided that there was no reason not to create new rights. Making the list was personal autonomy, which meant decisions about one’s body. Thus, obviously abortion was now sacrosanct. The state constitution, intoned the jurists after slipping into their role as de facto legislators, “protects the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy.” Which is unlimited, unless the government can assert a “compelling government interest” — which seems unlikely, since the court considers the life of the baby to matter not at all.
The opinion is a hoot to read. The majority dismisses the fact that at the time Kansans approved the constitution they prohibited abortion. Why, said the jurists, there’s no evidence the law reflected the people’s will. But what evidence is there that the state bill of rights did so? Or that any action by any Jayhawk legislature or governor since then did so? And does the court believe that imputing a right to abortion reflected the people’s will?
Second, complain the jurists, the law’s constitutionality was never tested. Which probably means everyone assumed it was constitutional. After all, a century ago progressive jurisprudence — judges getting to make up the law as they went along — had yet to become the rage in American courtrooms. Finally, noted the majority, those passing the laws didn’t recognize women as being fully equal to men. But women suffered legal and political disabilities for decades after Kansas banned abortion. Women could not vote until 1920, so the Constitution, and the 14 th Amendment, upon which so much liberal interpretation rests, also should be dismissed as the creation of oppressive patriarchy. Toss out everything! Including the Kansas constitution which creates the jobs filled by the abortion-friendly jurists. This argument proves just a tad too much.
Almost comedic was the justices’ shameless reliance on authorities which they must have detested. The majority rested its analysis on a discussion of natural rights, John Locke, George Mason, Edward Coke, and William Blackstone, even though, no doubt, the justices would have run shrieking from their chambers if those concepts and names had been presented to them on behalf of the liberties the Founders, and early Jayhawkers, were committed to protecting from overweening government. Such as property. Find a safe space and bring out the cartoon books!
Justice Caleb Stegall was the only court member to dissent. He understood what was at stake: “The majority’s decision is so consequential because it fundamentally alters the structure of our government to magnify the power of the state — all while using that power to arbitrarily grant a regulatory reprieve to the judicially privileged act of abortion. In the process, the majority abandons the original public meaning of section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights and paints the interest of unborn life championed by millions of Kansans as rooted in an ugly prejudice.”
In fact, abortion is a difficult issue because it involves both life and liberty and concerns two different people. Which makes it almost perfectly a legislative issue, subject to complicated compromise, and not a judicial issue, controlled by pristine principle. Roe was notably dishonest because the justices unconvincingly crafted a legislative compromise — with different rules for different trimesters, for instance — while calling it law. The opinion was horrid, not really constitutional law at all, denounced by many liberals at the time. (In fact, lefties also were pro-life; a socialist was a member of our pro-life group when I attended Stanford Law School.) Only in recent years have left-wing extremists seized almost complete control of the issue and made commitment to even late-term abortion, the moral equivalent of infanticide, a requirement for progressive membership.
However, here, in America’s heartland, left-liberals have triumphed, giving a preview of what the court-packing they desire by the next Democratic president would mean. Judges voting as legislators, interpreting the law as they wish it to be. New left-wing rights magically enshrined, traditional human rights ruthlessly dismissed.
Yet state justices are not so invulnerable as federal ones, meaning that the Left’s Kansas victory might prove Pyrrhic. As my friend Jim Pinkerton noted, “in political terms, the losing side of an issue is oftentimes more motivated to action than the winning side. The winners, after all, have won, and so they typically become complacent. In the meantime, the losers, still smoldering, resolve to get even.” Kansas law allows ample opportunity for vengeance.
Prolife activists have called for amending the state constitution, which would be appropriate, but would not go far enough. Impeachment is warranted for such jurisprudential abuse, thought that might be a long-shot, given legislative and party divisions. A better opportunity is provided by the retention elections in which supreme court members must run every six years. Two of the justices are up for a vote next year: Hodes & Nauser should become the primary case against them. The other four justices are up in 2022 (along with the sole dissenter, Caleb Stegall).
A model for such a campaign could be the 1986 retention election for California Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird and two of her colleagues, who steadfastly refused to apply the death penalty. She reviewed 64 death penalty cases. In every case she voted to overturn the sentence (and was regularly joined by three of the other six court members in doing so). Voters tired of the jurists’ dishonest refusal to apply a law with which the latter disagreed and voted Bird and two similarly obstructionist justices off the court. As in the case of Bird, the justification for removal is not the specific issue involved (death penalty or abortion) but the rule of law and role of judges. Jurists are not empowered to rewrite state constitution and law through creative interpretation.
The rule of law sets free societies apart from tyrannies. But to be secure, the law must mean something. It cannot be infinitely malleable, matching whatever has become the new progressive consensus. For that means no rights are secure. Indeed, this process is well underway, with the entire First Amendment on the Left’s chopping block. Certainly, religious liberty is deemed of little concern by progressives. But even free speech now is treated as inconvenient, protecting “hate speech” which unduly distresses the sensitive among us. What other liberties will be the next ones to be sacrificed for the gods of social engineering, income redistribution, and values reeducation?
Which makes control of the courts even more important. The Left long ago captured the legal academy and professional infrastructure. Since the 1960s it has dominated the commanding heights of the judiciary. That balance has started to shift, but the battle will be a long one. Hodes & Nauser reminds us what is at stake.

Train platform in Merced, California (Diego Grandi/Shutterstock) Top Stories by Veronique de Rugy
Sacramento
When I think about government infrastructure projects, I always think back to the third game of the 1989 World Series between the Oakland A’s and the San Francisco Giants, which was being played at Candlestick Park. Like many Americans, I settled in the easy chair to watch the start of the game and then, poof, the screen went blank. A magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit the Bay Area, killing 67 people, injuring 3,000 — and collapsing a section of the Bay Bridge.
The California Department of Transportation repaired the fallen bridge section in a month, but then the state set about replacing rather than retrofitting the entire eastern span . Fast forward to 2013, when the state held its long-delayed ribbon cutting for the new bridge. Granted, building a massive new bridge is no easy feat, but it took 24 years and the project was 2,500 percent — yes, that number is correct — over budget.
The project was plagued by scandal , including allegations of shoddy welds , questionable inspections , and, as a Senate committee explained (as reported by the Sacramento Bee ), allegations that Caltrans “managers ‘gagged and banished’ at least nine top experts for the new $6.5 billion San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge after they complained about substandard work….”
Looking at worldwide infrastructure projects, a University of Toronto think tank reported in 2015 that “the all-too-human tendency to underestimate the costs and time required to complete a project means that megaprojects are well-nigh guaranteed to exceed their budgets and schedules.” Furthermore, “promoters of megaprojects may deliberately misrepresent the budget and schedule to ensure approval of projects from which they will gain — financially, professionally, or politically.”
This is the nature of government infrastructure projects, which are conceived in the political world and funded by Other People’s Money . Rebuilding a bridge that serves one of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas is a necessity, so perhaps such overruns and poor management are just the cost of doing business in our current system. But when it comes to building more esoteric projects, you’d think planners and journalists would be more skeptical.
Yet I recall the debate over Proposition 1A , the 2008 California ballot initiative that approved $9.95 billion in initial bond funding to build a starter segment for a high-speed rail system that would speed passengers at 220 mph from the San Francisco Bay Area through the Central Valley and into the Los Angeles basin. Of course, the project’s boosters would tout every conceivable benefit — easing climate change, reducing reliance on foreign oil, creating jobs. It would be faster and cheaper than air travel and the project would be subject to “strict fiscal controls and oversight.” As they say on Facebook, lol.
The media largely went along for the ride, allowing the exciting idea to overcome concern about big-infrastructure realities. For instance, the San Jose Mercury News opined that, “The proposal, years in the making, has been thoroughly vetted in public debate, particularly over the route. The High Speed Rail Authority made the right choices, coming up with a practical and visionary plan that will place San Jose and Silicon Valley at the heart of the Bay Area’s economy.”
In its editorial, the Los Angeles Times pointed to boosters’ prediction that the bullet train would “draw 117 million riders a year by 2030” and “will turn a billion-dollar profit by then even as it keeps ticket prices remarkably low.” But the newspaper admitted that opponents’ projections were more persuasive: “[I]t seems close to a lead-pipe cinch that the California High-Speed Rail Authority will ask for many billions more in the coming decades.” In the end, the Times backed Prop. 1A as a “visionary leap that would cement California’s place as the nation’s most forward-thinking state.”
Big surprise. Eleven years later, the critics have been mostly right. A Times news story this week, based on an internal draft of the High Speed Rail Authority’s forthcoming report to the Legislature, found, “The cost of building a 119-mile section of the California bullet train in the Central Valley is projected to increase by $1.8 billion.” Note that the cost overruns are in the simplest place to build, along a flat agricultural plain. And just how many people are itching to ride this downsized rail line from Bakersfield to Merced?
Last week’s Times report was even more damning, as it detailed “How California’s faltering high-speed rail project was ‘captured’ by costly consultants.” Are we surprised that the authority has been “overly reliant on a network of high-cost consultants who have consistently underestimated the difficulty of the work”? It wasn’t exactly a secret that contractors and unions pumped enormous funds into the Prop. 1A campaign. Those figures were available about the importance of the visionary system as editorialists touted the “visionary” system.
But as the Southern California News Group noted in an editorial this week, this problem won’t be solved by hiring an army of well-compensated government employees to do the work in the consultants’ place. The problem lies within the project itself. It needs to be scuttled.
There is no need for a 2-hour and 40-minute projected rail ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles in a world of quick and cheap hour airline flights. The project is not going to do anything about climate change, but is more likely to be an underused monument to government waste. The project’s costs continue to soar, private investment has not materialized, and the state never figured out how to overcome geographic barriers (e.g., various mountain ranges). In recent months, the state auditor released a harsh report about the project.
The plan has changed dramatically from inception, with rail boosters and the courts ignoring the many ways it has deviated from the supposedly iron-clad promises made in the initiative. For instance, the plan to share commuter track in the two big metro areas dramatically slowed planned travel times — and is one reason one of the system’s original drafters ultimately denounced it as a boondoggle. Yet former Gov. Jerry Brown could not be dissuaded from his rail fixation.
Fortunately, new Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his intention to scale back the system, forgoing the big metro areas and focusing on connecting the gritty cities along the 99 corridor in the Central Valley. But that smaller project is now estimated at around $20 billion — more than three times the initial planned costs for the segment. It’s almost guaranteed that 24 years from now we’ll still be talking about that yet-to-be completed and unneeded project and rolling our eyes at the massive cost overruns. When it comes to the nature of government, we never learn.

Thelma Nadler and Louise Schiff,spectator.org,David Catron,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/thelma-nadler-and-louise-schiff/,"Thelma Nadler and Louise Schiff Congressional crazies are taking the Democrat party over the cliff. by Melissa Mackenzie
I n the final scene of Thelma and Louise , when Detective Hal Slocumb realizes that those wacky chicks are about to drive that ’66 Thunderbird over the edge of the Grand Canyon, he runs after them in a futile attempt to prevent their senseless descent toward self-destruction. Slocumb, played by Harvey Keitel, does a good job of conveying the impotent despair that moderate Democrats like Steny Hoyer must feel while watching Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff accelerate toward the electoral abyss that awaits their party if they insist on relitigating Russiagate and rummaging through the President’s tax and business records.
If they continue to mine the Mueller report for presidential malfeasance and conduct multiple investigations into Trump’s business and tax matters, the effect on Democratic electoral prospects will be comparable to the damage done to that dusty T-Bird after Louise stomps on the gas. The electorate has had enough of collusion conspiracy theorists and Trump truthers. This is reflected in the latest public opinion polls as well as the ratings of cable networks that continue to push the most implausible narratives of White House skullduggery. CNN, for example, managed to lose more than a quarter of its viewers in April. The Hill reports :
CNN’s prime-time ratings dropped a whopping 26 percent in April compared to last year, according to Nielsen Media Research.… The sharp decrease for CNN marked its lowest-rated month in total viewers since October 2015.… In the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that advertisers covet most, it was the network’s least-watched month since Aug. 2015.
Nonetheless, the antics of the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee during Wednesday’s testimony by Attorney General Barr augured worse behavior had he decided to appear before its House counterpart on Thursday. Wednesday’s Senate hearing included the usual disingenuous Democratic stunts, but Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham kept the proceedings under control. Sadly, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is Jerrold Nadler, who is already engaging in irresponsible antics himself, including a threat to have members of the Trump administration arrested if they don’t comply with committee requests.
Attorney General Barr has decided to skip Thursday’s House hearing pursuant to Nadler’s bait-and-switch on the format. Typically, the House Judiciary committee would deal with a Cabinet official like Barr by allowing members five-minutes each to ask questions. Nadler and the Democrats, however, have decided that Barr must submit to additional queries from staff lawyers. This is quite unusual, particularly in the case of Cabinet officials. The Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, Georgia Republican Doug Collins, characterized Nadler’s maneuver as an unprecedented stunt designed to create an impeachment-like atmosphere:
The Chairman has decided, along with the majority, that they want to appear as if they’re doing impeachment. They want to have an impeachment-like inquiry because the precedent for staff questioning is impeachment.… Why would you want to say something that a staff member can say better than you can? If a staff member wants to ask questions, run for Congress!
If Barr had acquiesced in the bait-and-switch engineered by Nadler and his accomplices for Thursday’s hearing, one of the first topics the Democrats would have raised is a letter written to Barr by the special counsel on March 27. In the letter, Mueller has the crust to criticize the 4-page memo provided to Congress outlining the report’s major findings. Evidently forgetting that, once the investigation was closed the report was the AG’s to handle as he saw fit, Mueller had the gall to insist that Barr release his introduction and executive summary prior to the release of the full report. The tail, in other words, wanted to wag the dog.
Barr ignored that, as he should have, and released the full report after redacting material that he couldn’t legally release. That wasn’t good enough for many Democrats, including House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, who called Wednesday for Attorney General Barr to resign . Schiff insists this is necessary because special Counsel Robert Mueller complained to Barr about his initial summary of the probe’s findings. Barr did talk to Mueller, but decided to release the report according to his own plan. Any intelligent reader of the DOJ’s explanation of this decision will have little difficultly divining Barr’s reasons:
After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller’s letter, he called him to discuss it. In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading . But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis.
That Schiff is the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is terrifying. Even after the special counsel probe found “no collusion,” Schiff has maintained that there was indeed collusion “in plain sight.” His persistence in this evidence-free claim eventually resulted in a unanimous Republican call for his resignation from the chairmanship of the committee. This made no impression on his apparently absent sense of integrity. His committee has issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, Capital One, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Chase, and Bank of America seeking records on President Trump’s personal finances.
Yet, having been cleared by an FBI investigation and a 22-month special counsel probe, now the President will be harassed by Democratic hacks like Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff. Detective Hal Slocumb would easily see where this is going in 2020. The President will tell the voters, “We have accomplished a lot together, despite these investigations. Think what we can do if you reelect me, get these bums off my back, and we focus on making America greater than ever.” If moderate Democrats don’t take control of their party, that message will resonate with the voters, and Thelma and Louise will disappear into oblivion.

"Once a Protectionist, Always a Protectionist",spectator.org,Veronique de Rugy,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/once-a-protectionist-always-a-protectionist/,"Once a Protectionist, Always a Protectionist Why is NAFTA still the law of the land? by Steven Greenhut
T he United States has been plagued with uncertainty ever since President Donald Trump started his trade disputes with many of our trading partners. From steel and aluminum tariffs to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and replacing it with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), trade rules have been in flux, with U.S. consumers caught in the crossfire — and with no end in sight.
This drama started in March 2018, when the Trump administration announced that it would impose 25% tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum for imports from all countries that he deemed to be treating America unfairly. The duties were levied in the name of national security, even though they would actually punish many of our NATO allies. At the time, the administration made no secret about the fact that it planned to use the tariffs as leverage to renegotiate the 25-year-old NAFTA with Canada and Mexico.
Whether the strategy worked is still up for debate. Yes, NAFTA was renegotiated through the USMCA, but that agreement hasn’t been approved by the U.S. Congress or ratified by Mexico or Canada, either. In other words, NAFTA is still the law of the land. Unfortunately, the uncertainty over whether (and when) the USMCA will replace NAFTA places a significant economic burden on companies trying to make investment decisions and predictions throughout North America.
What’s not up for debate is the fact that in some important ways, the USMCA is more protectionist than NAFTA. It’s true that the USMCA includes a few improvements over NAFTA, such as an update of the digital trade rules. The internet was barely a thing when NAFTA was adopted, so the agreement did need to be modernized on this front. The USMCA also includes the slight opening of a few markets, for example the Canadian dairy market. That said, several of these provisions were already agreed to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement, which Trump withdrew from soon after he entered office.
On the negative side, the USMCA’s new automotive “rules of origin” are much more restrictive than the ones in NAFTA, including a new minimum wage provision requiring that 40% of a car be made in plants where the workers are paid at least $16 an hour or tariffs will be imposed on those cars. No such requirement exists in NAFTA. These changes will make producing cars in North America, and in the United States specifically, more expensive. Considering that the automotive industry’s future lies in large part with exporting, it’s unwise to raise the cost of producing cars in the United States, as it makes it more difficult for U.S. car companies to export them.
That said, in spite of its problems, approving the USMCA would at least put an end to some uncertainty. In fact, according to a recent report by the U.S. International Trade Commission, some of the biggest economic gains from adopting the USMCA would come from ending the current uncertainty.
So how close are we to adopting the USMCA? It doesn’t look too good.
For starters, the Democrats would like to see even more significant labor provisions imposed on Mexican workers. The House leadership said that it wasn’t anywhere near putting it up for a vote.
On the Republican side, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa warned the president that he shouldn’t expect his team to support the USMCA as long as the metal tariffs are still in place, writing in the Wall Street Journal , “If these tariffs aren’t lifted, USMCA is dead. There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.” The metal tariffs have hurt American consumers of foreign metals. And once retaliatory tariffs from Canada and Mexico went up, everyone suffered even more.
What’s more, Canadian and Mexican officials have shown very little interest in bringing the new deal to a vote in their own countries. The window for a vote is closing fast, as there are elections coming in Canada; observers predict that if the deal hasn’t been approved by then, it will have to wait until 2020.
Ultimately, for all the talk about using these tariffs as leverage, it seems that Trump’s true goal for the duties was to protect the steel industry. He is a protectionist, period. As such, he won’t let those tariffs go easily.
So, get used to the uncertainty."

Since discussing Endgame theories is still verboten by polite company on Twitter (I jest, there is no polite company there) and other public forums, one must cloister oneself to a Google-blacklisted website like The American Spectator. A cultural phenomenon like a Marvel movie, Endgame is pushing $1.5 billion in ticket sales after only a week, must be discussed! This post is a demonstration of great restraint. I saw the movie last weekend and waited til now to post so readers could see the movie first.
There are spoilers ahead so stop now, if that matters to you.
Onto the good stuff. Captain America is worthy of Thor’s hammer. My son came popping out of the movie saying four words that tinkle like glorious cymbals, “Mom, you were right!” What was I right about? I told him after we saw Age of Ultron together that Steve Rogers purposefully didn’t pick up the hammer so as not to upset the god and that the good Captain was worthy. And so he was. Were you thrilled when Cap called it? What a fun moment. Iron Man’s character arc and the beauty of embracing fatherhood pulled the film together.(He’s a stark, ahem, contrast to Thanos’ bad parenting.) Many men relate to him making peace with his father and making peace with being a father. Tony finally grew up. It took a while, but Tony got it. Thor’s moment with his mom. I’ve seen men write of their connection to Tony’s transformation. Thor’s stolen moment with Frigga was so tender, I cried. Rene Russo was shamefully underused throughout the Thor franchise and it was lovely to see her adore her adult son and demonstrate true, selfless bravery in facing the future. Tony had to die, but did Black Widow? It was the obvious place the story was going and it was obvious that Ironman was going to make the ultimate sacrifice. What I wasn’t prepared for was watching Black Widow, after her life of abuse and sorrow and love lost, sacrifice herself to save and redeem her friend. Noooo! The scene was absolutely brutal. Scarlett Johansson is the best actor in the cast. She’s a true talent and brought depth to a nuanced character. I don’t want her to go. Maybe she isn’t truly gone? In the predictions section, I’ve thought of something… It was great to see the Ancient One again. Another stellar actress giving gravity to a short scene. Chris Evans doesn’t get enough credit for creating a believable Captain America. What could be a cardboard-cutout character Evans makes sincere and fully realized. Steve Rogers is not a simple man. He’s been to war. He’s seen friends die. He lost his best friend (or thought he did), lost him again, and lost love, lost it again, and then found it. It was good to see him be rewarded, but so difficult to see him old. Did it seem false to you that Captain America would be self-seeking in the end? His essence is self-sacrifice. I’m not the only one who wondered about it. Thanos’ daughters’ resilience to overcome, damaged though they be, an abusive childhood. It’s impressive to have a superhero movie do an accurate portrayal of siblings suffering under a tyrant. The way they coped with one another and came to find forgiveness and sisterhood felt authentic. Captain Marvel got so little screen time. That was a surprise. Fine with me. The end scene that had all the ladies in a collective hero shot was annoying. The Scarlett Witch is one of the most powerful beings in the universe and has been fighting like a badass for many movies. All the ladies of Wakanda are tough. Thanos’ girls are warriors. There was no need to lump them together. Bleh. The hero of the movie was Black Widow. Women fought alongside men. “The #GoGurl moment” was unnecessary and condescending. The ultimate goal is always hearth and home. New Asgard, Clint Barton on the farm with his family, Tony and Pepper’s home on the lake, Steve Rogers and Peggy dancing. That’s the heart’s hope and the reason for it all, and ironically what Thanos was so angry about not having. But home cannot be created with a snap of the fingers, as Thanos discovers. It takes work which is why Steve Roger’s choice seems out of character.
Weird things and predictions: Why won’t Natasha Romanoff come back when Captain America returns the stone? A soul for a soul? And couldn’t she then be in Captain’s time and have, as she’d always hoped, her past erased? Loki went somewhere with the scepter. He’s alive and making a mess in an alternate timeline. I bet what we saw was not the last of it or him. Star-Lord still has the star within. How could half of his DNA just poof, be gone? My prediction is this: We’ll see that he is still, in fact, immortal when he fights Thor and the fight is even. This fight is inevitable because they’re both Alpha’s and goofballs. Dr. Strange is amazing. There better be more movies. Could Ironman’s daughter be an Irongirl at some point? Someone has to run the empire with Pepper. Could the kid who was at Tony’s funeral be the new Ironman ? Could Clint’s daughter Lila be the new Hawkeye? Ironman gave Spiderman some gravitas. Where will that come from now? Why wasn’t Bucky Barnes the next Captain America? Isn’t that the way it’s supposed to go? More Sebastian Stan, please. I do love Falcon and he’ll be a great Captain America, but still. What happens to Bucky? If the Mind Stone is returned, it means it goes back into Vision’s noggin, right? That means more movies with him? I hope so. He’s amazing. And then, could Vision create an A.I. version of Tony to keep Pepper company? He does have Tony’s genius after all. Then, all Robert Downey, Jr. would have to do is voice work.
After watching the movie, it’s difficult to imagine where it will go. Losing the anchors – Captain America and Ironman – makes the Marvel universe seem sadly empty. When the Guardians of the Galaxy flew away, everything shifted. The earth is connected to the Universe and the technological leaps (time travel!) open many possibilities. Maybe too many possibilities? Will it float away now?
Avengers: Endgame raised plenty of questions and it will take lots of movies to answer them, so maybe the magic isn’t gone. One good side of this end? Robert Downey, Jr. is now free to do another Sherlock movie. It’s been too long."
America’s Big Lie,spectator.org,Gary Lieberthal,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/americas-big-lie/,"by Robert Stacy McCain
� ��America’s Big Lie.” That’s quite a provocative title but no, I’m not talking about politicians or even the government. I’m referring to American business’ big lie, and you have all experienced it as they constantly repeat it to you… and I quote, “This conversation may be recorded for QUALITY purposes.” While it may be recorded, I can assure you it has no impact on quality. Allow me to elucidate.
Call any one of a number of large American corporate entities like the phone company or the cable company among others. Remember when the call was answered by a live person in one of the fifty states who was an actual employee of the company you were calling? Well now, as Tony Soprano often said, “fuggeddaboutit.”
Call your phone company and after working your way through a menu larger than Nate and Al’s deli you are connected to a call center somewhere in a city or town in India. (The phone company not answering their own phone is an irony that should not be lost on any of us.) The voice at the call center says in an unintelligible accent, “Hello my name is Kimberly” or Ashly, Ralph or Brian. Now I’m no expert on India but I bet one would be hard pressed to find a gal named Kimberly or a fella named Brian in Mumbai or Jaipur. The company, to further their charade, teaches these folks to toss in a few American idioms hoping that we are too stupid to notice to whom we are speaking. I have heard that fixing my issue was “a piece of cake” and I should be sure to “have a great day.” I actually had one man tell me that bundling phone with internet would “cover the whole nine meters.” Yep… meters. Sometimes I am tempted to hire someone with a very heavy Swedish accent to call for me. Wouldn’t you love to be on the extension to hear that conversation?
And it’s not just companies shuttling you off to foreign lands, it’s being connected to some domestic illiterate whose knowledge of their job is minuscule and only reads from a company authored script. A case in point. I recently signed up for AARP’s United Healthcare. After I’d filled out the application they sent my membership card to the wrong street address.… At least they had my city correct. I got them on the phone and they acknowledged their error. The next time they got the street correct but sent my ID card to Los Angeles of all places. The next time my city was correct but the street address was wrong again. It took nine more phone calls over three months to get my address correct. Does anyone believe that any of those calls were recorded for quality purposes?
Now if the greeting said, “We may record your call to be sure that we make the same mistakes consistently while maintaining our low level of service,” then at least it would be honest. We all lived through “If you like your doctor you can keep him…” but can’t corporate America cut us a little slack?
Just sayin’."
"Congress, Not Bill Barr, Deserves Contempt",spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/congress-not-bill-barr-deserves-contempt/,"by Robert Stacy McCain
T he Democrats’ latest scam (of many) is to threaten to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress. Will the heavens fall? Be still my heart.
But wait. Is this even a threat? Considering recent events, what sensible person paying the least attention would not hold Congress in contempt? It certainly behaves contemptibly, and richly deserves all the contempt Bill Barr and other patriotic Americanos can heap on it. Failing to do so would be a moral and intellectual dereliction.
His recent testimony before Congress shows that Barr does not rattle easily. And while he’s polite, he clearly takes the Democrat-controlled House about as seriously as it deserves to be taken. So don’t look for him to roll over. But the pointless pyrotechnics will continue. Jerry Nadler and his merry pranksters will continue to bang their spoons on their high-chairs, at least until November of 2020. No one’s mind will be changed on the question of whether Donald J. Trump is or ever has been a Russian agent. The cosmos, having better things to do, will take no notice."
With ‘News’ Like This…,spectator.org,Larry Thornberry,05-05-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/with-news-like-this/,"by Robert Stacy McCain
I t gets increasingly difficult with the reliably leftist Tampa Bay Times to sort opinion from news. In fact, it’s near impossible to find the latter uninfected by the former. Take this page one headline and story from Sunday’s edition (please):
“Florida turns hard right — New Republican leadership pushed through policies that have failed for years.”
Wow.
The item is not labeled opinion or even analysis. This is what passes for news at the Times . The long story goes on to lament “hard right” policies newly adopted by the Florida Legislature such as money for school vouchers, a ban on sanctuary cities, and a law that would allow trained teachers to be armed. They also sniffed at the legislature making it more difficult to get constitutional initiatives on the ballot. These clutter up ballots every state-wide election and usually concern issues that should be dealt with legislatively, not things that belong in the state’s basic governing document. How these policies, most of which are new, have “failed for years,” the team of Times reporters who put this opinion piece together offer no clue.
The obvious question Times readers are left with — many of these reluctant readers as there is no other Tampa area daily — is: With “news” like this, what the hell does the Times need an editorial page for?"
Democrat Offered Reward to ‘Dox’ Pro-Life Teens | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Robert Stacy Mccain,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/democrat-offered-reward-to-dox-pro-life-teens/,"Democrat Offered Reward to ‘Dox’ Pro-Life Teens Catholic girls targeted by Pennsylvania State Rep. Brian Sims. by Betsy McCaughey
Teenage girls praying outside an abortion clinic in Philadelphia were harassed by a Democrat state politician, and the father of two of the teens has contacted police after the girls were apparently “doxed” by abortion supporters.
Joe Garecht says his wife, two of their daughters, and one of his daughter’s friends were praying in front of a Planned Parenthood clinic April 18 —the Thursday before Easter — when they were approached by Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims who “yelled at them for ten minutes, then comes back with his phone and starts recording video.” Garecht said his wife didn’t recognize Sims, who was elected in 2012 as the first openly homosexual member of the state legislature. The Garechts also didn’t realize Sims had posted the video online, offering $100 “to anyone who will identify” them.
In the video, Sims calls them “a bunch of pseudo-Christian protesters” and says “there’s nothing Christian about” opposing abortion. The Garechts are devout Catholics; two of the girls in the video are home-schooled, while the oldest Garecht daughter now attends a Catholic day school. In the video, Sims can be seen calling them “a bunch of white people,” at which point Garecht’s daughter’s Hispanic friend says, “I’m not white.”
After the family was “doxed” (publicly identified) as a result of Sims’ video, Garecht said he called the township police in his suburban community, “just in case anybody tries anything.”"
Immoralists: The Example of Brian Sims | The American Spectator,spectator.org,Daniel J. Flynn,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/immoralists-the-example-of-brian-sims/,"by Scott S. Powell
� ��A man must be something of a moralist if he is to preach,” G.K. Chesterton observed, “even if he is to preach immorality.”
Brian Sims, a Pennsylvania state representative by profession and abortion counterprotester by avocation, embodies Chesterton’s quip. The former defensive tackle for Bloomsburg University aggressively hectored a woman who appeared to be praying the rosary outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic in his Pennsylvania district. On the uncomfortable eight-minute clip , Sims calls the silent protester “an old white lady” and announces, “If you know who this woman is and if you can give me her address, we’ll protest in front of her home. Let’s protest out in front of her house.”
The reason for such a protest escapes. Is mere disagreement with a private citizen now grounds for demonstrations at her residence? A clinic that provides abortion, an inherently controversial practice, strikes as something inevitably protested. Mere disagreement? A polite conversation, or just a silent “agree to disagree,” works better for a civil society.
The entire clip seems a case study in projection. “How dare you! This is grotesque,” Sims lectures the woman. “What you’re doing out here is disgusting,” he says. “This is wrong.”
He repeatedly relies on the judgmental language of morality to denounce the protester, calling her actions “wrong” and “disgusting.” Three dozen times in eight minutes he utters some variant of the word “shame” (e.g., “shame on you,” “your Christian faith believes in shaming people,” etc.). He could use a thesaurus. He could use George Washington’s “Rules of Civility” more.
Strangely, the strange man condemns the protester as “extremely racist.” He announces, “If you’re a white person like I am we have a lot of catching up to do. We have a lot to apologize for. I’m going to start by apologizing for this woman.”
Why not apologize for Planned Parenthood’s racism?
Planned Parenthood’s founder Margaret Sanger spoke at a Ku Klux Klan gathering in 1926. She called “the aboriginal Australian” the “lowest known species of the human family, just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development.” In one letter, she used the n-word to refer to a black man.
“The Jewish people and Italian families,” she testified before the New York legislature, “who are filling the insane asylums, who are filling the hospitals and are filling our feeble-minded institutions, those are the ones the tax payers have to pay for the upkeep of, and they are increasing the budget of the state, the enormous expense of the state is increasing because of the multiplication of the unfit in this country and in the state.”
As Hitler came to power in Germany, Planned Parenthood’s founder unveiled her similar vision for America. Her “Plan for World Peace” called for “a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.” The plan allowed for a segment holding dysgenic traits “their choice of segregation or sterilization.” The rest received no such “choice.” She envisioned the plan manifesting in “farm lands and homestead for these segregated persons where they would be taught to work under competent instructors for the period of their entire lives.” Sanger’s “Plan for World Peace” rivaled Hitler “Final Solution” in its scope. “Having corralled this enormous part of our population and placed it on a basis of health instead of punishment,” she wrote, “it is safe to say that fifteen or twenty millions of our population would then be organized into soldiers of defense — defending the unborn against their own disability.”
Americans, perhaps too backward to ride this wave of the future, balked — moving away instead of toward the eugenics embodied by Sanger and the organization she founded. Given Sanger’s ethnic tics, one imagines that she did not foresee people who looked like her peopling the camps.
Margaret Sanger rationalized forced sterilization and concentration camps and planning the parenthood (or lack thereof) or others under the warped vision that all this embodied science, progress, and enlightenment. One senses that Brian Sims imagines his cornering a quiet, unassuming lady who disagreed with him as representing much of that, too. In his attempt to bait her into playing the part of the finger-thrusting zealot, Sims inadvertently cast himself in that role.
God made people with their eyes facing outward, so we do not easily see ourselves. Mr. Sims exhibits greater difficulty surmounting this handicap than most. “This is a racist act of judgment,” he says of the anonymous woman, Planned Parenthood acts as a “civil rights” organization he says of the abortuary, and pro-life activists “have no business telling people of color what they think about what they do with their families, with their own family planning.”
Surely Planned Parenthood had no business telling people of color what they think about what they do with their families, but they did that through their “negro programme” anyway, and Representative Sims either cares not or knows not. People with all the answers rarely know it all or care at all. Alas, Sims’s issues seem beyond correction through a history lesson.
“This is what broken morality looks like,” the politician harangues the beleaguered woman. “This is what broken values looks like.”
Indeed."
John Dowd’s Indispensable Work for President Trump,spectator.org,George Parry,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/john-dowds-indispensable-work-for-president-trump/,"Special Report John Dowd’s Indispensable Work for President Trump His recent interview with Fox News can serve as a template for what Republicans ask Robert Mueller when he appears before the House Judiciary Committee. by Scott S. Powell
M any years ago, John Dowd was Chief of Strike Force 18, a unit within the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Justice Department. In that capacity, he conducted massive and complex investigations of underworld financial crimes and related organized criminal schemes. He was and remains a legend among my aging generation of Strike Force lawyers and throughout the Justice Department.
When Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate possible collusion between Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia, the president wisely retained Dowd’s services. Working with co-counsel Ty Cobb, Dowd interacted with Mueller and his team of angry Democrats as they did their best to take down the president.
The strategy pursued by Dowd was daring and unconventional. Contrary to the all-out resistance mounted by Bill Clinton’s lawyers in dealing with Independent Counsel Ken Starr, Trump’s legal team pursued a course of total transparency and complete cooperation with Team Mueller.
So how did it come about that the president did not assert executive privilege, made his staff — including White House Counsel Don McGahn — available for interrogation by Mueller’s Clintonistas, and produced over one million documents?
The answers to those questions came shortly after the release of the Mueller report when Dowd was interviewed on Fox News . In that interview he laid out the presidents’ strategy and marching orders to his lawyers in their dealings with Team Mueller and discussed the claim that Trump had ordered Mueller’s firing.
On Fox and Friends , host Steve Doocy asked Dowd, “When did President Trump say go out there and fire Mueller?” Dowd responded as follows.
“He never did. I was there at the same time that the report says that McGahn mentioned this, and I was assigned to deal with Mueller, and I briefed the president every day. And every week I saw Mueller or [Assistant Special Counsel James] Quarles for eight months.
“At no time did the president ever say, you know, John I’m going to get rid of him [Mueller], Don [McGahn] is not going to do it.
“It was just the opposite. Here’s the message the president had for Bob Mueller for me to carry:
“One, you tell him that I respect what he’s doing.
“Number two, you tell him he’s got my full cooperation.
“Number three, get it done as quickly as possible.
“And, number four, whatever else you need, let me know.
“That was always the message, and that’s exactly what we did. And, as you know, we produced everything without a document missing, without a lie. Can you imagine in Washington someone without a lie?”
When Doocy asked about the president’s Tweets calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt, Dowd replied, “I talked to Bob [Mueller] about that, and he said, ‘I understand. He has to do that for political reasons.’
“One time, early on, Mueller said, ‘I don’t want to scare off witnesses.’
“I said, ‘Well, I’ll tell you what. The president and I will make sure we’ll say publicly [to] cooperate with Bob Mueller.’ And we did, early on, so that was it.
“I think there was a misunderstanding with Don McGahn. People forget that it was Rosenstein that ambushed the president with the appointment of Mueller. So the president never had a chance to think about it, have him [Mueller] vetted.”
Doocy pointed out that the Mueller report says that the president told McGahn to fire Mueller, which elicited this reply:
“Yes, that’s the report. I don’t believe it. I think the president wanted McGahn to call Rosenstein and have him vetted because the president believed that Mueller did have some conflicts. Whether he did or not, the president as the number one law enforcement officer was entitled to ask Rosenstein to do that. He asked his White House counsel to do it.”
When asked to rate the Mueller report on a scale of one to ten, Dowd said, “It’s an ‘F’. I used to have a Strike Force, I ran cases just like this. There are things that are missing. There are parts of it that just aren’t right. And I would say that they had a junior writer of the New York Times do it. It’s very poor.”
The Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee want Mueller to testify about his investigation. Obviously they believe that he will be able to provide support for their stated belief that the president obstructed justice.
I hope Mueller does appear and testify. If he does, then he will be open to cross-examination by the minority committee members who will be able to probe every aspect of his investigation. That would include such areas of interest as the following:
When did Mueller learn there was no collusion with Russia?
Did he delay announcing that there was no collusion? If so, why?
Did he drag out the investigation in the hope that the president, under constant and unremitting accusations of treason, would crack and submit to interrogation by Mueller’s Hillary acolytes? In other words, did Mueller prolong the investigation in the hope of luring the president into a General Flynn-style perjury trap?
Why did he hire only angry Democrat lawyers including one who had represented the Clinton Foundation and another who had contributed to Hillary’s campaign and attended her abortive election night victory party?
These are all good questions, and like all good cross, the witness’s answers will be irrelevant. We already know the truth, such that Mueller can give whatever answer he wants. The onslaught of the questions alone will discredit Mueller.
But an even more productive line of questioning has been provided by John Dowd. The committee minority should use Dowd’s terrific interview as the template for questioning Mueller about his report’s spurious discussion of obstruction of justice. If Mueller honors his oath to speak the truth and confirms even a fraction of Dowd’s narrative, Team Mueller’s unprofessional and sophomoric claim of possible obstruction by the president will be exposed for the cheap political smear that it is.
So, as Mueller takes the witness stand, let the cry go forth:
“Batters up!”

How the U.S. Can Solve the Current Trade Tariff Impasse With China,spectator.org,Scott S. Powell,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/how-the-u-s-can-solve-the-current-trade-tariff-impasse-with-china/,"How the U.S. Can Solve the Current Trade Tariff Impasse With China Movement on tariffs in the first round — with many more rounds to go in the long term. by George Parry
Trade talks between the U.S. and China have hit an impasse, but there is surprising bipartisan support for the Trump administration to stay the course on what will be a long process to resolve the full range of trade problems specific to China.
Success on this first round of trade negotiations in the form of ending the tariff penalties that are at the heart of a year-old trade war, with further reduction and even elimination of tariffs on as many categories as possible, should actually be attainable in the near term.
Future rounds of trade talks to find remedies for China’s intellectual property and trademark theft, national security threats, and forced technology transfer from American companies doing business in China will be far more problematic.
China is already feeling the pain of our tariffs, just as American farmers are feeling the pain of their retaliatory tariffs against U.S. agricultural products. Both sides benefit from more trade with minimal tariffs that come naturally because of comparative advantage — a theory that has worked consistently since David Ricardo developed it in 1817.
When China was admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, it was granted “developing country” status — allowing it to have higher tariffs on imports from the U.S. and Europe in order to protect so-called infant industries, even while China benefited from low tariffs on its exports into those same countries.
Now that China’s economy is the second-largest in the world after the United States — having increased its GDP nearly 10-fold since 2001 — China should follow the precedents of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, who all gained by lowering their respective tariff rates once they grasped the trade benefits of comparative advantage. Stellar examples are Singapore and Hong Kong, which have become the wealthiest Asian countries on a per capita basis, largely because they have maintained 0 tariff rates. In short the principles of comparative advantage remind us that trading partners each benefit when they export what they’re good at producing and import what they’re not so good at.
The traditional understanding of comparative advantage has expanded in the last 50 years as economists recognized the importance of what’s known as total factor productivity (TFP), which includes the education and specialized knowledge of the workforce and the technological advancement of the workplace. But TFP now takes into account political, social, legal and regulatory variables at the national level. These include factors such as the ease of business formation, efficiency of capital markets, macroeconomic stability, and rule of law, property rights, free expression, as well as the institutionalization of competition, transparency and accountability.
While China has recently surpassed the U.S. on total patents granted and is moving upstream with artificial intelligence technologies, overall its TFP is a shadow of what we enjoy in the U.S. China’s primary comparative advantage remains large-scale cheap labor suited for consumer product OEM manufacturing. America’s comparative advantages are far superior and include being a world leader in high tech innovation and manufacturing in both electronics and life sciences; having six of the 10 top universities in the world; and eight out of the 10 most valuable brand names in the world.
Countries with high TFP are all at the top of the Index of Economic Freedom. They enjoy greater prosperity because of the aforementioned contributing factors and institutions that enable the free market to thrive with innovation that provides solutions to old and new problems. High TFP is also tightly correlated with healthier societies and cleaner environments — two essential measures of welfare.
The fact is that China probably needs a trade deal with the United States more than we need one with China. This current round of trade talks should result in tariff reductions with attendant benefits to both sides. But we also need to keep the long view. It took the WTO’s predecessor organization, GATT, some 60 years of on and off negotiations — through a series of nine rounds — to bring international tariff levels down to 13% of the high tariff years of the Great Depression.
To its credit, the Trump administration has been the first to articulate how the U.S. has been taken advantage of in prior trade agreements, and to follow through in a resolute push for new corrective and fair agreements.
With a favorable tariff agreement with China, the U.S. can enter the next round of negotiations — and enlist the WTO where possible — to focus on protecting the intellectual property rights and national security interests of the United States.
And the good news is that we can stay that course longer than the Chinese — even indeterminately — so long as we hold on to the Constitution that protects and empowers our total factor productivity advantage.

Mark Levin’s ‘Unfreedom of the Press’: Right on Target,spectator.org,Jeffrey Lord,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/mark-levins-unfreedom-of-the-press-right-on-target/,"R ight off the bat, Mark Levin nails it exactly in his new bestseller Unfreedom of the Press .
Says Mark:
Unfreedom of the Press is about how those entrusted with news reporting in the modern media are destroying freedom of the press from within….
Indeed, social activism, progressive group-think, Democratic Party partisanship, opinion and propaganda passed off as news, the staging of pseudo-events, self-censorship, bias by omission, and outright falsehoods are too often substituted for old-fashioned, objective fact gathering and news reporting. A self-perpetuating and reinforcing mindset has replaced independent and impartial thinking. And the American people know it. Thus the credibility of the mass media has never been lower.
Bingo. Truer words could not be spoken.
Mark’s objective with Unfreedom of the Press is “to jump-start a long overdue and hopefully productive dialogue among the American citizenry on how best to deal with the complicated and complex issue of the media’s collapsing role as a bulwark of liberty, the civil society, and republicanism…” Suffice to say, mission accomplished.
As usual, Mark Levin comes through with a history lesson that gives some perspective to where the press is today — and how it got here. An entire chapter is devoted to “The Early Patriot Press,” and instructive it is. In recounting the critical role played by the early pamphleteers and the handful of newspapers (“forty or fewer by 1775”) in making the cause for independence from Great Britain, the Harvard professor and historian Bernard Bailyn is cited for his considerable knowledge of the role of pamphleteering between 1750 and 1776. While newspapers were small in number, there were in fact hundreds of pamphlets produced. Perhaps one of the greatest pamphleteers, Mark notes, was Thomas Paine whose famous essay Common Sense was published in January of 1776. Paine’s 48-page pamphlet is, among other things, a bold condemnation of monarchy and hereditary succession, something progressives of today would surely applaud. But Mark zeroes in on a very real problem with the progressive media as it is today.
He asks just why progressive media is all too eagerly accepting and advocating of “the enormous power exercised today by lifetime-appointed judges, who micromanage more and more of society; unelected bureaucrats employed by scores of government departments and agencies, who legislate not through elected members of Congress but by the issuance of untold regulations and rules; and the surrendering of sovereign legal and policy authority to international organizations, thereby conferring decisions to organizations that exist outside the Constitution’s framework?” Or in other words, the monarchy and hereditary succession the early patriots fought so hard to be free of has in essence reappeared in the form of lifetime judges and career bureaucrats — all to the applause of progressive media.
Notably Mark reminds of the era between the 1780s and 1860s when seriously partisan newspapers became the rule rather than the exception. He says that “they had little to do with objective news. Quite the contrary, they deliberately reported everything with a political slant, and were intended to be biased.”
Sound familiar? Mark reminds of the disturbing fact of life with today’s “mainstream media.”
Importantly, unlike the party-press era, where newspapers lined up fairly evenly behind one party or the other or one candidate or the other, and transparently proclaimed their partisanship, the current party-press also differs in that news outlets are overwhelmingly supportive of the Democratic Party and hostile to the Republican Party — particularly conservatives — and these days, virulently antagonistic to President Donald Trump, his supporters, and his policies.
Exactly.
The degree of unanimity and vicious anti-Trump partisanship is so blatant that even former New York Times editor Jill Abramson said this of the Times and her successor as editor, Dean Baquet, in a recent book: “Though Baquet said publicly he didn’t want the Times to be the opposition party, his news pages were unmistakably anti-Trump.” She also throws in the Washington Post as well with this open hostility spewing from the news pages.
Mark details the assaults on Trump from the anti-Trump media — which is to say almost every outlet on cable and in print or cyber space. Trump is a racist, Trump is demented, Trump is treasonous, Trump is morally depraved etc., etc., etc. The open hostility to a president who won the presidency with the votes of over sixty-million Americans — not to mention hostility to his voters — is truly astonishing.
The very serious point here is in this sentence when Mark notes the reaction of the press when they are called out for their decidedly un-journalistic behavior.
In fact, they protest when called out and claim that they are protecting freedom of the press against their critics. But are they? Or does the threat to press freedom lie with them?
Good question.
Mark illustrates the intolerance of the modern media with the story of NBC’s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd announcing that he has banned so-called “climate deniers” from his show, thus shutting down serious intellectual inquiry about a controversial topic when there are, in fact — as Todd and his producers well know — “many legitimate, credentialed, and serious scientists and climate experts who are either skeptical of or outright reject the claims of man-made climate change.” What Todd — and other “journalists” — are in fact about is propaganda, not objectivity and news. If ever there were a serious threat to press freedom, it doesn’t get more blatant than that.
Cited here is a book by Bill Kovach (the former Washington bureau chief of the New York Times and former editor of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution ) and Tom Rosenstiel (longtime media critic for the Los Angeles Times as well as chief congressional correspondent for Newsweek ).
Kovach and Rosenstiel authored the book The Elements of Journalism, in which they “provide five ‘intellectual principles of a science of reporting.’” They are: Never add anything that was not there. Never deceive the audience Be as transparent as possible about your methods and motives. Rely on your own original reporting. Exercise humility.
Well said. And most assuredly advice wildly ignored by a media that is determined to be advocates for what I call in this corner the Leftist State Media.
There is more in this book — oh so much more — that details precisely the quite serious problems with the modern media. Unfreedom of the Press is decidedly a must read to understand exactly what and why Americans are — and are not — reading, seeing, and hearing when they turn on or read more or less any “mainstream media” outlet.
Mark’s intention in writing this book, as mentioned, “was intended to ‘jump start a long overdue and hopefully productive dialogue among the American citizenry on how to best deal with the complicated and complex issue of the media’s collapsing role as a bulwark of liberty, the civil society, and republicanism.’”
And as I also said at the beginning of this column: “Mission accomplished.”
Let the dialogue begin."
2034: Big Non-Gender-Conforming Sibling Is Watching,spectator.org,Christopher Dale,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/2034-big-non-gender-conforming-sibling-is-watching/,"by George Parry
I t is 7:30 a.m., and the smart alarm clock bellows. “Wake up… to the triggers of tofu bacon! Making vegans think of meat is inappropriate and shameful!”
Pat yawned and stretched. Better than yesterday’s warning about music making tone deaf people feel “less than.”
Pat headed downstairs. “Some coffee would be nice,” he — a thousand apologies to our new Founding Non-Gender-Conforming Parents, the correct term is it — thinks, before admonishing itself for the thought-aggression. Someone had been triggered by a coffeemaker last year (the drip reminded it of tears) so, correctly, coffeemakers were banished. Instead, Pat boiled water for kale tea, which would have paired nicely with avocado toast were bread still on the Woke List.
It promised to be a long day. First the bank, where the weekly economic equality tax would be levied. Next, a haircut (unisex, of course) and a trip to the pharmacy, since once again Pat had been accused, by an anonymous online avatar (so obviously a credible source), of toxic masculinity. Among other consequences, the penalty was a three-day suspension from the WomInternet and, correctly, a renewed prescription for Castrex™.
Pat knew h… (caught myself!) it had better get moving. The lines at the post office were long enough prior to the Great Awokening; now, Pat would need to check not only its white privilege but its heterosexual F.K.A. (formerly known as) male imperialism before even being allowed to wait in the Historical Oppressors line.
But the worst was left for last. Pat had been summoned to the Less Young Persons School (the word “high” in “high school,” having triggered recovering substance abusers, had been replaced by “Older Children,” which in turn triggered senior citizens and kids alike) for an afternoon meeting with the personipal (principal, sounding too much like the gender-specific “prince,” was among the first titles to change during the Re-Education of 2028). Apparently Pat’s child, Sam, had really done it this time.
Not only had Sam once again gender-identified (last month, Sam had delivered the since-deleted “I Have a Penis” speech from atop a lunchroom table), it also had asked a fellow student, to quote the personipal, “what SHE was DOING this weekend.” Not only had Sam projected gender onto a fellow student, Sam also had invaded the student’s social safe space in a manner that sounded suspiciously close to what was once called a “date.”
In the Dark Days of the early 21 st Century, of course, Sam’s alarmingly aggressive behavior may have been dismissed as a “crush.” Correctly, we now know that Sam, in not asking for permission to “like” a fellow student, had committed an unforgivable, nonconsensual pre-sexual assault. It (the situation and, of course, Sam itself) had really gotten out of control.
Pat took a spoonful of quinoa-collard yogurt and sighed. Pat had been something called a “Democrat” once — a time that, though little more than two decades ago, seemed like the distant past.
At 18, fresh out of less young persons school, he (such offensive pronouns permeated society back then) had voted for the Excused Philanderer, F.K.A. Bill Clinton. He had voted for ecological soothsayer and lockbox enthusiast Al Gore in 2000, and, four years later, swiftboated Senator John Kerry. And of course, he had voted for His Half-Non-Whiteness, Barack Obama, twice.
With Obama in office and the world’s problems seemingly solved, however, Pat had become disenchanted. Pat had always seen himself as tolerant of all races and sexual orientations; now others insisted that his opinions as a white, heterosexual male were insignificant. In short order, the manner in which Pat had spoken his entire life was, correctly, deemed riddled with microaggressions. Pat was not a diverse voice, and did not yet realize that the penalty for this was, correctly, to be left voiceless.
Around this time, the plant at which Pat had worked downsized. Half of the jobs moved overseas, the other half given to robots. Pat’s Democratic Party told him that everything was just fine, and to vote for the Excused Philanderer Survivor for president in 2016.
Incorrectly, Pat rebelled. He voted for Orange Satan, F.K.A. Donald Trump. A resident of Milwaukee, Pat figured that if the Excused Philanderer Survivor cared about Wisconsin, perhaps she should have visited Wisconsin. Today, of course, we correctly know that Wisconsin is full of white people who, being white, should be ashamed of themselves.
Orange Satan’s victory had its consequences. In 2020, the Glorious Demasculization began when Elizabeth Warren became not only the first un-man to become president, but also the first full-blooded 1/64 th Native American.
And in 2028, of course, the now-officially-great-again society was blessed with President Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, praised be its Instagram.
The great Re-Education commenced. We shed ourselves of our gender-burdened past and, in 2029, passed the White Tax. We made school bathrooms transgender-only, saving millions time-consuming trips to relieve themselves.
And finally, just as @PrezWokeAOC was about to announce its reelection campaign (#AOKwithAOC), society progressed to its current more-perfect union: we realized that elections themselves were triggers. And besides, by then President AOC had already Marie Kondo-ed the West Wing, so she might as well reside there indefinitely.
Looking back, we are embarrassed for not realizing how wrong it was to separate candidates into “winners” and “losers,” based on the number of “votes” they received. We should have known to be more self-validating than that. The current system of a participation trophy for every candidate is, of course, correct. So long as the trophy depicts a publicly breastfeeding un-man.
Pat snapped back from its daydream. It was time to crank up the windmill, charge his scooter, and spend another day apologizing, correctly, for its white, F.K.A. male privilege.

Why Does Congress Keep Getting Global Warming Wrong?,spectator.org,Brian McNicoll,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/why-does-congress-keep-getting-global-warming-wrong/,"Another was Jeffrey Sachs, a professor at Columbia University, who touted threats of catastrophic increases in sea level , even though the rate of sea level rise is lower for the 2000s than it was in the 1900s .
The fourth was Michael Oppenheimer, who has made his career on global warming activism . He is a professor of Geosciences and International Affairs at Princeton and director of its Science, Technology and Environmental Policy program.
Oppenheimer worked for more than two decades at the Environmental Defense Fund , a non-governmental, environmental organization that specializes in environmental advocacy. In other words, basically a hired activist whose specialty is attempting to silence dissenting views.
He told the panel “the clear message scientists are trying to deliver has been obfuscated by a noxious miasma of contrarianism” and sketched the difference between “rational skeptics, those conversant with the scientific literature who can be convinced by evidence” and “the obdurate, uninformed skeptics whose ideas about climate change never or rarely are found on the pages of a peer-reviewed journal.”
He was a co-founder of the Climate Action Network, a far-left group of 1,100 organizations that represented the anti-dissent movement to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, from which President Trump withdrew the United States in 2017.
He has co-authored three papers with Naomi Oreskes , a professor of the history of science whose claim to fame is a book that accused oil companies of mounting disinformation campaigns and insisted all dissent from the global warming oligarchy be quashed.
He has appeared in a documentary with Bill McKibben and other climate extremists. He fought sensible infrastructure improvements, such as the Keystone XL pipeline. He even opposed the naming of a Democrat, former Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, to a congressional energy panel because he judged her too close to the industry.
He also has it in for ExxonMobil . He is part of the group that joined with the Union of Concerned Scientists — a membership organization anyone can join by paying the fee, regardless of scientific education or training — and 100 other “scientists” who urged the attorney general of New York to investigate whether energy companies “knew” that burning fossil fuels caused climate change “and that impacts will intensify until emissions are reduced.”
“New Yorkers deserve to know what role ExxonMobil and other firms played in misleading investors, policymakers and the public about the facts,” he says in the press release.
This is raw intimidation, a gotcha campaign against a successful company precisely because that company spent the money to do the research to determine to what extent global warming was a problem.
The research on global warming shows that temperatures have risen about 1.2 degrees F since 1880 ( and basically none in the last 22 years ), that the decade of the 1930s is the hottest since record-keeping began , that carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere is not a reliable indicator of heat and that extreme weather events — hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, blizzards, etc. — are no more frequent or severe now than at any time since weather records have been even remotely reliable.
Oppenheimer talks about “the facts.” The facts are he is an attack dog whose insults are not backed by the research. He is defending people who predicted there would be no ice on the poles by now and that New York City would be under water by 2000 and Miami by 2015.
The question is how can someone who makes his living fearmongering about energy end up testifying before a congressional committee. And the answer is that no one in the majority wants the real answers either."
Alienated Americans: Whither the American Dream?,spectator.org,G. Tracy Mehan III,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/alienated-americans-whither-the-american-dream/,"How small, of all that human hearts endure, That part which laws or kings can cause our cure. — Samuel Johnson
Donald Trump’s electoral victory in 2016 has generated a veritable industry of academic research and commentary about the “white working class” and the issues and concerns that caused them to respond so enthusiastically to his claim that “the American Dream is dead.”
Globalization, deindustrialization, income inequality and stagnation, racism and the loss of “white privilege” have all been named as the usual suspects.
In Alienated America: Why Some Places Thrive While Others Collapse , Timothy P. Carney posits this thesis: “Alienation is the disease of working-class America. Its most important accompaniment is family collapse. Strong families are the necessary condition of the good life, of economic mobility, and of the American Dream. The story of Election 2016, the story of working-class struggle in America, the story of rising suicides and crumbling families, and the story of growing inequality and falling economic mobility, is properly understood as the story of the dissolution of civil society.”
Building on the work of Robert Nisbet ( The Quest for Community, 1953), Robert Putnam ( Bowling Alone, 2001), and Charles Murray ( Coming Apart, 2012), Carney aims to discern the root cause of this alienation through an analysis, not just of the sociological and economic literature, but also the 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses, as opposed to the general election in which most conservative-leaning voters cast their ballots for Trump. This approach yields a more granular understanding of behaviors by these alienated GOP voters who, it turns out, are not buffered by strong family or religious institutions.
While recognizing, say, the trauma of a plant closing to a community, he argues that “Half the problems we think of as problems of poverty are problems of eroded civil society.” This results in a litany of dysfunctions seen in places such as the Rust Belt and Appalachia:
Deaths of despair, such as suicide, overdose, and alcohol poisoning. Men dropping out of the entire labor force, and out of society altogether. A retreat from marriage, and births out of wedlock becoming the norm Life spans shortening. Inequality skyrocketing. Economic mobility fading.
Tim Carney maintains that marriage and religious practice and institutions are the key for working-class happiness. Wealthy people, as Murray documented previously, seemed to have recognized the importance, or at least the utility of family integrity and marriage. Moreover, “college-educated Americans ages thirty-six to fifty are 50 percent more likely than their non-college educated peers to attend religious services.” For poorer Americans, the loss of these elements of civil society has been disastrous.
“It would be hyperbole to say marriage is now dead,” writes Carney. “But it’s not debatable that the mid-century norm of marriage is now dead.” About 40 percent of all births are out of wedlock. Given that so many of these children live in single-parent, female-headed households, their economic future is bleak.
The American Dream is dead only where community, families, and churches are weak or nonexistent. It was non-religious voters in the GOP primary in places such as Buchanan County, Virginia, coal country, that voted for Donald Trump. In counties in west Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin, with strong families and active (Dutch) Reformed and Lutheran Churches, primary voters who did not break for Trump. Nor did Mormon Utah. “In the early GOP primaries,” says Carney, “Trump did twice as well among Republicans who never went to church as he did among Republicans who go to church the most often.”
Not only do Reform, Lutheran and Mormon voters attend religious services regularly, but they actively participate in family and community life. It seems to be a package deal if the usual measures of social capital are accurate.
Again, this analysis only applies to the primary election in 2016. In the general election, “Anybody but Hillary” prevailed in the general.
Looking for solutions to these problems is not easy since they “are precisely the sort of thing that cannot be solved or even significantly ameliorated by any president or by the central government at all.” Indeed, growing centralization and expansion of government social programs has a “crowding out” effect on civil society functionality, says Carney. This leads to greater atomization of individuals alienated from family and community. The hyper-individualism of the Sexual Revolution has not helped either. All these factors contribute to further deterioration of the social fabric.
“When the solution is twenty thousand towns each taking steps to revitalize their community and one million little platoons forming and deploying on their little patches, it is not possible or productive to write the typical ‘solutions’ section,” according to the author. So go to church, start a T-ball team. Spend less time watching cable and more time asking after your neighbors.
Labor unions could be reinvigorated as unemployment insurance systems. Parents should be given more control over local schools, and government should be supporting religion as a pillar of civil society instead of being a drag on it.
“The mind-set that religion ought to be a private concern, hidden behind church doors or bedroom doors, is directly antithetical to the fact of churches, synagogues, and mosques are civil society institutions,” argues Carney. “Recall the American Civil Liberties Union’s lawsuit to force Catholic hospitals to perform abortions. It’s a statement that you can’t be Catholic and a hospital.”
Without using the term, Tim Carney seems to like walkable New Urbanism designs to encourage community interaction. More controversially, he believes the tax deduction for mortgage interest should be eliminated because it does not really lead to more home ownership but actually drives up prices and leads people to buy larger homes. “More expensive homes and bigger homes are a recipe for eroding community” and makes it harder to start families and constitute neighborhoods.
Alienated America may understate the economic and cultural impacts of globalization and lax immigration policies on the plight of the working class (see Victor David Hanson on those points). Nevertheless, it makes a compelling case for something we can only work and pray for, a Third Great Awakening as to the importance of religion, marriage, family and community to reclaim the American Dream for all.

‘Did Islam Have Anything to Do With It?’,spectator.org,Larry Alex Taunton,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/i-visited-13-sites-of-islamic-terrorist-attacks-and-asked-witnesses-the-same-question-did-islam-have-anything-to-do-with-it/,"‘Did Islam Have Anything to Do With It?’ I visited 13 sites of Islamic terrorist attacks and asked witnesses that one question. In Nice, France, a patrol after the terrorist attack that killed 86. (bellena/Shutterstock.com) Top Stories by G. Tracy Mehan III
O n April 7, 2017, in Stockholm, Sweden, Rakhmat Akilov, a Muslim immigrant and asylum-seeker, stole a beer truck in the heart of the city’s shopping district. Did he have a keg party in mind? No. Alcohol is forbidden in Islam. The killing of “infidels,” however, is not, and that is precisely what Akilov had in mind. Circling the block, he careened down a fashionable pedestrian lane. Before the rampage ended, five people were dead and 14 others injured.
A few weeks later, I walked from my hotel to the street in question. There was little to signal an unknowing visitor to this place that anything out of the ordinary had ever happened here. It was all so normal, so business as usual. Sitting at a sidewalk café, I tried to imagine the scene unfolding before me. With so many window shoppers and cyclists on this strip, it wasn’t difficult to picture the terror at the too-late realization that the truck bearing down on them had no intention of stopping.
My coffee finished, I walked the length of the street from where the carnage began to the corner window of the Åhléns department store where it ended. Plywood took the place of glass and people covered it with Post-it Note messages, turning it into an extemporized memorial. Some of the notes were nonsensical. Others spoke vaguely of “love conquering” or “love winning.” What that means in the context of a terrorist attack is not clear. Still others, however, identified the source of the problem: “Leave Islam,” declares just such a note.
But they mostly don’t get it.
Reversing course, I headed back up the street and went to several businesses along the terrorist’s bloody route asking shop owners and their employees what, if anything, they saw of the attack on that awful day. One said he was on vacation. Another told me (nervously) he was in a back office and saw nothing. One woman just shrugged.
Then I met Lily.
Lily is a twentysomething who works the counter at a cosmetics boutique. At the time that I walked in, we were the only two people in the store. Her blond hair framed a striking Nordic face and pale blue eyes. She might have been a poster for a Swedish vacation or a member of Abba.
Then I asked about the attack.
The customer service veneer immediately evaporated and was replaced by a deep pathos. Such a look, indescribable really, seemed incongruous with such a lovely face and on one so young. In impeccable English, she described the horror of that day.
Lily was upstairs with a customer when she heard tumult from the street below. Turning to look out of the window, she saw the truck driving down the lane at high speed. Some people were running; others were motionless. As the truck passed only feet from where she stood, she saw, behind it, the broken form of a boy lying in the street. A woman was kneeling over the child when a man sprinted in, swept up the boy in his arms, and disappeared into a side alley. A father? A bystander? Lily didn’t know.
The women hurried downstairs. A young intern who worked on the ground floor was hysterical. “She had seen a lot more than I had. Crushed bodies and blood. It was unimaginable.” The four of them locked themselves in a tiny bathroom behind the counter. They called the police and waited fearfully, listening, hoping for salvation. Two and a half hours later there was a knock on the storefront glass. The women cracked the bathroom door just enough to see a man in a black uniform, black body armor, and carrying an automatic weapon.
They closed the door abruptly and locked it again. Was he one of the good guys or a terrorist? They didn’t know and chose to stay put. Calling the police again they described the intimidating figure and were told to let him in. Cautiously they abandoned their refuge.
“We didn’t trust him,” Lily said.
“Why?” I asked.
“He looked pale, terrified,” she said. “He was very young. I had no confidence that he could protect us.”
But that day’s terror was over. She thinks about it a lot. “People can be so evil,” she observed thoughtfully. “The man [who did it] was married and had children, yet he targeted women and children. Why would he do that?”
The answer seemed obvious to me. I offered a clue: “Do you think his religion had anything to do with the attack, Lily?”
To this point, she spoke freely, passionately, articulately. But not now. Now her response seemed like a statement prepared by the European Union’s Strategic Committee on Immigration, Frontiers, and Asylum (SCIFA): “Not for me,” she said somewhat nervously. “I don’t think religion is like that. For him maybe, but not for me.”
Shortly after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, I was granted a special pass to enter the perimeter of cordoned off blocks within which the World Trade Center towers had formerly stood. Standing atop FDNY Ten House, the home of Engine 10 – Ladder 10, the men of that station described what happened and what was now taking place in the rubble below. An unnatural smell still hung over these 16 acres like the pall of death. The impression that day, that moment, left on me was profound and enduring.
Since that time, I have visited the sites of many other Islamic terrorist attacks: The Madrid Train Station, site of a bombing that killed 193 and injured 2,000 others. (2004) I was in London in July 2005, when the 7/7 bombers struck, killing 52 and injuring 784. Toulouse, where a gunman carried out a series of attacks. Six were killed and 5 injured. (2005) Recently, I was in Paris and visited the former offices of Charlie Hebdo (12 killed, 11 injured), the Bataclan (90 killed, 413 injured), and the Hypercacher kosher supermarket (17 dead, 22 injured), places where people were machine-gunned. (2015) Nice (2016), 86 killed and 434 injured. Westminster Bridge in London, in the shadow of Parliament, a man drove a van into a crowd and stabbed a police officer. Five were fatally wounded and 50 more injured. (2017) London Bridge, a repeat of the Westminster Bridge attack ten weeks before, 8 were killed and 48 wounded. Barcelona, where bombs, automobiles, and knives were used to kill 13 and injure 130 others. And, finally, Jos, Nigeria, where I went in 2017 at the invitation of the Bishop of Bukuru to see firsthand the persecution they are continually suffering at the hands of the Boko Haram and the Fulani Herdsmen Militia who have killed untold thousands of people in that country.
This is not an exhaustive list of terrorist attack sites; they are just the ones I have personally visited. In each place on my macabre tour, I asked people the same question I asked Lily:
“Do you think his [or their] religion had anything to do with the attack?”
With the exception of the New York firemen, London taxi drivers (who don’t give a damn what anyone thinks of their opinions), and the Nigerian Christians, the answers were always the same as Lily’s. Islam, they have been told again and again, is a religion of peace, and they were simply unwilling — or unable — to acknowledge the obvious.
To put this in some perspective, were I to ask any educated person what inspired kamikazes, the suicide bombers of the previous century, to fly their planes into American ships during the Second World War, they would undoubtedly say Emperor worship and the militarism of Imperial Japan. So why the inability to make the connection between terrorism and Islam?
In post-Christian Europe, where Rousseau’s view of human nature (i.e., we are born good) has replaced the biblical view (i.e., we are born corrupt); evil is understood to be merely a religious construct; and secularism is not only the de facto paradigm but an entrenched ideology, few Europeans have the intellectual framework to understand an absolutist religion like Islam. In the secular mindset this life is all you get, and almost nothing is worth dying for, certainly not religion. Consequently, those answering my question either responded with puzzled looks as if the question itself had no meaning, or they dismissed the attacks as the irrational acts of the mentally disturbed. That they might have been inspired by an ideology deeply at odds with traditional Western ideals and rooted in a belief in eternity simply didn’t enter into the discussion. The terrorists just had to be crazy or poor or disenfranchised. The things they did were somehow our fault, provoked by our racism or imperialism or failure to assimilate them. Better dialogue and mutual understanding will overcome.
It won’t.
Some will object that I am demonizing all Muslims. I am not. My point is not that all Muslims are terrorists or would-be terrorists. It is, rather, that their religion has a disproportionate number of adherents who believe the words of Surah 8:39 are absolute truth and their duty to fulfill, violently and at the cost of their lives if need be:
“And fight them until there is no fitnah [i.e., worship in anything other than Allah] and until the religion, all of it, is for Allah.”
In her answer, Lily — so bright, so wounded and victimized by the events of the April 7, 2017 Muslim terrorist attack in Stockholm — revealed that whatever she has learned about human nature and its capacity for evil, she had not learned the most obvious lesson of all: that some religions and some philosophies exacerbate that evil and give justification to it.
In this, however, Lily is not alone. It is the answer almost everyone gives to my question. Unfortunately, it is the wrong answer, and until we understand the ideology driving these terrorist attacks, then this terrible history of violence will continue to repeat itself.

Abortion Racism in Pennsylvania,spectator.org,Paul Kengor,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/abortion-racism-in-pennsylvania/,"by Larry Alex Taunton
D emocrats are losing it over abortion. Sure, they’ve long been bad on the issue, but they’re suddenly escalating the vitriol. And by “Democrats,” I’m referring to elected ones. You could always find unhinged “pro-choice” liberals doing vulgar things. Elected Democrats, however, have tended to show a little more restraint. Not anymore.
Look at Gov. Andrew Cuomo in New York or Gov. Ralph Northam in Virginia, the latter of whom generously promises that an infant that survives an abortion will be “ kept comfortable ” amid final gasps without attempts at resuscitation. In Alabama, Democratic state rep. John Rogers accepts abortion with a shrug: “ you kill them now or you kill them later .” Here in Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf is the nation’s first governor who was a Planned Parenthood escort — those macabre volunteers who ensure that distraught girls approaching an abortion facility walk in with cash and walk out without a baby. In fact, here in Pennsylvania, we have not only a governor who was a Planned Parenthood escort but a state rep., Brian Sims, which brings me to the focus of this article.
In a breathtaking spectacle, Sims proudly filmed himself outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Philadelphia — the Locust Street Surgical Center — verbally accosting an older woman who was praying the rosary. For eight painful minutes, this former college football player turned angry LGBTQ activist gives this woman an oral pouncing. He repeatedly tells her she is “shameful” and “disgusting.” “There is nothing Christian about what you’re doing,” he lectures. “There’s nothing loving or kind,” he says of her unlovingly and unkindly. He lambastes her “broken morality.” He asks for her address so people can “protest in front of her home,” as if hounding her there wasn’t sufficient. More must be done, with perhaps a larger and angrier mob.
Sims is a bully, with this woman not his only victim . Watch him in action as he heckles this woman who accepts his abuse stoically in silence. Truly, she turns the other cheek while he torments her.
I’m always amazed by the lack of charity and understanding by self-proclaimed “tolerant” liberals so intransigent that they can’t even concede that pro-lifers are motivated by a benevolent concern at least worthy of respect. They’re so hell-bent on the righteousness of their cause that they assume nothing but malice of their opponents — whose primary objective is simply to try to save defenseless unborn babies. They rage against them. There’s something diabolical about it.
And make no mistake, a spiritual battleground wages at these clinics. I’ve witnessed it. I’ve watched the escorts engage the people praying. A few months ago, on a bitterly cold day, I joined a group outside the Planned Parenthood abortion center in Pittsburgh. Sims’ caricature could not be more inaccurate and viciously unfair. One of those praying told me that the previous week he stood aside an elderly woman who kneeled on a frozen sidewalk on her aching legs while a dude inside strummed a ukulele and grinned at her. “We’re freezing outside in the snow, with 80-year-old women praying and kneeling on payment covered with ice,” he told me, “and they’re inside, staying warm, and mocking us. You could feel the evil.”
The pro-lifers, particularly those from churches, are almost always a model of charity, sacrifice, mortification. Moreover, it’s the pro-lifers, not the clinic workers or Planned Parenthood volunteers, that are there to comfort the crushed girl as she leaves the clinic and prepares for a life of emotional, spiritual, and possibly physical trauma because of what the abortion advocates did to her inside.
Sims’ nasty charges are wrong on so many fronts, but I want to underscore his most outrageous accusation against pro-lifers, namely: the “ BLATANT RACISM they spew .” He leveled that surreal charge repeatedly in his video. This “old white lady,” he says of her dismissively, as if that label merits automatic denigration, is “extremely racist.” He accuses her of a “racist act of judgment.”
What in the world is Sims talking about?
If you’re looking to affix racism, you would be far more justified looking in the direction not of those defending the unborn babies but those terminating them. There’s far and away a disproportionate number of unborn African-American children killed by abortion. The escorts guide in and funnel their mothers. As Dan Flynn noted here , Sims’ wild claim has great irony given that Planned Parenthood is the spawn of Margaret Sanger, who I’ve written about frequently , including her work with the “Negro Project,” her gospel of “race improvement,” her May 1926 speech to the Silverlake, New Jersey chapter of the KKK.
The vast majority of Planned Parenthood clinics are located near African-American populations. The infamous Gosnell “House of Horrors,” a sick slaughterhouse of unborn black children, resided just down the street from where Sims engaged in his antics accusing pro-lifers of racism. It’s downright stunning that Sims either cannot see that or, in turn, casts the finger of racist shame in the complete opposite direction.
Well, given Sims’ claims to be worried about racism, and given that he’s a Pennsylvania legislator, I ask him this simple request as a fellow Pennsylvanian: Could he please ask that clinic for data on how many of its abortions have been of minority babies?
I asked that question of an analyst who does research on this issue in Pennsylvania.
“Unfortunately, we don’t have a breakdown for that particular clinic, or for just Planned Parenthood on how many patients are African-American,” she told me. “Here are some statistics we do have statewide.”
According to the latest abortion statistics from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, in 2017 there were 30,011 abortions performed in Pennsylvania. Among them, 14,726 were to white women, 12,865 were to African-American women (43%), and 3,038 were to Hispanic women (10%).
Thus, 53%, or a majority of abortions, were of minority women and unborn babies. Even more remarkable is the sheer disproportionately: only 11.9% of Pennsylvania women are black and 7.3% are Hispanic . Pennsylvania is 82% white. Abortion in Pennsylvania, like everywhere else in America, victimizes minorities by leaps and bounds.
If abortion was a person, it would wear a white hood as the deadliest klansman in this nation’s history.
And who’s leading the assault? Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood performs half of the abortions in the state of Pennsylvania. It operates nine of the 12 largest abortion clinics in the state. The facility where Sims harangued that woman is the largest in the city of Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the fifth largest city in America. (The state’s second largest city, Pittsburgh, is 65 th . Philly is the epicenter of abortion in Pennsylvania.)
And who does Brian Sims finger as the bad actor in all this? The “racist”? He points to the likes of the woman outside the clinic praying to God that this industry of death will stop — that this “black genocide,” as Dr. Alveda King calls it, will end. He says “shame” on her . She’s the one he finds “disgusting.”
And finally, aside from the race issue, that particular clinic that Sims stood in solidarity with isn’t good for women of any ethnicity. That Locust Street facility is guilty of many violations against the women whose babies it has ripped from their wombs. It has been cited for numerous code violations , failing over half of its last 23 patient-safety inspections. And yet, it has never been shut down.
Now that’s shameful and disgusting, Rep. Sims.
In fact, maybe we should be grateful to Sims. In bringing national attention to himself, he’s bringing national attention to this clinic and this scandal of abortion racism. "
I Miss My Mom Something Fierce,spectator.org,Ben Stein,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/i-miss-my-mom-something-fierce/,"I Miss My Mom Something Fierce She even fought Communists for me. by Larry Alex Taunton
W hen I was a junior in Montgomery Blair High School, my teacher, Mrs. F., asked us if we thought America lived up to its promises by having so much of a struggle over integrating the schools. (Remember this was 1961.) I raised my hand and said, “That’s the kind of question a Communist would ask.”
Little did I know that Mrs. F. had been a card-carrying Communist and had lost several jobs over it. I was just trying to have a conversation.
Mrs. F. sent me to the Vice-Principal’s office and then blackballed me for the Junior Honor Society. My mother raised hell about it and sped the day when Hrs. F. was sent packing. Now, fate being what fate is, Mrs. F. probably kept me from getting into Harvard. I went to Columbia instead and had a fabulous time there, especially with my girlfriend, Mary, and my frat house, Alpha Delta Phi.
I also had the best teachers anyone could ask for, especially C. Lowell Harriss, genius economist, and Milton Friedman, mega-genius who was there on a sabbatical.
That’s not my point. My point is that my mother (and it’s Mother’s Day) knew I would be lonely and homesick and sent me a letter every single day I was at Columbia. That’s devotion. EVERY DAY.
When I graduated from law school, I was the graduation speaker and gave a highly inflammatory speech about how Yale had failed us. In retrospect, I see I was wrong. Yale treated us like kings and queens. My mother went up to the dean, Mr. Pollak, after the ceremony, and said, “Don’t mind anything Benjy says. He’s a born trouble maker.” She was totally right.
That’s devotion of another kind. When Alex and I got married, Mom did not raise one finger in protest that Alex was not Jewish. When Alex and I got divorced (soon to be remarried, by the greatest stroke of luck in history), my mother did not protest either. Instead, she threw herself into helping my girlfriend, Pat, get into one good job after another, then into Library Science School at Catholic U., and then into a super great job at the World Bank.
That’s devotion, too.
In the latter days of my mother’s life, when I visited her and Pop at the Watergate, my mother would follow me down the hall to the elevator, ride down with me to Virginia Avenue, and kiss me goodbye.
My mother left all of her worldly goods to my sister and me. It was not a trivial sum but not millions either and that’s devotion, too.
Mom was far from a perfect, Harriet Nelson, type of Mom. But she was a damned good Mom and she’s been gone now for 22 years and I miss her every hour of every day. How many breakfasts did she make for me without a word of thanks, and how many fine dinners? Now, my wife is an invalid and we get our food at restaurants. But I miss my Mom something fierce. She was Phi Beta Kappa at Barnard and PBK at motherhood, too."
Past Attorney General Went Unpunished for Contempt,spectator.org,Debra J. Saunders,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://spectator.org/past-attorney-general-went-unpunished-for-contempt/,"Past Attorney General Went Unpunished for Contempt Eric Holder got away with it. So why not his successors… by Larry Alex Taunton
Washington
Can Attorney General William Barr thumb his nose at Congress and get away with it? Can the nation’s top lawman refuse to honor a House Judiciary Committee subpoena for an unredacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report and not pay a penalty?
In 2012, then-Attorney General Eric Holder did just that. Holder defied a congressional subpoena to furnish documents about Operation “Fast and Furious,” a program to attempt to trace gun trafficking along the southwest border that went awry. The House held Holder in contempt, but since Holder declined to indict himself, the controversy faded. Holder resigned in 2015.
“Congress can’t enforce their own contempt charges; all they can do is give notice to the attorney general that they would like it enforced, and Eric Holder never enforced it against himself,” observed Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at the Georgetown University Government Affairs Institute. Harkins doesn’t expect Barr to charge himself, either.
Stanford law professor Michael McConnell wrote in the Washington Post about the parallels between Barr and Holder. The Obama administration said disclosing information about executive decision-making would “inhibit the candor” of officials inside the administration. An assistant attorney general falsely told Congress the Obama administration was unaware of Fast and Furious — a claim the administration had to pull back — and Holder said he would provide the subpoenaed documents only if the committee agreed to close the investigation.
Next, as far as Holder was concerned, nothing happened. “The Obama administration ran out the clock. Holder never complied with the subpoena and went unpunished for the contempt,” McConnell wrote.
Harkins says if Congress charges Barr with contempt, “You can easily see the court cases for this lasting more than 18 months.”
Expect an epic legal battle in which Democrats challenge executive privilege and Republicans challenge congressional oversight. In the meantime, both sides can duke it out in the court of public opinion.
Barr Boycotts House Barr did testify last week before the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. He was set to appear before the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee, but then the committee demanded Barr take questions from staff lawyers as well as elected members. Barr balked.
If House Democrats believe having professional lawyers ask questions “would help them do a better job at oversight, that’s Congress’ constitutional prerogative,” said Harkins. “That’s their call. The court of public opinion will ultimately decide.”
While Democrats demanded unredacted versions of the Mueller report, Barr maintained he could not legally release grand jury material, sensitive national security information, information that could affect ongoing investigations, or material that violates the privacy rights of people not central to the special counsel’s investigation.
Barr, however, did forward the committee a less-redacted version of the report.
Press Secretary Sarah Sanders scoffed Monday at House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler’s demand for an unredacted version of the report when “not a single Democrat has yet to go read the less-redacted version of the report,” she said.
Nadler already had rejected Barr’s offer to read the less-redacted version because it applied only to a dozen House members and the deal “would not permit them to discuss it with other Members of Congress who all have top security clearances.”
Fighting Subpoenas The White House resisted House subpoenas on other fronts, too.
On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin again informed the House Ways and Means Committee that he would not hand over Trump’s tax returns from 2013 to 2018, as the request lacks “a legitimate legislative purpose.”
On Tuesday, White House counsel Pat Cipollone invoked executive privilege, as he informed Nadler that the White House and former White House counsel Don McGahn would not honor an April subpoena seeking documents and testimony from McGahn, who is slated to testify before the committee before May 21.
Some legal scholars contend the White House effectively waived executive privilege in allowing McGahn to speak and provide evidence to the special counsel so that the administration now cannot claim executive privilege to prevent McGahn from testifying to Congress.
But John C. Yoo — a University of California, Berkeley law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel under former President George W. Bush — maintained that since McGahn spoke to the Department of Justice, which is part of the administration, the White House “was just giving the information to itself.”
Even though Trump told reporters in April, “We’re fighting all the subpoenas,” Barr, Cipollone, and Mnuchin have offered to continue negotiating with House Democrats.
To go by the Holder model, Harkins noted, both parties may find “an advantage” in letting the partisan battles percolate in the court system, a process likely to run beyond 2020. Republicans can maintain that the fight is all about Russian collusion “and there wasn’t any,” while Democrats can maintain their cause is to stop the Trump White House from impeding an investigation. Harkins added, “There will be winners and losers.”
