Working in legal marijuana industry could keep immigrants from becoming citizens,www.nbcnews.com,Dennis Romero,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/working-legal-marijuana-industry-could-keep-immigrants-becoming-citizens-n996651,"As the 4/20 weekend kicked off, federal officials issued new guidance for would-be U.S. citizens that says working in the cannabis industry, even in states where the drug has been legalized, could be grounds for rejection during the naturalization process. Observers saw the move on 4/20, the unofficial holiday for cannabis enthusiasts, as a hurdle set up by the Trump administration for newcomers rather than one targeted at the nascent marijuana industry in the more than 30 states that have legalized some form of the drug.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services publicized the new guidance in a statement Friday.
""The policy guidance ... clarifies that an applicant who is involved in certain marijuana-related activities may lack good moral character if found to have violated federal law, even if such activity has been decriminalized under applicable state laws,"" the agency, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, stated.
The fine print of the guidance states that participation in the cannabis industry ""continues to constitute a conditional bar to GMC [good moral character] for naturalization eligibility, even where such activity is not a criminal offense under state law.""
""Possession of marijuana for recreational or medical purposes or employment in the marijuana industry may constitute conduct"" that would prohibit naturalization, the guidance states.

Richard Vogel / AP ""I don’t think this is about marijuana at all,"" said Michael Collins, national affairs director of the Drug Policy Alliance. ""I think this is about them using the war on drugs to go after migrant community and that’s what they’ve been doing since Day 1.""
Collins compared the policy guidance, first reported by Marijuana Moment , to President Donald Trump's insistence on a wall between the United States and Mexico, which the president has said would stop the flow of drugs to the country.
""This administration has used the war on drugs to persecute the migrant community, from building the wall to going after migrants for minor drug offenses ,"" Collins said.
Earlier this month, Colorado attorneys representing two immigrants who work in the legal marijuana industry accused the Trump administration of blocking the naturalization of the pair.

""The Department of Homeland security sees this is another excuse to deport people,"" Collins said. ""To deal with this issue you really need to take marijuana policy out of the hands of the federal government.""

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 20, 2019, 1:54 AM GMT By Associated Press BOSTON — A Massachusetts man who sent threatening letters with white powder to President Donald Trump's sons, Antonio Sabato Jr., Sen. Debbie Stabenow and a law professor was sentenced Friday in federal court to five years of probation. The judge declined to send Daniel Frisiello to prison, as prosecutors had sought, because of concerns the 25-year-old man from Beverly, who is developmentally disabled, would not respond well to incarceration. But he stressed the sentence wasn't ""lenient."" ""Do not underestimate how serious I am treating your crimes,"" Judge Nathaniel Gorton said to Frisiello as the dozens of his family members, friends and supporters who packed the court proceeding hugged, cried and sighed in relief. Booking photo of Daniel Frisiello. Beverly Police Department via Reuters file Frisiello was also ordered to serve his first year of probation in home confinement, and has been banned for the full five years from accessing the internet or sending mail without prior approval. Frisiello also won't be allowed to have a computer, tablet or other device with access to the internet. Frisiello, who pleaded guilty in October to sending the threatening letters, thanked Groton for not imprisoning him. The past year, he said, has been ""hell"" for his family. Frisiello's family, in a statement after the court appearance, said he ""deeply regrets the fear and harm he caused and will work very hard to be a better person and citizen."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Garland, who had sought a three-year prison sentence, argued that Frisiello had carefully considered the letter writing campaign, which included 13 letters over three years. He researched the best addresses and took steps to avoid detection, like dropping them off at different mailboxes, Garland said. ""This was not an impulsive thing,"" he said. ""At every step, there was a chance for deliberation."" Imposing only probation, Garland said, was akin to sending Frisiello back to the life he had before his arrest, which was largely spent at home on the internet. 2018: Massachusetts man charged for white powder hoax letter to Trump Jr. March 1, 2018 01:59 Frisiello's lawyer William Fick argued that prison would be physically and mentally harmful to his client, who he said has significant developmental issues from brain damage at birth, autism and anxiety disorder. Fick also argued probation is appropriately severe for a person with Frisiello's condition because it takes away what few opportunities he has to interact with society, such as going to work or spending time with family and friends outside the house. Acknowledging the nearly 90 letters of support written to the judge on Frisiello's behalf, Fick said it was ""tragic"" no one in his client's extensive support network intervened before his seemingly harmless obsession with writing letters to celebrities and other notable people took a dark turn. ""He clearly felt like he wasn't being heard, so he became threatening,"" Fick said. Prosecutors say Frisiello sent a letter to Donald Trump Jr. that was opened in February by his now-estranged wife, Vanessa, at their New York City home. She called 911 and was briefly hospitalized after she reported she was coughing and felt nauseous. He also sent a white powder letter to Eric Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign that said his father must drop out of the race or the next letter wouldn't be fake. The substance in all of the letters turned out not to be hazardous. Other letter recipients included Stabenow, the Democratic U.S. senator from Michigan; Michele Dauber, a Stanford University law professor who promoted an effort to recall California judge Aaron Persky; and Sabato, a former underwear model and soap opera actor who is running for Congress in California as a Republican and spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Hoaxes involving white powder have been common since anonymous letters laced with anthrax spores were sent to media companies and congressional offices days after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, killing five people and infecting 17 others."

Northern Ireland police arrest two over killing of journalist Lyra McKee,www.nbcnews.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/northern-ireland-police-arrest-two-over-murder-journalist-lyra-mckee-n996656,"LONDON — Police in Northern Ireland on Saturday arrested two teenagers in connection with the fatal shooting of a journalist during rioting in the city of Londonderry. The men, aged 18 and 19, were detained under anti-terrorism legislation and taken to Belfast for questioning, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
The men have not been identified or charged. Police had said earlier there was one gunman who pulled the trigger who had been backed by an ""organization,"" and said they were searching for multiple suspects.
Lyra McKee, 29, was a rising star of investigative journalism. She was shot and killed, probably by a stray bullet aimed at police, during rioting Thursday night.

The use of a firearm apparently aimed at police marks a dangerous escalation in sporadic violence that continues to plague Northern Ireland.
The rioting started after police moved into a housing complex to search for weapons.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said earlier that a gunman fired a number of shots at police during the unrest. Police on Friday night released closed-circuit TV footage showing the man suspected of firing the shots that killed McKee.
The footage shows the police facing a barrage of gasoline bombs before the shots were fired by someone wearing a balaclava to obscure his face.
The killing was condemned by all the major political parties as well as the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland.
Leona O'Neill, a local journalist who was present, wrote on Twitter that she was with McKee when she was hit. She said McKee fell beside a police vehicle Land Rover and officers rushed her to hospital, where she died.
I was standing beside this young woman when she fell beside a police Land Rover tonight in Creggan #Derry .

— Leona O'Neill (@LeonaONeill1) April 18, 2019 McKee had written for publications around the world including The Atlantic and she also edited for California-based news site Mediagazer. Her first book ""The Lost Boys"" was to be released next year, according to literary agency Janklow & Nesbit UK .
She rose to prominence in 2014 with a moving blog post — ""Letter to my 14 year old self"" — describing the struggle of growing up gay in Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. She also had recently signed a contract to write two books.
Heartbroken by the murder of Lyra McKee and the violence in Derry. The challenges in NI today are real--but we cannot let go of the last 21 years of hard-won peace and progress. This tragedy is a reminder of how much everyone has to lose if we do.
— Bill Clinton (@BillClinton) April 19, 2019 Her partner, Sara Canning, told a vigil Friday that McKee's amazing potential had been snuffed out.
Canning said the senseless murder ""has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with.""
""It has left so many friends without their confidante,"" she added.

"Congo's Ebola response threatened by conspiracy theories, rumors",www.nbcnews.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/congo-s-ebola-response-threatened-conspiracy-theories-rumors-n994156,"People who have contracted Ebola are opting to die at home rather than seek treatment as conspiracy theories fuel distrust of the government and of health workers grappling with the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the workers and aid groups. Nearly 20 new cases of the deadly illness are being identified daily in two northeast provinces of the country. Both areas are opposition strongholds where political tensions run high.
Many of the victims are being discovered outside treatment centers after they refuse to seek help, officials said. The epidemic has left more than 700 dead and affected more than 1,000 people .
Ebola returns as a 'one-word death sentence' in the Democratic Republic of Congo Dec. 19, 2018 02:42 In addition to combating a lethal virus, health workers are having to dispel rumors that the disease is manufactured and that the millions of dollars spent on the response are part of a money-making scheme derisively referred to as the “Ebola business.”
""We have lost the trust of the community,"" Tariq Riebl of the nonprofit International Rescue Committee told NBC News from Goma.
A study conducted in September , less than two months into the outbreak, found that 25 percent of people surveyed in the affected areas did not believe Ebola was real, while 36 percent thought it was fabricated to destabilize the region.
“It’s all about money, that we’re getting bonuses for cases we find, that prolonging the response helps the business side,” Riebl said, listing some of the lies that have been spreading among local communities.

She has encountered skepticism about Ebola's existence and origins, and questions about why aid workers take extra precautions when treating it compared to malaria or cholera.
Ebola treatment centers established by the central government in conjunction with international aid groups have been met with suspicion. Designed to isolate and treat suspected cases of Ebola and staffed by health workers wearing bulky “space suits,” the centers come with an increased presence of police and military forces.
Some people in Butembo even believe that ""when you go there they inject you with the disease,"" according to Vahavi, 30, who collects data for a Congolese nonprofit.
Related Health Health 'Perfect storm' of conflict threatens Ebola fight in Congo The Ebola outbreak is also taking place in a part of the country that has suffered regular violence at the hands of armed groups. Health workers have increasingly come under threat, causing further setbacks to the emergency response.
On Friday, the World Health Organization said an Ebola doctor was killed in an attack on Butembo University Hospital.
Hours later attackers armed with machetes tried to burn down another treatment center, the city's deputy mayor said Saturday.
Two centers run by Doctors Without Borders, along with the Ministry of Health, were attacked three days apart in February, forcing health workers to suspend operations.
Speaking after the second attack, Doctors Without Borders President Joanne Liu described the “great hostility” against the Ebola response , adding “the use of security forces and police only deepens the suspicion of those who believe Ebola is being used as a political tool.”
Deeply entrenched opposition to the government in the areas affected by the epidemic means that even the arrival of foreign aid is treated with apprehension.
Red Cross workers carry the coffin of woman who was killed by Ebola in Butembo. Baz Ratner / Reuters ""The government is seen as profoundly untrustworthy,"" said Phil Clark, a political scientist at SOAS University of London.
He described the timing and location of the outbreak as an ""unfortunate coincidence.""
Ebola was confirmed by the World Health Organization on Aug. 1, months before the country was set to head to the polls. Former President Joseph Kabila, who intended to step down after two terms in office, announced in December that he would postpone voting in the Ebola-hit communities to prevent the spread of the disease.
That has triggered rumors that the government was behind the outbreak — either infecting opposition communities with the virus or exaggerating its spread — to allow Kabila's choice of a successor to win at the polls, Clark said.
Related News News Amid concerns of Congo election violence, U.S. deploys troops to Central Africa Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga recently returned from a visit to the affected area of Butembo and told NBC News that ""community mistrust"" had even been fueled by candidates running for office.
""When the outbreak started in August, it was during the electoral period, so unfortunately some local politicians deliberately spread lies to boost popularity ahead of elections,"" he said.
He’s more optimistic now that the elections have taken place, saying that a vaccination campaign — which reached more than 100,000 people in the Ebola-effected region — has been effective.
""Things are improving,” he added.
Aid agencies have also taken unprecedented steps to try to assuage local doubts about the Ebola response, including changing how they conduct burials of the dead.
Eva Erlach, who heads the regional community engagement program for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said the organization has procured transparent body bags for the first time “to show the family that it is actually their loved one that is being buried and it’s not stones or empty coffins.”

Baz Ratner / Reuters The decision was not random, but based on reams of data that IFRC volunteers have collected during home visits with local communities to better understand their concerns. Some 800 volunteers working across eastern Congo have collected over 150,000 comments so far, which are put into a database to share with other organizations on the ground.
“Our role is really to make sure that in anything we’re doing, we are in dialogue with the communities and there is an understanding of what our role is and what is being implemented,” Erlach said.
Riebl, with the International Rescue Committee, said the situation still couldn't be compared to the 2014 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11,000 people in six countries in the region, with cases also popping up overseas.
But he still has his concerns. “Ultimately, if you don't connect with communities it doesn’t matter how efficient the treatment system is,"" Reibl said.

Leah Millis / Reuters file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 20, 2019, 8:23 AM GMT By Reuters SEOUL — North Korea has criticized National Security Adviser John Bolton's ""nonsense"" call for Pyongyang to show that it’s serious about giving up its nuclear weapons, the second time it has criticized a leading U.S. official in less than a week. President Donald Trump has said he is open to a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but Bolton said on Wednesday there first needed to be ""a real indication from North Korea that they've made the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons."" ""Bolton, national security adviser of the White House, in an interview with Bloomberg, showed above himself by saying such a nonsense,"" North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters when asked about his recent comments, the Korean Central News Agency said on Saturday. ""Bolton's remarks make me wonder whether they sprang out of incomprehension of the intentions of the top leaders of the DPRK and the U.S. or whether he was just trying to talk with a certain sense of humor for his part, with its own deviation,"" she said, referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. ""All things considered, his word has no charm in it and he looks dim-sighted to me."" The North Korean vice minister also warned that there would be no good if the United States continued ""to throw away such remarks devoid of discretion and reason"". North Korea said on Thursday it no longer wanted to deal with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and that he should be replaced in talks by someone more mature, hours after it announced its first weapons test since nuclear talks broke down. North Korea tests new tactical guided weapon, state media says April 17, 2019 01:08 Pompeo on Friday rejected the demand, throwing more uncertainty over the possible resumption of stalled talks. The talks have been at an impasse over sanctions since Trump's second summit with Kim ended without any agreement in late February, and the North has warned it may not return to the table without immediate sanctions relief. ""Nothing changed, we're continuing to work. I'm still in charge of the team,"" Pompeo told reporters, insisting that he and his special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun would remain on the job. Kim warned last week that the summit breakdown risked reviving tensions and said he was only interested in meeting Trump again if Washington showed more flexibility. He gave a year-end deadline for a change in attitude. Experts said the North Korean moves appeared aimed at dividing Trump from senior officials in the hope of exacting concessions, particularly relief from punishing sanctions. ""Just as this week’s 'tactical weapon' test was a signal to warn Trump that his much-vaunted 'freeze' is in jeopardy, the verbal attack on Pompeo is meant to encourage Trump to ignore his hardline advisers and make a deal with his 'friend' Kim Jong Un,"" said Daniel Russel, the top U.S diplomat for East Asia until early in Trump's administration. ""As long as the North Koreans believe they can flatter and dupe the U.S. president into making important concessions ... they will resist dealing with less gullible and more demanding subordinate U.S. officials."""
The Mueller report's Facebook section shows people believe what the company lets them see — even Russian propaganda,www.nbcnews.com,Sam Thielman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/mueller-report-s-facebook-section-shows-people-believe-what-company-ncna996396,"How dumb are we, anyway? It’s a real question. There is, of course, an entire industry devoted to the proposition that we’re all absolutely dumb enough to believe obviously skewed representations of the facts. It’s called “advertising” and it’s the only way Facebook breaks even — and it breaks better than even, with gigantic operating margins and huge revenues.
Many detractors of the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election have had a different answer to my question: We're not that dumb — or, at least, certainly not dumb enough to be swayed to vote for Trump by a bunch of stupid memes about a cartoon frog posted on the internet.
 Facebook, Google and other internet platforms are creating a dystopian nightmare. It's time to wake up. The Mueller report lays out a very different view of the American public. Facebook, the social network with more than 2 billion accounts active every month , comprises a full sub-section in the part of report devoted to Russian ""active measures"" on social media — the section about electioneering misdeeds of a hostile foreign government. Facebook apparently lent it an inadvertent helping hand by simply not paying much attention to how its platform was being used from at least 2014 forward.
Since Facebook’s primary revenue stream is not much bothered by fake accounts and fraud — despite its years-long insistence on various versions of a ""real names"" policy to the detriment of many marginalized communities — neither are its executives, for the most part. What the company and its investors primarily fear is regulation, a future with which conservatives enthusiastically threatened them at multiple congressional hearings last year because Facebook had suspended so many of their supporters for hate speech .
Facebook’s thinking seems to be that any of its users can say anything that doesn’t jeopardize their relationships with people who could reasonably sue them — which is pretty much limited to mega-corporate intellectual property holders — and people with the electoral clout to pass laws that could harm their bottom line — namely the conservatives in the House and Senate. Don’t insult those two groups of people, and you can do whatever you want on Facebook.
 Mark Zuckerberg wanted Facebook to change the world. And it has — but not for the better. And people do.
Facebook, in fact, was so used to letting bad actors do anything they didn’t notice Russian phone numbers, IP addresses in St. Petersburg and payment for electioneering ads in rubles during the Russian security service’s ""sweeping and systematic"" interference in the 2016 election, as Mueller puts it. And thus, he writes, through its contractors at a firm called the Internet Research Agency, a “troll farm” owned by billionaire Putin confidant Yevginy Prigozhin — who also runs mercenary army The Wagner Group — the Russian military ran an extended disinformation program on Facebook targeting Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and aiding her opponents, especially Donald Trump. And much of that campaign involved pretending to be people they weren't.
Long-time Facebook users are likely aware of a common variation of this. Multiple times last year, for instance, I got friend requests on Facebook from people with whom I thought I was already friends. At least once, I was unsure whether we were still connected and clicked “confirm request” — and immediately got a message from the “friend” sharing good news about a government program that was doling out cash to the deserving if I would simply provide them with my checking account routing number. Some version of it has been going for years, and Facebook is rarely successful in proactively policing it, relying instead on users to report the fakes accounts once they’ve been scammed.
I am not the only one dumb enough to click “confirm request.” About once a week, some account with an avatar photo of a pouty 20-something woman tries to add me — the current offender, “Angelina M. Barbara,” has lots of publicly visible fashion-plate pictures of herself and a banner photo of a male demon and a female angel in flagrante. At least half the time, these accounts have a “mutual friend” with me. (Yes, the mutual friend who accepted the request is always a man. No, the men are not always single).
This stuff is annoying and potentially extremely inconvenient, though unlikely to be disastrous. But it is also disinformation — information distributed with the intent to deceive, as opposed to misinformation, which is information disseminated in honest error. And if a platform allows disorganized disinformation to proliferate, it is only a matter of time before it will have the organized variety on its hands.
 Forget Facebook, YouTube videos are quietly radicalizing large numbers of people — and the company is profiting Like those of us who have truly believed a pal from high school might really stranded without her wallet at an airport in Belarus and needed to be wired cash immediately, the people who participated in the Russian disinformation program in the United States appear to have done so in good faith. According to the Mueller report, they attended rallies organized by Russian intelligence operators from St. Petersburg, and joined Facebook groups about police violence and gay rights, or border security and patriotism. In one incident so creepy it’s even a little funny, real Facebook users wished troll farm owner Prighozin a happy birthday. “In May 2016, IRA employees, claiming to be U.S. social activists and administrators of Facebook groups,"" Mueller writes ""recruited U.S. persons to hold signs (including one in front of the White House) that read ‘Happy 55th Birthday Dear Boss,’ as an homage to Prigozhin (whose 55th birthday was on June 1, 2016).”
Can you catfish an individual? Everyone knows, in many cases from personal experience, that you can. Can you catfish a whole voting bloc? After the Mueller report, the more pressing question is: Who will stop you?

Probably the freest person in the world,"" Chad Elwartowski posted on his Facebook days before the Thai navy raided his floating home. A photo provided by the Royal Thai Navy shows the floating home lived in by American Chad Elwartowski and his Thai partner in the Andaman Sea, off Phuket island, Thailand. AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 20, 2019, 9:23 AM GMT By Reuters BANGKOK — The Thai navy on Saturday boarded the floating cabin of a fugitive U.S. bitcoin trader and his Thai girlfriend, both prominent members of the ""seasteading"" movement who possibly face the death sentence for setting up their offshore home. Thai authorities have revoked the visa of American citizen Chad Elwartowski and have charged him and his partner, Supranee Thepdet, with violating Thai sovereignty by raising a small cabin on top of a weighted spar 14 nautical miles off the west-coast of the Thai island of Phuket — a popular holiday destination. The cabin has been promoted as ""the world's first seastead"" by the group Ocean Builders, part of a movement in tech and libertarian circles to build floating communities beyond the bounds of nations as a way to explore alternative societies and governments. ""I was free for a moment. Probably the freest person in the world,"" Elwartowski posted on his Facebook on April 13, days before the Thai navy raided his floating home. Elwartowski, 46, and Supranee, whose Facebook page describes her as a ""Bitcoin expert, Trader, Chef, seastead Pioneer,"" apparently fled after a surveillance plane flew over the cabin the previous day. The Royal Thai Navy task force had planned on Saturday to seize the structure and tow it back to shore for use as evidence, but by the afternoon it was still studying how to move it without destroying it, the navy said. In a video posted last month detailing the raising of the floating home, Elwartowski said 20 more similar houses would be up for sale to form a community. Elwartowski and Ocean Builders say the spar was in international waters and beyond Thailand's jurisdiction. Thai authorities say the structure is in its 200-mile exclusive economic zone and therefore a violation of its sovereignty. The navy said they have evidence that the floating home was built in a private boatyard in Phuket and said the couple wanted to establish a ""permanent settlement at sea beyond the sovereignty of nations by using a legal loophole"". It said the action ""reveals the intention of disobeying the laws of Thailand as a littoral state and could lead to a creation of a new state within Thailand's territorial waters... undermining Thailand's national security as well as economic and social interests of maritime nations."" In an email reply to Reuters, Elwartowski referred all questions to the Seasteading Institute and pointed to online statements from the Ocean Builders website. The group said that the pair, both active bitcoin investors, did not build, invest in or design the floating home themselves but were ""volunteers excited about the prospect of living free,"" documenting their lives as ""pioneer seasteaders"" off the coast of Phuket.

Why alien 'megastructures' may hold key to making contact with extraterrestrials,www.nbcnews.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/why-alien-megastructures-may-hold-key-making-contact-extraterrestrials-ncna994996,"If you’re trying to come up with the best game plan for proving the existence of extraterrestrials, you’ve got plenty of options. Naturally, you want a strategy with a high chance of success, simply in the interests of time, money and a shot at the Nobel Prize. For nearly 70 years the scheme favored by most scientists has been to look for signals — radio transmissions . That’s the classic approach of SETI (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence), and frankly, it makes sense. Radio can easily traverse light-years, and the technology for detecting it is well known and highly sensitive.
But is looking for signals really the best plan? Is it possible that we’re making the wrong bet?
There’s an attractive alternative: searching for physical artifacts — alien structures . We’re not talking about crop circles or other odd phenomena here on Earth. We’re talking about massive engineering works that an advanced society has constructed somewhere in space.
Why search for artifacts? Because it eliminates the requirement that the aliens have chosen to get in touch — to transmit radio signals our way. Sure, maybe they’d want to do that, but then again maybe they’d rather lay low. If you’re not sure you’re the Milky Way’s top-dog society, you don’t want to bet the farm by assuming that the alpha aliens, wherever they might be, have good intentions. Silence could have survival value.
There’s another point: Picking up an alien civilization’s transmissions requires that the signal reach your telescope at the very moment that you’re pointing it in their direction. This is SETI’s well-known “synchronicity” problem, and it’s been likened to firing a bullet and expecting that it will intercept, head-on, another bullet shot by someone else. Improbable.
Related Space Space NASA scientist says space alien search should be more 'aggressive' In nearly every radio SETI experiment, the amount of time spent listening at any given frequency is but a few minutes. The universe has been around for nearly ten thousand trillion minutes, so SETI efforts are a bit like stepping into the backyard hoping you’re just in time to catch a raccoon stealing the cat food.
Of course, you can believe the aliens have some good reason to spend lots of time transmitting to Earth, but if they’re even a short distance away (astronomically speaking), they won’t know we’re here — there hasn’t been enough time for our radar and television signals to reach them yet, even at the speed of light .
In contrast, artifacts may be lurking in space just waiting our discovery, all night, every night. China’s Great Wall and the Egyptian pyramids are earthly constructions that have existed for centuries. Finding them doesn’t demand much synchronicity.
Have we found any alien megastructures? In 2015, astronomer Tabetha Boyajian and her colleagues reported on a star 1,400 light-years away that occasionally dimmed . Actually, it dimmed a lot, and this wasn’t normal stellar behavior.
One explanation was that the star was surrounded by a Dyson sphere . The idea, proposed years ago by physicist Freeman Dyson, is that really advanced aliens would construct a gargantuan, spherical swarm of solar panels in orbit beyond their own planet — sort of the way you might cup your hands around a candle to collect the heat. The swarm would gather enough starlight to energize the aliens’ souped-up lifestyles, and could sometimes get in the way of light from the star, causing it to intermittently dim as seen from afar.
That explanation for Tabby’s star seems less likely today. Astronomical measurements show that it gets redder when it dims, suggesting that it’s surrounded by naturally produced dust, not a gargantuan group of light collectors.
But it’s reasonable to believe that Dyson spheres exist somewhere. In the past, astronomers looked for clues to such massive engineering projects by trawling star catalogs for systems that show an excess of infrared light — produced by the warm backside of the panels. Another approach is to comb through data from the European Space Agency’s Gaia space telescope to find stars whose light is fainter than expected, simply because their shine is partially, and constantly, blocked by a bunch of panels.
Recently, University of Chicago physicist Daniel Hooper offered a new idea for searching for high-tech alien artifacts. He notes that the universe is expanding, and galaxies are growing ever farther apart. So forward-thinking alien societies might want to grab stars from nearby galaxies while they can and park them in their cosmic neighborhoods as a hedge against future energy scarcity. This is akin to storing gasoline if you’re worried about a developing shortage. If collections of corralled stars do exist, they’d be easy to spot in the course of mainstream astronomy research.
Looking for extraterrestrial signals has a venerable history and no doubt a promising future. But a search for structures accumulated during the many billions of years of cosmic time might give someone a leg up on that Nobel.
Yes, efforts to find Dyson spheres have come up empty. And we haven’t found any stellar stockpiles either. But tomorrow could be different.

"Call it weed, marijuana or cannabis: 420 is a time to celebrate the growing acceptance of its healing pleasures",www.nbcnews.com,Simon Moya-Smith,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/call-it-weed-marijuana-or-cannabis-420-time-celebrate-growing-ncna996591,"I’m 35, so I remember the days when teachers and parents would say things like Pot will rot your mind! Well, my mind is quick and quite sharp, and I have not walked through a gateway and into addiction to another drug just because I enjoy a joint now and again. That’s why, like many people, I’ll be participating in April 20, better known as 4/20 — a massive, worldwide celebration of weed culture, freedom and (let’s be honest here) food. And if you unfortunately suffer from cancer (hopefully you recover quickly), according to the clinical research, this medicine — not “drug” mind you — will help inspire that appetite and prompt deep, peaceful sleep.
The term 420, which is most often attributed to police codes, actually began in 1971 in Marin County, California, when five San Rafael High School pals who enjoyed pot would meet after class at 4:20p.m. by a statute of chemist Louis Pasteur. One of the guys became a roadie with a member of the band Grateful Dead, who caught wind of the code word created by the one-time students, and the rest, they say, is history.
 Jay Chandrasekhar: The racist origins of marijuana laws still affect how they are enforced today April 20, then, is the annual day of the year when cannabis enthusiasts light up, nibble an edible, laugh, eat, light up again, relax and perhaps listen to some Carlos Santana or TOOL — or maybe that’s just me — often in public places, like Civic Park in Denver, which has hosted an annual event since at least 2006 , long before weed was legal in the state.
But if the sight of thousands of people congregating in a public place to smoke weed and listen to music doesn’t tick off the conservative anti-marijuana jackals, the reality that more states are welcoming weed with open arms certainly gets them fuming.
Take former Attorney General Jeff Sessions — who was fired by President Donald J. Trump late last year: He has regularly opined that marijuana will “destroy your life.”
 For legal marijuana to thrive in the Trump era, Congress must legalize it “I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,” he said . “And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana — so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another that’s only slightly less awful.”
South Carolina’s Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel recently said that nothing else had “the potential to change South Carolina in a negative way” the way medical marijuana does. Connecticut Republicans inveighed against legalization earlier this year. And the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas continues to fight even decriminalization by claiming that “marijuana lowers IQ scores, increases criminality, has no medical use when smoked, and is addictive,” against scientific evidence.
 Marijuana legalization must make War on Drugs' victims whole before companies profit But, much to chagrin of the naysayers and fear mongers, it’s only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized at the federal level.
Currently, more than 10 states, including Washington, D.C., have passed laws legalizing recreational use of weed and that number looks to grow — or bud or bloom.
In Wisconsin , advocates and lawmakers there are working to fully legalize cannabis, both recreationally and medicinally. In Idaho , there’s a push to get medicinal marijuana on the ballot in 2020. New York is finally examining full legalization (though it failed this year ), a ballot initiative is pending in Ohio and even Texas’ Republican Party has backed decriminalization initiatives .
What’s prompting these moves by lawmakers and citizens to decriminalize, legalize and approve medical marijuana isn’t only the booming weed industry, which brings in millions of dollars to states every year. (In 2018, the State of Colorado received $200 million in tax revenue from marijuana sales alone.) There’s also a wave of clinical research coming in that demonstrates the medicinal benefits of cannabis for those who suffer often debilitating maladies.
A new study in Minnesota found cancer patients benefited significantly from consuming cannabis. The benefits include increased appetite, decreased fatigue, less pain, a reduction in nausea and vomiting and far better sleep.
“It is encouraging to see this evidence that Minnesota’s medical cannabis program is helping cancer patients,” Jan Malcolm, state Health Commissioner, said following the release of the research.
 Elon Musk trying marijuana isn't shocking, but our hypocritical response to it should be Yet there are still those who continue to demonize the plant and ignore the incontrovertible medical benefits of cannabis. Most of it focuses on usage among children (which no one is advocating) and the effects on a small percentage of heavy users (though few still support alcohol prohibitions despite its deleterious effects on a small percentage of heavy users).
True, there is empirical research demonstrating that daily smoking of potent weed can lead to a higher risk of psychosis. But weed is just like any other intoxicant, from alcohol to caffeine: It must be used responsibly and moderately and by adults and the potential for misuse by a few people doesn’t justify the criminalization of a substance for everyone.
The pros of decriminalizing marijuana — medical access, the end of disproportionate policy against minority populations, regulation of quality and taxation — clearly outweigh the cons, even if dotty, anti-weed apologists continue to claim that marijuana is “a gateway drug.”
But if marijuana is a gateway to anything it’s a gateway to a better quality of life for those who just want to eat, sleep, and feel better again. There’s a rush of research that says cannabis is good for you in moderation, we should pay close attention and listen to the science, the scientists and the patients, not the sourpuss pessimists and prohibitionists. Especially not on 420.

"One year after Easter pardons, Cambodian refugees find fragile stability",www.nbcnews.com,Agnes Constante,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/one-year-after-easter-pardons-cambodian-refugees-find-fragile-stability-n995981,"LOS ANGELES — Sokha Chhan was relieved when he learned that he was granted a pardon from then-California Gov. Jerry Brown last year. He had come to the United States from Cambodia as a war refugee about four decades ago, but faced possible deportation to the country that he barely remembered after being convicted of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant and threatening a crime in 2002, for which he served about a year in prison. He was happy to know he would be able to stay with his community in Northern California.
“Even though it’s my birth country, it’s like going back to a foreign country with no family or friends,” Chhan, 50, told NBC News. “That’s why I’m happy I get to stay here with my children and my family.”
Chhan was one of two Cambodian nationals who came to the U.S. as refugees at risk of deportation who received gubernatorial pardons from Brown the Friday before Easter last year. The other was Phann Pheach, 36, a Southern California resident.
Related News News 'I can't find any peace here': Raised in the U.S. and deported to Cambodia, refugees struggle to build a new life While a pardon doesn't eliminate a conviction in California , it restores certain rights convicts lose, such as the right to serve on a jury. For immigrants facing deportation because of a criminal conviction, a pardon does not necessarily invalidate a deportation order, but it can help reopen an immigration case.
Chhan’s pardon hasn't completely eliminated the threat of deportation that's loomed over his life for more than a decade. His attorney, Raha Jorjani from the Alameda County Public Defender's Office, said the pardon will help his case because it will show an immigration judge he's been rehabilitated. But it doesn't eliminate the criminal ground of deportability on which Chhan is being charged.
""The thing that stands out about this story and Sokha’s pardon is that immigration laws are so draconian and unreasonable that even a governor’s pardon is not enough to eliminate immigration consequences,” she said. “So Sokha Chhan remains in removal proceedings and has to keep fighting his case in hopes that an immigration judge will grant his application to remain in the country.”
Deported: Forced Family Separation (Part 2 of 5) March 16, 2017 09:23 Still, the pardons Brown granted have allowed Chhan and Pheach to remain with their loved ones over the last year.
Chhan said he's been able to return to his normal life since receiving his pardon. He works 15-hour days seven days a week at a restaurant, takes care of his kids and volunteers at his local temple when he can, he said.
Chhan's pardon document noted that after his conviction, he was awarded custody of his five children, raising them as a single father, and served honorably in the U.S. Army Reserve.
Tania Pham, at attorney representing Pheach, said in an email that her client was granted a pardon while he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed by a stay of removal that temporarily postponed his deportation while he was awaiting a flight to Cambodia.
Pheach's pardon was welcomed by his wife, 4-year-old son and elderly mother, Pham added. Pheach's removal was ordered after he was convicted of possessing a controlled substance for sale in 2005 and served six months in prison.
But employment-wise, things have been tough for Pheach. He lost the full-time information technology job he held because he was detained for several months and has struggled to find comparable employment, Pham said.
Related news news NBC Asian America Presents: Deported Like Chhan, Pheach is in the middle of removal proceedings. His attorney said she's optimistic he will be granted relief and be able to apply for citizenship afterward.
Pheach has a final hearing scheduled for November 2020. Chhan has yet to receive a final hearing date for his case.
Pardons have become an avenue for Cambodians to fight deportation orders . Angela Chan, policy director and senior staff attorney managing the criminal justice reform program at the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Asian Law Caucus, previously told NBC News that it's one of the only ways to stop deportation in these cases.
“It allows the immigration attorney or the individual themselves to challenge the basis of the deportation order,” she said.
Brown issued 1,189 pardons during his latest stint in office — 2011 to 2019 — and 404 in his first stint — 1975 to 1983, Brian Ferguson, deputy director of media and public affairs in the Office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said in an email. The number of pardons were more than any other governor in the state's recent history.
Ferguson did not specifically comment on how Newsom plans to use his pardon power while in office, but said pardons aren't granted unless they are earned. “Each pardon case that comes before the governor is evaluated on its own merits and receives careful review and consideration,” he said.
Related News News New California pardon law may help those facing deportation Ny Nourn, a fellow at the Asian Law Caucus who is also at risk of deportation, said in an email that pardons for Southeast Asian refugees in imminent danger of deportation are necessary to allow them to remain with their loved ones and community.
She argued that these refugees have changed their lives to become model community members who should not be punished for a crime they committed more than a decade ago.
Several groups earlier this year launched a petition urging Newsom to issue pardons to Cambodian Americans at risk of deportation. It has so far amassed more than 14,400 signatures.
ICE said last month that 1,784 final orders of removal have been issued for Cambodians, 1,294 of whom are convicted criminals. In total, 45 Cambodians with final orders of removal were detained at that time.
“It is essential for Gov. Newsom to follow in Brown's footsteps to ensure pardons is one form of relief to help protect our vulnerable immigrant community members against the current administration hate filled polices of targeting immigrants with felony convictions,"" Nourn said.

"On impeachment, Warren just stole the show from her dodging Democratic rivals",www.nbcnews.com,Jonathan Allen,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/impeachment-warren-just-stole-show-her-dodging-democratic-rivals-n996636,"Nevertheless, she insisted. While most fellow 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls ducked and dived to find safe ground — and party elders solemnly warned against over-reach — Sen. Elizabeth Warren stepped boldly out into the open late Friday and called on the House to begin an impeachment process against based on special counsel Robert Mueller's report.
The Massachusetts senator and 2020 Democratic presidential contender slammed Trump for having ""welcomed"" the help of a ""hostile"" foreign government and having obstructed the probe into an attack on an American election.
""To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country,"" Warren tweeted. ""The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States.""
It was a rare moment in a crowded and unsettled primary: A seized opportunity for a candidate to cut through the campaign trail cacophony and define the terms of a debate that will rage throughout the contest.
2020 Democrats divided over impeachment after Mueller report April 20, 2019 01:35 With her party torn between its impulses — to avoid the potential political death spiral of a failed impeachment even though it may be popular with the energized base and to hold Trump accountable for what Democrats see as gross abuses — Warren framed pursuing House hearings as a matter of conscience.
In other words, she sided with that base of core party supporters, defined its cause in moral terms and hollered the message from the mountaintop.
That's classic Warren. And in a period when she's focused her campaign on serious policy proposals, it is a timely reminder to progressives that they like her politics, too.
Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics
""Not doubting her sincerity here but it's also probably a very shrewd primary move to leap out front on this,"" tweeted David Axelrod, who served as a top campaign and White House adviser to President Barack Obama.
A campaign official told NBC News Warren believed it was the right course of action after reading Mueller's report during a flight home from the campaign trail Thursday. Nevertheless, she will remain focused on her policy platform, not impeachment, the official said.
And yet, calling for the removal of a president — especially when so many other Democrats are reluctant to do so (shortly before Warren issued her statement, fellow senator and 2020 hopeful Amy Klobuchar said, ""I think you've seen all the senators are very cautious about talking about this because we would be the jury if there was any kind of an action brought over from the House"") — isn't a particularly forgettable act.
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, said the political left is outraged over the handling of the Mueller report by Attorney General William Barr and the response by the White House.
Warren's move could help her capitalize on that energy at a time when several of her rivals have been garnering more attention — as well as bigger fundraising hauls and higher poll numbers — in the early months of the primary campaign.
""If you think about the oxygen that is now in the room for the entire Russia-Mueller-impeachment swirl of stuff, for weeks or months, every time someone comes out publicly and agrees that we need to begin impeachment hearings, people will remember that Elizabeth Warren is the presidential candidate that got that started,"" Green said.
While Green noted Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., introduced the House resolution that would be a likely vehicle for beginning impeachment hearings, Warren's status as a significant player in the primary will likely make her announcement a major marker if the House moves forward against the president.
At nearly the same time as Warren spoke out, fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the polling leader among candidates currently in the race, waved off press questions about the Mueller report in South Carolina.
On Thursday, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, who said during his Senate campaign last year against Ted Cruz that he would vote to impeach Trump, framed the question as one for Congress or the voters — rather than presidential candidates.
Asked about impeachment proceedings, O'Rourke says: ""I'm gonna leave that to those members of the House who as they review those findings can make that decision. ... But ultimately at this point I believe that this is going to be decided in November 2020."" https://t.co/kAEhVFeYdP
— Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) April 18, 2019 Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, said he was ""pretty sure"" Trump ""deserves to be impeached"" but deferred to Congress, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, speaking before Warren, said it would be ""perfectly reasonable"" for lawmakers to launch impeachment proceedings. ""This president should be held accountable,"" Castro said on MSNBC .
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said on MSNBC's ""All In with Chris Hayes"" on Thursday that she wants to hear what Mueller has to say about his report before passing judgment on whether impeachment proceedings should begin — similar to the position of her fellow Californian, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the most important player in any impeachment drama.
The reticence of some Warren's rivals suggests her decision to walk point on the left flank of the impeachment front carries some risk, even if it's a quick path to rally support from liberals.
It will not only put her squarely back in Trump's field of vision, but it also will expose her to friendly political fire from Democrats who believe pursuing his ouster is the surest way to ensure his re-election.
Still, Warren, often cited as the heir to Edward M. Kennedy as the liberal lion of the Senate, has shown that her brand can be most compelling when a healthy dose of politics is mixed in with her substance.
That's what happened when GOP senators cited the chamber's rules to take away Warren's speaking privileges during a 2017 debate over Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Warren had read from a letter criticizing Sessions that had been written by Coretta Scott King in 1986.
Since Sessions was a member of the Senate at the time of the nomination fight, Warren was told she couldn't malign him under the rules. The Senate voted to prevent her from speaking again on Sessions' nomination.
""She was warned. She was given an explanation,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said afterward. ""Nevertheless, she persisted.""
Progressives quickly adopted McConnell's disparaging phrase as a symbol for strong women. It was even condensed to ""She Persisted"" for the title of a bestselling book by Chelsea Clinton.
It remains to be seen whether Warren's impeachment call will give her a major boost. But there aren't many opportunities to stand out from the crowd, and she took this one without hesitation.

Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency — the second one he has declared in less than a week due to tornadoes. A friend of the owner reviews the remains of a storm damaged house in Morton, Mississippi on April 19, 2019, following a possible tornado touchdown Thursday afternoon, as strong storms again roared across the South on Thursday, topping trees and leaving a variety of damage in Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. Rogelio V. Solis / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 20, 2019, 2:44 PM GMT By The Associated Press ATLANTA — A strong storm system barreling through the South killed an 8-year-old girl in Florida on Friday and threatened to bring tornadoes to large parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia on Saturday. A tree fell onto a house in Woodville, Florida, south of Tallahassee, killing the girl and injuring a 12-year-old boy, according to the Leon County Sheriff's Office. The office said in a statement that the girl died at a hospital while the boy suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Their names weren't immediately released. The same storm system was blamed for the deaths a day earlier of two people in Mississippi and a woman in Alabama. The threat on Friday shifted farther east, where tornado warnings covered parts of northeast Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia, where four suspected tornado touchdowns were reported Friday night. Twisters touched down in Reston, Fredericks Hall, Barham and Forksville. Homes and small structures were damaged, but no injuries were immediately reported. Deadly storm system slams Southeast April 20, 2019 02:52 The national Storm Prediction Center said 9.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were at a moderate risk of severe weather. The region includes the Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area. Torrential downpours, large hail and a few tornadoes were among the hazards, the National Weather Service in Raleigh, North Carolina, warned. Radar readings appeared to show a tornado formed in western Virginia's Franklin County, south of Roanoke, though damage on the ground still must be assessed, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Phil Hysell. In South Carolina, authorities urged motorists to avoid part of Interstate 26 — the main artery from Upstate through Columbia and all the way to Charleston — because downed trees had left the roadway scattered with debris. In Georgia, the storm system knocked down trees, caused flooding and cut off power to tens of thousands of people. A tree came down on an apartment complex in an Atlanta suburb, but only one person reported a minor injury and was treated at the scene, Gwinnett County fire spokesman Capt. Tommy Rutledge told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In Forsyth County northeast of Atlanta, three firefighters suffered minor injuries when their firetruck overturned during heavy rain and wind, Fire Department Division Chief Jason Shivers told the newspaper. Meanwhile, hundreds of people cleaned up part of a central Mississippi town hit hard by a tornado on Thursday.

More than 20 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. The town of 3,500 is about 30 miles east of Jackson. ""When it stopped, there was nothing left,"" Morton resident Sharon Currie told WAPT-TV . ""I was going, 'Oh my God. My house is gone.'"" Forecasters confirmed that 14 tornadoes had touched down in Mississippi and damage from the storm system was reported in at least 24 of the state's 82 counties. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency — the second one he has declared in less than a week due to tornadoes. Authorities on Friday reported a third storm-related death in the state. Freddie Mobley, 63, died while helping cut a tree that had fallen on a house, Lincoln County Coroner Clay McMorris told the Daily Leader of Brookhaven. Mobley had made a few cuts on the tree and backed away when the trunk shifted before he could move, Deputy Coroner Ricky Alford said."

Dozens of black-hooded demonstrators threw rocks at police and some set fire to motor-cycles in the center of French capital, according to Reuters TV footage. Trash cans and a several scooters were also set ablaze. Police responded by firing tear gas and stun grenades. Some officers also marched toward demonstrators to control the crowd and funnel it to Paris' Place de la Republique, where they were authorized to demonstrate.

Health Matters: 5 foods in your kitchen with surprising amounts of sugar,www.nbcnews.com,"Madelyn Fernstrom, PhD",04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/health-matters-5-foods-your-kitchen-surprising-amounts-sugar-ncna995971,"The average American consumes around 22 teaspoons of sugar every day – that’s nearly 66 pounds in a year! And eating too much sugar has been associated with multiple health risks. But how much is “too much”? The American Heart Association recommends a total of about six teaspoons of added sugars a day for women and nine teaspoons for men. Translated into calories, that’s only about 100 calories for women, and 150 for men.
RELATED: Mika's lifelong struggle with sugar
That’s not easy for many people, especially because there are many popular foods with surprising amounts of hidden sugars. Here are five that are probably in your kitchen:
Condiments A squirt here, a dunk there – the sugar calories add up fast. Among the highest in added sugars, per tablespoon are:
-Ketchup (1 teaspoon sugar)
-BBQ sauce (1 ½ teaspoons sugar)
-Teriyaki sauce ( 1 ½ teaspoons sugar)
-Hoisin sauce (2 teaspoons sugar)
Sugar Swap Out: mustard, no-sugar added ketchup
You'd Be Surprised to Find Hidden Sugars in These Foods April 24, 2017 02:26 Jarred pasta sauces Adding sugar to tomato-based sauces serves as a flavor balancer, and brands vary in amount added from as little as 3 grams (almost a teaspoon) to 12 grams (3 teaspoons) for a half cup serving. And you can only know by reading the label.
Sugar swap out: Cook down canned tomatoes (or tomato puree) with some seasonings for a quick, sugar-free pasta sauce, or cut down the sugar in a jarred sauce by mixing equal parts with plain tomato sauce.
Flavored Yogurts Figuring out what has added sugars can be confusing due to container size and the kind of add-ins. While yogurt has lactose, one of nature’s sugars, it’s not the major contributor of sugars listed for many flavored yogurts. In fact, plain (natural) yogurt has less than 2 teaspoons per 5 ounce serving, while many fruited yogurts have up to 13 grams (3 teaspoons) or more for the same serving size.
And don’t be fooled by the words “organic” or “kids” – as these brands are often higher in sugar than others.
Sugar Swap out: Add your own fruit to plain yogurt, or even one teaspoon of jelly or jam (you’re still saving sugar compared to fruited yogurts).
Janine Driver on staying healthy and losing weight March 29, 2018 04:47 Breakfast Cereals Here’s where reading the nutrition label – on the back – is essential. Ignore the words “fortified” or “whole grain” or “protein”, which are all unrelated to sugar. Avoid cereals with the word “frosted”.
Sugar Swap Out: Look for cereals with less than 8 grams of sugar per 1 cup serving. Try mixing a sweeter cereal with a low-sugar variety to cut the added sugars in half.
Beverages Clear doesn’t mean calorie-free. Watch out for coffee house drinks, loaded with syrups. Drinks flavored with ANY calorie-containing sweeteners count as added sugars. And skip fruit juices as a stand-alone drink; you want to eat your fruit, not drink it.
Sugar Swap Out: If you’re tired of plain water or seltzer, add a splash of 100 percent juice for flavor. Use low calorie drinks if you choose, but limit consumption to tame your sweet tooth.
You also might be wondering where all that sugar is coming from. Consider this:
Added sugars vs. nature’s sugars
If you’ve already cut the obvious tooth-aching sources of added sugars – like cakes, cookies, candy and soda – you’re off to a good start. But there are loads of hidden sugars in everyday foods that add up fast. The “taste test” for sweetness doesn’t work because these packaged and processed foods often don’t taste particularly sweet. And with more than 50 different names for added sugars, it’s hard to know how much you’re eating because it’s disguised.
One important note: Fruit, which is often referred to as “nature’s candy,” is not considered “added” sugar and is a healthy part of the food supply, along with those sugars found in starchy vegetables and dairy.
Recognizing added sugars on a label:
A common mistake after limiting white sugar (sucrose) is to swap it out for another sugar with a health halo and perception of a “better-for-you sugar.” Our bodies recognize all sources of added sugars the same way – and breaks them all down to glucose, the simplest and most preferred source of energy used by a healthy body.
Here’s what to look for when reading labels for added sugars in your foods:
-Ingredients that end with the letters -ose (like sucrose or glucose)
-Ingredients that have the word “syrup” (like corn syrup or brown rice syrup)
-Ingredients that have the word sugar (like cane sugar, beet sugar, or coconut sugar)

Drag troupe 'The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence' mark 40 years of 'dragtivism',www.nbcnews.com,Tim Fitzsimons,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/drag-troupe-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-mark-40-years-dragtivism-n996701,"According to Michael Williams, much better known as “Sister Roma,” the story of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence began in San Francisco on Easter Day of 1979. Back then, just a year before the city’s gay community was struck by the AIDS epidemic, four friends found themselves fed up with what Roma called the “Castro clone look.” “Gay men in San Francisco in the 70s all presented very masculine, leather jackets, moustaches, sort of like the Marlboro Man, you know?” Roma told NBC News. “So they were very fed up with that, and they thought, ‘Let’s put on these nun’s habits and sort of go out and screw with people and see what happens.’”
As they strolled from the Castro to the city’s gay beach, Roma said, “everywhere they went the reaction was just insane — people had never seen anything like men, most of them with facial hair, in nun’s habits.” They realized they were onto something, so they came up with a name for their group: The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence.
Now four decades later, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence were clearly ahead of their time, and many of their campy “dragtivism” tactics have inspired others, Roma said. “Little did they know it, but these four queers who went out in these nuns habits actually changed the world,” she said.
“One of the original sisters was Bobbi Campbell , who was Sister Florence Nightmare, who was a registered nurse,” Roma said.
Campbell became well known across America as the self-designated “AIDS poster boy,” a role he took on in an effort to destigmatize the disease.
“The sisters took a very pragmatic, responsible attitude towards the virus, and said, ‘We need to protect the community,’” Roma said. “So the sisters produced a safer sex pamphlet called Play Fair that we still produce today, that was the world’s first-ever safer sex pamphlet.”
In the early 1980s, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence hosted some of the world’s first fundraisers for AIDS victims, many of whom faced financial ruin as the then-unknown pathogen ravaged their bodies. “The sisters were at the forefront of the fight against HIV/AIDS before anyone knew what the disease was,” Roma said.

John S Lander / LightRocket via Getty Images file At each anniversary every 10 years, the sisters have had a different focus. In 1989, Roma launched the ""stop the violence” campaign, which addressed an uptick of homophobic hate crimes in San Francisco at that time.
“In 1989, queer people were still really fighting for equality and just desiring to be recognized as equal people in the world,” Roma said. “So it was a very basic fight, and we were also crippled with HIV and AIDS, which many people saw as a disease that was killing all the right people.” That year, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence also became an official nonprofit organization.
For their 20th anniversary in 1999, the Sisters closed Castro Street for a massive celebration. “That seemed like a no-brainer to us, but apparently it was quite a major issue for a lot of people in San Francisco, who still at the time ... thought that we were very sacrilegious,” Roma said. But support from local politicians got them through the day, and they hosted their street fair, where the Sisters emceed a “hunky Jesus” competition that continues to this day.

John S Lander / LightRocket via Getty Images file Because of publicity generated by the opposition, “it was one of the largest celebrations that we had, probably ever in our history,” with around 20,000 to 30,000 people filling Castro street, Roma said.
For their 30th anniversary, the sisters focused on the political issues animating the LGBTQ community at that time.
“We started to talk about gays in the military, and same-sex marriage, and adopting children,” Roma said. “So the sisters again picked up the bullhorns and buckets and collected money and raised awareness for all of these important issues.”
For this weekend’s 40th anniversary in San Francisco’s Mission Dolores Park, the Sisters will turn their focus to a new set of issues, Roma said, like transgender and migrant rights, as well as anti-gay laws like the one recently passed in Brunei. “But we are also thinking about the jeopardy of our own civil rights and our own safety in this country as the pendulum swings back to the right,” Roma said.
When considering a protest against Mayor Pete Buttigieg earlier this week , in which protesters donned religious garb for dramatic effect, Sister Roma acknowledged that the troupe’s performative style of activism may have had an impact outside the LGBTQ community.
“Let’s face it, religion is campy. It’s pomp. it’s circumstance, it’s burning purses that smell like incense, it's candles and stained glass windows and robes and brocade,” she said. “Is there anything gayer than religion, really?”
The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence will celebrate their 40th anniversary this Easter Sunday in San Francisco’s Mission Dolores Park from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m .

Woman's brutal killing in Bangladesh triggers protests,www.nbcnews.com,The Associated Press,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/woman-s-brutal-killing-bangladesh-triggers-protests-n996696,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Dozens of protesters gathered in Bangladesh's capital on Friday to demand justice for an 18-year-old woman who died after being set on fire for refusing to drop sexual harassment charges against her Islamic school's principal. Nusrat Jahan Rafi told her family she was lured to the roof of her rural school in the town of Feni on April 6 and asked to withdraw the charges by five people clad in burqas. When she refused, she said her hands were tied and she was doused in kerosene and set alight.
Rafi told the story to her brother in an ambulance on the way to the hospital and he recorded her testimony on his mobile phone. She died four days later in a Dhaka hospital with burns covering 80% of her body.
The violence has shaken Bangladesh, triggering protests and raising concerns over the plight of women and girls in the conservative Muslim-majority nation of 160 million people where sexual harassment and violence are often unreported, victims are intimidated and the legal process is often lengthy. Many avoid reporting to police because of social stigma.
""We want justice. Our girls must grow up safely and with dignity,"" Alisha Pradhan, a model and actress, told The Associated Press during Friday's demonstration. ""We protest any forms of violence against women, and authorities must ensure justice.""
Tens of thousands of people attended Rafi's funeral prayers in Feni, and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina promised Rafi's family when they met in Dhaka that those responsible would be punished.
At least 17 people, including students, have been arrested in connection with the case, said Banaj Kumar Majumder, the head of the Police Bureau of Investigation.
In late March, Rafi filed a complaint with police that the principal of her madrasa, or Islamic school, had called her into his office and touched her inappropriately and repeatedly. Her family agreed to help her to file the police complaint, which prompted police to arrest the principal, infuriating him and his supporters. Influential local politicians backed the principal, and ruling party members were also among the arrested.
Police said the arrested suspects told them during interrogations that the attack on Rafi was planned and ordered by the school's principal from prison when his men went to see him. It was timed for daytime so that it would look like a suicide attempt, Majumder said.
Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Rafi's family said that they had received death threats before the attack telling them to drop the case.
Related News Bangladesh high-rise office building fire leaves more than a dozen dead While Rafi's case is now being treated with urgency, that wasn't the case until her death.
A video taken on March 27 while Rafi reported the assault shows the local police chief registering her complaint but telling her that the incident was ""not a big deal."" The chief was later removed from the police station for negligence in dealing with the case.
For Bangladeshi women, it is often not easy to file sensitive complaints with police. Victims often fear further harassment and bullying. Police also often show an unwillingness to investigate such cases and are often accused of being influenced by local politics or bribes.
But the call for dealing with violence against women, especially related to sexual harassment and assault, is also getting louder.
""The horrifying murder of a brave woman who sought justice shows how badly the Bangladesh government has failed victims of sexual assault,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""Nusrat Jahan Rafi's death highlights the need for the Bangladesh government to take survivors of sexual assault seriously and ensure that they can safely seek a legal remedy and be protected from retaliation."""

"As syphilis invades rural America, a fraying health safety net is failing to stop it",www.nbcnews.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/syphilis-invades-rural-america-fraying-health-safety-net-failing-stop-n996731,"When Karolyn Schrage first heard about the “dominoes gang” in the health clinic she runs in Joplin, Mo., she assumed it had to do with pizza. Turns out it was a group of men in their 60s and 70s who held a standing game night — which included sex with one another. They showed up at her clinic infected with syphilis.
That has become Schrage’s new normal. Pregnant women, young men and teens are all part of the rapidly growing number of syphilis patients coming to the Choices Medical Services clinic in the rural southwestern corner of the state. She can barely keep the antibiotic treatment for syphilis, penicillin G benzathine, stocked on her shelves.
Public health officials say rural counties across the Midwest and West are becoming the new battleground. While syphilis is still concentrated in cities such as San Francisco, Atlanta and Las Vegas, its continued spread into places like Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma creates a new set of challenges. Compared with urban hubs, rural populations tend to have less access to public health resources, less experience with syphilis and less willingness to address it because of socially conservative views toward homosexuality and nonmarital sex.
In Missouri, the total number of syphilis patients has more than quadrupled since 2012 — jumping from 425 to 1,896 cases last year — according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of new state health data. Almost half of those are outside the major population centers and typical STD hot spots of Kansas City, St. Louis and its adjacent county. Syphilis cases surged at least eightfold during that period in the rest of the state.
At Choices Medical Services, Schrage has watched the caseload grow from five cases to 32 in the first quarter of 2019 alone compared with the same period last year. “I’ve not seen anything like it in my history of doing sexual health care,” she said.
Back in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a plan to eradicate the sexually transmitted disease that totaled over 35,000 cases nationwide that year. While syphilis can cause permanent neurological damage, blindness or even death, it is both treatable and curable. By focusing on the epicenters clustered primarily throughout the South, California and in major urban areas, the plan seemed within reach.
Instead, U.S. cases topped 101,500 in 2017 and are continuing to rise along with other sexually transmitted diseases. Syphilis is back in part because of increasing drug use , but health officials are losing the fight because of a combination of cuts in national and state health funding and crumbling public health infrastructure.
“It really is astounding to me that in the modern Western world we are dealing with the epidemic that was almost eradicated,” said Schrage.
Grappling With The Jump Craig Highfill, who directs Missouri’s field prevention efforts for the Bureau of HIV, STD and Hepatitis, has horror stories about how syphilis can be misunderstood.
“Oh, no, honey, only hookers get syphilis,” he said one rural doctor told a patient who asked if she had the STD after spotting a lesion.
In small towns, younger patients fear that their local doctor — who may also be their Sunday school teacher or basketball coach — may call their parents. Others don’t want to risk the receptionist at their doctor’s office gossiping about their diagnosis.
Related Health Health Two crises in one: As drug use rises, so does syphilis Some men haven’t told family members they’re having sex with other men. And still more have no idea their partner may have cheated on them — and their doctors don’t want to ask, according to Highfill.
It’s even hard to expect providers who haven’t seen a case of syphilis in their lifetime to automatically recognize the hallmarks of what is often called the “great imitator,” Highfill said. Syphilis can manifest differently among patients, but frequently shows up for a few weeks as lesions or rashes — often dismissed by doctors who aren’t expecting to see the disease.
Since 2000, the current syphilis epidemic was most prevalent among men having sex with men. Starting in 2013, public health officials began seeing an alarming jump in the number of women contracting syphilis, which is particularly disturbing considering the deadly effects of congenital syphilis — when the disease is passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. That can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or birth deformities.
Among those rising numbers of women contracting syphilis and the men who were their partners, self-reported use of methamphetamines, heroin or other intravenous drugs continues to grow, according to the CDC . Public health officials suggest that increased drug use — which can result in a pattern of risky sex or trading sex for drugs — worsens the outbreaks.
That perilous trend is playing out particularly in rural Missouri, argues Dr. Hilary Reno, an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who is researching syphilis transmission and drug use in the state. Tracking cases from 2015 through June 2018, she found that more than half of patients outside of the major metropolitan areas of Kansas City and St. Louis reported using drugs.
Less Money, More Problems Federal funding for STD prevention has stayed relatively flat since 2003, with $157.3 million allocated for fiscal year 2018. But that amounts to a nearly 40% decrease in purchasing power over that time, according to the National Coalition of STD Directors.
In Missouri, CDC annual funding has been cut by over $354,000 from 2012 to 2018 — a 17% decrease even as the number of cases quadrupled, Highfill said.
Iowa, too, has seen its STD funding cut by $82,000 over the past decade, according to Iowa Department of Health’s STD program manager George Walton.
“It is very difficult to get ahead of an epidemic when case counts are steadily — sometimes rapidly — increasing and your resources are at best stagnant,” Walton said. “It just becomes overwhelming.”
Highfill bemoaned that legislatures in Texas, Oregon and New York have all allocated state money to raise awareness or provide transportation to local clinics. Missouri has not allocated anything.
Karolyn Schrage, executive director of the Choices Medical Services clinic in Joplin, Missouri says she can barely keep the antibiotic treatment for syphilis, penicillin G benzathine, stocked on her shelves. Bruce Stidham / Kaiser Health News A New Playing Field In the digital age, fighting syphilis is much harder for public health responders, said Rebekah Horowitz, a senior program analyst on HIV, STDs and viral hepatitis at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
The increased use of anonymous apps gives people greater access to more sexual partners, she said. Tracking down those partners is now much harder than camping out at the local bar in town.
“We can’t get inside of Grindr and do our traditional public health efforts,” she said.
That’s not to say Highfill’s department hasn’t tried. It has engineered a series of educational ads on Instagram, Grindr and Facebook displaying messages such as “Knowledge looks good on you.”
Highfill would love to do more — if Missouri had the money.
Public health clinics nationwide have also had to limit hours, reduce screening and increase fees that can reach $400. And some run by health departments across the country have been forced to close — at least 21 in 2012 alone, according to CDC data.
In Missouri, restrictions on Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid reimbursements that were passed last year in the legislature, and are again under debate, mean the nonprofit organization cannot be reimbursed for STD treatment for some patients.
That is another crack in the already failing public health infrastructure, said Reno, the Washington University professor who also serves as the medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic.
“We have a system that’s not even treading water,” she said. “We are the ship that is listing to the side.”

Zookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka Zoo,www.nbcnews.com,Safia Samee Ali,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/zookeeper-hospitalized-after-tiger-attack-topeka-zoo-n996721,"A zookeeper in Kansas was hospitalized after an attack by a Sumatran tiger at the Topeka Zoo on Saturday. The trainer was out of surgery and stable but remained hospitalized on Sunday, according to Molly Hadfield, a spokesperson for the City of Topeka. The tiger, named Sanjiv, was in the same area as the keeper when the animal attacked, Hadfield said.
The incident took place while the park was open to the public and ""a few people"" saw the attack happen, she said. The zoo shut down for around 45 minutes while employees handled the tiger and helped the injured zookeeper.
Sanjiv, a male Sumatran tiger, at the Topeka Zoo in Kansas. Topeka Zoo / via Facebook The zoo was open on Saturday and the zoo's female tiger and her four cubs were in the public exhibit, according to Hadfield.
The Topeka Zoo has decided not to euthanize the tiger, noting that Sumatran Tigers are critically endangered and Sanjiv was a wild tiger doing what wild tigers do, according to Hadfield. Sanjiv was in a holding pen on Saturday but would be in the public exhibit on Sunday, she said.
""The male Sumatran tiger, Sanjiv, simply reacted the way that is normal for a tiger to do,"" Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said in a statement. ""There is absolutely no consideration of euthanizing the tiger.""
The injured keeper was ""alert and awake"" when she was transported by medical responders.
Topeka Zoo will not euthanize tiger that attacked zookeeper April 20, 2019 00:54 The city said in a later statement that the incident occurred at around 9:15 a.m. when ""a Zoo Keeper found herself in the same outdoor space with a seven year old Sumatran tiger.""
The tiger was never out of its enclosure, the city said.
Sumatran tigers can weigh anywhere between 160 to 300 pounds, and only an estimated 400 are left in the world, according to the World Wildlife Fund .
""For this critically endangered species we have an active breeding program, we make regular contributions to the science of caring for this species and our community financially supports a ranger on the ground in Sumatra,"" Wiley said.
""Right now, our focus is on our injured team member,"" he continued. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with her and her family.""
An investigation will be conducted over the next several days, which will include a review of all policies and procedures around tiger management at the zoo.
""If we need to make updates to our current procedures, we will most certainly do that,"" Wiley said in the statement.

Corporate America embraces 420 as pot legalization grows,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/corporate-america-embraces-420-pot-legalization-grows-n996716,"U.S. news Corporate America embraces 420 as pot legalization grows In one example, Lyft is offering a $4.20 credit on a single ride in Colorado and in select cities in the U.S. and Canada. A clerk reaches for a container of marijuana buds for a customer at Utopia Gardens, a medical marijuana dispensary, in Detroit on Oct. 2, 2018. Carlos Osorio / AP file Breaking News Emails April 20, 2019, 5:08 PM UTC By Associated Press LOS ANGELES — Marijuana users have for decades celebrated their love of the drug on April 20, but the once counter-culture celebration that was all about getting stoned now is so mainstream Corporate America is starting to embrace it. No, Hallmark doesn’t yet have a card to mark “420.” But many other businesses inside and outside the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry are using April 20, or 4/20, to roll out marketing and social media messaging aimed at connecting with consumers driving the booming market. On Saturday, Lyft is offering a $4.20 credit on a single ride in Colorado and in select cities in the U.S. and Canada. Carl’s Jr. is using a Denver restaurant to market a hamburger infused with CBD , a non-intoxicating molecule found in cannabis that many believe is beneficial to their health. On 420 last year, Totino’s, a maker of frozen pizza snacks, tweeted an image of a microwave and an oven with the message: “To be blunt, pizza rolls are better when baked.” “I think brands that associate themselves with cannabis kind of get that contact high. In other words, they’re just considered to be cooler by association,” said Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University. “As pot becomes more legal, more discussed, more interesting to people, more widely used, then 420 becomes more mainstream as well.” Marijuana normalization has snowballed since 2012, when Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational use. Eight more followed, including California, Oregon and Michigan. Medical marijuana is legal in two-thirds of the states, with conservative-leaning Utah and Oklahoma among recent additions. Businesses are celebrating cannabis on April 20 April 20, 2019 01:51 Meantime, the CBD market has exploded. CBD oil can be found in candies, coffee and other food, drinks and dietary supplements, along with perfume, lotions, creams and soap. Proponents say CBD helps with pain, anxiety and inflammation, though limited scientific research supports those claims. U.S. retail sales of cannabis products jumped to $10.5 billion last year, a threefold increase from 2017, according to data from Arcview Group, a cannabis investment and market research firm. The figures do not include retail sales of hemp-derived CBD products. Ben & Jerry’s was one of the earliest big brands to foster a connection with the marijuana culture through marketing. The Vermont-based ice cream company features Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, honoring late Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia and the band Phish. Both bands are favorites of the marijuana-smoking crowd. To mark 420 in recent years, Ben & Jerry’s debuted taco and burrito inspired ice cream sandwiches. This year the company partnered with a San Francisco Bay Area cannabis retailer to give customers who place delivery orders on Friday and Saturday a free pint of Half Baked, a combination of cookie dough and fudge brownie. Related Business Carl's Jr. to sell a $4.20 burger infused with CBD on 4/20 “We have a lot of fun, never being overt, but really playing into the moment of 420,” said Jay Curley, the company’s global head of integrated marketing. Last year, Ben & Jerry’s also turned more serious, asking consumers to call on lawmakers to expunge prior marijuana convictions and press for pardons or amnesty for anyone arrested for smoking pot. This year the company is using the holiday to call for criminal justice reform. “We’re actually using this as an opportunity not to tell a stoner joke like we have in the past, but to raise what we see as a much more serious issue around justice,” Curley said. Those in the marijuana marketplace also are ramping up advertising around 420. Much of the marketing about cannabis or related products takes the form of online ads, emails, text messages and social media. Shops typically offer discounts. Some host parties with food and entertainment. The larger 420 events can draw thousands of people. Verano Holdings, whose businesses include cannabis shops, sponsors street festivals in Chicago and Tulsa, Oklahoma, where attendees can learn about marijuana products, listen to music and grab a bite. The company expects this Saturday’s festival in Chicago, going on its third year, will draw more than 4,000 people. Last year, it drew 1,500, said Tim Tennant, Verano’s chief marketing officer. Marijuana-related ER visits spike at Colorado hospital after legalization March 26, 2019 00:00 In San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, Hippie Hill will again be the site of a 420 celebration. Last year, more than 15,000 attended the event, which has transformed from a small informal gathering into a full-blown festival of corporate sponsors and commercial booths selling smoking devices, T-shirts and food. Roger Volodarsky, whose Los Angeles-based Puffco makes portable vaporizers, has celebrated 420 since he was a teenager. Back then, he said, “420 was the day that you splurged on yourself and got high in interesting ways. It was the day that you made a gravity bong and coughed your brains out.” Volodarksy likes that some Main Street brands are getting into the industry and the holiday. “What’s important to me about these ad campaigns is they’re speaking to people who aren’t users and they’re normalizing the space to people who aren’t users,” he said. Even as popularity grows, some companies will stay away from 420 as a marketing tool, said Allen Adamson, co-founder of Metaforce, a marketing consulting company. “If you’re talking about a big brand that needs to appeal to everybody and is very risk-averse, then probably not,” he said. “I don’t think you’ll see large financial institutions doing it.” "

FBI arrests member of armed group stopping migrants in New Mexico,www.nbcnews.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-arrests-alleged-member-armed-group-stopping-migrants-new-mexico-n996746,"The FBI on Saturday arrested a man described as a commander of an armed group that has been detaining migrants in New Mexico, the state attorney general’s office said. Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, of Flora Vista, New Mexico, was arrested for allegedly being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas and the FBI said.
The arrest comes after New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, demanded that members of a militia group, some of whom are armed, stop detaining migrants at the New Mexico-Mexico border.
Larry Mitchell Hopkins Dona Ana County Detention Center Balderas said in a statement that Hopkins is ""a member of the armed group of individuals reportedly detaining migrants near Sunland Park, New Mexico.""
""This is a dangerous felon who should not have weapons around children and families,"" Balderas said. ""Today's arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes.""
Jim Benvie, a spokesman for United Constitutional Patriots, said Hopkins is their ""national commander.""
In a letter Thursday to Lujan Grisham and Balderas, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico said United Constitutional Patriots had arrested nearly 300 people Tuesday near Sunland Park, a city about 10 miles from El Paso, Texas.
Hopkins is scheduled to appear in federal court Monday in Las Cruces. It was unclear if he has an attorney. A message left at a phone number that public records show might belong to Hopkins in Flora Vista was not immediately returned Saturday.
The FBI said no other information would be released until after Hopkins' court appearance, and it was not immediately clear what the underlying felony conviction was.

Paul Ratje / AFP / Getty Images file Lujan Grisham said this week that state officials would be working with local police to stop the militia group from arresting migrants.
Balderas warned that ""these individuals should not attempt to exercise authority reserved for law enforcement.""
Benvie claimed Saturday that Hopkins' arrest was politically motivated and that the United Constitutional Patriots is an ""armed patriot group"" not an armed militia. He said Hopkins is a Vietnam veteran and former ""fugitive recovery officer,"" or bounty hunter.
""I believe that this was an attack from the governor ordered to the AG's office to come out to our camp and find something that they could find to either shut us down, get us removed from the property that we’re on, or do something else to harm the integrity of the organization,"" Benvie said.
The FBI said it arrested Hopkins on a federal complaint and did not mention an armed group.
Reuters reported Thursday that United Constitutional Patriots, made up mainly of veterans, has been patrolling in the Sunland Park area since late February. They have been posting videos almost daily of members in camouflage, armed with semi-automatic rifles, holding asylum-seekers until Border Patrol officers arrive, the news agency reported.
Members of the United Constitutional Patriots share cigarettes while on patrol in Sunland Park, New Mexico, on March 20, 2019. Paul Ratje / AFP - Getty Images file U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that it “does not endorse private groups or organizations taking enforcement matters into their own hands.”
Armed civilian groups have been a fixture on the border for years, especially when large numbers of migrants come, the Associated Press reported. But unlike previous times, many of the migrants crossing now are children.
In the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which has emerged as the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings after Texas' Rio Grande Valley, 86% of arrests in March were people who came as families or unaccompanied children, the AP reported.

Stephanie Washington, 22, was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries following the shooting by an officer from Yale and another from the adjacent town of Hamden, university officials said in a statement.
""No weapons were observed at the scene,"" Connecticut State Police Sgt. Dwight Washington said in a statement.
""This is not just a Hamden situation or a New Haven situation,"" demonstrator Remidy Shareef of Hamden told NBC Connecticut Friday night. ""This situation is the culture of policing throughout America.""
Black Lives Matter of New Haven planned another demonstration Sunday afternoon. On its Facebook page, the group call New Haven, Hamden and Yale police a ""triple occupation"" of the community.
The shooting occurred after 4:15 a.m. Tuesday when Hamden police Officer Devin Eaton and Yale police Officer Terrance Pollack, responding to a report of an attempted robbery at a gas station, stopped a red car near campus fitting the description of the suspect's vehicle, Yale officials said.
Both officers opened fire on the car, the university said. Police have not said why the officers deployed their guns. The officers, Stephanie Washington and the driver, identified by NBC Connecticut as Paul Witherspoon, 21, are black.
Hamden Mayor Curt Leng called the shooting ""shocking, haunting.""
""I am so deeply sorry to the individuals who were involved that this ever occurred, and also very thankful that the healing has begun,"" he said Saturday in a statement. ""We will do better. We must do better.""
More details about the shooting, including body-camera footage from the Hamden officer, could be released as soon as Monday, police sergeant Washington said.
""As the primary investigation proceeds, we will share whatever information we can as quickly as we can about the circumstances of the shooting,"" Yale officials said Wednesday in a letter to the community.
""The university has been very open to having a transparent process, but I think they continue to frame this as an unfortunate tragedy when in reality it was preventable,"" Yale Divinity School first-year student Joshua Cayetano told NBC News on Saturday.
Security video of the shooting shows at least one officer discharging several rounds through the passenger side window of the car. Witherspoon is the suspect in the early morning robbery, said Washington, the police sergeant.
Witherspoon was detained and released after the shooting, the Hartford Courant reported, adding that his uncle, Rodney Williams, said the robbery report was an exaggerated claim based on heated words Witherspoon had with a newspaper delivery worker at the gas station.
The Connecticut State’s Attorney’s Office, assisted by the state police, is investigating the shooting.

Six blasts hit three churches and three hotels in Sri Lanka,www.nbcnews.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/six-blasts-hit-three-churches-three-hotels-sri-lanka-n996751,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — At least 290 people were killed and 500 others injured after a series of blasts shook Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. A wave of near-simultaneous explosions rocked three churches and three luxury hotels, officials said. Police later reported two further explosions.
Police said Monday that 24 suspects had been arrested.
The government declared an island-wide curfew and said it had shut down access to major social media sites and messaging services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, to prevent misinformation and rumors.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks.
Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said the death toll included at least 27 foreign nationals. He described the attacks as a terrorist incident, and blamed religious extremists.
In a statement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that several of those killed were Americans.
""The U.S. Embassy is working tirelessly to provide all possible assistance to the American citizens affected by the attacks and their families,"" Pompeo said.

STRINGER / AFP - Getty Images Police conducted a search operation on the outskirts of Colombo, where the latest of eight blasts took place. After police moved in, at least two more blasts occurred, with the occupants of a safehouse apparently blasting explosives to prevent arrest. Three officers were killed.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he feared the violence could trigger instability in the country and its economy.
He said his government would ""vest all necessary powers with the defense forces"" to take action against those responsible for the attacks, ""regardless of their stature.""

A security official told The Associated Press that two of the blasts were suspected to have been carried out by suicide bombers. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak with reporters.
The first blast ripped through St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo. The church and the three hotels in the country's capital are frequented by foreign tourists.
A second explosion was reported at St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, a Catholic majority town north of Colombo.
More than 50 people were killed in that blast alone, a police official told Reuters, with pictures showing bodies on the ground, blood on the pews and a destroyed roof.
Relatives of a victim mourn in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on Sunday. Dinuka Liyanawatte / Reuters Father Edmond Tillekeratne, the social communications director of the Archdiocese of Colombo, was near St. Sebastian's when the explosion happened.
""I was close by, so I ran there. I saw the aftermath with my own eyes,"" he told NBC News.
""The rooftop is completely destroyed. The flesh of the people is on the walls and all over the place.""
The third church that was targeted is in the eastern town of Batticaloa.
Pope Francis denounced the ""cruel violence"" and added an appeal at the end of his Easter Sunday blessing to address the massacre.
""I want to express my loving closeness to the Christian community, targeted while they were gathered in prayer, and all the victims of such cruel violence,"" he said. ""I entrust to the Lord all those who were tragically killed and pray for the injured and all those who are suffering as a result of this dramatic event.""
The first three hotels hit were the Shangri-La Colombo, Kingsbury Hotel and Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
President Donald Trump tweeted his condolences and said the U.S. stands ""ready to help!""
Bombings target churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday April 21, 2019 00:48 Akshat Saraf, from Bangalore, India, was staying at the Shangri-La hotel with his family when the blasts hit.
""We were in our room on the 25th floor when we felt strong tremors. We rushed downstairs fearing an earthquake,"" he told NBC News. ""Once out of the building we saw a flurry of emergency responders and ambulances ferrying injured guests.""
The blasts follow a lull in major attacks since the end of Sri Lanka's civil war 10 years ago. The island nation of nearly 23 million people was at war for decades with Tamil separatists until 2009, during which bomb blasts in the capital were common.
Sri Lanka has long faced a bitter ethnic divide between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils, fueling the civil war as Tamil militants tried to carve out their own homeland.
Sinhalese are overwhelmingly Buddhists, while Tamils are mostly Hindu, Muslim and Christian.
Sri Lanka has a population of around 22 million. Around 70 percent are Buddhist, 12.6 percent Hindu, 9.7 percent Muslim, and 7.6 percent Christian, according to the country's 2012 census.
The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka.
— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) April 21, 2019 Last year, there were 86 verified incidents of discrimination, threats and violence against Christians, according to the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL), which represents more than 200 churches and other Christian organizations.
This year, the group recorded 26 such incidents.
In its 2018 report on Sri Lanka's human rights, the State Department noted that some Christian groups and churches reported they had been pressured to end worship activities after authorities classified them as ""unauthorized gatherings.""

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 21, 2019, 3:45 AM GMT By The Associated Press NEW YORK — There's at least one area of agreement among conservative, centrist and liberal leaders in the United Methodist Church: America's largest mainline Protestant denomination is on a path toward likely breakup over differences on same-sex marriage and ordination of LGBT pastors. The differences have simmered for years, and came to a head in February at a conference in St. Louis where delegates voted 438-384 for a proposal called the Traditional Plan, which strengthens bans on LGBT-inclusive practices. A majority of U.S.-based delegates opposed that plan and favored LGBT-friendly options, but they were outvoted by U.S. conservatives teamed with most of the delegates from Methodist strongholds in Africa and the Philippines. Many believe the vote will prompt an exodus from the church by liberal congregations that are already expressing their dissatisfaction over the move.

Charlie Riedel / AP Some churches have raised rainbow flags in a show of LGBT solidarity. Some pastors have vowed to defy the strict rules and continue to allow gay weddings in Methodist churches. Churches are withholding dues payments to the main office in protest, and the UMC's receipts were down 20 percent in March, according to financial reports posted online. ""It's time for some kind of separation, some kind of amicable divorce,"" said James Howell, pastor of Myers Park United Methodist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, who posted a video assailing the proposal for its ""real meanness."" The UMC's nine-member Judicial Council convenes a four-day meeting in Evanston, Illinois, on Tuesday to consider legal challenges to the Traditional Plan. If the plan is upheld, it would take effect for U.S. churches on Jan. 1. If parts of it are struck down, that would likely trigger new debate at the UMC's next general conference in May 2020. Related LGBTQ United Methodist leaders gutted by church's anti-gay decision The UMC's largest church — the 22,000-member Church of the Resurrection with four locations in the Kansas City area — is among those applying financial pressure. Its lead pastor, Adam Hamilton, says his church is temporarily withholding half of the $2.5 million that it normally would have paid to the UMC's head office at this stage of the year. ""We'll ultimately pay it,"" Hamilton said. ""But we want to show that this is the impact if our churches leave."" Hamilton is among the opponents of the Traditional Plan leading an initiative dubbed UMC-Next that seeks the best path forward for those who share their views. Clergy and activists in the alliance have met in Texas and Georgia, and a bigger meeting is planned for May 20-22 at Hamilton's megachurch. Hamilton, in a telephone interview, said two main options are under consideration. Under one scenario, many centrists and liberals would leave en masse to form a new denomination — a potentially complex endeavor given likely disputes over the dissolution process. Under the other option, opponents of the Traditional Plan would stay in the UMC and resist from within, insisting on LGBT-inclusive policies and eventually convincing the conservatives that they should be the faction that leaves under what's envisioned as a financially smooth ""gracious exit."" ""There's a sense that some conservatives have been wanting to leave for a long time,"" Hamilton said. ""They're tired of fighting about it."" Related United Methodists seek to resolve deep split over LGBTQ clergy and marriage Formed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States. While other mainline Protestant denominations have embraced gay-friendly practices, the UMC still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBT clergy have multipliedv. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit. Enforcement of the bans has been inconsistent; the Traditional Plan aspires to beef up discipline against those engaged in defiance. Traditional Plan supporter Mark Tooley, who heads a conservative Christian think tank, predicts that the UMC will split into three denominations — one for centrists, another oriented toward liberal activists and a third representing the global alliance of U.S. conservatives and their allies overseas. ""It's a question of how long it takes for that to unfold — and of who and how many go into each denomination,"" Tooley said. ""A lot of churches will be irreparably harmed as they divide."" Scott Jones, bishop of the UMC's Houston-based Texas conference, says churchgoers in his region are divided in their views, but a majority supports the Traditional Plan's concepts. ""I have urged all of us to love each other, listen to each other and respect each other, even if we disagree,"" said Jones, who holds out hope that the UMC's disparate factions can preserve some form of unity. Ann Craig of Newburgh, New York — a lesbian activist who has advocated for greater LGBT inclusion in the UMC — thinks a breakup can be avoided, though she's unsure what lies ahead. ""We expect something new to happen, but what that change should be or will be has not jelled yet,"" she said. ""I don't think we're going to break up — it's so cumbersome to figure out a way to divorce."" The crisis is being followed closely at Methodist-affiliated theology schools based at universities with LGBT-inclusive policies. There are 13 UMC-connected theology schools around the country. ""There's a lot of turmoil and distress,"" said Mary Elizabeth Moore, dean of Boston University School of Theology. ""We're trying to find a future that will be less destructive than where we are now."""

"For some millennials, climate change clock ticks louder than biological one",www.nbcnews.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/some-millennials-climate-change-clock-ticks-louder-biological-one-n993331,"SEATTLE — Erika Lundahl writes and performs her own songs. She works in Seattle for a company that publishes books on the environment. She thinks a lot about how best to occupy her place in the world. Yet, despite this full life, Lundahl, at 27, feels a clock ticking. Her biological clock, yes, but also the one to fix global warming, or face the likelihood that she and her potential children will have to live in a seriously marginalized world.
“There is this sense that if you don’t have kids soon, you could be putting them in a harder position,” Lundahl said. “But if you do have them, that will not be easy either, with the storms, the intense droughts, the precariousness of the times. It’s like you are playing with two ticking time bombs — yours and the planet’s.”
Fears of bringing children into a troubled world may be as old as recorded history. The government reported last year that U.S. birth rates had hit a 30-year low , attributed partly to millennials who felt they were under economic duress.
Meet Swedish teen behind a worldwide climate change campaign March 15, 2019 00:37 But climate concern also appears to be surging. Today’s young adults have been taught since grade school that life on Earth promises to become more precarious. Now, groups have formed to support conversation around the tenuous future. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recently posted an Instagram Live video that brought attention to the question. Given the looming fallout of climate change, she asked, “Is it OK to still have children?”
A recent poll for Business Insider found that 30 percent of Americans agree, at least somewhat, that the potentially life-threatening effects of climate change should be factored into decisions about whether to have children. A little more than 8 percent of those surveyed strongly held that view. And a New York Times poll last summer revealed that 11 percent of those who don’t want children, or aren’t sure, cited climate change as one reason.
New revelations fuel the sense of uncertainty, including a November report from U.S. government scientists that detailed the myriad threats that climate change will pose for the American economy and way of life. Drought in the Southwest, powerful hurricanes in the South and devastating wildfires in California have all been exacerbated by temperature increases, driven by humanity’s burning of fossil fuels, the report found.
Related News News Heat waves, mosquito outbreaks, landslides: 6 ways climate change is hitting the U.S. Frustrated by the government’s muted response, some activists have taken matters into their own hands. They are driving electric vehicles, taking public transportation more often and swearing off meat. All those changes will reduce the output of Earth-warming greenhouse gases. But no personal action reduces a person’s carbon footprint like having fewer children.
With each child, citizens of the developed world increase their carbon footprint sixfold, adding roughly 60 metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, one oft-Quote: d study concluded. The calculation figures the probability that each offspring may also reproduce — potentially expanding an individual's carbon footprint for decades after they die. Put another way, forgoing having a child has more than 25 times the carbon-reducing impact of giving up a gas-burning car.
Such details remain a distant abstraction for most people. But for Lundahl, her friends in Seattle and an increasing number of other Americans, the reality of climate-driven disruption feels all too real. The once-pristine Pacific Northwest choked on weeks of thick smoke last summer, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, as wildfires, exacerbated by climate change, swept the region.
Josephine Ferorelli, left, and Meghan Kallman co-founded Conceivable Future. Jennifer Ludden Four years ago, two women who shared fears about rearing children in such a world formed the group Conceivable Future to create a safe space for talk about it. One of the co-founders, Josephine Ferorelli, a writer, editor and yoga instructor, said that, early on, the topic was greeted as “fringey or hysterical or weird.”
They have no way of measuring how many people now share their concerns, but one thing is clear: “When we talk to women, there is a huge amount of relief, even excitement, that we were bringing this issue out in the open,” Ferorelli, 36, said. “People are like: ‘Oh my God. I felt like I was the only one who felt this way.’”
‘Do I really want to bring a child into this world?’ Natalie Lubsen, 28, a friend of Lundahl’s, would like to have children. But Lubsen — who works in the marketing office of a magazine that seeks “a more just, sustainable and compassionate world” — said she sometimes sees a bleak horizon.
“It kind of feels like anything can happen, as the impacts spiral,” Lubsen said, “with a lot more global unrest, famine, mass migration, water insecurity, food insecurity, potential political collapses and natural disasters.”
In the summer of 2015, Lubsen, Lundahl and friends gathered with about two dozen others in the meeting room of a Seattle cooperative market. Lundahl helped organize the event as a volunteer for Conceivable Future. It was the first time the friends had joined with others in Seattle to publicly discuss their fears about childbearing in a time of climate change.
Erika Lundahl Doug Indrick Another in the Seattle friend-group, Caitlin Blair-Stahn, recalled the gathering as a time for “being present with our grief about climate change … and then being able to talk about taking action purposefully and, hopefully at some point, even joyously, to make a change.”
The challenge feels intensely personal for Blair-Stahn, 29, a nanny, who has dreamed since she was young of becoming a mother. But her longtime boyfriend, now her husband, had different ideas.
“I had this internal struggle: ‘Do I really want to bring a child into this world?’” Nathaniel Blair-Stahn, 40, said. At the 2015 Conceivable Future meeting he made a video, expressing his anger at the idea that “we’re going to use up everything in the world until there is nothing left.”
‘Do I really want to bring a child into this world?’
To Caitlin, the idea of having a partner who did not want to have children was a “deal-breaker.” The two broke up for more than two years, just after Nathaniel received a doctorate in math from the University of Washington. But after some soul-searching, Nathaniel — his worries about overpopulation notwithstanding — decided that he didn’t want to miss the experience of fatherhood.
Not long into 2019, Caitlin learned that she was pregnant. She and Nathaniel are expecting a little Blair-Stahn in August.
“Maybe it’s a really dumb idea to have kids. On the other hand, the streets aren’t burning right now,” he said recently, laughing at his ambivalence. “And I think kids can actually be a positive thing for society. We’re going to raise our child with our values and to be very active in trying to make a difference in the world.”
That means adding a baby to the couple’s community, sharing living space with friends, recycling and composting and buying locally produced products, while the couple shares a single hybrid to get around Seattle. Nathaniel, who is seeking work as a computer programmer, believes that collective political action will provide much more important solutions to the climate crisis.
“It’s a systemic problem and it needs systemic solutions,” he said, citing the end of fossil fuel consumption as the most critical example. “I feel now like having a kid is an individual choice and changing that, alone, won’t make a big difference.”
‘Morally serious’ consequences A lively debate has emerged in academia and the media over the question of human reproduction in challenging times.
Travis Rieder, an ethicist with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins University, urges young people to consider all the usual variables and then add another layer of analysis.
“Procreating both contributes to climate change and creates a new victim of climate change,” said Rieder, a research professor and father of one. “I don’t know whether people should have kids, or whether they should have a big family, but I do believe that climate change should be part of their deliberation, because the consequences of bringing a new person into a changing world are really morally serious.”
Related News News More Americans believe in global warming — but they won't pay much to fix it Another academic who studies humanity’s interaction with the natural world says the discussion about procreation is laudable, drawing more attention to the seriousness of climate change. But Erle Ellis, a professor of geography and environmental systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, rejects the notion that humans should respond by not having children.
“We are on track for climate change, but we are not on track for the worst of it,” Ellis said. “People who are so concerned they would even consider not having children are the very kind of people who can be part of the solution. By having children they have doubled down on the future. They are motivated. Because they know if they don’t succeed, they are failing not only themselves but this new generation they have brought into the world.”
Conceivable Future co-founder Meghan Kallman said the group does not advocate for people to stop having children, but rather uses reproduction choices as a gateway to engage the public on the issue of global warming.
“Asking these questions helps connect people to the deeper meaning of climate change,” said Kallman, 35, a sociologist. “But the bigger goal is to build an economy and a society and a polity that is clean. And we’ve got to do it fast.”
Not without its critics In the U.K., a group of women founded BirthStrike , with 200-plus members declaring their decision “not to bear children due to the severity of the ecological crisis and the current inaction of governing forces in the face of this existential threat.” Like Conceivable Future, the international group is conscious not to dictate reproductive decisions to others.
Not everyone welcomes talk about the dangers of human reproduction. The environmental activists have faced criticism from political conservatives and others who have labeled them overly pessimistic, even “anti-natalist.” One Twitter user dubbed them “a particularly paranoid group of lefties.”
BirthStrike co-founder Blythe Pepino went on Fox News’ “Watters' World” in March and was challenged by host Jesse Watters, who suggested that scientists could be just as wrong about climate change as they were when they predicted a massive computer meltdown in the year 2000 and when they suggested that Earth was the center of the universe. “I just don't believe the science,” Watters said, “because it's not all there.”
“You have been told to not believe the science by your government,” Pepino retorted, “and now you don't believe it because it suits you.”
Related News News How to convince someone global warming is real? Play this game Many of those choosing the no-child path feel as if they are viewed as an oddity in a world where the default setting is for child-rearing. Sometimes their commitment is dismissed as a passing fancy that will change with age.
But many, like Rachel Ries, say that their determination has only deepened, as they see new projections of water and food scarcity. Ries says it’s wrong to dismiss the very real fears of those looking toward a future threatened by global warming. “It’s visceral,” she wrote three years ago on the Conceivable Future website. “It’s dire. It’s real. And there’s POWER in that.”
Ries, 39, a musician in Minneapolis, feels she has not had to give up her maternal instincts entirely, because she lives in a house with her brother, sister-in-law and two nieces and a nephew. “I have found a way to parent,” Ries said. “And I have been very intentional in that way, but also very lucky.”
‘A rude awakening’ For the Seattle friends, the quotidian questions about bearing children have not gone away. Lundahl reports a marked “uptick in my desire to procreate in the last couple of years.” Her boyfriend, who, at 29, is two years older, has not reached that point. Beyond concerns about climate change, there are typical career questions to ponder and student debts to be paid.
Lundahl decided, a little more than a year ago, that the topic was too big to leave her parents out of the discussion. When she described her fraught view of the future, they were shocked.
“It was kind of a rude awakening to another dimension of climate change that I didn’t foresee,” said her father, Dave Lundahl, who runs a behavioral market research firm in Oregon. “My response was to say: ‘Don’t give up. Keep on fighting. Keep on moving forward.’ I said, ‘Being a parent is one of the greatest joys you can have.’ I said, ‘Don’t give up on that joy.’”
Erika recently got an IUD. “I felt like, ‘I am just going to put a stopper on this conversation for a while,” she said, laughing. “But it’s still something that feels real and present. That’s kind of part of the fabric of life, when climate change keeps making itself more known and felt.”

Earth Day founder's daughter says her dad would be 'deeply distressed' by climate inaction,www.nbcnews.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/earth-day-founder-s-daughter-says-her-dad-would-be-ncna996576,"For Tia Nelson, Earth Day is as personal as it gets. The daughter of Gaylord Nelson, who founded Earth Day in 1970 while serving as U.S. senator from Wisconsin, Tia has spent most of her 62 years devoted to climate activism .
""Lots of people miss their parents or dear family members over the holidays. For me, Earth Day is that holiday,"" she said.
Driven by sentimentality over her father's legacy and her own outrage over climate inaction , Nelson currently serves as a managing director at the Outrider Foundation , a Madison, Wisconsin-based organization that aims to raise awareness about the risks of climate change and nuclear weapons.
But in 2015, Nelson was publicly involved in a political dust-up while serving as executive secretary of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands. The incident culminated in a “gag” order that barred her from discussing climate change or addressing climate issues while on the job.
Tia Nelson serves as the managing director of climate for the Wisconsin-based Outrider Foundation. Kevin J. Miyazaki Four months later, Nelson resigned her position. But she hasn't backed down from difficult fights.
On the eve of the 49th Earth Day, MACH chatted with Nelson about the event’s enduring legacy, how it shaped her and what her father would find most troubling if he were alive today. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.
MACH: What does Earth Day mean to you?
Nelson: First and foremost, I miss my dad. But I think the most powerful lesson that I am reminded of each year is the power of individual action to make a difference. It certainly was successful beyond my father’s wildest dreams. It’s really interesting to reflect on how simple, grassroots actions across the country helped create awareness and, most importantly, political will to action.
What was your father’s long-term goal for Earth Day?
I don’t think he thought of it that way. He came up with the idea because he had gone out to Santa Barbara to inspect an oil spill . At the time, it was the largest oil spill in American history. And he got on a plane and picked up a Ramparts magazine — I’ve actually found the issue — and the cover of the magazine was a story about campus protesters opposed to the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. He had struggled for years to come up with an idea that would galvanize people to have a conversation about the environment. He looked at that magazine cover and he thought to himself: These campus teach-ins are affecting the way the nation is talking about the morality and justification of that war. I’m going to call for a teach-in on the environment. His hope was to shake the political establishment out of their lethargy on the threats posed to clean water, clean air and public land in America.
Related Environment Environment Global warming will cause the world's oceans to change color. Here's why. To this day, I am stopped on the street or get a note from someone to tell me that Earth Day changed their life and the career choices they made. I hear this from park service employees, I hear it from professors — they remember feeling a call to action and a brightening and awareness of the issues, and many people made choices about the direction of their life based on that experience.
How did it shape you personally?
I think I was 12 for the first Earth Day . I was in junior high school and we did a cleanup on the school grounds but I don’t remember a lot beyond that. My father and I were very close. As a young person, I had a huge crush on Bobby Kennedy and would beg my father to let me go to work with him when I didn’t have school, so I walked the Senate halls with him and followed him wherever he went. I loved hanging out with him, knowing what he was doing and observing that. But it was probably the [10th anniversary] that it really sunk in to me that this had become something that would endure. It was bigger than he was and it would be a part of his legacy and endure for what I assume will be the foreseeable future.
If he was alive now, what do you think he would have to say about where we are on environmental issues?
He certainly would be deeply distressed by the further erosion of bipartisan support for environmental protections. On that first Earth Day, Congress adjourned so every member of Congress could go home to their district and participate in an Earth Day event. He would be sad and concerned about how partisan the issue has become.
I know that he saw the right to drink clean water and breathe clean air as fundamental inalienable rights of every American, and rights that the government is obligated to protect in the same way that we expect the government to provide for our public safety and national security.
As a climate change activist, what are you reflecting on this Earth Day?
We’ve seen many improvements in the environment since that first Earth Day, but we’re faced with a climate crisis that will affect the quality of life for the human species and others. It’s a question of what type of environment we want to leave to the next generation and the generations beyond. It’s a very daunting and dire situation.
I do feel like we’ve come a long way, but I also know that we’ve missed many opportunities to turn toward clean energy and improvements in land-use practices that would have prevented what all of us are beginning to experience. It kind of doesn’t matter what hometown you live in. This is not some faraway, remote threat. It’s here and it’s impacting every community in America.
Why do think there is this persistent denial of the link between human activity and climate change?
It’s important to understand that it’s not a matter of people still thinking that way. Something changed. I have videos of Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Rudy Giuliani, Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, John McCain — all prominent Republicans — 10 years ago saying climate change is a risk to the economy and the environment. I think the question is: Why do certain leaders, largely in the Republican Party, deny something now that they didn’t deny 10 years ago?
That’s much more interesting to me because that leads you to look at a disinformation campaign run very much like tobacco companies ran their campaigns against regulating the sale of cigarettes. There’s enormous sums of money spent to spread misinformation to the public and for dirty campaign contributions to the coffers of conservative leaders who, at the end of the day, if you could get most of these guys in a private place, they’d probably tell you they actually do believe climate change is happening, But, just on ideological grounds, they want to avoid any type of government intervention in solving the crisis.
When you served as executive secretary of the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, you were effectively banned from speaking about climate change on the job. How did you navigate that and what sort of lessons did you learn from that experience?
That certainly was the most stressful period in my career. I think it’s very important that people understand that when government suppresses science, it is a severe abuse of public trust. It tested me like I’d never been tested before. I just wanted to show up, do my job, stand up for my team, stand up for the agency’s work and all I said publicly for quite some time was that I want to be judged on the record of this agency.
But just as disconcerting to me as the gag order was — simultaneous with this, [then-governor of Wisconsin] Scott Walker ordered the Department of Natural Resources to take publicly financed research off their website. It was a report that had no policy advocacy in it. It was called the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts. It was simply a report compiling the best available science on climate change impacts in Wisconsin, like on the economy, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, etc. That suppression of science — that’s really for me the most frightening. Any efforts to suppress science or suppress voices speaking about science should be strenuously objected to, because it’s a great risk to all of us, regardless of how you feel about any particular issue. You can’t make good public policy without the best available science.
What gives you hope right now?
I think about that every morning when I wake up, because it’s a hard time to be worried about this issue in this moment in American history and politics. It tests me, especially on the eve of this Earth Day and approaching the 50th anniversary, feeling like I’ve been at this a long time. There are a couple things that give me hope. The youth-led movements around the world are inspiring. The younger generation gets it. They’re demanding leadership and they’re engaged and informed and inspiring in a way I’ve never seen in my lifetime.

That’s why we’ve put together a quick overview of the new movie for the folks out there who don’t know their vibranium from their planet Vormir . (Stay with us, people!)
OK, so what exactly is this movie? That’s a good place to start, especially if you haven't been bombarded with teasers and trailers and billboards and bus ads and action figures and McDonald's tie-ins and Geico insurance spots .
“Avengers: Endgame” is the 22nd entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), a three-phase franchise that began with 2008’s “Iron Man” and has since widened its scope to include Captain America, Thor, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, Black Panther and, most recently, Captain Marvel .
“Endgame” is also the fourth and final chapter in a series of movies about the core team of superheroes, such as Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man, that began with 2012’s “The Avengers” and was followed by 2015’s “Age of Ultron” and last year’s “Infinity War.”
What’s going to happen? The plot details have been kept under wraps, leaked footage on Twitter and Reddit notwithstanding. We know “Endgame” picks up around where “Infinity War” left off. (Spoilers ahead. You’ve been warned.)
When we last saw our heroes, the purple-hued intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin, enhanced by computer generated imagery) wiped out half of all life in the universe with the snap of his fingers. “The Snappening,” as some die-hards call it.
In the wake of that downer ending, the surviving Avengers and their allies — including Iron Man, Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and an acerbic raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper — are left to pick up the pieces and find a way to resurrect their dead pals.
It's safe to assume that fight scenes will ensue. And for what it's worth, some fans have speculated that time travel might play a key role in ""Endgame.""
How much money is it expected to earn? The eternal question! Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore and a go-to expert on box-office stats, said he expects “Endgame” to debut in the range of $250 million to $275 million . It could eclipse “Infinity War” ($257 million debut) as title-holder for the biggest opening weekend in North American box-office history.
Related Pop Culture Pop Culture 'Endgame' advance ticket sales are 5 times 'Infinity War,' Fandango says It’s also poised to become one of the highest-grossing movies of all time by the end of its theatrical run, potentially putting it in the same tier as “Black Panther” ($700 million domestic lifetime gross) and “Infinity War” ($678 million).
How much did it cost to make this thing? It’s not entirely clear, and Disney (which owns Marvel Studios and distributes its titles) has been tight-lipped.
But for what it’s worth, the similarly-scaled “Infinity War” was reported to have cost somewhere in the ballpark of $300 to $400 million — roughly equivalent to the GDP of the Federated States of Micronesia , or about 17 versions of Jordan Peele’s horror smash “Us.”
How long is it? Well, it’s pretty darn long — at least by the standards of modern commercial filmmaking.
“Endgame” clocks in at a bladder-testing three hours and two minutes , making it the lengthiest Marvel movie yet. “Infinity War” previously held the record at two hours and 40 minutes. But hey, long runtimes didn’t stop “Gone with the Wind” (three hours and 58 minutes) and “Titanic” (three hours and 15 minutes) from becoming certifiable cultural phenomenons.
The mad rush to scoop up advance tickets, after all, suggests that plenty of moviegoers aren't deterred.

Starbucks in Shanghai is both cultural homogenization and a welcome taste of home when away from it,www.nbcnews.com,Lettecha Johnson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/starbucks-shanghai-both-cultural-homogenization-welcome-taste-home-when-away-ncna994101,"I currently live abroad, but my consumer experience has begun to feel more and more like the movie “Groundhog Day” with Bill Murray, only with the endless malls and chain stores you can find anywhere in America — Starbucks, McDonalds, Domino's, Dairy Queen, Pizza Hut and the like. While small shop owners do exist, you could stand on almost any corner in Shanghai, put on a blindfold, spin around, walk in whatever direction you choose and end up at what looks like the same mall as anywhere else. Chain stores and restaurants seem to multiply faster than a Gremlin drenched with a fire hose. On the bright side, I guess it can take the stress out of deciding where to go until you get familiar with the place.
That, of course, is how things can get complicated during extended travel or after becoming an expat. I love eating local food and cooking — but I am still an American, and sometimes crave a taste of home, which is where those repetitive chains can help, by easing homesickness or at least providing me with a quick meal with which I am already quite familiar.
Flying is terrible now and here's why June 3, 2018 04:54 Contrary to what you may see on Instagram, not everyone wants to eat escargot, dishes with pork or food with extreme levels of spiciness — at least not all the time. Some days you may be at the end of your budget and don't want to risk spending it on something you may not like or can’t digest properly.
And, especially for expats, in addition to comfort food, we need comfortable clothes that well… actually fit. Shopping for clothes in Asia as an American woman can be disappointing unless you have access to American chains like Old Navy or Forever 21 — stores that will have clothes and shoes that fit a typical western body.
And even the Gremlin clones had their slight differences, as do some chain locations abroad.
Related Opinion Opinion 'Clean eating' has become such a sham that fast food chains are pushing it To ease the blow of repetition or appeal more distinctly to locals, some outlets have a way of putting a more regional spin on chains that they open in other countries. Hotdogs appear to be very popular in Asia and you can order a burger with a hotdog or two inside of it at Burger King. McDonalds in Italy serves sandwiches on Ciabatta while ones in Paris also serve macaroons.
Or take Dunkin Donuts, which became my frequent neighborhood hangout while living in Shanghai. While a glazed donut and large coffee at Dunkin Donuts tastes great back in the U.S, you usually have to enjoy it to go or pray that one of the four deeply uncomfortable seats will be available. Contrast this to a Dunkin Donuts in Shanghai: Excellent coffee, plush seats, strong internet, local spin on donuts (cheers to matcha powder and that strawberry cream donut with the happy face that I can’t forget) and music fit for any party.
And why settle for pepperoni when you could have fried fish balls or squid on your Pizza Hut pizza in China?
Time abroad has given me a different perspective on these aspects of chain retail. A chain can be something that either restricts you or links you to others; it can provide certain comforts of home and also restricts the prosperity of unique businesses, regardless of global location.
That is something we’ve exported like the stores. When I was a young girl in Boston, I would stop at my local neighborhood store like clockwork after school. Doritos, chocolate bars and dusty soda cans would beckon me from the cramped aisles to sooth the period between school and homework, and they recognized my face and purchase preferences without the use of a computer algorithm. Today, such places are becoming increasingly rare and replaced with more 7-Elevens.
And I remember one popular and slightly grungy neighborhood coffee shop near my college alma mater; it lost a street turf battle to Starbucks, but not because it had lesser-quality coffee. Or there was the time, after a move to Los Angeles, that my taste buds were tantalized by the presence of a refreshingly normal and unpretentious diner near Santa Monica Pier that specialized in pie. A short time later, I went back in search of another slice to find the diner had faded away into Hollywood history.
KFC signs on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Ariana Lindquist / Bloomberg via Getty Images I live in Vietnam right now, which has Starbucks in addition to a strong local coffee scene, where tons of unique coffee shops dominate. At first, I thought that the coffee shop Cong CaPhe in Saigon was a solo coffee shop; it turns out that it is also a part of a chain. I guess the super cozy interior, old tattered books on the wall and wooden furniture at both locations fooled me.
Is there a solution to avoid local places being strangled by the chain? While we may have little control over the inflated commercial real estate prices that often play a hand in smothering unique stores around the world, consumers can still do our part to keep them afloat, both at home and abroad. Let’s try to treat small businesses like truly beloved family members or friends; don’t wait until they fade away to cry at their funeral. Love them now and loudly tell others how great they are while they are here. And, when abroad, try to make an effort to support the local stores, even when you need a taste of home.
Speaking of which, it is time for me to get a Banh Bao from a local cafe.

Giuliani: Americans had 'right to know' the contents of Democratic emails hacked by Russians,www.nbcnews.com,Ben Kamisar,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/giuliani-americans-had-right-know-contents-clinton-emails-hacked-russians-n996781,"WASHINGTON — Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for President Donald Trump, suggested Sunday that the American people had a “right to know” about the private Democratic emails released during a state-sponsored hack by the Russian government aimed at bolstering Trump’s 2016 election. During an interview on “Meet the Press” days after special counsel Robert Mueller’s partially redacted report was released , Giuliani said the American people were better off with an inside glimpse into Hillary Clinton’s campaign operation — regardless of the source of the leak.
Giuliani says 'nothing wrong' with taking information from Russia after Mueller report April 21, 2019 01:50 He compared the hacked information to the Pentagon Papers, which shed light on controversy surrounding the Vietnam War.
“They shouldn’t have stolen it, but the American people were just given more information about how deceptive, how manipulative her campaign was,” Giuliani said. “I wonder if there isn’t an argument that the people had a right to know that about Hillary Clinton.”
The Mueller report, released on Thursday, details how the Russian government “interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion” with intrusions including the hack of the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign chairman.
Related Politics What is in the Mueller report? Your guide to the special counsel's findings While it found the Russians “worked to secure” Trump’s election and that his campaign “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election activities.”
The document dumps included internal deliberations by campaign and national party staffers, including some that exacerbated rifts between supporters of I-Vt., and the Democratic Party.
Giuliani denied knowing during the campaign that the emails were stolen by Russian actors or “participating” in the Russian government’s manipulation. But when asked whether he believed it was acceptable for political campaigns to work with material stolen by foreign adversaries, Giuliani replied, “It depends on the stolen material.”
On top of an extensive look at the Russians’ plan to aid the Trump campaign, Mueller’s report also analyzed whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice.
Related Politics Trump failed at obstruction because his aides refused to carry out orders, Mueller finds Mueller declined to file such a charge, but noted that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
That statement led some Democrats, including presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., to call on the House to begin impeachment proceedings.
The report details numerous times where “the President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful … largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
In one instance, the report details how White House Counsel Don McGahn declined to follow through with Trump’s order to fire Mueller.
During his “Meet the Press” interview, Giuliani argued that Trump had “a perfect right to fire Mueller” and called the report “really sloppy.”
He also questioned the focus on the damaging information on Trump contained in the report, pointing to the decision by Mueller not to charge Trump with any crimes and calling Trump “innocent.”

Suzanne Garment: Is the Mueller report really a road map for Trump's impeachment?,www.nbcnews.com,Suzanne Garment,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/mueller-report-really-road-map-trump-s-impeachment-ncna996601,"People are now calling the just-released report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller a “road map” for deciding whether or how to impeach President Donald Trump — that is, an evidence summary that the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment would begin, can use as a guide. As the committee's chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler , said on Thursday: Mueller's report seemed to have been written “with the intent of providing Congress a roadmap” to investigate Trump for obstruction of justice. But the term is actually borrowed from a previous road map , sent to another House Judiciary Committee in 1974 by Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski’s grand jury as a guide to the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon.
That 1974 road map was indeed used by the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment. The committee had the authority to hold the president accountable by impeaching him — but didn’t have the kind of evidence that the grand jury had developed. Accordingly, Jaworski and the grand jury crafted the sparely written “just the facts” road map; and Judge John Sirica authorized its transmission to the committee under seal.
But that was then and this is now. The condition of the road has gravely deteriorated in the intervening years.
Chaotic as the end of Watergate was, the two years of the Trump presidency have left Washington with even less capacity for coherent action.
Chaotic as the end of Watergate was, the two years of the Trump presidency have left Washington with even less capacity for coherent action. So, Mueller’s road map may be less likely to serve as a model for actual articles of impeachment than a big headache for Trump’s opponents. It will be a miracle if they manage to get themselves a strategy, let alone execute it, before the Mueller report is submerged in the 2020 presidential campaign. With today’s warp-speed political calendar, the election is virtually upon us.
Another big problem has also emerged: The Democratic leadership has shown a marked reluctance to impeach the president. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed this sentiment sharply: “He’s just not worth it.” But how can Democrats avoid the imperative to begin impeachment proceedings in light of the seriousness of the misdeeds outlined in the Mueller report?
In 1974, Democrats trying to decide whether to impeach Nixon also faced a difficult timing problem. Nixon’s public support remained substantial until the spring of 1974. If he had lasted until the 1974 midterm elections, and if Republicans had scored gains in those elections, the steam might well have started to seep out of the impeachment effort. It took the smoking gun tape , released August 5, 1974, to break the spine of Nixon’s defense and save the impeachment efforts.
Because things are moving so much faster now, the Democrats, like the Mueller report, must operate in real, constrained time. They will have to decide about every aspect of their effort — what hearings to hold, what witnesses to call, what arguments to use — even as the presidential race revs up.
SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE
They will be forced to do so without any real secrecy and in the face of the millions of Americans who remain Trump loyalists . Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidates will most surely want their own messages, not the impeachment news, to command the media. That doesn’t even count the fact that Republicans control the Senate, which would have to convict the president by a two-thirds vote.
It may be no accident that the Watergate road map, unlike the Mueller report, remained secret for 45 years after it was created — until the National Archives recently released it under a court order. The report included valuable grand jury testimony, provided with the vigorous assent of the grand jurors themselves.
In contrast, we don’t as yet have grand jury information connected to the Muller report, since Trump’s has redacted all of it and refused to take the needed step of asking the court to release it. True, this situation may change — which is another part of the messiness in working in real time.
Fmr. Watergate Legal Counsel on legal standard for impeachment April 19, 2019 05:30 Meanwhile, Barr appears to have done just about everything he could to create the Trump administration’s very own Mueller report narrative. Just before the report was to be released, Barr held a news conference to explain — as he had already twice before — that Mueller found no collusion, or conspiracy or coordination. The attorney general announced, yet again, that Mueller “did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” on obstruction and that Barr had concluded there was none. Trump, Barr said sympathetically, was under unjustified attack. Yet, in Barr’s view, Trump “fully cooperated,” showing “non-corrupt motives” that “weigh heavily against” obstruction charges.
But that’s not what the Mueller report said.
For one thing, Mueller didn’t simply or inexplicably decline to come to a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” — generally described as “put up or shut up.” Instead, Mueller’s decision was clearly based on the Justice Department’s policy that a sitting president can’t be indicted . Next, the report made equally clear that Mueller hadn’t refrained from doing this so that Barr could. Instead, the report looked to Congress as the body with the authority to adjudicate the facts presented.
Related Opinion Opinion Mueller report says no collusion, but reveals how often Trump must be saved from himself More than that, the Mueller report described a president who, far from fully cooperating, gave “inadequate” answers to written questions and refused to sit for an interview. It described a president whose efforts to interfere with the investigation were largely unsuccessful only because the people he ordered to interfere tended to ignore him.
It wasn’t easy. In a meeting with Trump, his then-White House Counsel Don McGahn took notes. “Lawyers don’t take notes,” Trump told him. “I never had a lawyer who took notes .” “I’m a real lawyer,” McGahn answered. “I’ve had a lot of great lawyers,” Trump countered. “Like Roy Cohn . He didn’t take notes.”
A man with that idea of lawyering, based on an infamous litigator who was ultimately disbarred, will be hard to educate on the difference between prudent and crazy, let alone right and wrong.
The Mueller report confirms, in spades, what journalism has been saying about Trump and his presidency. The report’s very force, however, creates pressure on Democrats to do something politically dangerous.
There’s never a real road map for that.

House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler won't rule out impeachment for Trump,www.nbcnews.com,Ben Kamisar,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/house-judiciary-chair-jerrold-nadler-won-t-rule-out-impeachment-n996796,"WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Sunday did not rule out the prospect of impeaching President Donald Trump over allegations detailed in the Mueller report , arguing Congress has to see the full unredacted report. Nadler, D-N.Y., said in an interview on Sunday’s “Meet The Press” that Congress will “have to hear from” both Attorney General William Barr and special counsel Robert Mueller, as well as obtain the unredacted report before coming to a conclusion on impeachment.
Nadler oversees the committee with jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings.
“Some of this would be impeachable,” Nadler said of the accusations detailed in the report, which was released Thursday. “Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable.”
Mueller’s report analyzed both the Russian government’s attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, as well as the question of whether Trump or his top allies tried to obstruct the investigation.
While Mueller wrote that “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government,” he did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction of justice.
Related Politics Trump failed at obstruction because his aides refused to carry out orders, Mueller finds “The President’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,” Mueller wrote .
Among those efforts were attempts to fire the special counsel and the firing of FBI Director James Comey.
In one instance, Mueller’s report says that White House counsel Don McGahn refused to fire Mueller despite an order from Trump. And when that encounter was eventually reported publicly, McGahn refused Trump’s request to deny the story.
Nadler on Sunday added that on top of hearing from Mueller and Barr, Congress will call McGahn to testify.
He also questioned why Mueller didn't charge Donald Trump Jr. ""and others"" who met with Russians during an infamous meeting at Trump Tower that they believed to be about obtaining dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
""He said that he didn't charge them because you couldn't prove that they willfully intended to commit a crime,"" Nadler said of Mueller.
""All you have to prove for conspiracy is that they entered into a meeting of the minds to do something wrong and had one overt act. They entered into a meeting of the minds to attend a meeting to get stolen material on Hillary. They went to the meeting, that's conspiracy.""
In a statement released Thursday, Donald Trump Jr.'s attorney, Alan Futerfas, argued that the report exonerated his client.
""The Report confirms that the June 9, 2016 meeting was just what Don said it was, and nothing more, and that there was nothing improper about potentially listening to information,"" he said.
While Mueller declined to file a charge on obstruction against President Trump, he wrote that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
The report also notes that a “criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President’s capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.”
Based on that comment, some Democrats, including presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass., have already begun to call for impeachment proceedings based on the report. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote Thursday night in a letter to members that they will discuss the next step forward but promised that “Congress will not be silent.”
But the president’s allies believe that the Mueller report should be the final step in the process and that the decision not to indict the president means that Congress shouldn’t continue investigating him.
Also on “Meet the Press,” presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani argued that the report shows Trump is “innocent.” He defended Trump’s attempts to fire the special counsel as within his rights and argued that the “sloppy” report was biased against the president.

Pickleball: The fastest growing sport you've never heard of,www.nbcnews.com,Amanda Loudin,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/pickleball-fastest-growing-sport-you-ve-never-heard-ncna992106,"One of the fastest growing sports in America involves a court and a net. And, no, it's not tennis or badminton, it's pickleball. Yes, that pickleball, the one your grandma plays, and the one you may consider beneath your athletic pay grade. Time to rethink that. Pickleball has had a 650 percent increase in numbers over the last six years, according to USA Pickleball Association (USAPA) . The biggest subset of that growth is not in the over-60 crowd, says Justin Maloof, executive director of USAPA, but the younger set. “When the sport first caught on in the sunbelt states around 2009, it was at 55-plus centers and RV communities,” he says. “It snowballed from there. But these days, there are many municipalities and parks and rec departments that are setting up courts, making it accessible to a younger crowd.”
That’s how 49-year old Rocky Brown first learned of the sport. The Woodbine, Md., real estate professional gave the game a try through his local parks and recreation department and before he knew it, Brown was hooked. “I fell in love with it, found a league and soon was playing five days a week,” he says. “I wanted to help it grow locally, so I became the league director.”
Now Brown oversees a league that plays on multiple days per week and offers beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. The Wednesday night, intermediate league now has 120 players, up from just 30 a couple of years ago. And while there are certainly senior citizens in the league, there are plenty of middle-aged and younger participants moving around the courts as well.
A pickleball player participates in the 2017 USAPA National Championships in Arizona. Tom Gottfried / ASAPA file What is pickleball exactly? For the uninitiated, pickleball is something of a mix between tennis, racquetball and ping pong. Players use special paddles and a wiffle ball, and games take place on tennis courts with specific pickleball lines. Nets and court sizes are smaller than their tennis counterparts, and the most common game is doubles, although singles is also an option. It has its own set of quirky rules — for instance, try to stay out of the “kitchen”— but they’re easy to learn.
Josh Jenkins, who is Brown’s 30-year old partner and plays in professional tournaments around the country, says the game appeals for several reasons. “For one, it’s very social,” he says. “You’ll see a big mix of demographics out there.”
Another factor Jenkins appreciates is its mental component. “You need to out-think your opponent,” he says. “There’s a lot of strategy that goes into playing.”
The game is also quick, making it a convenient way to get in some exercise. Games in a typical league run only 15 minutes each — you can get in as little or as much as you want. Brown likes to go for broke. “I wear my fitness tracker when I play and after two hours, I’ve moved the equivalent of four miles of walking,” he says. “But the nice thing is that if you’re playing doubles, you can get in a workout without killing yourself.”
I wear my fitness tracker when I play and after two hours, I’ve moved the equivalent of four miles of walking.

Pickleball is inexpensive and requires minimal gear Pickleball is also affordable, making it accessible to all. A beginner can pick up a basic wooden paddle and balls at retailers like Dick’s Sporting Goods or on Amazon for around $30, although prices for composite paddles can run into the hundreds of dollars. As the game grows and spreads throughout the country, access to many municipal courts is free, and even league play is relatively cheap when compared to other racquet sports.
Because most pickleball games are played on retrofitted tennis courts, it’s quick and easy for a parks and recreation department to get the game up and running, too. “You don’t need dedicated courts, so with some tape and a portable net, you can be good to go within a half hour,” says Maloof.
All of these factors are contributing to the rapid growth the sport is enjoying, but so too is a push from USAPA. “We’ve got over 1,800 ambassadors out there spreading the word,” says Maloof. “We’ve also got a ‘places to play’ database all over the country, and the sport is getting a good deal of attention from media right now.”
There’s no shortage of information available for the beginner on up to the elite, from a dedicated YouTube channel, to a bi-monthly magazine, and even books on the topic. Jenkins, for his part, has co-authored a children’s book on the sport called “Pickleball with Pop,” aimed at drawing kids into the game.
There’s even the first pickleball-themed restaurant, Chicken N Pickle, a combo of indoor/outdoor courts, a chicken, beef and pork restaurant that also serves craft beers. The pickleball-playing owners launched the first location in Kansas City, have expanded to Wichita, and will soon open in San Antonio.
Pickleball is for everyone Brown says that pickleball is a great family sport, too. The father of twin nine-year olds, he loves getting the entire family out on the court. “Anyone can play, from eight-year olds up to 100-year olds,” he says. “It’s great for hand-eye coordination for younger kids.”
As to the sport’s future, Jenkins sees no signs of it slowing down and eventually envisions it as a varsity sport. “It’s already an intramural sport on many college campuses,” he says, “and because it is affordable, it would be a natural progression for it to get to high schools.”

"Biden and Bernie lead early polls, but don't place bets yet",www.nbcnews.com,Dante Chinni,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/biden-bernie-lead-early-polls-don-t-place-bets-yet-n996761,"It’s Easter Sunday of 2019, but many political watchers are already looking ahead to 2020 and who will win the Democratic nomination to face off against President Donald Trump. Many of the polls are laying out a pretty clear pecking order nationally and some familiar names are leading the way.
Many of the polls are laying out a pretty clear pecking order nationally and some familiar names are leading the way. He hasn’t officially jumped into the race yet, but former Vice President Joe Biden leads the Democratic field at 30 percent, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. Behind Biden is Vermont who finished second in the 2016 nominating process, at 22.5 percent.
Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris are a bit further back at 8.8 percent and 8.5 percent respectively. And behind them sit South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, both at 6 percent, with New Jersey Sen. Corey Booker at 3.5 percent.
But before you run off to Vegas and bet the kid’s college fund or make bold predictions, a few words of caution: Beware early polls. The 2020 cycle is just getting started and previous election cycles suggest he or she who leads in spring before an election year does not always end up carrying the flag on Election Day.
Take a look at the last two men to win the Oval Office, starting with Barack Obama.
Take a look at the last two men to win the Oval Office, starting with Barrack Obama. Back in April of 2007, Sen. Barack Obama was in second place among Democrats in the Real Clear Politics polling average. And it wasn’t very close; he was nearly 10 percentage points behind frontrunner Sen. Hillary Clinton. In fact, Obama was closer to third-place candidate John Edwards than he was to Clinton.
That all changed in the months after, as Obama became a political phenomenon and went on to capture the nomination and the presidency.
You can see a similar dynamic in play with Donald Trump in the spring of 2015.
You can see a similar dynamic in play with Donald Trump in the spring of 2015. Trump didn’t officially join the presidential race until June 16 of that year and didn’t make his first appearance in the Real Clear Politics polling until late-May. He started slowly, first sitting in ninth place, but climbed quickly once he entered the fray officially. He overcame a deep GOP field on his way to the White House.
The fact that Trump wasn’t even in the race at this point in the 2016 cycle should serve as a point of caution for those looking to make predictions about 2020. Things can change, fast.
However, astute observers will also notice those two election cycles are different from 2020 in at least one key aspect. They were both races with no incumbent. By all estimations, the next presidential race will feature Donald Trump seeking a second term. And using that particular scenario, the better comparison for 2020 may actually be 2012, when Obama was up for re-election.
Those 2012 numbers look a little different.
Those 2012 numbers look a little different. In April of 2011, the leader in the Republican field was former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. He didn’t have a commanding advantage — it was a big GOP field in that cycle — but he led former Rep. Newt Gingrich by about 7 points. And, of course, months later Romney would go on to win the Republican nomination.
It wasn’t necessarily easy. He was challenged episodically before he won the right to be the Republican standard-bearer. Texas Gov. Rick Perry led in the polls for a while, as did businessman Herman Cain, Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. But Romney kept bouncing back to take the lead and eventually took the nomination.
Is there a lesson in that path for the Democrats in 2020? Maybe.
It could be that when there is an open White House, such as in 2008 and 2016, voters are more likely to take a chance on someone new, like Obama and Trump. It is, after all, an opportunity to make a clean break and try something different. But when it is one party trying to unseat another, such as 2012 and, well, 2020, voters may be more likely to go with a known commodity … like current leader Joe Biden.
But, hold on, Biden isn’t the only known commodity on that 2020 list. Remember Bernie Sanders wound up finishing a close second in 2016 to eventual nominee Hillary Clinton.
And remember too, this next campaign will take place in the age of Trump, where social media and small donors have remade the world of politics.
All of which is to say, read the polls if you want, but remember it’s early. A month ago, you probably didn’t know how to spell Buttigieg. You still might not, but he’s climbed up to fifth place in the polls.

"Ancestry.com ad pulled, criticized for sugarcoating slavery",www.nbcnews.com,Janell Ross,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/ancestry-com-ad-pulled-criticized-sugarcoating-slavery-n996771,"The Ancestry.com ad begins with a couple - a young black woman and young white man - clad in mid 19th century clothing, running through what looks like an alley. The couple stops. The man holds up a ring. “Abigail,” the man says, “We can escape...Will you leave with me.” The young woman gets out only a fraction of one word, “I...,” before the point of this ad becomes clear. Ancestry.com, which claims to have the world’s largest consumer DNA database, says stories like 'Abigail's' would be lost to history if people didn't trace their roots using their service.
In the days since it began to air in the United States, critics have described it as a sanitized and inaccurate depiction of American life designed to obscure the brutality of slavery. In doing so, historians and advertising industry insiders say, the ad campaign illuminates a set of very modern, ongoing American problems with race.
Late Thursday, Ancestry pulled the ad from its YouTube channel, scuttled a TV airing schedule and late Friday offered more information about the thought processes behind the ad.
“Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history...both those that are positive and those that are more difficult but equally as important,” the privately-owned Utah company wrote in an emailed statement. “Many of our ad campaigns are based on factual historical events. This ad was intended to represent a love story between two people who were not able to marry in the United States in the late 1800s and wanted to migrate to Canada, which had no blatant laws banning interracial marriage .”
But ads, like anything else created by human beings, involve choices. Choices have meaning.
“What’s really going on here,” said Daina Ramey Berry, a historian and professor at the University of Texas- Austin who wrote the books “Enslaved Women in America” and ‘The Price for Their Pound of Flesh,” “is that the people behind these ads want to feel comfortable and find a happy place. They think this is who I would be. I would be the white man helping this black woman. Here’s a positive story about slavery. It’s “The Greenbook” of ads. It really is.”
“The Greenbook,” a 2018 feature film, won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. It’s also been criticized for distorting history in a way which rendered segregation and its violent enforcement a trivial matter best overcome with personal integrity, grit and the guiding hand of a wise and brave white friend .
The Ancestry ad, created by the Toronto arm of Anomaly -- an advertising agency with offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Shanghai -- first aired on Canadian television in early April. Anomaly did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
The ad wasn’t controversial in Canada, a source familiar with Ancestry’s internal operations told NBC BLK. The person spoke on condition on anonymity. In fact, the ad generating such significant spikes in website traffic that an Ancestry executive through the commercial should be deployed south. However, when the Ancestry executive was warned that the ad would likely offend, the executive dismissed the information.
On Tuesday the ad began airing in the United States, the company said. By Thursday, the controversy had mushroomed.
“Ancestry will not comment on speculation about internal company matters,” Ancestry.com wrote in an emailed statement.""
In reality, the average slave was bought or traded an average of three to five times before death, said Berry, the slave experience expert. That disconnected slaves from family, friends and all the physical places and routines they had previously known. Slaves were sometimes beaten nearly to death. Men and women, girls and boys endured sexual abuse .
Slave women often wore layers of tattered clothing in an attempt to cover their bodies. Slave girls were taught not to “let nobody touch your principle,” but most were raped , repeatedly beginning around the age of 13 or 14 . Slave owners and physicians studied and experimented on slaves -- mostly in the interest of forcing as many pregnancies as possible. Those children could be sold, traded and exploited with impunity so mothers often loved their babies ferociously and missed and worried about them for decades . Although regarded as chattel, slave women were forced to feed their enslavers’ white children from their breasts, perform hard labor during and immediately after pregnancy.
When slaves ran for freedom, they did so at great peril, usually alone or in the company of other black people, sometimes with a lover or (not legally recognized) spouse . Some found help along the Underground Railroad. Most did it on their own while pursued by armed men and dogs. Runaway slaves often went days without food, hid out in swamps, crevaces and caves . There were few opportunities for rueful moments, indecision and rings.
All of that is apparent, if one actually reads slave testimonies, examines the many ads placed by enslavers trying to recapture valuable slaves, Berry said. It’s also clear in census records and how many 19th century black families include mixed race members, even if there is no box to check indicating that most of those children were the result of rapes. Many of those records are available on Ancestry.com.
“When I saw this ad, it honestly made the hairs on my arm stand up,” Berry said. “That’s how bad this is. The most common interactions between white men and black women during slavery were rape. That’s really the most common story.”
Ancestry, like many companies, ranks attracting a larger number of black and Latino customers among its goals, according to the source familiar with Ancestry’s operations who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity. In Ancestry’s case, it’s a business imperative. The DNA profiles the company sells rely on comparison samples from a large and diverse collection of people . Commercial DNA databases do not include a sufficient number of black, Latino and Asian samples to provide the level of detail available to white consumers .
“...Ancestry is committed to serving a diverse range of customers,” the company said in an emailed statement. The statement also included a list of activities and a film funded by the company related to black life, “and who seek to explore their own personal journeys of discovery and to building an internal culture that is aligned with that goal.”
In the wake of the controversial ad, suggestions that Ancestry and other companies need to hire a more diverse workforce have proliferated. Jenelle Coy, the founder and managing partner of the advertising firm Spero, sees something more.
""I think it’s time to recognize it’s more complex than that. These kinds of problems are about hiring and they are about hearing. It’s about listening to the people in the room once you have hired and re-engineering leadership so that knowledge matters and when that one person of color in the room does speak up there isn’t a penalty. That’s when these ads stop happening.”

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE Feb. 27, 2019, 4:07 PM GMT By Paul A. Eisenstein While North Korean leader Kim Jong Un chose to travel by train to Vietnam this week for his second summit with President Donald Trump, he switched to a different set of wheels once across the Vietnamese border: his heavily armored — and luxuriously outfitted — Mercedes-Maybach S600. While Kim's limousine may stand out in a country that views itself as a worker's paradise, some signs of emerging capitalism have begun to pop up in the Communist state, including privately owned vehicles produced by a handful of North Korean manufacturers and imported from Russia. Precisely how many vehicles are produced and sold in what is officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea isn’t known. The historically secretive government has declined to provide data to the Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d’Automobiles, the industry group that tracks global production and sales. But various estimates suggest North Korea can produce as many as 50,000 vehicles annually — including passenger cars, buses and trucks. But the numbers have been running substantially lower in recent years due to the country’s sanction-hit economy. Watch North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's motorcade roll into Hanoi Feb. 27, 2019 01:00 The first and largest of the country’s motor vehicle companies is Sungri Motors, which produces a mix of products but is primarily focused on commercial vehicles, like the ZR 5000 Dumping Truck. But it does produce a few passenger models, such as the Jaju, essentially a clone of an old version of Volkswagen’s Passat, and the Achimkoy, a clone of a Russian sedan. The big player in the small market is Pyeonghwa Motors, a joint venture based in the industrial center of Nampo. It was set up in 1999, during one of the thaws in relations between North and South Korea. It was initially funded by Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church. Considering the late reverend’s vocal opposition to communism, that might seem an odd alliance, but he envisioned it as a way to foster long-elusive reconciliation between the longtime foes. The company’s name itself means “peace,” in Korean. Unfortunately for Moon and company, profits have proved as elusive as peace on the Korean peninsula. The church abandoned its stake in Pyeonghwa in 2013. Pyeonghwa Motors produced a grand total of 1,600 cars in 2018, according to one report . And the vehicles it rolls out are decidedly less luxurious than the one the country’s leader travels in. While some new technologies, such as rear parking assist, are now available on some models, base models don’t even offer air conditioning. Prices start as low as $10,000, which might seem a bargain, but one has to balance that against the average income of a North Korean, which is estimated to be around $1,300 a year . That puts even a base model out of the reach of all but a small elite group of North Koreans — and those largely based in the capital Pyongyang. As the U.S. has shown, there’s always a market for automotive imports. And North Korea has allowed some in from time to time. Back in the 1970s, Kim’s grandfather authorized the import of 100 Volvos, though the deal remains the center of a dispute, with the Swedes claiming they were never paid. Back in 2007, Kim’s father, Kim Jong Il, reportedly ordered Japanese-made cars taken off the road after seeing one broken down and blocking the road. A car drives through Pyongyang, North Korean, on Sept. 18, 2013. Jonas Gratzer / LightRocket via Getty Images file Today, the Russians provide most of North Korea’s auto imports, primarily through Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod, also known as GAZ. Like their Cuban counterparts who are also limited by sanctions, North Korean motorists have become adept at keeping even the most ancient of motor vehicles running. Leading up to this week’s summit, Trump suggested that what is often called the Hermit Kingdom could transform its economy by agreeing to a peace deal and opening up to the rest of the world. The current Supreme Leader doesn’t have to look far to see what that could mean — especially from an automotive front. Six decades ago, in the wake of the Korean War, the southern half of the peninsula was an economic wreck. Today, it is one of the world’s industrial powerhouses, with a thriving automotive industry and auto market. Officials from Hyundai, South Korea's largest automaker, have explored joint opportunities with the North on several occasions and few would be surprised if they didn’t reach out again in the future. But, for now, North Korea remains one of the world’s smallest automotive markets, with all but a small cadre of elite able to afford a car. Paul A. Eisenstein"
Mueller investigated whether Trump attended a 2016 chess championship with Russians,www.nbcnews.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mueller-investigated-whether-trump-attended-2016-chess-championship-alongside-russians-n996786,"Buried in special counsel Robert Mueller's 400-plus page report is the question of whether then-president-elect Donald Trump attended a 2016 championship chess tournament — an event that came under scrutiny as Mueller probed possible collusion between Trump's orbit and the Russian government. Although Trump said he did not attend the event, he told Mueller in written answers that he became ""aware of documents indicating"" that then-president of the World Chess Federation (FIDE) Kirsan Ilyumzhinov — a sanctioned Russian power player — invited the Trump Organization in March 2016 to host the tournament at Trump Tower.
""I do not remember having been asked to attend the World Chess Championship gala, and I did not attend the event,"" Trump told Mueller. ""During the course of preparing to respond to these questions, I have become aware of documents indicating that in March of 2016, the president of the World Chess Federation invited the Trump Organization to host, at Trump Tower, the 2016 World Chess Championship Match to be held in New York in November 2016.""
Related Politics Mueller report shows Russians, Trump camp were friends with benefits. Collusion by another name? ""I have also become aware that in November 2016, there were press inquiries to my staff regarding whether I had plans to attend the tournament, which was not being held at Trump Tower,"" he continued. ""I understand these documents have already been provided to you.""
Mueller reported that the tournament, which featured a Russian grandmaster chess player and took place just after the 2016 election, was attended by the likes of Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, and Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian sovereign wealth fund.
Dmitriev flew to New York for the event and invited George Nader, a Middle Eastern businessman who was questioned by Mueller for meetings with Trump allies, to join him for the opening of the tournament. Nader helped arrange a backchannel meeting between Dmitriev and Blackwater founder Erik Prince, a Trump-ally and brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, which took place in Seychelles.
On the morning of November 9, 2016, Mueller wrote that Dmitriev contacted Nader to request a meeting with ""key people"" close to Trump ""as soon as possible in light of the '[g]reat results'"" of Trump's electoral victory. Dmitriev asked Nader ""to convey to the incoming Administration that 'we want to start rebuilding the relationship in whatever is a comfortable pace for them.'""

""Dmitriev invited Nader to the opening of the tournament and noted that, if there was 'a chance to see anyone key from Trump camp,' he 'would love to start building for the future,'"" Mueller wrote, adding that Dmitriev ""also asked Nader to invite [Jared] Kushner to the event so that [Dmitriev] could meet him.""
Nader did not pass along Dmitriev's invitation, Mueller wrote.
Related Media Russian media mocks 'lackluster' Mueller report and media 'meltdown' Although a World Chess Federation official ""recalled hearing from an attendee that President-Elect Trump had stopped by the tournament,"" Mueller said his investigation ""did not establish that Trump or any Campaign or Transition Team official attended the event"" and that Trump denied attending in his written answers.
Nader, meanwhile, said Dmitriev ""continued to press him to set up a meeting with transition officials"" and ""was particularly focused on Kushner and [Donald] Trump Jr.""
Earlier on November 9, a person whose name was redacted from the report to hide an investigative technique wrote to Dmitriev ""Putin has won"" after Trump's victory.
Ilya Merenzon, the tournament's organizer, told NBC News in an email that Ilyumzhinov invited the president's business to host the event in his personal capacity, adding that ""FIDE and organizers did not have anything to do with it.""
Merenzon added: ""It's a standard procedure for the World Chess Championship to invite the head of state where the World Chess Championship is held.""
Trump was a subject of discussion during the 2016 event, which was also attended by tech entrepreneur and Trump supporter Peter Thiel. In 1995 , the last time the chess championship was held in New York City prior to the 2016 tournament, Trump made the ceremonial first move at a qualifying event held in Trump Tower.
In the month before the 2016 election, Trump rankled the American chess community when he wrongly stated that the U.S. has no chess grandmasters , saying that you had to be ""a grand chess master"" to withdraw the nation from a trade pact ""and we don't have any of them.""
Trump has been extremely critical of the Mueller report in the days since a redacted version was released by the Justice Department. On Twitter , Trump said the report ""was written as nastily as possible"" and called it a ""total 'hit job' which should never have been allowed to start in the first place!""
At the end of his section on Russian interference and possible collusion, Mueller wrote that while his investigation ""established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government,"" the probe ""did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference.""

Nick Little / for NBC News Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 21, 2019, 3:29 PM GMT By Kalhan Rosenblatt In mid-April, Gemma McLean noticed that her Instagram account was getting some stealthy attention from her ex-boyfriend. Instagram’s stories feature lets users see who has viewed their posts, and McLean saw that her ex had viewed her stories for four days in a row. So she decided to make sure he knew she could see his snooping. McLean posted a screenshot to her Instagram story of the television show “Riverdale” with the message: “Hey PSA: if ur my ex I dumped in literal 2012 when I was still at high school: I can see u checking my insta story everyday lmfao.” Such is the tangled web that Instagram users now weave thanks to a small feature that has developed an outsize impact on the social zeitgeist. “My thought process was honestly just getting the message across to him that I can see him being a creep without having to actually talk to him in the hopes that he would stop,” McLean, 24, who lives in New Zealand, said. “Nothing like being lowkey publicly humiliated to put you in your place.” There’s a riverdale screen cap for every occasion pic.twitter.com/SktTi1kenM — 𝓖𝓮𝓶𝓶𝓪 (@chiisaitamago) April 14, 2019 Instagram first introduced stories in 2016 and now more than 500 million users access it daily. Stories allow users to compile pictures, video and text snippets throughout the day, with those posts available for only 24 hours unless the users asks to save them. But stories has a quirk rarely seen in social media. Users generally have to make a conscious decision to look at another person’s story by tapping on the small bubbles that appear at the top of the app, and the people who post stories can see which users opted to see their posts. While that might sound like a small detail, it has given rise to a peculiar social dynamic, creating a cat-and-mouse game for users looking to catch exes, crushes, former friends and parents looking at their posts. Tales of teens and young adults wondering about why a certain person, like a new boyfriend’s ex-girlfriend, is watching their Instagram story are now commonplace on sites like Reddit and Twitter. Others have posted about their excitement when they catch their crush watching their stories. But the stories feature has also been something of a reality check. For younger people who have grown up with social media, stories have provided a window into just how many people are actually seeing their posts. McLean said Instagram’s stories feature has given her a private glimpse of who’s looking at what she posts on the platform — not just who decides to publicly comment or tap a heart. “It is also handy to be able to see if unsavory folk are being nosy so you can take the best course of action,” McLean said, adding that the feature can help her identify people she needs to block. Why we love to look Stories first appeared on the messaging app Snapchat, but were soon copied by Instagram, Facebook and a variety of other social media platforms. Instagram’s stories feature has outperformed its competitors, even surpassing Snapchat, according to CNBC . While other apps like Snapchat and Facebook allow users to see who has watched their stories, Instagram has dominated the feature. Instagram declined to comment to NBC News for this story. Stories are beloved and used religiously, and it has also caused people to adjust their behaviors on the app. Instagram has already been criticized for its propensity to exacerbate some of human nature’s worst social media instincts, and the stories feature adds another layer to the issue. While the main Instagram feed can play into insecurities and warped beauty standards , the stories feature preys upon user’s desire to know their exact social status. TODAY anchors look back on their 1st Instagram posts April 3, 2019 01:27 One reason we have a need to know who’s looking is the drive to know where we fit in in our social world, according to Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center . “We care about who responds because we place different weighting on who responds,” Rutledge said. “By knowing who [the people looking] are and recognizing people, we enhance the emotional engagement factor.” The other component is the dopamine hit people get when they get feedback from a social media post, Carrie Goldman , an author, educator and speaker, specializing in social media behaviors and bullying prevention, said. “When teens are putting out their stories, the motivation is the dopamine hit they get and the reward in their brain when they see people are looking at it,” Goldman said. “It’s a direct dopamine hit and that’s true for adults, too.” Experts say that the ability to see who is looking at your Instagram story gives teens and young adults some sense of where they fall in their social hierarchies. But some users say for them, it’s just fun to know who is going out of their way to view their content. McLean, who noticed her ex-boyfriend watching her stories, said she has no plans to outright block him from her page. “It’s honestly mostly hilarious to me that he still thinks of me after all this time,” she said. “Representing myself” When Sophie Evans posted a picture of herself and her partner to her Instagram story in recent weeks, she was doing more than sharing an image with friends — she was hatching a small social experiment. Evans, 24, who lives in Wales, was fishing for answers to a question about who was looking at her posts, and she noticed the ex-girlfriend of a colleague had been watching. That person didn’t follow Evans and had a private account, leaving Evans to deduce that the ex-girlfriend was manually searching for her account in order to watch her stories. “I love the fact I can see who’s looking at me especially when I know they’re not following me on Instagram,” Evans said. “I sometimes post stories deliberately so I can actually see who is viewing me and if they follow me or not.” Imani Gayden, 24, a social worker in Las Vegas, often switches the settings on her profile between public and private. She said she’s been on Instagram for the past seven years, but recently started using it more. Gayden said she’s careful about what she posts on her story, knowing some of her family members can see her posts. Instagram recently introduced a feature that allows users to share their stories with only “close friends.” “I want to share what I’m doing but make sure I’m representing myself well,” Gayden said. Evans and Gayden said they have both checked out Instagram profiles that they didn’t follow, scoping out the content of a mutual friend or distant connection, but Gayden said she’s careful not to view the person’s story. “I try not to watch their story because that lets you know I’ve been on their page,” Gayden said. Evans, on the other hand, said she had viewed stories of people she didn’t follow. “I know I can be bad for looking at other people’s Instagrams without following them because I like to be nosy too at times,” Evans said. Evans said she’s completely unbothered knowing her colleague’s ex-girlfriend is looking at her posts. She said, if anything, it has become more of a game for her, attempting to see what that person will look at next. “Now I’m aware she has been looking at my Instagram, it’s made me want to post more stories,” she said.

The 37-year-old Nayib Bukele easily won the presidency early this month in the first round of voting, breaking a three-decade hold on that office by the Central American country’s two dominant parties. Wearing his usual jeans and leather jacket, Bukele told The Associated Press in an interview that poor relations with the U.S. are one of the mistakes of the outgoing administration that he plans to correct after taking office June 1. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans have lived in the United States for years under temporary protected status, a renewable designation that allows them to live and work legally in the U.S. They are a fraction of all the Salvadorans living in the U.S., a total estimated to be around 2.5 million. Related Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley demand action on TPS for immigrants Last year, the Trump administration announced it was ending temporary protected status, known as TPS, for citizens of El Salvador and several other countries. But in October, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked ending the status for four countries, including El Salvador. The injunction remains in effect. “With people carrying signs saying ‘Yankee Go Home’ at party events or burning the United States flag, it is very difficult to go and negotiate a way out,” Bukele said. “But if we send them the right signals, I believe that we can negotiate a resolution to the common problem we have with TPS.” Bukele recently met with U.S. Ambassador Jean Manes and said he emerged feeling that the two governments can arrive at a “win-win” solution. They also spoke about combatting corruption — a central pillar of Bukele’s campaign platform — and decreasing migration through economic development. “El Salvador needs to be friends with the United States. It is an imperative for us,” Bukele said. Finding friends among his own lawmakers could be more challenging. Bukele, a former mayor of El Salvador’s capital, began in politics with the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the current governing party, but he was expelled for his persistent criticism of its leaders. He was elected president Feb. 3 as the candidate for the conservative Grand Alliance for National Unity, which has only 10 of the 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly. That means Bukele will need help to get his initiatives passed, but he said he is not interested in making deals in the way politics has worked for years. That is what voters wanted to eradicate when they elected him, he said. “I believe that the way politics has been done in the country is wrong,” he said. “It has always been based on alliances that don’t have the well-being of the people as their first priority.” “They make alliances in the (Legislative Assembly) based on things that aren’t ideological, like money under the table, business, group interests,” he said. Related Can El Salvador's president-elect Nayib Bukele break the previous parties' hold on power? Lawmakers will have to decide whether they will vote for initiatives that will be good for the people, Bukele said. One of those proposals is creating an international commission to investigate corruption, similar to a United Nations-backed effort in Guatemala. But Bukele conceded there is “scarce political support” for the endeavor in El Salvador. He said that if lawmakers block it, “the people, who are wise, intelligent and informed, are going to say who are those opposed to and blocking the creation.” “The people are going to be able to judge for themselves who is supporting corruption and who is against it,” he said."

Mueller was approached by MSNBC's Mike Viqueira on Sunday as he was leaving St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., for Easter services. Viqueira asked Mueller as he and his wife, Ann Mueller, were getting into their car whether he would testify before Congress after the Thursday release of his report on President Donald Trump and Russian electoral interference.
Mueller said he would be offering ""no comment.""
Viqueira then asked Mueller if he had been investigating anyone other than Trump, and the evidence was identical, would they be indicted? The reporter also asked why Mueller did not make a recommendation on possible obstruction of justice and if Attorney General William Barr accurately characterized the report in his initial summary and subsequent press conference.
Mueller did not respond as he entered his car.
""I think it's accurate to characterize Director Mueller today as being 'tight-lipped' in response to my questions,"" Viqueira said afterwards on MSNBC.
Mueller has remained silent during the course of his probe, which began in May 2017, refusing to engage in public discourse about the investigation. Mueller's ""no comment"" was the first time he had spoken publicly to the media about the investigation since its inception.
In his 400-plus page report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials and whether the president sought to obstruct justice, Mueller said he was unable to establish a Trump-Russia conspiracy and said he could not come to a traditional prosecutorial decision on obstruction.

Schultz, who has said he may run as a centrist independent, has based his potential candidacy on a message of nonpartisanship.

Devastating floods leave millions in Iran facing humanitarian crisis,www.nbcnews.com,Ali Arouzi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/devastating-floods-leave-millions-iran-facing-humanitarian-crisis-n996766,"AHWAZ, Iran — Two weeks since the storms started, relentless rain and flooding throughout Iran has left some 2 million people facing a humanitarian crisis. The deluge has swamped large swaths of the country, from the mountains in the north down to the Persian gulf in the south.
Twenty-five out of 31 of Iran’s provinces have been affected. Officials say say 76 people have been killed so far, with some 150,000 homes partially or completely destroyed. Bridges across the country and miles upon miles of road have been left unusable. Authorities say the estimated bill to repair the damage stands at least $2.5 billion.
The country's agriculture sector, which makes up about 14 percent of Iran's GDP, has been devastated.
'It's all gone' In the oil-rich city of Ahwaz, in Khuzestan province, a local sports stadium is now home to rows of Red Crescent tents lined up next to each other.
The aid group, the Muslim world's equivalent to the Red Cross, is working with the government to respond to the disaster.
People in a Red Crescent aid center in Iran. Ali Arouzi / NBC News Hussein and Farideh Abdekhani, an elderly couple whose village was consumed by the floods, have sought shelter there for the past 10 days along with their daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren.
Farideh, a seamstress, told NBC News that the family had lost everything they had worked so hard for.
“Between us we had two fridges, three heaters and a television. Along with our home, it’s all gone,” she said.
“All we have left are the clothes we are wearing,"" she added, tugging the shirt her husband was wearing and pulling on her chador — a loose-fitting garment that goes over the head and down to the ankles, so as not to show a woman’s hair or figure.
""We have nothing. I don’t know how we are going to rebuild our lives,” she added.
In the nearby village of Hamidiyeh, farmer Jasem, 26, looked out at what was his once his livelihood.
His family had spent decades building their family home and toiling on arable land. Now they fear they will never rebuild what they have lost.
Jasem said he will move to the capital Tehran, some 600 miles from where he has spent his entire life, and try to find work in a restaurant.
Twelve percent of the country's land is agricultural, like that which once proved so fertile for Jasem and his family.
Blame game Amid desperation, the all-too-familiar blame game between two old enemies has continued.
Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for hampering relief efforts.
""The heads of the American regime have revealed their true vicious and inhuman nature,"" President Hassan Rouhani said at a cabinet meeting screened live on state TV, according to Al Jazeera.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the Iranian government.
""These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness,"" he said in a statement earlier this month.
""The regime blames outside entities when, in fact, it is their mismanagement that has led to this disaster.""
Related World World After vowing to strangle Iran's economy, Trump admin divided over how far to squeeze Tehran The Red Crescent are doing what they can to reach these often rural communities devastated by the floods, but damaged infrastructure has hampered their mobility.
An aging helicopter bought by Iran before the 1979 revolution allows them to reach Lorestan province, a mountainous region in the country's west.
Because of U.S. sanctions, Iran has been unable obtain parts for the aircraft over the last 40 years. Instead they have almost entirely rebuilt the choppers themselves.
From the air, the scope and scale of the devastation are clear. What looked like massive lakes were actually vast villages and farmlands.
Nasser, 81, a taxi driver in Khorramabad, the capital of Lorestan province, told NBC News: ""I have lived here my whole life and have never seen anything like this.""
In the city of Pol-e-dokhtar soldiers from the army and Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) are leading the clean-up operation.
Alongside clerics and volunteers they clear rubble, divert water, build dykes and distribute food, medicine and tents.
One of the guards at a temporary station saw a van passing by with IRGC members on board carrying shovels. “Come and get some food, terrorists,” he shouted, an apparent reference to their recent designation as a foreign terrorist organisation by the Trump administration.
Related World World Designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard as terror group could jeopardize U.S. troops This had seemingly become an ongoing joke among the group's members.
But the city's residents were in no mood for jokes.
Uncertain futures Frustrated at the recovery effort, many pressed themselves against the gates of the Red Crescent building screaming that they didn’t have enough food, medicine or tents.
Some of those gathered in hope of aid had not been affected by the floods.
Two women in their 60s, Sultaneh Imani and Shamsi Malekipoor, traveled from a nearby village despite being fortunate enough to escape the worst of the floods. Life was already so difficult, they told NBC News, that they were hoping get something, anything, from the aid group to help them get by.
Poverty and discontent with the government run deep among some here, with the economy already struggling before the weather intervened.
Many Iranians feel they haven't seen the economic benefits of the Obama-era nuclear deal from which President Donald Trump withdrew last year. While it allowed Tehran to sell its crude oil and natural gas on the international market, Iran's economy remains weak with high unemployment and inflation.
For those who were already struggling, the floods have left many hopeless.
Flooding in a graveyard near Ahwaz, Iran. Ali Arouzi / NBC News A few miles from Pol-e-dokhtar, the small village of Baba Zeyd has only 530 residents. Once a breadbasket for the area, rich in vegetables and crops, it is now almost entirely destroyed. Its residents were in a state of shock.
“Mother Nature cried for two weeks and we almost drowned in her tears,” said Mahin Fathi, a grandmother sitting outside the wreckage of her home.
Her neighbor, the local lawyer, was angry.
His home gone and his family's livelihood washed away, Khashayar Javadi told NBC News that the land was so badly damaged they won’t be able to sow crops or vegetables for years to come.
The government has offered small interest-free loans to help villagers rebuild their homes, but Javadi wondered how they could pay the loans back with no prospect of making money anytime soon.
“Our homes have been destroyed, our farmlands and livestock washed away,"" said Radoul, a farmer from the village. ""I have no idea how we are going to make money. This was once a great place to live but now the future is uncertain, without prospects.""

After investigators in the suburban Chicago city of Crystal Lake unsuccessfully scoured hundreds of acres and searched the city's lake for traces of Freund on Thursday, the local police department said in a statement that he had not been abducted and it did not appear that he walked away from his home.
No suspects have been identified in the boy’s disappearance, though the department said “information obtained currently has police focusing on the residence.”
Andrew Freund, Jr., 5, went missing from his home in Crystal Lake, Illinois. Crystal Lake Police Department Andrew’s parents told authorities they last saw him at roughly 9 p.m. local time on April 17, police said.
When the parents were unable to find the boy at home the next morning, they called police, the statement said.
Authorities then searched nearly 1,000 acres by foot and with drones, while sonar and underwater cameras were used to scan Crystal Lake, the department said.
When a canine team examined the family’s home, police said, they “picked up Andrew’s ‘scent’... indicating that Andrew had not walked away on foot.”
Andrew Freund, Sr., the father of the missing 5-year-old, walks near his home in Crystal Lake, Illinois, on April 19, 2019. John Starks / Daily Herald via AP NBC Chicago reported that the boy’s father, Andrew Freund Sr., was seen getting into a car with investigators after they obtained a search warrant for the family's home.
He declined to speak to reporters, though on Sunday he told NBC Chicago that he had “no control over what people think. I just want my son to come home, okay?”
A lawyer for the boy’s mother, Joann Cunningham, told reporters Friday that she had “cooperated extensively with police until at some point we got the impression that she may be considered a suspect,” the Chicago Sun-Times reported .
“I don’t know whether she is or not and I don’t know how serious that consideration is,” said the lawyer, George Kililis, according to the newspaper. Kililis told NBC News that Cunningham is seven months pregnant and ""emotionally and physically exhausted.""
NBC Chicago reported that Andrew had been in foster care for two years after he was born with opiates in his system, and his parents were twice investigated last year over unsubstantiated neglect and abuse allegations.
The state Department of Children and Family Services took the boy’s younger brother into custody on Friday, the station reported. It was not immediately clear why.
