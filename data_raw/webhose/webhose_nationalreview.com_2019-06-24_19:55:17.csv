Iranian officials announced on Monday that they will begin to increase uranium enrichment in violation of the 2015 international nuclear treaty from which the U.S. already has withdrawn.
Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Agency, said the country’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium will surpass the limit established under the treaty within ten days, according to the Iranian news agency Tasnim.
The announcement by Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency comes weeks after Tehran threatened to violate the 2015 nuclear treaty if the pact’s remaining European signatories failed to shield the country from the effects of U.S. sanctions within 60 days."
Parkland Shooting Survivor Has Harvard Admission Rescinded over Old Comments | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/parkland-shooting-survivor-has-harvard-admission-rescinded-over-old-comments/,"June 17, 2019 10:55 AM Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Kyle Kashuv.

Making the click-through worthwhile: Protestors in Hong Kong expand their list of demands, Joe Biden’s support seems to be dropping as Elizabeth Warren gets a little lift in the polls, and Harvard rescinds its acceptance of Parkland shooting survivor Kyle Kashuv over old texts and comments.
Hong Kong Protests Continue
In Hong Kong, pro-democracy protestors are continuing their efforts to block a bill that would allow extradition to China, but their list of demands is expanding. On Sunday, protestors swarmed the streets even after the government agreed to suspend the bill in question and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam offered an apology over the measure.
The sheer size of the demonstration — organizers gave an unverified estimate of close to two million of the territory’s seven million people — made clear the public remained unsatisfied.
Many of the protesters said they were disappointed with Mrs. Lam’s statement, saying it seemed insincere. . . .
The marchers filled broad avenues and ran the length of downtown Hong Kong, parents with their children, groups of students and numerous retirees. Reflecting their changing mood, most dressed in black, a stark change from the white most wore the previous week.
They chanted and carried signs listing their demands: the complete withdrawal of the bill, not just an indefinite suspension; an impartial investigation into the police use of force during Wednesday’s clashes with protesters; and the rescinding of the official description of that protest as an illegal riot, which could expose anyone arrested during the violent demonstration to long jail terms.
Many of the demonstrators are beginning to call for Lam’s resignation, as well as for the departure of her ministers for justice and security, but the leader shows no signs of preparing to step down. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that President Trump will discuss the protests with Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit at the end of the month in Japan.
Some observers suggest that Lam’s decision to suspend the proposed bill should be viewed as a huge concession to demonstrators’ demands, comparing these protests to previous demonstrations in Hong Kong over anti-democratic Chinese policies. From Timothy McLaughlin at The Atlantic this morning:
Though it was not completely withdrawn, the proposal’s temporary shelving was a concession that had been unthinkable, even to the most committed demonstrators, just a few days earlier. It marked a deeply embarrassing retreat for Lam, who, in a humiliating press conference, repeatedly dodged questions about her ability to lead, the possibility of stepping down, and why she hadn’t moved to suspend the bill earlier—before the accusations of police brutality.
Hong Kong’s recent protests have drawn comparisons to the 2014 Umbrella Movement demonstrations, which saw young protesters occupy thoroughfares for 79 days to call for universal suffrage for Hong Kong. There are, however, significant differences, perhaps the most obvious of them being the lack of a clear leader. Five years ago, Joshua Wong, just a teenager at the time, rose to be the central figure of the movement. Time magazine put him on its cover , and the Financial Times called him “the teen doing battle with Beijing.” Wong was released Monday morning after serving nearly five weeks in jail on charges stemming from his involvement in the 2014 protests. Moments after being escorted from jail, he called for Lam to step down and the extradition bill to be withdrawn.
No single person has risen to Wong’s status this time around, but the Civil Human Rights Front—a coalition of 50 organizations, including pro-democracy political parties—has been instrumental in building and helping sustain the protest movement, and in the process has obtained remarkable results, even if incomplete by its own measure.
Biden Starts to Slump as Warren Slowly Rises Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
As the Democratic primary lurches toward its first round of debates — which will feature nearly the entire field with 20 candidates on stage, split between two debates — former vice president Joe Biden seems to be losing his luster, even as he continues to lead the pack in polls. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
He has spent the last several weeks making relatively little news, aside from his sudden decision to backtrack from his decades of support for the Hyde amendment, a bipartisan rider added to federal spending bills to prohibit the direct public funding of abortion procedures. After calling himself “personally pro-life” during his decades in office, and backing Hyde out of a supposed desire to protect the conscience rights of pro-life Americans, Biden’s reversal on this issue was a clear concession to the demands of the increasingly radical pro-abortion Left.
Until his reversal on Hyde, Biden was the only candidate in the field with a policy position other than total support for government-funded abortion on demand. Since entering the race, the former Delaware senator hasn’t commented on his previous support for the federal ban on partial-birth abortion. His choice to back taxpayer funding for abortion came after several weeks of uncertainty, first telling an activist that he no longer supported the amendment, then claiming he had “misheard” the question and still supported Hyde, and then finally reversing himself yet again to say he no now longer supports it.

As Biden falters a bit on policy, his poll numbers appear to be lagging. At the start of the month, he led his next-closest competitor, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, by nearly 20 points. The latest poll of the field, from Fox News, shows Biden up by only 9 points.
And his slump comes as Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren seems to be on the rise, showing up third behind Biden and Sanders in four national surveys over the last week, as well as in several polls of voters in early primary states. Even so, the extent of Biden’s slide is hard to gauge, because his decline in support likely has been distributed somewhat evenly among his rivals.
Harvard Rescinds Kyle Kashuv’s Admission over Old Comments Advertisement
This morning, Kyle Kashuv — a high =-school graduate who survived the mass shooting last February in Parkland, Fla. — announced that Harvard University has withdrawn his offer of admission after his past racist comments came to light.

The comments in question appeared in a Google document that Kashuv had with friends in high school and that he wrote when he was 16 years old. Since the remarks were publicized, Kashuv issued a lengthy apology and cooperated with Harvard’s requests for further information. According to Kashuv, some of his political opponents then began to repeatedly contact Harvard and urge the university to rescind his admission.
After being notified of Harvard’s decision, Kashuv requested an in-person meeting with administration officials to discuss the situation, but the university declined. Here’s some of what Kashuv said this morning about his offer being rescinded: "
Munroe Bergdorf & Transgender Child Abuse | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/transgender-activist-munroe-bergdorf-should-not-work-with-children/,"June 17, 2019 10:21 AM Munroe Bergdorf (BBC via YouTube)
Earlier this week, I wrote about “ Desmond is Amazing ,” the eleven-year-old boy whose sexualization and exploitation is being obscured by ideologues.
One of the ideologues I mentioned is the British transgender (male-to-female) activist, Munroe Bergdorf. In February, Julia Long, a lesbian activist, attended an event where Bergdorf was speaking and asked about Desmond’s safety. This turned out to be a highly illuminating encounter (see here ):
LONG: [Desmond] appeared in a show with a convicted killer and a picture behind him that said “rohypnol” [the date rape drug]… and [he] has also appeared in gay clubs… [where] older gay men [throw] money at him. And I wondered what you thought about this normalization of child abuse?
BERGDORF: I did an article with “Desmond is Amazing” — who is amazing. And it was with their mother as well and it was focused on how we can encourage children to be themselves and how we can listen to what they want to do. With regards to Desmond having money thrown at him, if you’ve ever been to a New York drag club, that is completely normal.
Bergdorf added: “I think we need to be encouraging children to be themselves and do whatever they want to do.” This was met with rapturous applause from the audience and a post from Desmond’s official Twitter account — “owned by Mom” — expressing thanks.
— Desmond is Amazing (@desmond_amazing) February 18, 2019
But who is Munroe Bergdorf, anyway? Advertisement Advertisement
The activist underwent a gender transition from male to female at the age of 24, became the first transgender model in the U.K. for L’Oreal (but was soon fired for making racist comments). After this, Bergdorf was appointed LGBT adviser to the Labour Party (but resigned after negative press coverage). Advertisement
When Bergdorf was appointed the celebrity ambassador for NSPCC, a child-protection charity which operates the Childline helpline, many felt that the appointment was inappropriate. For instance, Bergdorf has modeled naked for Playboy , a fact which would be easy for any vulnerable child to ascertain with a quick Google search. Another reason for concern is that Bergdorf, who is 31 years old, has solicited private communication from vulnerable minors online on multiple occasions. This behavior directly contravenes NSPCC’s safeguarding policy. Here are some of Bergdorf’s Tweets of this nature:
“To any trans kids out there who need or want support. Please @ me. I will answer all messages and work with you to get you the help you deserve. You deserve to be happy.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

It’s easier to track than on here. Keep your heads up! You got a big sister here, always. X” Advertisement Advertisement
When one minor wrote, “I cant legally set up a gofundme or youcaring for about a year and im a queer trans disabled kid in an abusive household who cant work,” Bergdorf replied, “Let’s talk on dm. Msg me.”
Janice Turner, a columnist for the Times of London wrote on Twitter: Hey @NSPCC can you please explain why a children’s safeguarding charity has hired a porn model as a Childline ambassador? It’s an astonishing decision. Is it worth the cancelled direct debits?
— Janice Turner (@VictoriaPeckham) June 6, 2019
The NSPCC dismissed Bergdorf and explained in a public statement :
When appointing an ambassador we are required to consider whether the relationship supports our ability to safeguard children and be influential in safeguarding children. The board decided an ongoing relationship with Munroe was inappropriate because of her statements on the public record, which we felt would mean that she was in breach of our own risk assessments and undermine what we are here to do. These statements are specific to safeguarding and equality.
However, as James Kirkup writes perceptively at the Spectator , the media narrative was redirected from the real story — the firing of a Childline ambassador who, having appeared in sexualized photo shoots, had also failed to comply with the charity’s own safeguarding policies — to a total fantasy about an allegedly “transphobic” campaign begun by Turner. Kirkup sums up the depressing details:
Fact 1: Munroe Bergdorf was sacked by a child safety charity because the charity said she undermined its child safety work. She has since been lionised and feted, treated as a victim of injustice."
The Exploding Bullets Myth & Kevin Drum | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/kevin-drum-is-wrong-about-exploding-bullets/,"About Kevin D. Williamson June 17, 2019 10:06 AM

Kevin Drum believes he has me dead to rights on the question of “exploding bullets,” which are, I repeat, a myth. You cannot go out and buy bullets that explode on impact. Advertisement Advertisement
(Such bullets would not be very useful, though they did used to be a thing in the 19th century . Ammunition makers have attempted to revisit the concept from time to time, to little effect .)
Drum cites a product that goes by the silly brand name R.I.P. for “radically invasive projectile.” These bullets are designed to expand and fragment on impact. What Drum does not seem to understand is that most ordinary bullets are designed to do that. The bullets police officers carry do that. The bullets you hunt deer with do that. (Weirdly enough, this is not necessarily true for soldiers .) They expand in the same way that an empty beer can expands if you step on it. Beer cans do not explode when you step on them. We do not talk about “exploding beer cans.” Advertisement

"‘Handbagged’ Review: Queen Elizabeth v. Margaret Thatcher, in a Left-Wing Fantasy | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/defender-of-the-left-wing-faith-an-imaginary-queen-elizabeth-on-stage/,"June 17, 2019 4:09 PM From left: Kate Fahy, Beth Hylton, and Susan Lynskey in Handbagged (Carol Rosegg) Her Majesty and Margaret Thatcher go at it in Handbagged , a slightly daft exercise in wishcasting.
Q ueen Elizabeth II carries many titles: Her Majesty, Defender of the Faith, Head of the Commonwealth. To these we can now add Columnist of the Guardian .
Such is the image of Elizabeth Regina presented in the play Handbagged , a slightly daft exercise in wishcasting by playwright Moira Buffini, who has the Queen spewing left-wing talking points all over Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in their weekly meetings. The monarchy, which seemed a bit wobbly as recently as the 1990s, has had the last laugh. It now rests so secure that the fulminating Left that used to mock it as reactionary and retrograde has now spun around and started insisting the Queen was secretly on its side all along. The Queen is, as usual, keeping her own counsel. One must get used to having others project their views on one. Advertisement Advertisement
Taking place on a single minimalist set with six actors, Handbagged (at 59E59 Theaters through June 30) presents two versions of each of the two principals. Called “T” and “Q” in the program, the 60-something Thatcher (Kate Fahy) and Queen (Anita Carey) share the stage with younger versions of themselves as they appeared in the 1970s, dubbed “Mags” (Susan Lynskey) and “Liz” (Beth Hylton). (Two men, Cody Leroy Wilson and John Lescaut, play all supporting roles including a palace footman, cabinet ministers, Rupert Murdoch, and Nancy and Ronald Reagan.)
The theatrical device of having each character be judged and contradicted by another version of herself adds little to the play since neither lady changed much late in life. Mostly the presence of two Elizabeths and two Margarets simply subtracts clarity from the show, with the older characters saying things like “I never said that” or “I never thought that.” Mrs. Thatcher and the Queen make poor vessels for postmodern ideas about subjective reality or the conflicts of memory. Moreover, the playwright’s habitual breaking of the fourth wall — actors tell us who they’re playing or beg for an intermission — is meant to be larkish but doesn’t belong here. Peter Morgan’s 2013 play The Audience , which imagined what went on during the weekly meetings between the sovereign and prime ministers from Winston Churchill to Gordon Brown, was a far more skillful and plausible rendering of dramas that may or may not have taken place behind closed doors. Advertisement
Morgan’s inability to stop himself putting his imaginary Queen to bat for his ideological side is taken to a very silly extreme in Handbagged . Possibly the most ridiculous moment of this almost wholly implausible piece comes when the Queen’s second cousin Louis “Dickie” Mountbatten is murdered by an IRA bomb and the sovereign seems more annoyed with Mrs. Thatcher’s failure to call her right away than with the homicidal terrorists, who also killed three others in the blast. Throughout the play, the IRA is portrayed as a sort of unfortunate background element, more like bad weather than a hateful gang of evildoers. Thatcher herself was nearly killed by the IRA, in the Brighton Hotel bombing of 1984. It would have ended her if she had been in her suite’s bathroom at the time, but she indomitably gave a speech as scheduled less than seven hours later. The play (unlike the 2011 film The Iron Lady ) offers very little respect to Mrs. Thatcher for this or any other action, instead positioning as heroes her disloyal foreign minister Geoffrey Howe and — I can’t believe I am typing these words — serial Labour loser Neil Kinnock, whose desperate fear-mongering in a typically nonsensical 1983 campaign speech is presented as prophecy: “If Margaret Thatcher wins on Thursday, I warn you not to be ordinary. I warn you not to be young. I warn you not to fall ill. And I warn you not to grow old.” Kinnock lost in a landslide and Britain boomed, with its citizens continuing to be free to “be ordinary,” whatever that was supposed to mean. Advertisement"

Freedom of Speech: Flag-Burning Should Be Legal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Katherine Timpf,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/flag-burning-freedom-of-speech/,"June 17, 2019 6:13 PM (Pixabay) Among the freedoms that the flag stands for is our freedom of speech.
O ver the weekend, President Trump tweeted his support for a bill proposed by Republican Senator Steve Daines that would outlaw flag burning — overturning a Supreme Court precedent that protects it as free speech.
Here’s the tweet: All in for Senator Steve Daines as he proposes an Amendment for a strong BAN on burning our American Flag. A no brainer!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2019
Many of President Trump’s supporters, including prominent ones such as Candace Owens, weighed in to agree that flag burning should indeed be punished: Advertisement If I were President, the punishment for burning the U.S flag would be the renunciation of citizenship. No jail time, no fine— simply one year to liquidate your assets and get the hell out of our country.
In exchange, we’d extend citizenship to a hardworking LEGAL immigrant.
— Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) June 16, 2019
Now, Daines has claimed that flag-burning must be banned since the “flag is a timeless symbol of liberty . . . the story of our enduring pursuit of freedom.” Honestly, though, it seems clear to me that “our enduring pursuit of freedom” is exactly why it should never be banned. Advertisement Advertisement
Let me be clear: It’s not that I’m not a patriot because I want to keep flag-burning legal, it’s that I want to keep flag-burning legal because I am a patriot.
Is burning an American flag a disgusting, reprehensible act? Yes, it absolutely is, and I would tell that to the face of absolutely anyone who has done so. The flag is a symbol of our freedom, and burning it absolutely is one of the least patriotic things that a person could possibly do. I say “one of the least” because I can think of a few things that would actually be less so — and, as a matter of fact, I think that banning flag-burning would absolutely be on that list.
Now, I understand that some of you may think that that sounds insane — but, before you tweet at me and tell me that I should be deported, just take a moment and hear me out. Although it may seem counterintuitive, one of the things that our flag stands for is our right to burn it if we choose to do so. Why? Because among the freedoms that the flag stands for is our freedom of speech. Advertisement
These days, it seems to me that when most people think about “free speech,” they think about it as a protection from our increasingly politically correct culture. This is, of course, true — and it is important. It’s not, however, the most important reason for this freedom. No . . . the most important role that the First Amendment plays in this country is that it gives us the freedom to speak out against our government, thereby providing a check on its power. Advertisement
Now, I normally hate the “slippery slope” argument, but in this instance, I have to admit that the slope is exactly what makes me so terrified. Think about it: If we outlaw flag burning because it is “unpatriotic,” what could “ because unpatriotic ” be used as an excuse to outlaw next? Protesting government decisions? Speaking out against the president? If we start using “lack of patriotism” as a barometer for what speech should and should not be allowed, we could see the tragic loss of the very freedoms that our flag is meant to extoll.

Justice Thomas and Justice Ginsburg on Overruling Precedent | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/justice-thomas-and-justice-ginsburg-on-overruling-precedent/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter June 17, 2019 4:29 PM
In its ruling today in Gamble v. United States , the Supreme Court, by a vote of 7 to 2, affirmed 170 years of precedent applying the dual-sovereignty doctrine to the Fifth Amendment’s Double Jeopardy Clause. As Justice Alito’s majority opinion sums up this doctrine, “a crime under one sovereign’s laws is not ‘the same offence’ [under the text of the Double Jeopardy Clause] as a crime under the laws of another sovereign.” In other words, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a state from “prosecut[ing] a defendant under state law even if the Federal Government has prosecuted him for the same conduct under a federal statute,” and vice versa. Advertisement Advertisement
I’m going to pass over the substantive debate between Justice Alito, on the one hand, and Justice Ginsburg and Justice Gorsuch, on the other. I’d instead first like to highlight Justice Thomas’s 17-page concurring opinion in which he addresses how the doctrine of stare decisis ought to be applied.
Thomas argues that the Court’s manner of viewing stare decisis as a judicial policy that balances several factors “might have made sense in a common-law legal system in which courts systematically developed the law through judicial decisions apart from written law.” But “[w]e operate in a system of written law” in which “the systematic development of the law is accomplished democratically.” In such a system, “Our judicial task is modest: We interpret and apply written law to the facts of particular cases.” Advertisement
It follows, Thomas argues, that “if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous — i.e. , one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other facts support overruling the precedent.” (Emphasis added.) By contrast, federal courts “may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision” that is a “ textually permissible interpretation of the law.” (Emphasis added.) The same principles, he says, should apply to both constitutional questions and statutory questions.
Thomas’s opinion (which my brief summary doesn’t do justice to—read the whole thing) should provoke a lot of discussion. Much criticism is likely to come from folks who think that his approach fails to give enough weight to stare decisis (or at least to the wrong precedents they hope to salvage). But I suspect that there will also be critics who lament that he would allow an incorrect decision to stand merely because it offers a “textually permissible” interpretation. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Justice Ginsburg, in calling for the dual-sovereignty doctrine to be overruled, again departs from the alarmist tenor of the attention-grabbing dissent she joined last month. In that dissent, she and her fellow liberals warned that “Each time the Court overrules a case, the Court produces increased uncertainty” that could threaten the “necessary stability” of the law, and that the Court should therefore overrule precedent “only when the circumstances demand it.” Today, while acknowledging that the Court has “repeatedly embraced” the dual-sovereignty doctrine, she recites the usual proposition that stare decisis “is not an inexorable command” and offers her reasons why 170 years of precedent should be overturned.

Conference of Catholic Bishops: Incompetent Bureaucracy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Declan Leary,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/catholic-bishops-conference-incompetent-bureacracy/,"June 18, 2019 6:30 AM Attendees at the USCCB general assembly in Baltimore, Md., in 2018. (File photo: Theresa Keil/Reuters) They’ve lost track of their mission to sanctify and are failing even in their attempt to be mere business administrators.
M ore than 200 men in black suits sit in a conference hall in a Baltimore hotel. On folding tables in front of them hundreds of pieces of paper are scattered and pitchers of water are placed at regular intervals. Two tables raised in the front are lined with people apparently in charge, each with a microphone. Everyone has a name tag, hung around his neck on a green lanyard. At a glance, you might think it’s a regional gathering of some professional association of paper salesmen, hotel managers, maybe even low-caliber lawyers. Only a careful look at their collars will show that these men are the apostolic shepherds, more or less, of the Catholic Church in the United States. Advertisement Advertisement
One steps up to a portable podium and offers a brief opening prayer. There is a pull-down projector screen behind him lit up with an image of the crucified Christ; one can’t help but think that a better setting might have some permanent reminders of why these men are here — or permanent anything, for that matter. Folding tables, a moving podium, a temporary stage (though why a stage is necessary at all in a gathering of bishops is beyond me), all in a neutral (not to mention, thoroughly secular) location, every exit neatly marked by red-lit signs — the bishops look ready to pick up and run at the first hint of trouble. Call it a sign of the times.
A woman begins to bang out a hymn on one of those plug-in electric keyboards. Another impermanence tic. It’s turning into a compulsion, a reflex against that hideous horror, tradition — or, worse, aesthetics. As the keyboard jumps and jolts along and the bishops sing (each out of tune in his own way), you can’t help but feel nostalgic for the grand organs that once made music worthy of the Church and for the simple, ancient chant that even Blase Cupich could sing without sounding like a character out of VeggieTales . Advertisement
When morning prayer is ended, though not before one more grating hymn is scraped out, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, reminds them of the reason for this assembly: “To further the sacred work of rooting the evil of sexual abuse from our Church.”
That would be great. But it quickly becomes clear that combating evil is not their primary concern — or that, if it is, they have no idea how to do it. Forty-five minutes into the proceedings, the first substantial mention of the issue finally appears, as a chargé d’affaires from the office of the Holy See’s nuncio to the United States, reading a message from the nuncio himself, tells the bishops that “there can be no hesitation in responding vigorously as a matter of justice.” And therein lies the problem: for the bishops, everything is about responding. Advertisement
A procedural crackdown is necessary, to be sure. But a plan and an institution that are by nature and habit reactive cannot possibly meet the challenges that face the USCCB. Does anybody seriously believe that clearer guidelines for reporting abuse after the fact will solve the problem? Does nobody recognize the moral and cultural rot that has brought us to this point in the first place? It is probably no coincidence that the peak of the crisis (from the late 1960s to the early ’80s, roughly) accompanied one of recent history’s most dramatic shakeups in Church culture, and that abuse declined dramatically with the restoration of order and tradition after the post-conciliar dust had settled. The Church, especially in America, has progressed by leaps and bounds on this issue in recent years, but this has largely been a result of careful cultural adjustments and increased standards and formation in seminaries. The major procedural reforms (e.g., the Dallas Charter) have mostly been ineffective and highly controversial. That may be because the problem, and consequently its solution, have never been about procedure. Advertisement
Nevertheless, over three days that feel as long as the two millennia these men seem desperate to forget, the bishops debate meticulously on the ins and outs of the new guidelines for reporting, investigation, and accountability. “Meticulously” is the right word, though not in any positive sense. It’s like watching the proceedings of a struggling student government or a small-time city council. They even have a parliamentarian, though he’s had trouble with his flight and has to show up late. His name is Schnurr (Dennis Schnurr, archbishop of Cincinnati), a bit of onomatopoeia that must give voice to general public feelings toward the USCCB.
Some of the questions might raise some eyebrows. (One bishop seems particularly concerned that sexual improprieties between a bishop and a consenting adult should not be treated too harshly.) Most of them are just procedural. (How will the proposal to apply the Dallas Charter to bishops work, since we can’t write letters of suitability for ourselves? Will mandating the participation of lay experts in investigations nationwide solve the problem? Are we allowed to do that?)
Discussion has been droning on for hours into the second day, mostly over the precise wording of various documents, directives, programs, etc. (all of which say more or less nothing), when one bishop finally stands up to say something worthwhile. It’s Bishop Robert Baker of Birmingham, Ala., and he seems to have had enough:
I just want to especially point out that the NAC [the National Advisory Council to the USCCB] did strongly emphasize “cultivating an ever-deepening spirituality of chastity and virtue,” and I hope we can find ways to really articulate that further. Just a general observation: I notice the name Jesus Christ hasn’t been mentioned in the course of this. . . . It might not hurt to throw that in there somewhere. . . . Hopefully, somewhere, his name could be mentioned.
The response: “And what I’d — just to get back to the genre that we’re dealing with, uh, one of the advantages of having this as an ‘emphasis area’ is it doesn’t just become the work of one committee, but we hold ourselves to the agenda of cross-committee collaboration in all of these areas.”
What? Advertisement
For one thing, Archbishop Henry Vigneron, of Detroit, was so thrown by the mention of Jesus that he couldn’t even string together a coherent sentence. And what concrete ideas, if any, can be gleaned from his gobbledygook, which reflects only the hollow, secularized bureaucracy that has taken hold of the institutional Church in America? Bishop Baker’s suggestion that assaults on our most deeply held beliefs should be treated as just that, rather than as matters of procedure to be ironed out, is entirely ignored. Maybe the implications — that there’s a problem deeper than enforcement here, that there might actually be something fundamentally wrong with the direction we’re taking — are too terrifying to grapple with.

The USCCB, in preparation for this general assembly, reached out to the laity multiple times with questions such as “If you are a young Catholic who is still Catholic, what has made you stay?” To say nothing of the insane formation of that question and the point we must have reached to even ask it, the answers were surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) uniform. Catholics stay in the Church because they love the Church and believe in the truth and beauty of her teachings. But they’re all but done with churchmen. If there’s one thing that’s tempted even the most faithful of Catholics to leave the Church, it’s the manifest incompetence of her leaders. There are certainly good bishops left — Bishop Baker is a prime example — but the USCCB as a whole is in serious trouble, mostly owing to the actions and inactions of many of its members.
It might have something to do with their desperate, delusional desire to mimic their secular counterparts, to be men of the world. Business suits with Roman collars in place of the ancient cassock. Hotel conference rooms in place of a monastery, or even a cathedral. (The Second Vatican Council held its proceedings in St. Peter’s Basilica.) Everything ready to be packed up and forgotten at the end of the assembly, leaving no trace of the successors of the apostles. Advertisement"
NY Governor Andrew Cuomo Signs Bill Allowing Illegal Immigrants to Obtain Driver’s Licenses,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-signs-bill-allowing-illegal-immigrants-to-obtain-drivers-licenses/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter June 18, 2019 8:42 AM New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news conference in New York City, N.Y., November 13, 2018. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters)
New York governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill Monday night granting illegal immigrants the right to obtain driver’s licenses, shortly after the legislation narrowly passed the state Senate.
The bill, which passed the state Senate 33-29, divided moderate, suburban Democrats, concerned about the safety implications of licensing illegal immigrants, from their more progressive counterparts.
Before signing the bill Monday evening, Cuomo threatened to veto the legislation out of concern that it might lead to the creation of a database of illegal immigrants that the federal government might use to enforce immigration law.
In response, attorney general Tish James released a statement assuring Cuomo and the public that the bill would not be used to help enforce immigration law. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“The legislation is well-crafted and contains ample protections for those who apply for driver’s licenses. If this bill is enacted and challenged in court, we will vigorously defend it,” she said."

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Monday compared the Trump administration’s attempts to control the flow of migrants across the southern border to the systematic extermination of millions in the Holocaust. “The U.S. is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are. That is exactly what they are. They are concentration camps,” the freshman Democrat said during an Instagram livestream.
“The fact that concentrations camps are now an institutionalized practice in the Home of the Free is extraordinarily disturbing and we need to do something about it,” she continued.

Ocasio-Cortez went on to invoke the phrase “never again,” which is typically used in connection with Holocaust rememberance. She later defended her “concentration camp” comparison on Twitter, but appeared to distance herself from the Holocaust in particular by sharing an article that uses a broader definition of what constitutes a concentration camp. This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying.

Conditions at migrant detention centers along the Souther border have steadily eroded in recent months as record numbers of asylum-seekers, many of whom are women and children, have overwhelmed Department of Health and Human Services resources.
Trump administration officials have repeatedly urged Congress to provide more funding for the provision of shelter and medical care to the migrants, but the requests have gone largely unanswered due to partisan infighting over how much will be spent on enforcement verses humanitarian aid.
Majority leader Mitch McConnell announced Monday that he plans to hold a vote next week on legislation that would provide $4.5 billion in additional funding to address the situation at the border."
America’s First Third-World State,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/california-third-world-state-corruption-crime-infrastructure/,"Follow Victor Davis Hanson on Twitter June 18, 2019 6:30 AM A man who said he is homeless stands outside his makeshift home near a housing construction project in San Francisco, Calif., in 2015. (Robert Galbraith/Reuters) Medieval diseases, gangs, corruption, crime, crumbling infrastructure, out-of-touch wealthy elites …
‘T hird World” is now an anachronistic geographical term of the old Cold War. But after 1989, “Third World” was reinvented from a political noun into an adjective to mean more than just Asian, African, and Latin American nations nonaligned with either the West or the Soviet bloc.
Rather, the current modifier “Third World” has come to transcend geography, politics, and ethnicity. It simply denotes poor failed states all over the globe of all races and religions. Advertisement Advertisement
Third World symptomologies are predictably corrupt government, unequal or nonexistent applicability of the law, two rather than three classes, and the return of medieval diseases. Third World nations suffer from high taxes and poor social services, premodern infrastructure and utilities, poor transportation, tribalism, gangs, and lack of security.
Another chief characteristic of a Third World society is the official denial of all of the above, and a vindictive, almost hysterical state response to anyone who points out those obvious tragedies. Another is massive out-migration. Residents prefer almost any country other than their own. Think Somalia, Venezuela, Cuba, Libya, or Guatemala.
Does 21st-century California increasingly fit that definition — despite having the nation’s most amenable climate and most beautiful and diverse geography, with major natural ports facing the dynamic Asian economies, and being naturally rich in timber, agriculture, mining, and energy, and blessed with a prior century’s inheritance of effective local and state government? Advertisement Advertisement
The California Manor
By many criteria, 21st-century California is both the poorest and the richest state in the union. Almost a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line. Another fifth is categorized as near the poverty level — facts not true during the latter 20th century. A third of the nation’s welfare recipients now live in California. The state has the highest homeless population in the nation (135,000). About 22 percent of the nation’s total homeless population reside in the state — whose economy is the largest in the U.S., fueling the greatest numbers of American billionaires and high-income zip codes.
But by some indicators, the California middle class is shrinking — because of massive regulation, high taxation, green zoning, and accompanying high housing prices. Out-migration from the state remains largely a phenomenon of the middle and upper-middle classes. Millions have left California in the past 30 years, replaced by indigent and often illegal immigrants, often along with the young, affluent, and single. Advertisement
If someone predicted half a century ago that a Los Angeles police station or indeed L.A. City Hall would be in danger of periodic, flea-borne infectious typhus outbreaks, he would have been considered unhinged. After all, the city that gave us the modern freeway system is not supposed to resemble Justinian’s sixth-century Constantinople. Yet typhus, along with outbreaks of infectious hepatitis A, are in the news on California streets. The sidewalks of the state’s major cities are homes to piles of used needles, feces, and refuse. Hygienists warn that permissive municipal governments are setting the stage — through spiking populations of history’s banes of fleas, lice, and rats — for possible dark-age outbreaks of plague or worse. Advertisement
High tech does its part not to clean the streets but to create defecation apps that electronically warn tourists and hoi polloi how to avoid walking blindly into piles of sidewalk excrement. In Californian logic, public defecation butts up against progressive tolerance, so it is exempt from the law. Yet for a suburbanite to build a patio without a permit, for example, costs one dearly in fines. Indeed, a new patio without a permit can be deemed more dangerous to the public health than piles of excrement in the public workplace.
One out of three Californians who enters a hospital for any cause is now found to be suffering from either diabetes or pre-diabetes, an epidemic that hits the Hispanic community especially hard but for a variety of reasons has not led to effective public-health efforts and sufficient publicity. State-run dialysis clinics now dot the towns and communities of the Central Valley — a tragic symptom of dietary culture, massive illegal immigration, and poor public-health education. Advertisement
Infrastructure Is for the Unwoke
California’s transportation system, to be honest, remains in near ruins. Despite the highest gas taxes in the nation, none of its major trans-state freeways — not the 99, not I-5, not the 101 — after 70 years off use, are yet completed with six lanes, resulting in dangerous bottlenecks and wrecks. Driving the 99 south of Visalia, or the 101 near Paso Robles, or the 5 north of Coalinga is right out of Road Warrior — but not as dangerous as the fossilized two-line feeder lines such as 152 into Gilroy, or the 41 west of Kettleman City. The unspoken transportation credo of Jerry Brown’s aggregate 16 years as governor apparently was “If you don’t build it, maybe they won’t need it.”
Meanwhile the concrete carcass of the recently cancelled multibillion-dollar high-speed rail system dots the skyline over Fresno. Bureaucrats now insist that more billions must be spent to ensure that a short segment of the least traveled route will be finished, though they obviously do not anticipate spurring a new tourist or commercial corridor between Merced and Bakersfield. Advertisement Advertisement
High-speed-rail gurus insist on salvaging something of the boondoggle not because they have an economic rationale justifying more dollars — they would be far better invested in improving freeways, airports, and rails — but largely out of pride and shame that demand some small token rescued from a very bad pipe dream.
In 1973, when I first visited and lived in Greece, the roads were medieval. The old Hellinikon Airport was dysfunctional, if not creepy. Highway rest stops were filthy. I have lived in or visited Greece in the ensuing 45 years since, including occasionally after the 2008 meltdown and European Union standoff. And yet today, the freeways, chief airport, and rest stops of relatively poor Greece are in far better shape than are California’s. LAX’s poor road access, traffic, uncleanness, crowds, and chaos seem premodern compared with the current Athenian airport.
It is an eerie experience to see America’s once premier state, currently at its supposed acme, now resemble Greece of the colonels a half-century ago, while 2019 Greece seems more like a functioning 1973 California. Athens and Thessaloniki are still dirty in a few places, and there are homeless and illegal immigrants. But one does not see needles and feces on the sidewalks, and it is safe to walk in the evening. Greek public restrooms, once notorious, are far more sanitary than those at rest stops in Fresno, San Francisco, or Los Angeles. Advertisement
Power outrages are characteristic of Third World countries. Here in California we are advised to brace for lots of them, given that our antiquated grid apparently contributes to brush fires on hot days. As a native, I do not remember a single instance of our 20th-century state utilities shutting down service in the manner that they now routinely promise.
California for Others
Crime the last three years has increased. It is epidemic in local jails. San Francisco has the highest property-crime rate per capita of any major city. The California prison system is a mess, and sanctuary cities ensure that illegal aliens charged with crimes will not be deported. Pick up a McClatchy paper and you’ll see that the day’s fare of Central Valley criminality, even after sanitization and editorialization, is mind-boggling.
California’s cycles of wet boom years and dry bust years continue because the state refuses to build three or four additional large reservoirs that have been planned for more than a half-century, and that would store enough water to keep California functional through even the worst drought. The rationale is either that it is more sophisticated to allow millions of acre-feet of melted snow to run into the sea, or it is better to have a high-speed-rail line from Merced to Bakersfield than an additional 10 million acre-feet of water storage, or droughts ensure more state control through rationing and green social-policy remedies.
Twenty-seven percent of Californians were not born in the United States, a large minority of them residing in the United States illegally. Yet California’s universities and popular culture are at the forefront of salad-bowl and identity-politics policies that obstruct assimilation, integration, and intermarriage — the historical remedies for the natural tensions that arise within multiracial and multiethnic societies. In this perfect storm, at the very moment the world’s poorest citizens from Oaxaca and Central America flooded into America, de facto rejecting the protocols of their home, their hosts’ messaging to them was that they should lodge complaints about the social injustice of their new home and romanticize the culture that they had just forsaken for good cause.
California schools are usually in the bottom decile of national rankings. No one in polite conversation asks why that is so, given that the state’s K–12 schools used to be among the most competitive in the United States.
Yet, again in medieval fashion, the professional schools and science and technology departments of California’s premier research universities — Cal Tech, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC — are among the highest-rated in the world. Imagine something like the scribal oases of Padua, Oxford, or Paris in an otherwise frightening 13th century. If one wishes to be schooled as an electrical engineer or cancer researcher, California is an attractive place; if one wishes to be a knowledgeable graduate of a public elementary and high school, it most certainly is not.
California’s Department of Motor Vehicles is perhaps the worst public-service entity in the United States. To enter any branch office is to venture into a Dante’s Inferno of huge lines, chaos, unkept rest rooms, and rude and often incompetent unionized employees. The only efficient DMV office in the state is the unmarked and secret branch in Sacramento reserved for state legislators and grandee insiders who oversee the DMV for the rest of the population. For a fee, concierge private auto clubs and firms often duplicate some DMV services, a de facto admission that the state needs something else besides itself to offer basic services. I once asked a DMV clerk, after a long wait in line, if it was right to be wearing a purple SEIU organizing T-shirt; she replied, “Do you still want to be served?” Advertisement
The DMV scandals are multifarious: Thousands of motor-voter registrations sent to the wrong people, including illegal aliens supposedly ineligible to vote; corrupt employees who sell commercial truck driver’s licenses to the unqualified; and private corporations and occasionally individuals selling hard-to-obtain reservations and appointments.
California now has the nation’s highest basket of sales, gas, and income taxes. With a state surplus, and a slowing economy, one would think that the legislature and governor would pause before even considering raising more taxes. After all, new federal tax law limits write-offs of state and local taxes to $10,000 — radically spiking upper-bracket Californians’ federal tax liabilities.
Yet the rule in California is to punish the upper middle class while pandering to the rich and romanticizing the poor. Thus, the legislature is now considering a punitive new inheritance tax, and it just imposed an Internet sales tax.
Again, the message is that if Californians can survive a recent 13.3 percent top state-income-tax rate, and a vast increase in their federal tax liability, then certainly they can be easily squeezed further after death to pony up 40 percent of their already taxed estates that are over $3 million in value. Translated, that can mean that a tract house in Los Angeles or the Bay Area and a modest 401K are proof that you did not build your wealth on your own, so the state has a second shot at appropriating your postmortem capital, to ensure that your children will see no benefit from your parsimony and thrift.
California’s apocalyptic present has created an alternate universe, in good Third World style, of pay-for-play services. To avoid the emergency room (the last time I used one, two gangs squared off in the waiting room, to continue what their wounded members were under treatment for), progressive Californians often pay for concierge medicine and anything private to avoid at all costs using any state services.
The coastal corridor elite often put their kids in tony prep schools that have sprung up or vastly expanded, in the fashion of the 1960s white Southern academies that were designed to circumvent federal desegregation edicts. Elite progressives mimic old-style, 1960s segregationists but feel that their children’s green and multicultural curricula offer enough penance to assuage their guilt over abandoning the state’s much praised “diverse” schools.
Our Dreams, Your Nightmares
What caused this lunacy?
A polarity of importing massive poverty from south of the border while pandering to those who control unprecedented wealth in Silicon Valley, Hollywood, the tourism industry, and the marquee universities. Massive green regulations and boutique zoning, soaring taxes, increasing crime, identity politics and tribalism, and radical one-party progressive government were force multipliers. It is common to blame California Republicans for their own demise. They have much to account for, but in some sense, the state simply deported conservative voters and imported their left-wing replacements.
In a reductionist sense, perhaps if former governor Jerry Brown knew that he would one day retire to Delano and drive the 99 daily, rather than to Grass Valley, with several state pensions in his bank account, or if Dianne Feinstein dwelled in an East Palo Alto or Redwood City residence rather than in Pacific Heights, or if all the Pelosi grandchildren had to attend state public schools, then the architects of 21st-century California might have had to live with the consequences of their own dreams and been less eager to inflict their nightmares on the other 40 million Californians."
"In Toy Story 4 , the Franchise Shows Its Age",www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/movie-review-toy-story-4-franchise-shows-age/,"June 18, 2019 6:30 AM Buzz (Tim Allen), Woody (Tom Hanks), and Bo Peep (Annie Potts) in Toy Story 4 (Disney/Pixar) Like any idea might after four films in 24 years, this one has grown a bit stale.
F or a film franchise, 24 years is middle-aged, bordering on elderly. Nearly a quarter-century after the first Toy Story , the fourth installment, which hits theaters later this week, feels a bit tired.
If earlier films in the franchise were about loss and abandonment and saying goodbye to childhood, this one is pretty much just about getting from one physical-comedy gag to the next. The set pieces that deliver the gags, busy as they are, are much less inventive than they were in years past, and the way underlying themes get tossed out haphazardly without much follow-through suggests a case of writing by committee. (As do the credits: Eight scribes managed to get their names on the film.) Advertisement Advertisement
We begin with the usual: Woody (Tom Hanks) trying to save a suicidal spork. “Forky” (Tony Hale), who keeps trying to throw himself in the garbage, is a neurotic, mentally challenged toy put together by Woody’s kid, Bonnie, and Woody and Forky get separated from her. They must find their way back to their kid!
Or not. She doesn’t seem to care. She has lots of other toys. I’m not sure what the point of Forky is apart from jokes about his googly eyed weirdness. A symbol of how anything could be a toy given the spark of its creator’s imagination? Proof that ugly things can be loved? An urgent plea for suicide hotlines to provide service to plastic utensils?
A potentially brilliant sidebar is a trip to an antique store where one of those creepy old-timey dolls — usually found these days only in horror movies — and her sinister retinue of even-more-terrifying ventriloquist dummies lure Woody into a scheme with nefarious intent. Woody, as ever a bit of a sap, doesn’t sense the danger. Music from The Shining plays. This joke could get really good . . . but instead it just fades out gradually. The creepy doll, Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), turns out to be nice, merely a bit misunderstood. Advertisement Advertisement
TS4 does come up with one brilliant idea, a spoof of those 1970s Evel Knievel action figures and their wind-up motorcycles, with the daredevil relabeled “Duke Caboom” and voiced amusingly by Keanu Reeves as a clueless Canadian. Duke gives the movie most of its highlights, but then again vainglorious Canadians are inherently funny. He occupies the space ordinarily filled by Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who this time pops up only sporadically, as more of a sidekick than a rival to Woody.
Despite the film’s quick pace and breezy good nature, the overall effect is mediocre, and TS4 is easily the weakest effort in the series so far (the correct ranking of the four is, of course, 2 , 1 , 3 , and then 4 ). Most of its narrative energy is expended on a question that doesn’t matter much even within the movie. As Woody and Forky try to make their way back home, someone points out that “Kids lose toys all the time.” Quite so: Kids freak out over a lost toy, just as they will bawl nonsensically about a hundred other things (“I don’t want the blue cup, I want the PURPLE CUP!!!”). But give them 15 minutes and a snack and they’ll move on. So why should we care whether any given toy gets reunited with its kid, much less care enough to sit through a movie about it? In previous Toy Story installments, we cared because the toys had feelings and would be crushed if they weren’t played with. Here, that motive is abandoned: The suggestion is that toys can be perfectly happy, maybe even more self-actualized, living on their own. The kid, in this movie, doesn’t really need the toys, and the toys don’t really need the kid. Oh. Advertisement"
Oberlin Is Forced to Check Its Woke Privilege,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/oberlin-college-lawsuit-woke-privilege/,"June 18, 2019 6:30 AM Gibson’s Food Market and Bakery in Oberlin, Ohio. (via Facebook) It is wrong to steal, even if you are an Oberlin student.
I f there is one thing you learn about at Oberlin College, the notoriously progressive liberal-arts college, it is surely privilege: white privilege, hetero privilege, gender privilege, you name it.
Now, an Ohio jury has identified an entirely new variety, woke privilege, and resolved to hold people who believe they are protected by it to account. Advertisement Advertisement
The jury handed down a staggering $11 million verdict against Oberlin for a smear campaign against a local business, and it awarded another $33 million in punitive damages to the targeted mom-and-pop store, Gibson’s Food Market and Bakery.
The damages will certainly be reduced, but the verdict is a shot across the bow of well-heeled institutions tempted to join social-justice mobs.
Oberlin thought that it could defame Gibson’s as racist with impunity, that the hothouse rules of campus politics applied (i.e., anyone accused of racism is ipso facto guilty of racism), and that no one would question its superior righteousness and cultural power vis-à-vis a mere local business. Advertisement
In other words, Oberlin counted on its woke privilege to give it the latitude to discount reason, evidence, and fair play.
Gibson’s was the victim of this affair twice over. The imbroglio began when a black student, accompanied by two friends, attempted to shoplift wine from the store, and the owner’s son pursued and detained him. Police arrested the students, who were charged with crimes. Advertisement
It is wrong to steal, even if you are an Oberlin student, even if you are a member of a historically oppressed group. But the Oberlin worldview is opposed to such simplistic truths, and students immediately began protesting Gibson’s on the theory that, because the store stopped black kids from shoplifting, it must be racist.
Oberlin College’s Student Senate passed a resolution declaring, “Gibson’s has a history of racial profiling and discriminatory treatment of students and residents alike.” Advertisement
The facts of the case were readily available, including that one of the arrested students quickly offered to plead guilty to theft (all three students eventually took pleas and made statements absolving Gibson’s of any misconduct or racial animus).
No matter. As far as Oberlin is concerned, the arc of the moral universe bends toward whatever its students are protesting at any given moment. So the school pitched in. Advertisement
Its dean of students, Meredith Raimondo, formerly the special assistant to the president for diversity, equity and inclusion (of course), joined the protesters with a bullhorn. She helped distribute flyers condemning Gibson’s and calling for a boycott: “This is a RACIST establishment with a LONG ACCOUNT of RACIAL PROFILING and DISCRIMINATION.”
Students made copies of the defamatory flyers in the music conservancy offices, where the school bought them pizza and beverages and lent them other logistical support.
The school suspended its longtime business with Gibson’s, and for good measure, Oberlin’s Department of Africana Studies posted a comment on Facebook: “Their food is rotten and they profile black students.”
Ho-hum, you might say, just another reputation casually and arbitrarily destroyed in 21st-century America. But Gibson’s refused to accept the blow to its standing and bottom line, and sued. Oberlin’s defenses — it was neutral in the dispute between its students and the store — were shredded at trial (admirably covered in detail by the website Legal Insurrection ).
Documents revealed that the Oberlin administration was at times afraid of its students (even hesitating to condemn shoplifting) and at times viewed them as a weapon. When a professor publicly objected to the school’s handling of the matter, Meredith Raimondo said in a text: “F*** him. I’d say unleash the students if I wasn’t convinced this needs to be put behind us.” Advertisement"
‘Moral Relativism’: Do Conservatives Really Object?,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/moral-relativism-absolutism-debate-conservatism/,"June 18, 2019 6:30 AM The sun sets behind the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea, June 3, 2019. (US Navy) Moral absolutism presents its own dangers.
A s a young conservative, I was taught to despise something we were taught to call “moral relativism.” The moral relativism of the time was a particular Cold War variant: The United States and the Soviet Union were, relativism’s partisans insisted, more or less equivalent enterprises, each ruthlessly and cynically seeking its own advantage vis-à-vis the other, while liberalism and Communism were simply two different ways of trying to organize economic and political affairs, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. There were differences, to be sure, but only the truly naïve believed that there were good guys in this fight or that we — the West — were them. Advertisement Advertisement
We young conservatives found that proposition repugnant. The Soviet Union was a place of gulags and political prisoners, unnecessary privation, suppression, and — above all — lies. It was an empire of lies, and in such an empire no man is safe — no chess master, no novelist, no composer. The United States had its problems, as did the United Kingdom and the rest of our allies, but you could mock Ronald Reagan day and night and never fear hearing the sound of someone’s standard-issue boot kicking down your door in the dead of night. That was a moral truth, not a point of view.
But point of view, all the best people insisted, was all there was. From a few overstuffed truisms originating in the field of linguistics arose an entire philosophy — and an intellectual movement — oriented toward radical indeterminacy. Nothing was truly knowable. Texts — poems, history, laws, scientific theories, whatever — said, if they said anything at all, only that which they were given permission to say by shadowy and vague forces: capitalism, patriarchy, the omnipresent “power” of Michel Foucault and his disciples. The Bill of Rights could mean whatever anybody with enough power wanted it to mean, but Discipline and Punish had to be closely read, studied down to the semicolon, even venerated. Reading Foucault is why you learned French. De la démocratie en Amérique? Irrelevant. Advertisement
The thing about reactionaries is, we react. William F. Buckley Jr. dedicated an episode of Firing Line to the question of “moral absolutes,” and denunciations of “moral relativism” came fast and thick. And they did not stop. Our friend Ben Shapiro warns of the West abandoning its moral heritage and “favoring moral subjectivism.” Mark Sunwall, a Mises Institute contributor who teaches English in the College of Nursing Art and Science in Hyogo, Japan (those always-angry Mises guys are spread far and wide, like syphilis), indicts Buckley (they are always on the hunt for phony conservatives!) as a man with a “secret contempt for moral absolutes.”
And so the intellectual battle lines were drawn. Advertisement Advertisement
But few if any of us were standing on the side we said we were.
The Right has always been comfortable with moral ambiguity, most plainly in the matter of foreign policy. That was especially true in the Cold War, when conservatives went to great lengths — often too far, and sometimes far too far — defending such characters as Francisco Franco and Augusto Pinochet as bulwarks against Communism. F. A. Hayek’s overwhelming admiration for the Chilean dictator was sufficient to inspire a chiding letter from Margaret Thatcher, who described the general’s methods as “quite unacceptable.” Nelson Mandela was the leader of a revolutionary Communist movement and refused to foreswear political violence, but what he was up against was not a Madisonian republic. Perhaps it was the demands of political rhetoric, but conservatives have from time to time failed to cleave to the knowledge that necessary evil is evil .
And these calculations were not limited to foreign affairs. Consider the watershed moment that was the debate over the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Buckley had opposed the 1964 law, but there were few more trenchant critics of George Wallace’s racial record when the segregationist ran for president in 1968. There were — and are — legitimate concerns that the federal approach to civil rights, particularly in the matter of “public accommodations,” invited invasive micromanagement and created real constitutional problems. (It is the reason we are still having a debate over outlaw bakers .) There were political calculations at work, too, to be sure: Barry Goldwater, who had been an important civil-rights advocate in Arizona and in federal office, pronounced himself eager to “hunt where the ducks are.” But the fact was, and is, that the question is morally and politically complicated, and that there are good-faith reasons for disagreement about the legal particulars.

The political party and political tendency that were closely allied with the moral relativists of the Cold War era were in fact much more eager for moral absolutism. In the matter of the United States vs. the Soviet Union, they saw no moral equivalency: They saw the United States as the principal force for evil in the world and wanted it knocked down a peg or two, and any adversary would do: Lenin and his heirs, Mao, Castro, Ho Chi Minh. Noam Chomsky spent years insisting that the Cambodian genocide was an invention of American intelligence operatives hoping to discredit the authentic people’s movement of Pol Pot even as that maniac installed his throne on top of a giant pile of skulls. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The same is more or less true today: The great alternative was, for a hot minute, Venezuela, and now it is smashing capitalism in the name of the Green New Deal or, because nothing is ever really in the past, Communism once more, albeit the “fully automated luxury communism” Aaron Bastani recently described in the New York Times. (And shame on Bastani and the Times both for bowdlerizing “ fully automated luxury gay space Communism .” Pansies.) There’s a new spin on things — Bastani wants to use robots to mine synthetic meat asteroids, or something — but the fundamentals are always the same. Critics have sometimes knocked John le Carré for his alleged practice of moral equivocation in the Cold War, but those critics should reread him: They are being too generous. Le Carré is about as subtle as an episode of Captain Planet , for those of you old enough to remember.
The American Left is not only comfortable with moral absolutism, it is, at the moment, in the grip of a moral hysteria. Taylor Swift is injecting pro-gay messages into the pop charts, but the progressives are convulsed over whether she is spreading her message of (slightly snide) tolerance in a morally acceptable way. Lena Dunham, Elton John, the Whitney Museum’s tribute to the 1960s — no one and nothing is ever pure enough for these puritans. Joe Biden? “ Misogynistic .” Camille Paglia? A pariah. Professor Rebecca Tuvel was denounced as a perpetrator of “violence” for using the phrase “ biological sex .” Liberal book editors are so terrorized that they do not know what to publish , and even some young progressive authors have been bullied into suppressing their own books.

Conservatives took a mature attitude toward moral ambiguity in the matter of foreign policy, and to some extent still do. Our relations with the Gulf states, for example, is a reminder that while the “enemy of my enemy is my friend” school of thought is not always right, it is not always wrong, either. Our insistence on “moral absolutes” is very often to be rhetorical when challenged. You can take the conservatives out of Protestantism, but you can’t take the Protestantism out of conservatives.
Progressives, on the other hand, took a relativistic “Who are we to judge?” attitude toward questions of sexual ethics and a few thorny cultural questions, for about five minutes, and then they abandoned that single-serving libertarianism the moment they achieved enough power to demand conformity and punish dissent. “Liberals claim to want to give a hearing to other views, but then are shocked and offended to discover that there are other views,” as Bill Buckley famously put it. And now those shocked and offended partisans are out to root out and punish those other views — with prison time, in the case of global warming and the infinitely plastic offense of “hate speech.”
Which leaves us where, exactly? To the extent that the conservative movement is for the moment dominated by Republican™-branded entertainment figures, the question of moral relativism is . . . morally relative. Our populist friends, for example, presented the Donald Trump phenomenon as a classical case of moral relativism (“ But Hillary !”) and at the same time argued that this relativistic calculation produced as its outcome a moral absolute, the applicable scope of which has been steadily enlarged. One suspects that they are not thinking too very hard about it."
College Evaluation: Did It Help Make Your Child a Better Person?,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/college-education-expensive-risk-many-students/,"June 18, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) A campus culture of binge drinking, hook-ups, and indoctrination make college a very expensive risk for many students.
W hen assessing America’s or any of the Western world’s universities — wondering whether you should send your child to one, whether you should pay for a child to attend one, whether you should go into great debt to attend one, whether you should donate money to one, and related questions — it would seem that the single most important question to be answered is: What type of person does the university produce? Advertisement Advertisement
It is hard to imagine any parent — left, right, liberal, conservative, or apolitical — who would disagree with asking this question. They would disagree about what constituted a desirable outcome — obviously left-wing parents would want their child’s college to send home a child with left-wing views, and a parent on the right would not be happy if their child returned home with left-wing views. But every parent would probably agree that the question “What type of person did college produce?” is an important one.
My belief is that most of the time, colleges today produce a worse human being or, at the very least, a person who is no better, wiser, or more mature than when he or she graduated high school. Advertisement
Let’s begin with behavioral issues.
There is a good chance your son or daughter will have spent much of his or her free time at college partying, which often means getting drunk, smoking marijuana, and hooking up with someone for casual sex. While none of those activities necessarily means that your son or daughter became a worse human being, all of us can agree that none of them made your child a better one.
Regarding college drinking, Alcohol Rehab Guide, an online alcohol addiction site, reports:
A large percentage of college students consume alcohol by binge drinking. . . . For men, binge drinking involves drinking five or more alcoholic beverages in two hours. On the other hand, binge drinking for women is considered four or more drinks within a two-hour time period.
The website also states:
Roughly 80 percent of college students — four out of every five — consume alcohol to some degree. It’s estimated that 50 percent of those students engage in binge drinking.
BMC Public Health reported in 2013:
One young adult in two has entered university education in Western countries. . . . [This] is often associated with risky behaviour such as excessive alcohol consumption. . . . We found that the more a student was exposed to college environmental factors, the greater the risk of heavy, frequent, and abusive drinking. Alcohol consumption increased for students living on campus, living in a dormitory with a higher number of room-mates, and having been in the University for a long spell.
And we are all aware of the sexual activity that emanates from college drinking and can be regretted the next day (usually by the woman).
Then there is depression and mental illness at college. In the words of clinical psychologist Gregg Henriques, through Psychology Today :
It is neither an exaggeration nor is it alarmist to claim that there is a mental health crisis today facing America’s college students. Evidence suggests that this group has greater levels of stress and psychopathology than any time in the nation’s history.
Now let’s move on to values and character.
Did your son or daughter (or niece or nephew, grandson, or granddaughter) return home from college: Advertisement
More, less, or equally kind a person? Advertisement
More, less, or equally respectful of you, his or her parent(s)?
More, less, or equally grateful to you for the monetary sacrifice you made to enable him or her to attend college?
More, less, or equally proud to be an American?
More, less, or equally respectful of religion?
More, less, or equally wise?
More, less, or equally committed to free speech?
More, less, or equally open to hearing views he or she disagrees with?
I think I know the answers to those questions, in most instances. But far more important than what I assume is what you will find out. Please ask not only the college students and recent college graduates but also their parents and other relatives.
Then decide whether you want to risk sending your child to a place that will greatly increase his or her chances of being depressed, engaging in binge drinking, and learning nothing important — while being taught how awful America is, why speech he or she doesn’t agree with should be suppressed, how pathetic religious Christians and Jews are, how wonderful religious Muslims are, and how important skin color is.
I acknowledge that students who are entering STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields must attend college. But for most of the rest, sending your child to college is playing Russian roulette with their values, character, and even joy of life. Advertisement"
The Example of Hong Kong,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/hong-kong-protests-resisting-tyranny/,"About The Editors June 18, 2019 6:30 AM Protesters hold placards at a demonstration demanding Hong Kong’s leaders to step down and withdraw the extradition bill in Hong Kong, China, June 16, 2019. (Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)
I f you need an example of man’s desire to be free, and his willingness to resist tyranny, look to the streets of Hong Kong. Some 2 million residents of the city gathered there, in protest. The population of the city is only 7.3 million. It was a stirring sight — one of the most stirring the world has seen in recent years. Advertisement Advertisement
The protests in Tiananmen Square were stirring, too. That was exactly 30 years ago. It ended in a massacre of protesters by the Communist authorities. Every Hong Konger in the streets this year knew that.
The immediate object of their protest was an extradition bill, which would have sent Hong Kongers accused of a crime to the mainland, for trial. On the mainland, there is nothing like justice. Instead, there is torture, a sham trial, and a gulag (called laogai ).
Yet the protest in Hong Kong had a more general object. Citizens are intent on keeping their freedoms, or not letting them go without a fight.
When the British turned over the city to the Chinese Communist Party in 1997, the promise was “one country, two systems,” for 50 years. This was always chimerical. Year by year, month by month, the CCP has been chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The Party will not tolerate Hong Kong’s brash, uppity independence until 2047. Advertisement Advertisement
Five years ago, democratic protests broke out. These were dubbed the “umbrella movement,” because people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray. Earlier this year, eight leaders of the movement were sentenced. One of them, Chan Kin-man, a retired sociology professor, said, “In the verdict, the judge commented that we are naïve” (naïve to believe that a protest movement can attain, or retain, democracy). “But what is more naïve than believing in one country, two systems?”
In Taiwan, there were street protests in behalf of the umbrella-movement leaders sentenced. Why? Because Taiwanese know that their fate, and their democracy, is linked to Hong Kong.
In the wake of the extradition bill, the umbrellas came out again, as people tried to shield themselves from pepper spray, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Faced with this massive demonstration, which caught the attention of the world, Hong Kong officials backed down. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced the suspension of the extradition bill, and even offered an apology for its introduction. Advertisement
Some protest leaders demanded her resignation. Others pointed out that whoever followed her would be in the same position — a servant of Xi Jinping, the PRC’s supreme leader (for life). Advertisement
“Hong Kong’s bravery has bought it some time.” So said Edward Lucas, the British foreign-affairs analyst, and he put it well. We think back to “Finlandization,” which is often misunderstood.
Finlandization was the process by which Finland was rendered essentially neutral in the Cold War. The Finns did not set out to be Finlandized; they wished to be with the Free West. They fought like hell to avoid Sovietization, which resulted in their (mere) Finlandization.
In a similar vein, Hong Kongers are fighting like hell to keep the noose relatively loose around their necks. They are fighting to retain a little breathing space. Advertisement
VIEW GALLERY: Hong Kong Protests
The ruling Communists in Beijing hate the example of Hong Kong, as they hate the example of (even worse) Taiwan. They don’t want other Chinese — more than a billion of them — to get ideas: ideas that Chinese people, in some places, can live freely and democratically. News of the drama in Hong Kong was blocked on the mainland."

1973 —By a vote of five justices, the Supreme Court rules in United States v. SCRAP that plaintiffs, including a group of law students (“Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures”), have standing to challenge the Interstate Commerce Commission’s decision not to suspend a 2.5% freight rate increase.
What is the alleged injury on which their standing is based? As the majority sums it up, the rate increase “would allegedly cause increased use of nonrecyclable commodities as compared to recyclable goods, thus resulting in the need to use more natural resources to produce such goods, some of which resources might be taken from the Washington area, and resulting in more refuse that might be discarded in national parks in the Washington area,” thus causing the plaintiffs economic, recreational and aesthetic harm. The majority even acknowledges that the case presents “a far more attenuated line of causation to the eventual injury” than in a case the previous year in which the Court found no standing, and it further observes that “all persons who utilize the scenic resources of the country, and indeed all who breathe its air, could claim harm similar to that alleged by the environmental groups here. ” Advertisement Advertisement

2004 —A mere audience member at an American Constitution Society panel discussion on the forthcoming presidential election, Second Circuit judge Guido Calabresi can’t restrain himself. Calabresi begins his comments from the floor by acknowledging that he is “not allowed to talk politics,” but he quickly descends into a thinly disguised diatribe: “What the Supreme Court did in Bush v. Gore ” was “exactly what happened when Mussolini was put in by the King of Italy” and “what happened when Hindenburg put Hitler in.” Of course, Calabresi is “not suggesting for a moment that Bush is Hitler.” But, “like Mussolini, he has exercised extraordinary power.” And “when that has happened it is important to put that person out [of office].”
A week later, Calabresi will apologize that his comments could reasonably have been understood to be partisan. In April 2005, the Judicial Council of the Second Circuit will confirm that Calabresi violated the canon of judicial ethics that provides that a judge “should not … publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Justice Clarence Thomas Stare Decisis Originalist Persepective | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/justice-thomas-lays-out-an-originalists-perspective-on-stare-decisis/,"About Carrie Severino June 18, 2019 10:55 AM Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in his chambers at the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., June 6, 2016. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
Yesterday the Supreme Court announced its decision in Gamble v. United States , in which it declined to overturn its longstanding view that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent an individual from being prosecuted by both the state and the federal government—under each jurisdiction’s respective criminal laws—regardless of whether the state and federal offenses stem from the same conduct. In its decision, the Court found “the historical evidence assembled by” the defendant to be “feeble; pointing the other way are the Clause’s text, other historical evidence, and 170 years of precedent.”
Justice Clarence Thomas joined the Court’s decision and wrote a concurrence so he could separately address “the proper role of the doctrine of stare decisis .” He spelled out as explicitly as he has in his nearly 28 years of service why the current Court is wrong to “view[] stare decisis as a ‘principle of policy’ that balances several factors to decide whether the scales tip in favor of overruling precedent,” requiring (in the words of Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992)) “a ‘special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided’ to overrule a precedent.” That approach “might have made sense in a common-law legal system in which courts systematically developed the law through judicial decisions apart from written law. But our federal system is different.”
Here the Court’s role is set forth in Article III, § 1 of the Constitution, as the exercise of “judicial Power.” Citing two decisions by Chief Justice John Marshall, the Federalist Papers, and James Madison’s correspondence, Thomas explained,
That “Power” is—as Chief Justice Marshall put it—the power “to say what the law is” in the context of a particular “case” or “controversy” before the court. . . . It refers to the duty to exercise “judicial discretion” as distinct from “arbitrary discretion.” . . .
That means two things, the first prohibitory and the second obligatory. First, the Judiciary lacks “force” (the power to execute the law) and “will” (the power to legislate). . . . The Judiciary thus may not “substitute [its] own pleasure to the constitutional intentions of the legislature.” . . .
Second, “judicial discretion” requires the “liquidat[ion]” or “ascertain[ment]” of the meaning of the law. . . . [It] is not the power to “alter” the law; it is the duty to correctly “expound” it.
Thomas recognized the pedigree of stare decisis in English common law but added that judges were long expected to correct erroneous precedent. Moreover, federal courts look to different sources of law than common-law courts: They “need not—and generally cannot—articulate the law in the first instance,” but are primarily bound by “three bodies of federal positive law—the Constitution; federal statutes, rules, and regulations; and treaties. That removes most (if not all) of the force that stare decisis held in the English common-law system, where judicial precedents were among the only documents identifying the governing ‘customs’ or ‘rules and maxims.’” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Since “the primary role of federal courts today is to interpret legal texts with ascertainable meanings,” Thomas summarized the weight of judicial precedent as follows:
[I]f the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous— i.e. , one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.
Thus, “[w]hen faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it.” After all, judicial officers take an oath to support the Constitution, and “the Constitution . . . requires us to privilege its text over our own precedents when the two are in conflict.”
Still, precedent “may remain relevant when it is not demonstrably erroneous,” as when the indeterminacy of written law may lead reasonable jurists to arrive at different conclusions regarding a legal text’s original meaning. This case provided such an example. Thomas praised the “admirable job” done by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who dissented with an analysis of the double jeopardy question that explored among other things postratification legal treatises. Ultimately, however, he found those sources inconclusive about the understanding of the Fifth Amendment when it was ratified, leaving him unpersuaded “that our precedent is incorrect as an original matter, much less demonstrably erroneous.” Advertisement
Thomas concluded his commentary on stare decisis by noting how his view would provide more certainty and stability to the law than the current Court’s “malleable balancing test.” For good measure, he added the “true irony . . . that proponents of stare decisis tend to invoke it most fervently when the precedent at issue is least defensible.” Advertisement
With significance well beyond the immediate issue in Gamble , Thomas’ concurrence is one of the most thoughtful expositions on judicial precedent to come from the bench in modern times. It should be required reading, especially for originalists exploring the doctrine of stare decisis . Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network. "

If there is one thing you learn about at Oberlin College, the notoriously progressive liberal-arts college, it is surely privilege: white privilege, hetero privilege, gender privilege, you name it.
Now, an Ohio jury has identified an entirely new variety, woke privilege, and resolved to hold people who believe they are protected by it to account. Comments
The jury handed down a staggering $11 million verdict against Oberlin for a smear campaign against a local business, and it awarded another $33 million in punitive damages to the targeted mom-and-pop store, Gibson’s Food Market and Bakery.
The damages will certainly be reduced, but the verdict is a shot across the bow of well-heeled institutions tempted to join social-justice mobs."

(Andrew Harnik/Reuters)
President Trump and Secretary Pompeo have worked the U.S. into an advantageous position with a consistent policy toward bad actors.
We are now at a point that even left and right agree that China’s rogue trajectory had to be altered. And while progressive critics of Beijing now are coming out of the woodwork without ever uttering the T-word, nonetheless the subtext is that Trump has pulled back the Chinese curtain and what is exposed is pretty ugly — from reeducation camps and mass incarcerations to cheating Silicon Valley out of billions of dollars in research and development, currency manipulations, bullying allies, and international commercial roguery. Advertisement Advertisement
More to the point, the U.S. does not need China as much as it needs us, whether defined as trade and accounts surpluses, intellectual and technological transfers, the strange obsessions with buying U.S. properties or sending a third of a million students into the U.S. In all these areas, there are vast asymmetrical relations. The U.S. can find low-cost assembly plants elsewhere if that is its want, and American investors are not dying to buy Chinese properties or American companies to steal Chinese technological breakthroughs, or California parents to send tens of thousands of their teens to Chinese universities.
Iran is similar. Getting out of the Iran Deal and ratcheting up the sanctions remind us not just about what was surrendered when the Obama administration caved in 2015 and resuscitated that odious regime, but that Tehran is increasingly fragile — economically, politically, and socially — and in its fourth decade of bankrupt theocracy cannot survive long-term maximum-pressure strategies, especially vis-à-vis the world largest economy and natural gas and petroleum producer. Had it nuclear weapons as it had planned, the present face-off might have had different consequences. Advertisement
In other words, Iran’s current pathetic efforts to disrupt international maritime traffic are slowly reminding the world why it always was an outlaw state and yet how weak its provocative efforts really are. In contrast, the U.S. needs only to keep the pressure on and sit back, while Iran continues its frenzied nihilism. And if Iran gets too desperate to the point of attacking U.S. ships and assets, there are lots of tit-for-tat, quite disproportionate one-off responses on our part that would not lead to a general war and yet would maintain deterrence at little American cost while hurting Iran a great deal. Again, the key is not to be goaded into a war and not to ignore an Iranian attack on a U.S. vessel. Advertisement
Mexico and Central America follow a similar pattern. The flood across the border and the cynicism of Latin American governments are now utterly transparent, in a global climate in which Western publics are tiring of open borders and being lectured by the cynical and conniving failed states that it is somehow inhumane not to welcome in illegal entrants with the wink and nod of their own corrupt governments. With over a $70-billion trade surplus with the U.S. and some $30 billion in annual remittances (much of it from illegal aliens who rely on state subsidies to free up cash to send home), Mexico, for example, is in no position to dictate anything to the U.S., especially when the optics of green-lighting hundreds of thousands into the U.S. are so incriminating.

Ted Cruz's Yale Law School Investigation Can Help Christians & Conservatives Pushed Out of the Ivy League | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jamil Jivani,06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/ted-cruz-can-help-christians-and-conservatives-who-are-pushed-out-of-the-ivy-league/,"June 18, 2019 3:58 PM (Gabriella Borter/Reuters) Both as a law student and a guest speaker I felt unwelcome at Yale. Ted Cruz’s investigation can be a step toward increasing true diversity and tolerance.
S enator Ted Cruz’s ongoing investigation into Yale Law School over its treatment of Christians and conservatives is a good thing for American education. As a Yale Law graduate and active member of the Yale alumni community, I believe that elite universities are in the middle of an identity crisis. And they need to understand that the accusations of intolerance are part of an ongoing effort to make space for people deemed “outsiders.” Advertisement Advertisement
The Senate Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee turned its attention to Yale after the law school made a decision to restrict funding for student internships at faith-based organizations that have a traditional understanding of sexual morality. But this is a much deeper problem than one particular policy. Genuine concern over anti-conservative bias at Ivy League schools explains the fervor in response to Harvard University’s recent decision to rescind its admissions offer to Parkland-shooting survivor Kyle Kashuv, and it also explains reactions to how universities have responded to Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court. Cruz’s investigation will surely have implications for college campuses across the country.
Like other elite institutions, Yale has long struggled with creating a genuinely inclusive and diverse environment. Advertisement
The category of who is welcome at elite universities, who appears to fit in, and what a “typical” Ivy League student or professor looks like has always been overly narrow, historically excluding most Americans because of race, gender, or class. For most of the school’s history, someone like me wouldn’t have been admitted to Yale or given adequate financial aid to attend. Today’s efforts to fight anti-Christian and anti-conservative bias are part of a continuing struggle to create an accessible, truly merit-based university.
When I was a law student, from 2010 to 2013, I was deeply bothered by an orthodoxy I found in elite law schools, a status quo that didn’t include me because I had different priorities than the institutions did. For example, I gave a lot of my time to leading the Yale Black Law Students Association and working in New Haven public schools. I was part of the communities around Yale, not stuck in an ivory tower, because I wanted to be connected to neighborhoods similar to where I grew up in Toronto. Grassroots community service focused on empowering people (as opposed to top-down legal services) was not rewarded or encouraged by elite universities or employers, so I mostly felt like an outsider swimming against the current. Advertisement
Still, elite universities were not as partisan then as they are today. Yes, most of my Yale classmates would identify as Democrats or leftists, and conservatives usually kept their political opinions to themselves. I never saw any open hostility toward conservatives, though, until I returned to Yale four years later as a guest speaker. Advertisement
In October 2017, I made a presentation to a Yale seminar class focused on the opioid crisis. My presentation partly discussed the importance of a kinship-care bill in the Ohio state legislature that would provide more resources to the child-welfare system. Yale professor Ian Ayres was in the classroom and openly criticized my presentation, which is his right, but he went so far as to personally attack my former Yale classmate J. D. Vance — the author of Hillbilly Elegy, who worked with me to support the Ohio legislation. It appeared to me as though Ayres did not want me on campus talking about my work with J. D. Shocked, I exited the classroom wondering why he made things unnecessarily personal. A few days later, Ayres’s potentially partisan motivations became clearer when I learned that he was hosting a fundraiser for Betsy Rader, a 2018 Democratic candidate for Congress who was trying to build her political brand in Ohio by trashing J. D., a popular Republican, in The Washington Post .
At face value, feeling excluded as I did as a student and feeling unwelcome as a guest speaker may seem very different. My two roles — as a working-class black student trying to empower New Haven youth, and a lawyer in Ohio working with conservatives — should have little in common. However, both scenarios where I felt pushed away by Yale are rooted in the narrowness of the elite university identity. Is it an inclusive and diverse identity based on skill and merit? Or is it an identity based on a particular political ideology, one that leaves as little room for grassroots community service as it does for Christianity and conservatism? Advertisement"

It’s not exactly breaking news when AOC says something indefensible, but she outdid herself in an Instagram video last night by calling U.S. immigration facilities at the border “concentration camps”: Ocasio-Cortez falsely claims Trump is operating concentration camps, compares the situation to the Holocaust: “The U.S. is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are. … ‘Never Again’ means something … we need to do something about it” pic.twitter.com/F2MmZ8y2dT

Her defense was that “concentration camps” is a simply a term for facilities holding masses of people without trial. But it’s obviously pejorative, and she made it clear what she meant during the video when she invoked the phrase “never again.” Advertisement Advertisement
This is a ridiculous smear at every level: We obviously aren’t rounding up people and sending them to these camps, but temporarily holding people who are coming over the border illegally of their own volition. Yes, the facilities are badly over-taxed, but Congress could alleviate the situation immediately by appropriating more resources. The migrants aren’t being held in the absence of due process, but in many cases at the beginning of a long asylum process. Finally, they aren’t being held for the duration, but are released into the country in fairly short order, likely never to be removed."
En Banc Eleventh Circuit to Address Challenge to State Minimum-Wage Law | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/en-banc-eleventh-circuit-to-address-challenge-to-state-minimum-wage-law/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter June 19, 2019 9:39 AM
In an amazing opinion last July, an Eleventh Circuit panel ruled (in Lewis v. Governor of Alabama ) that plaintiffs challenging Alabama’s Minimum Wage Act had “stated a plausible claim” that the law “had the purpose and effect of depriving Birmingham’s black citizens equal economic opportunities on the basis of race, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.” I outlined my criticisms of that ruling in this post and won’t repeat them here.
I’d instead like to pass along some encouraging news that I had missed. Back in January, the Eleventh Circuit granted rehearing en banc of the case and vacated the panel’s ruling. The court has instructed counsel “to focus their briefs on the following issues”:
(1) Whether the plaintiffs have standing under Article III of the Constitution.
(2) Whether the Attorney of Alabama is a proper defendant under Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).
(3) Whether the complaint states a claim of racial discrimination, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, that is plausible under the pleading standard established in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Iqbal v. Ashcroft, 556 U.S. 662 (2009).

Biden is also coming under fire for these remarks :
By the way, you know, remember I got in trouble with some of the people on my team, on the Democratic side, because I said, ‘You know what I’ve found is rich people are just as patriotic as poor people.’ Not a joke. I mean, we may not want to demonize anybody who has made money. The truth of the matter is, you all, you all know, you all know in your gut what has to be done. We can disagree in the margins but the truth of the matter is it’s all within our wheelhouse and nobody has to be punished. No one’s standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change. Because when we have income inequality as large as we have in the United States today, it brews and ferments political discord and basic revolution. Not a joke. Not a joke. I’m not [inaudible] revolution. But not a joke. It allows demagogues to step in and say the reason where we are is because of the other, the other. You’re not the other. I need you very badly.

Left-wingers are exercised, of course, by the comments that “nothing would fundamentally change” for rich people during Biden’s presidency and that he really needs them. (Both comments would have been true for the last two Democratic presidents, too, but they never made the admissions.)"

John Sweeeney argues on the homepage today for the U.S. to adopt a revenue-neutral carbon tax as part of a strategy of moving the world toward carbon taxes. Comments
I find this alternative strategy for dealing with the risks of climate change superior. Note the estimate that “an optimally designed and implemented global carbon tax would provide an expected net benefit of about 0.2% of the present value of global GDP over the next several centuries.” As authors Jim Manzi and Pete Wehner note, that’s “a lot of money,” but given the many ways a real-world regime of global taxes would fall short of optimality it is not a strong reason to go down this road. Advertisement
I am also skeptical that a carbon tax “could be designed to be revenue-neutral and thus not result in an expansion of government,” as Sweeney writes. Let’s say we reduced payroll or income taxes dollar-for-dollar to account for the new carbon tax. Over the long run, revenue-neutrality seems unlikely to hold because it is easier to raise a tax that already exists than to create one that doesn’t. If you really wanted long-run revenue neutrality, you’d need, I think, to extinguish a comparably large revenue source altogether as part of the deal for creating a carbon tax."
Georgetown's Rev. James V. Schall Interview -- Inciting Wonder Remembering a Wise Teacher | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/inciting-wonder-remembering-a-wise-teacher-rev-james-v-schall-s-j/,"June 19, 2019 5:28 PM (Patrick Semansky/Reuters)
Earlier this year, Fr. James V. Schall, S.J., storied Georgetown professor of government, nearly died. After I saw that he was writing columns again, I asked him if he would do an interview about the near-death experience. Now he has really been gone for two months — there’s a memorial Mass at Georgetown today for those who couldn’t make it to his Christian burial Mass in California — and I realize that even though I broke up our final conversation (over e-mail) into a few pieces here and here and here , I have a little more from our exchange I never published anywhere. I thought some of you who knew and loved the priest and teacher, or read him over the years, might want to read some of his other near-closing thoughts. I also thought some of the people on his mind might appreciate knowing.
Lopez: In a recent e-mail to me, you described Msgr. Robert Sokolowski at (my alma mater) The Catholic University of America as one of the best minds we have today in the Church. Why is that? What do we all have to learn from him?
Fr. Schall: Msgr. Sokolowski is a good friend. I had come across his work only later in life and have often spoken with or written to him. His books and thought reveal a clarity of thought and a carefulness and attention to reality for which he gives a lucid and penetrating account. His life work has been to show how the work of Edmund Husserl relates to Aquinas and the core of western thought.
At first sight, his body of publications is formidable. The best single philosophy book I know, one that step by step takes the reader through every essential phase of human thought is found in his book The Phenomenology of the Human Person . He wanted to entitle this book, “The Agent of Truth,” a far better title, but the publishers (Cambridge) thought it sounded too much like a detective story! He begins with his oft-repeated principle that the first act of the mind is contemplative and wants first to distinguish clearly what is found not first in the mind but in reality. His book breaks every issue down to intelligible parts which build on each other. No book is quite like it.
Sokolowski knows his history of thought, the connection of ideas, and modern thought on basic issues. His book, The God of Faith and Reason is the place to begin reading him. His fundamental idea that God is not “part” of the world develops into an understanding of creation as something that exists but need not and thus requires an origin that is transcendent to the given cosmos in which we find ourselves. Advertisement Advertisement
Sokolowski’s book, Christian Faith & Human Understanding , is a series of profound essays on a number of theological and moral principles. His discussion of a vocation like medicine or any of the professions is really outstanding. He also recognizes in his book, Pictures, Quotations, and Distinctions that we do now just learn by words (a central topic of his Phenomenology of the Human Person ). His book, Eucharistic Presence lays out the whole issue of the Eucharist in all its philosophical and theological overtones. Each year or so he has taken a class through his commentary on Aristotle’s Politics and its abiding ramifications. All of this is in addition to his work on Husserl, the basic lines of which are found in his book, An Introduction to Phenomenology .
In brief, I would affirm that no one can take us to the heart and essentials of the complete truth of things faster than Sokolowski. But when you finally read him, he demands attention, he incites your wonder. Truth does not exist except when it is actively affirmed in a mind that knows of what is that it is. Advertisement
Lopez: You gave a “Last Lecture” in Gaston Hall at Georgetown in 2012. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Is there anything you might add?
Fr. Schall: No, I am content with what was found in that lecture. It is not good form to have more than one “last lecture.” That lecture had to do with my life as a teacher midst many of the several thousand students I had in various classes over the years of my tenure at Georgetown. No professor can be indifferent to what his students have taught him. I followed the observation of Frederick Wilhelmsen that a professor is not a professor unless he finally set down for his students and for the public what it is that he has learned in his time in academia. The “Last Lecture” was my effort to fulfill this welcome admonition.
We had one another exchange about the future of the Church and the culture in which he recommended both Jennifer Roback Morse’s The Sexual State and Daniel Maloney’s The Idol of the Age . He cited, too, a John XXIII word of “’ Corragio ‘; it is not over yet.”"

2002 —In Atkins v. Virginia , the Court, in an opinion by Justice Stevens (for a majority of six justices), relies on the “direction of change” in state laws, the views of the supposed “world community” and of various professional and religious groups, and polling data to rule that execution of anyone who is even slightly mentally retarded violates the “evolving standards of decency” that it sees as governing application of the Eighth Amendment. (A person who has properly been found competent to stand trial, who is aware of the punishment he is about to suffer and why, and whose subaverage intellectual capacity has been found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen his responsibility for a crime may nonetheless be “mentally retarded.”) Advertisement
In dissent, Justice Scalia marvels at the majority’s ability to extract a “national consensus” from the fact that 18 of the 38 states that permit capital punishment have recently enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded. Moreover, Scalia charges, the majority’s assumption that judges and juries are unable to take proper account of mental retardation “is not only unsubstantiated, but contradicts the immemorial belief, here and in England, that they play an indispensable role in such matters.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Keanu Reeves’ Dance with Death in John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum,www.nationalreview.com,Ross Douthat,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/keanu-reeves-dance-with-death-in-john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum/,"June 20, 2019 11:38 AM Keanu Reeves in John Wick: Chapter 3 — Parabellum (Summit Entertainment)
I have a confession: I did not love the first John Wick movie. If you don’t like action movies in which loner heroes fight their way through a succession of gangland enemies to get revenge for some deep wrong or betrayal, then you won’t find this a surprising opinion. But I do like such movies, and Wick was hailed by connoisseurs of the genre as a highly effective return to form, its success a bright spot in a landscape where special effects have overtaken the old choreography of fisticuffs. Advertisement Advertisement
Which, in many ways, it was. But I had a peculiar gripe about the titular main character, a former hitman played by Keanu Reeves in his finest stone-faced style, who carves his way through the Russian mob after a Mafioso idiot scion beats him up and steals his car and kills . . . his . . . dog. (The dog was a gift from his late wife, so the movie isn’t just a canine-lover’s manifesto.)
The heart of this particular genre’s appeal is watching somebody do the impossible — fight an entire world of enemies singlehandedly, and win — but without the superheroic gifts that dominate the defining genre of our time. There are two ways this can happen: He can be an everyman, like Bruce Willis’s character in Die Hard , who under extraordinary circumstances uses his brains and guts and luck and gumption to outwit as well as outfight his enemies. Or he can be someone with a very special set of skills — the martial arts of Jackie Chan, the assassin’s talents of Liam Neeson’s Taken dad. In either case, he’ll still have to take more punishment than any normal human being could. But in both cases you’re given some reason to suspend your disbelief that he could pull it off. Advertisement
And what has kept me from investing fully in Mr. Wick, now back for his third outing in John Wick: Parabellum , is that I don’t know how he does it. He is not a beleaguered everyman in the John McClane style, that’s for sure. Instead, we are told again and again, usually in hushed, Russian-accented tones, that he’s a nearly supernatural force, a Baba Yaga, a bogeyman. Well and good. But then in the action scenes that follow, he never seems that much more capable than any of his enemies; he just fights them one on one, or sometimes one on two or three, and always comes out just barely ahead.
This workmanlike quality lends the fights a certain grit, a punishing realism, that’s absent when a martial artist goes to work, and Wick’s progress evokes at times the doggedness of Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, another hardworking action hero. But Hunt has his team and his masks and his gadgets to help explain why he always pulls things out. Whereas Wick is a man (mostly) alone, and as the fights accumulate and the body count rises, the sense that the story wants to impart, of John Wick, force of nature, Death itself, gives way to the sense that he’s surviving all these fights just because the screenplay requires him to be a force of nature — when in reality, in the world we’re being shown, he’s just a solid, capable fighter who survives because all the breaks go his way.
Is this a stupid complaint about a series that makes no pretense of realism elsewhere — that takes place in a world with a secret government employing assassins who seem to kill only one another and whose battles are largely ignored by civilians and passers-by? Maybe so. I’m a great believer in the internal consistency of fantasy worlds, the importance of keeping things plausible not even but especially when you’re positing a different architecture for the universe. (This is a test that Game of Thrones spent many seasons passing and then abruptly failed.) But it’s possible that what the Wick movies are offering is a kind of magical-realist version of the action genre, where the luck of the protagonist is itself built into their universe’s architecture. Advertisement
And approaching them in that spirit I have enjoyed the movies more in certain ways with each installment, as the baroque assassin’s world envelops the narrative, the appearances by normal people fall away, and we just move from one ludicrously tricked-out lair to another, with stops in between at the movies’ best invention, the Continental Hotels (there’s one in every city), where assassins are required to keep the peace.

T he first meteorologists were the cows. On some road trip of my youth, passing a stony upstate farm, one of my parents explained that when the cows are standing it will not rain, but when they are sitting it will. As I grew older I devised a pseudo-scientific explanation for their prescience — increasing air pressure pushes them earthward — but never tried to confirm it, simply accepting their predictive powers as fact. I test them every weekend when I take the mill road to my house in the country. Across the road from the waterfall that must have been the site of the structure that gave the road its name is a barn and a field where there are always two, three, or four cows. Sometimes they are all upright, if it is proper to say that of four-footed creatures, sometimes they all rest on the grass like so many bovine Buddhas. Sometimes one stands while the others sit, or vice versa; my wife and I will say, mixed forecast. For years their record was extremely good, though of late they have often been off, so much so that we have taken to asking (if they are seated), Are they predicting, or just resting? To ask the question is to introduce a greater burden of observation and deduction than a simple adage will bear, so now we simply regard them as scenery. Advertisement Advertisement
Human meteorologists have changed too. When I first read it, the Broadsheet of the Resistance ran meager columns of data, all print, accompanied by information on the phases of the moon, in case you had misplaced your Farmers’ Almanac . The National Hotel Lobby Newspaper changed all that. In came colors and maps; slanty lines for storm fronts; yellow sun faces for clear skies. It reported the weather nationwide too; newspapers with international readerships added Dubai to Pittsburgh. TV weather changed along with print. The weather girl was an ongoing off-color joke, and Bill Murray supplied the ultimate satire of all-knowingness, but that is what broadcast weather became: a dollop of titillation, atop the omniscience of the Wizard of Oz — as it rained in the beginning, rains now, and ever shall rain (until the forecast changes). Advertisement
The forecast for information consumption changed the most. Now the weather comes to us online. The official site, maintained by an agency of the federal government, will give the current weather for whatever zip code you type in, and a forecast for succeeding days and nights, up to a week out: high and low temperatures, wind speeds and directions, chances of precipitation, rainfall amounts. All the future events are extrapolations from current trends. In a box midway down the main screen, off to the side, is displayed the real information from which the presumed trends are derived: maps of clouds as observed by satellites. By clicking on the proper arrow, you can look farther afield in all the directions of the compass. All clear here, but see that big blot of something over the neighboring state; and there, over the middle of its neighbor, another equally forbidding. Keep your umbrella handy.
A private company parrots this data, adding pseudo-precise scheduling to it: a 51 percent chance of rain at 3 p.m., dropping to 47 percent at 4. What algorithm exactly allows them to slice it so fine? I would as soon trust two cows sitting, one standing. But they must be right, the site has accu for accurate in its title. Advertisement
I notice that Wendell Berry, no doubt reacting to such pretensions, is against weather forecasting, as well as every other aspect of modernity. His is a lonely position. Men have been consulting weather glasses and other barometers for a long time. I am not a farmer with a backlist, but a weekend refugee from the city. If I don’t plant between Friday and Sunday, it doesn’t get done. So when I am upstate I check online several times a day. Advertisement
The first weekend of June everything went well. After an unusually wet May, there were three clear days, with a chance of rain Sunday night, so everything we planted would get a good wet tuck-in.
Sunday evening is when we clean up, load the car, and drive to the bus that takes us home. Although we have done the drill about 800 times, it is still a mad rush: paper to the fireplace, scraps to the compost, bottles and garbage to the bins for the transfer station, clothes and food in the suitcase. My wife and I argue over who has more to do. Each of us is right (and wrong). As we scurried, the leaves on the trees increased their tempo too, fluttering in the way that indicates new weather coming in. Good to know that the forecasts were accurate. Advertisement
Bull’s-eye accurate. The moment we stepped out the front door, at the time predicted for a “chance” of precipitation, the heavens opened. There was still sunlight in the west, but in the right here it was pouring. Advertisement Advertisement
The drive to the bus station takes half an hour. Ten or 15 minutes along the rain stopped. We followed a rainbow, with a dim second rainbow hovering at the threshold of existence outside it. As we waited for the bus not a drop fell."
Ballpark : How Baseball Stadiums Became Beautiful Again,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/ballpark-how-baseball-stadiums-became-beautiful-again/,"June 20, 2019 11:28 AM Memorial Stadium during the World Series featuring the Baltimore Orioles and the Pittsburgh Pirates, October 1979 (Rich Pilling/Contributor/Getty Images) Ballpark: Baseball in the American City , by Paul Goldberger (Knopf, 384 pp., $35)
M emorial Stadium in Baltimore wasn’t much of a ballpark. I didn’t know that when I went there for my first major-league baseball game as a kid in the late 1970s and while walking up to our seats caught a glimpse through a tunnel of the field, the greenest, most perfect grass I’d ever seen, a color I didn’t know existed. (This was long before the advent of high-def TV.) Advertisement
The lush field at the center of an enclosure of concrete and steel provides one of the themes of Paul Goldberger’s new book. For him, the ballpark is the garden in the city, the rus in urbe , a sports combination of the Jeffersonian agrarian tradition and the Hamiltonian emphasis on cities and industry.
A former architecture writer for the New York Times and The New Yorker , Goldberger calls the ballpark “one of the greatest of all American building types” and argues that, “as much as the town square, the street, the park, and the plaza, the baseball park is a key part of American public space.”
Goldberger relates the history of baseball through its physical facilities and the business, real-estate, and design considerations that created them. You couldn’t do this with any other major sport. It’s rare that a football stadium or basketball or hockey arena becomes memorable in its own right. The experience of baseball, in contrast, is caught up in its surroundings. Advertisement
Even watching a game on TV played at the Trop in Tampa Bay, the SkyDome in Toronto, the Coliseum in Oakland, or the New Comiskey (ridiculously called “Guaranteed Rate Field”) is less appealing than at a place with some character. Advertisement
Ballpark is a lovely book that is oversized but still manageable to hold and read, and it has enough drawings and photographs to illustrate Goldberger’s points about each park. He catalogues the journey from ballparks shoehorned into city streets, to the wrong turn into monochromatic dual-use forms, before an unexpected, triumphant return to the traditional.
Ballparks are one of the few public aspects of American life — it’s hard to think of other examples, frankly — that have gotten more beautiful rather than less. Advertisement
Goldberger argues, correctly, that despite our association of baseball with rural America, as captured in the classic movie Field of Dreams , the game is more connected to the city.
The first ballpark was built in Brooklyn in 1862 and called “Union Grounds.” (Amazingly enough, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” not yet the national anthem, was played before the first game.) New York and Brooklyn, then separate cities, had the greatest number of teams.
The second version of the South End Grounds in Boston, built in 1888, was the most ambitious of the 19th-century parks, with conical towers and other pinnacles atop a recognizably modern double-deck grandstand. Like many of the wooden ballparks of this era, it burned down. The fire started in the right-field bleachers during a game and ended up destroying 200 buildings in Roxbury.
Baseball was split at the outset between the impulses to appeal to the working man and to the more respectable, middle-class sort. In St. Louis, a tavern owner named Chris von der Ahe realized that fans from a nearby ballpark provided a flow of customers and took it over, rebuilding it as Sportsman’s Park. Not subtle, he placed a beer garden within the field of play. (On these grounds alone, I hazard to say my longtime friend and NR colleague Kevin Longstreet, a fellow Yankee die-hard, would consider Sportsman’s one of the great ballparks.) Advertisement
On the other end of the spectrum, Albert Spalding rebuilt Lakefront Park in Chicago in 1883 with private boxes furnished with upholstered chairs and tended by waiters, a forerunner of the luxury box. Advertisement
The 20th century brought the age of steel, brick, and concrete, and what Goldberger refers to as “the Golden Age” in 1912–14. It gave us Crosley Field, where the Reds played until 1970, with an upward slope known as the “terrace” in left field; Tiger Stadium, quirky and cozy (a flagpole was in the field of play in deep center); and especially the “jewel boxes” of Fenway, Wrigley, and Ebbets.
They had in common idiosyncrasies owing to where and how they were built, and an extraordinary intimacy. Some of their signature features didn’t come until later. The famous Green Monster and the “Dartmouth Green” paint of the interior of Fenway arrived with renovations. Wrigley didn’t get its iconic ivy walls until the 1930s. (An experiment in planting trees in the bleachers failed.) Advertisement
Subsequent decades brought a flight from cities, and from eccentricity. Cleveland previewed what was to come in the 1930s with its publicly funded, gargantuan, usually half-empty, symmetrical, multi-sport Municipal Stadium. The bleachers were so distant that no one ever hit a home run into them. So inhospitable was the stadium to baseball that for more than a decade the Indians split time between their prior little bandbox of a home, League Park, and the “Mistake by the Lake.” Advertisement
The truly dreadful, indistinguishable concrete donuts, like other lamentable trends in American life, were a product of the 1960s. If the stadiums looked like cookie-cutter public-works projects, it’s because they often were.
The turning point, of course, was Camden Yards in Baltimore. Advertisement
Originally conceived as another multi-sport suburban facility, it instead decisively moved baseball beyond such hybrids. A momentous decision at the outset was to keep an old Baltimore & Ohio Railroad warehouse intact at the site of the new park. The nostalgic feel of the brick warehouse usefully pointed backward.
Camden Yards has a red-brick exterior and exposed steel supports inside, eschewing the concrete of the donuts. It limits foul territory to make ground-level seats closer, and the stands are arranged asymmetrically to avoid a deadening sameness. Advertising on the outfield walls — for the first time since Connie Mack Stadium in Philadelphia closed in 1970 — recalls classic parks. And the stands frame a view of the Baltimore skyline, anchoring the park in the city.
It’s easy to forget what a revelation Camden Yards was now that its retro style has become a design cliché. Its influence left a stamp on the best of the new parks: PNC Park in Pittsburgh, which, outside of Fenway and Wrigley, might be the most charming place to watch a game in the country; Oracle Park in San Francisco, which is everything its execrable forebear, Candlestick, wasn’t; T-Mobile Park in Seattle, which is enchanting despite a retractable roof.
I agree with almost all of Paul Goldberger’s judgments, although I think he neglects the importance of noise. Not the blaring announcements and nonstop blasting of music in contemporary stadiums (get off my lawn!), but the roar of the crowd. What the Metrodome and Kingdome lacked in suitability for baseball, they could make up with crazed crowd noise, an indispensable part of sports excitement.
This is one of my beefs with the new Yankee Stadium. I appreciate the amenities and the larger, more functional spaces. The halls of the old Yankee Stadium could feel like a crowded subway platform. But the new stadium disperses sound, so the manic energy of the old place — you sometimes could feel the upper deck rock — is a thing of memory."
SCOTUS Rules Forty Foot ‘Peace Cross’ Can Remain on State Property in Maryland,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/scotus-rules-forty-foot-peace-cross-can-remain-on-state-property-in-maryland/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter June 20, 2019 11:20 AM Supporters of the memorial cross in Bladensburg, Md., gather outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., February 27, 2019. (Lawrence Hurley/Reuters)
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a 40-foot “peace cross” commemorating the men from a suburban Maryland town who died in World War I can remain on state property.
Writing for the 7 – 2 majority , Justice Samuel Alito held that the cross did not violate the Constitution’s establishment clause, as was alleged by the plaintiffs, a group of humanists who argued the war monument represented a state endorsement of Christianity.
“The Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in which people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, and the presence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood for so many years is fully consistent with that aim,” Alito wrote. “The cross is undoubtedly a Christian symbol, but that fact should not blind us to everything else that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent. . . . For all these reasons, the Cross does not offend the Constitution.”
Liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented while conservatives Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas jointly concurred. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote his own concurrence. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The cross was initially built on private land by members of the Bladensburg, Md. community in 1925 to commemorate the 49 Prince George’s County natives who died in World War I. The state took over the property, which is situated next to a major intersection, in 1961 and has since spent $117,000 to maintain it.
The American Humanist Association sued in 2014 to have the cross taken down. A three-judge panel then ruled in 2017 that the cross’s presence on state land violated the establishment clause, which codified the separation between church and state.
Attorneys for the American legion, which initially funded the cross’s construction, argued that the cross’s removal would lead to the destruction of hundreds of religious war memorials currently situated on public land across the country. “This is a landmark victory for religious freedom. The days of illegitimately weaponizing the Establishment Clause and attacking religious symbols in public are over,” said Kelly Shackelford, President, CEO, and Chief Counsel to First Liberty, which represented the American Legion. “Our Founders would have been appalled at this attempt to make the government hostile to our religious heritage, history, and symbols. The attempted perversion of our Constitution is now over, and every American now has more freedom than they have had in decades, with a government no longer hostile to people or expressions of faith.”
While conservative groups celebrated the ruling, they expressed concern that the opinion did not more clearly delineate the establishment clause’s limitations."
Letters,www.nationalreview.com,NR Editors,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/letters-251/,"June 20, 2019 11:14 AM (Pixabay) ‘No’ to Socialized Medicine, Cont’d
A recent article by Avik Roy (“Socialized Medicine Is Bad for Your Health,” June 3) gives me pause in my waning support for repeal-and-replace and my gradual conversion to support for single-payer health care. But I would like to draw his attention to two points not addressed in his article that seem to me to be fundamental to any health-care solution:
First, Roy makes no mention of mandating health coverage for all Americans. That so many people were uninsured is what led us to Medicaid and Obamacare. It seems this issue must be addressed: We need to mandate that all people in the U.S. purchase health insurance. It must be legal, constitutional, and enforceable. This will not only vanquish the liberal arguments that the government must step in and provide coverage (at taxpayer expense), but it will also drive insurance rates down, as actuarial models will improve substantially with 100 percent participation.
Second, Roy does not address the fact that, while many plans provided by large employers do indeed limit choice, they are often self-insurance — companies pay employee claims out of their own pockets and hire an insurance company to handle all administrative matters. It is unclear to me how giving me choice will result in lower cost for the same benefit; it seems it might get more expensive. David Beers Via email
Avik Roy responds : We don’t need to force everyone to buy health insurance to have a system in which every American can afford coverage. Indeed, doing so would be counterproductive, as it would allow policymakers to further drive up costs, knowing that they could pass those costs on to consumers. In a market-based system, insurers have an incentive to keep costs low, because they know you’ll choose to go without coverage if their products don’t provide enough value."

• By the time he’s done, Joe Biden will have disowned Amtrak.
• Iran blew up a couple of tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most important commercial thoroughfares in the world. There’s been skepticism on the left and in Europe over the intelligence, but there’s little doubt — the Iranians have threatened to carry out such attacks, and a video captured one of their boats removing an unexploded mine, which would be crucial evidence, from the hull of one of the ships. The operative question isn’t “Whodunit?” but “What to do?” Such threats in the Strait should be intolerable to us, given its strategic importance. If we don’t hit Iran for this attack, we should make it clear that we will retaliate if there is another one. We don’t want to get embroiled in a major war with Iran, but Tehran has an incentive to avoid an out-of-control escalation itself, since it has much more to lose. Iran assumes that it can increase its leverage in the ongoing contention over its nuclear program by carrying out deniable attacks with impunity. We should make it clear that it’s wrong about that.
• In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, President Trump said he’d accept information from a foreign government in the 2020 campaign. Naturally, all hell broke loose. Trump’s answer was muddled — at one point, he said he’d both accept the information and call the FBI, and he cited as a hypothetical Norway coming forward, whereas Stephanopoulos cited Russia or China. The right answer obviously is that you call the FBI if approached by a foreign adversary because, even if you aren’t inclined to do so on principle, you don’t know what the ulterior motive is or how you might get played. We suspect Trump simply didn’t want to admit by implication what is obviously true: that Don Jr. was wrong to accept the infamous Trump Tower meeting. He certainly wasn’t setting out a plausible standard operating procedure. After years of investigation of that 2016 meeting, there’s no way anyone from the reelection campaign is going to want to take the political and legal risk of sitting down with shady representatives of a foreign government promising oppo. Too bad that wasn’t the first instinct of his 2016 team.
• President Trump bludgeoned Mexico into promising more action to help with the migrant crisis. Trump’s threat of steadily escalating tariffs against Mexico had huge downside risks. If implemented, the tariffs would have been disruptive at a time when U.S. growth is perhaps slowing, been a gut punch to an allied country whose stability is important to us, and probably precipitated a congressional revolt against the policy. Instead, Mexico is devoting 6,000 troops to attempting to better police its own border with Guatemala, and, more important, has approved an extension of the so-called remain-in-Mexico policy. Under this arrangement, we can return asylum seekers to Mexico while their claims — almost always ultimately rejected — are adjudicated. This avoids one of the biggest problems of our current policy, which allows asylum seekers into the country, never to be removed, even if their claims are denied. Previously, Mexico limited the number of asylum seekers it accepted back to a trickle. Now it is saying it will take them with no restrictions, potentially a big advance. Given the blunderbuss weapon Trump was wielding, the Mexico deal is welcome, and better than could reasonably have been expected.
• The habit of abuse of presidential authority is now so ingrained that it is considered hardly noteworthy when a major presidential candidate promises unconstitutional executive action as part of her campaign. Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) has announced a new immigration plan that presumes congressional deadlock and extends executive action beyond even what Barack Obama did. The Harris plan would expand his quasi-amnesties and take other executive actions that would reinterpret federal statutes to provide some of the beneficiaries with a path to permanent legal residence. It’s astonishingly ambitious — especially considering that the Supreme Court rejected one of Obama’s actions and has grown more originalist since. But Harris’s plan represents the next step in the progress toward an imperial presidency. Obama at least claimed that Congress’s failure to enact his agenda “forced” him to act unilaterally. That was also Donald Trump’s argument for his emergency declaration. Harris isn’t waiting for Congress to disappoint her. She’s acting as if it didn’t exist.
• What Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) means when he calls himself a “democratic socialist” has been the subject of some debate. Does he merely mean that he wants the U.S. to be more like Scandinavia, albeit with higher corporate-tax rates? Or does his past praise for the Soviet Union, Cuba, and Venezuela give us a better picture of his goals? Sanders gave a big speech on the subject. He said that he is a democratic socialist in the tradition of FDR and Harry Truman: two people who never called themselves “socialists,” one of whom began our side of the Cold War. Their enemies called them “socialists” too, Sanders said. But wait: If he’s a proud socialist and he’s just like them, weren’t those enemies right to use that label? If on the other hand those mid-century Democrats were victims of hyperbole, then isn’t Sanders, by claiming them for his own socialist project, just repeating the insult? And while hugging the New Deal, Sanders couldn’t bring himself to say a discouraging word about Stalin or Castro or Maduro. His policy is to have no enemies on the left, and no clarity either.
• Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has put out what she calls “a plan for economic patriotism.” There are two germs of good ideas in it. Apprenticeships probably should be a bigger part of American career development, although what that has to do with patriotism is anyone’s guess. Consolidating the federal government’s many job-training programs may also be worthwhile, although it would be better to scrap the ones that don’t work first. The other ideas are counterproductive. Adding regulations to corporate research in an attempt to ensure that more of it goes toward producing high-paying jobs for Americans seems likely to backfire. Making governments buy American-made products would make a difference only to the extent that American taxpayers accept even lower value for the dollar than they already get. Managing the dollar to promote exports would in practice mean higher inflation in the long run in return for a short-term boost for manufacturers. A more regulated, centralized, highly taxed country, and probably a poorer one too, should not be any patriot’s goal.
• The Office of Special Counsel, run by an appointee of President Trump, has urged the firing of Kellyanne Conway for repeated violations of the Hatch Act. That’s the law that prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan politics on the taxpayer’s dime. The trouble is that the line between normal government activity and partisan politics is fuzzy, especially at the highest levels of government. When Kathleen Sebelius was secretary of health and human services, she got dinged for violating the act by advocating President Obama’s reelection at a meeting of a liberal organization. Perhaps the guardrail against overt partisanship is valuable; but presumably that meeting would have been a partisan one even if Sebelius had not explicitly mentioned the election. Trump says he will not fire Conway. Ultimately the question of whether government officials are acting in unacceptably partisan ways is one that voters, not lawyers, must decide.
• For decades, Joe Biden supported the Hyde amendment, which bars federal Medicaid funds from paying for abortions except in the cases of rape, incest, and threats to a mother’s life. In May, he was asked where he stood on the issue and said he opposed the amendment. A few weeks later, his campaign said he had misheard the question and still supported it. Coming under fire — everyone else in the Democratic presidential race opposes Hyde — Biden then either reversed himself or reversed himself again. He too now wants taxpayer-funded abortion. Most Americans, according to every poll that hasn’t been carefully worded by advocates of tax funding, are on the other side. But none of the Democratic candidates are hearing them well at the moment.
• New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand has suggested that opposition to abortion is akin to racism. Gillibrand, who lingers near the bottom of the pack of Democrats jockeying for the 2020 presidential nomination, has said she’ll require any potential judicial nominee of hers to back Roe v. Wade , declaring that nominating a judge who did not would be like appointing “a judge who’s racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic.” There you have it, ladies and gentlemen: Belief in the actual Constitution is now a hate crime.
• Pro-life Democrats are an endangered species in Congress, and pro-abortion groups are hard at work to bring about their extinction. Illinois congressman Dan Lipinski, one of only three pro-life Democrats left in the House, survived a 2018 primary challenge from left-wing activist Marie Newman by only two percentage points. Newman is running again to finish off Lipinski in 2020. If Democrats purge Lipinski, they won’t have to worry about losing the heavily Democratic district in the general election, but they will have to worry about the broader message they are sending to the country: that pro-lifers and even those with moderate views on abortion will not be tolerated within their party. Lipinski is a liberal on many issues, from guns to taxes to health care, but he deserves the full support of all pro-life Americans for standing athwart the culture of death within his own party.
• In Maine, Democratic governor Janet Mills has signed a bill allowing non-doctors — including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and midwives — to perform abortions. Activist groups such as Planned Parenthood have called the legislation a boon for women’s health, claiming that restrictions on who can perform abortions are “needless.” But even for those who wrongly call abortion “health care,” Maine’s provision should not be a cause for celebration. Despite the assertions of abortion-rights advocates, abortion procedures are not as simple as having a tooth pulled, especially later in pregnancy, and requirements that abortions be performed by doctors are in fact intended to protect women from harmful complications. If abortion advocates sincerely wished to prioritize “women’s health,” they wouldn’t champion legislation that increases the risks of abortion.
• California has approved a new budget that expands Medi-Cal coverage to illegal immigrants up to the age of 26. (Previously, the cap was 18.) The absolute lowest estimates place the cost for this expansion around $100 million. Even the higher estimates (somewhere around $260 million), however, don’t account for the incentive the program will create for illegal immigrants to move to California. As the magnet of free health care draws more and more people to the state, there’s no telling how high the price tag for this project might rise. So how will California pay for health care for tens of thousands more people? It’s bringing back the individual mandate. Governor Gavin Newsom expects the mandate to generate $1 billion over three years, a significant portion of which will fund the Medi-Cal expansion. So, California residents who do not buy health insurance — either because they don’t want it or, in many cases, can’t afford it — will have their money taken by the government. In this case, it won’t even be redistributed to their fellow citizens.
• The New York State legislature passed a bill aimed at making New York City, and potentially the rest of the state, more affordable. The bill includes an expansion of rent-regulation programs and intensifies the already dense thicket of rules on New York City landlords. It will almost certainly fail to achieve its aims. Efforts to control or regulate rent have been shown to decrease housing stock and raise rents. They favor the wealthy by incentivizing the construction of luxury units to the detriment of cheaper ones. New rules also make it harder for landlords to raise rent to pay for basic improvements, endangering the quality of lower-priced units. Hardly a victory for the average city-dweller.
• Texas prides itself on being hospitable to business, and now that welcoming spirit will extend even to the littlest entrepreneurs. The Lone Star State’s legislature has passed, and Governor Greg Abbott has signed, a bill that would eliminate the need for permits or licenses for “the occasional sale of lemonade or other nonalcoholic beverages . . . by an individual younger than 18 years of age.” In recent years the red tape on lemonade stands has come not so much from state tax authorities as from local governments and homeowner associations, but under the new law (which doesn’t take effect until September 1, but Texas summers are long), no such requirement can be imposed. Now kids from Amarillo to McAllen will be able to learn through experience about responsibility, salesmanship, accounting — and the importance of free markets unencumbered by government regulation.
• The 18th century had Thomas Paine. The 19th century had Henry David Thoreau. And the great American dissident of the early 21st century is . . . an outlaw baker named Jack Phillips. The baker took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court and won after Colorado attempted to sanction him for declining on religious grounds to bake a cake in celebration of a homosexual marriage. Though the Court ruled in his favor, the decision was narrow and wanted finality. Phillips was then sued by Autumn Scardina, a transgender activist who demanded a cake celebrating a gender transition. Phillips declined and countersued, and the case was dropped. Now Scardina has come back for a third round, this time demanding of Phillips a birthday cake, also for the purpose of celebrating a gender transition. Phillips has once again declined. This is pure harassment and should be treated as such. It is petty, it is vindictive, and it is without merit. But there is a larger question. The “public accommodations” aspect of American civil-rights law was a response to Jim Crow conditions that made it practically impossible for African Americans to travel freely and otherwise engage in fair commerce. The burden involved in finding a gay-friendly caterer or wedding planner is, to say the least, lighter. Members of sexual minorities should be treated with decency and dignity, but we need not pretend that their situation is comparable to that of the descendants of slaves.
• In June, the supreme court of Washington State ruled unanimously against Arlene’s Flowers. Its owner, Barronelle Stutzman, had been sued twice for declining to provide floral arrangements for same-sex weddings. Her lawyers defended her decision on grounds of “freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment.” She filed a countersuit, claiming that the legal actions against her had inflicted financial hardship, and lost at the state supreme court in 2017. She appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It sent her case back to the state, directing it to reconsider the matter in light of the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision, which hinged on the finding that the Colorado state agency that fined a Christian baker, Jack Phillips, for discriminating against a same-sex couple was motivated in part by religious animus. In affirming its original decision, the state supreme court in Washington argued that Stutzman encountered no religious animus, unlike Phillips. The anti-discrimination laws in question rest on an analogy between race and sexual identity. May a state decide that its interest in enforcing such laws compels it to deny religious exemptions? The Supreme Court has yet to say. Meanwhile, proponents of religious freedom had better hone their arguments.
• An Ohio jury has reached a verdict that should send a shock wave through college administrations across the land. It has ordered Oberlin College to pay $11 million in compensatory damages and $33 million in punitive damages for its employees’ role in accusing a local, family-owned grocery store and bakery of racism and racial profiling. The facts of the case are egregious but not surprising, given modern campus culture. After police arrested three Oberlin students for shoplifting alcohol and assaulting a store employee who had tried to stop the theft, student activists launched protests against the bakery, claiming the store’s shoplifting accusation was racially motivated. Administrators provided direct support to student protesters and even participated in the protests by distributing a defamatory flyer to the media, among other ways. The college also engaged in economic reprisals against the bakery by canceling a longstanding food-service relationship. In other words, without waiting for the facts, administrators participated in a campaign of defamation, wrongly harming the family’s business and damaging their reputation. But the First Amendment does not give anyone license to lie, especially if the target of the lie isn’t a public official. Oberlin may be full of students and administrators who consider themselves woke, but it was the jury that spoke truth to power.
• British prime minister Theresa May officially stepped down as leader of the Tory party, triggering a leadership contest. Her successor will have to take Brexit over the line and restore party unity, all while Parliament faces a Brexit-shaped constitutional crisis. In Tory leadership contests, candidates are knocked out in rounds. After Boris Johnson came in first in round one, with 114 of 303 votes (more than the second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers combined), he was guaranteed to be one of the final two candidates. Even though Johnson is a divisive figure among Tory MPs, political pragmatism is prevailing in a desperate hour. The Tories realize that they need to pick someone who can win a general election and rescue their brand from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Johnson is miles ahead in the polls among the Tory grassroots. At this writing, it seems very likely that he will be the next prime minister. Britain is now scheduled to leave the EU on October 31. While Johnson has said he would like an improved deal, something that the EU continually refused Theresa May, he has promised no further delays to Brexit and is prepared to leave without a deal. Should Parliament, or the speaker of the house, find a way to block no-deal — or should no-deal prove as disastrous as many fear — trust in both Johnson and the Tory party could be damaged for years to come.
• Kim Jong-nam was the eldest son of Kim Jong-il, the second North Korean dictator. Jong-nam was assassinated in February 2017 at the Kuala Lumpur airport. This was a hit ordered by the current dictator, Kim Jong-un, half-brother of the deceased. It transpires that Jong-nam was an informant for the CIA. We need all the information we can get on North Korea, the “Hermit Kingdom,” the most closed and isolated country in the world — and one with nuclear weapons. Asked about Jong-nam and the CIA, President Trump said, “I just received a beautiful letter from Kim Jong-un,” and “I would tell him that would not happen under my auspices, that’s for sure. I wouldn’t let that happen under my auspices.” If the president is not telling the truth, on this occasion we wouldn’t mind.
• Xinjiang Province in China — or East Turkestan, as the Uyghurs call it — is among the most miserable places on earth. Chinese authorities have rounded up more than a million Uyghurs, throwing them into a network of concentration camps or reeducation camps: a gulag. The object is to bring the Uyghurs to heel. To wipe out their culture and make good Chinese out of them (or kill them in the process). The Gauleiter of Xinjiang is the same man who did such an effective job in Tibet, subduing that proud and rebellious country. (His name is Chen Quanguo.) Xinjiang Province is also a perfect surveillance state, reaching Orwellian levels. Technology has virtually abolished privacy. Every day, men and women are dying in the camps. The United States and other free countries should make an issue of the Uyghurs. To take something relatively small: The next Winter Olympics are scheduled to be held in China. Why should they be?
• Every sport has its norms for sportsmanship in one-sided games. In baseball, you don’t steal or swing at 3–0 pitches; in basketball, you slow down the pace; in football, you run the ball up the middle. In soccer it’s harder to keep the score under control in case of a mismatch, but at least the Times Square–on–V-J Day celebrations that follow every goal can be toned down once your lead stretches to half a dozen. So the U.S. women’s World Cup team came in for some criticism when they continued with their wild, sometimes choreographed celebrations as the score climbed into double figures in a 13–0 rout of overmatched Thailand. Like all public controversies these days, this one quickly descended into each side criticizing a caricature of the other side’s view. We agree that the players should have taken it down a notch or two toward the end, but the whole thing isn’t worth getting worked up about. After all, it’s soccer.
• Many that are first shall be last, and the last shall be first — but, as Cleveland Indians fans will tell you, sometimes you have to wait a while for it to happen. They’re still waiting in Cleveland, but this spring supporters of two other longtime unsuccessful sports teams finally saw their faith rewarded, as Toronto won the NBA championship and St. Louis won the Stanley Cup, for the first time in each one’s history. We suspect most Canadians would have preferred it the other way around, since according to a recent survey, basketball is their eighth most popular sport (just ahead of curling, and hot on the heels of rugby), whereas in hockey, the national pastime, America has been eating Canada’s poutine continuously since 1994 (before Raptors roamed the earth; the team was a 1995 expansion entry). At least James Naismith, the inventor of basketball and a Canadian, has finally gotten his revenge.
• “Contain the spread of misinformation,” an apparatchik demands of a roomful of baffled Soviet bureaucrats in a chilling scene in Chernobyl , this summer’s exemplary and important HBO drama. Chernobyl , which stars Jared Harris and Stellan Skarsgaard as a scientist and a functionary charged with dealing with the aftermath of the horrific April 1986 explosion at a nuclear plant in Ukraine, then part of the USSR, took certain liberties with the truth for the sake of streamlining events (the character portrayed by Emily Watson, as a physicist who rushes to the scene unasked to provide advice, did not exist). Yet the five-hour miniseries, written by Craig Mazin and directed tautly by Johan Renck, was a television masterpiece as it turned reams of technical information into the stuff of riveting political thrillers. Despite dealing with matters few of us are conversant with, its dialogue was particularly tart and memorable: The phrase “it’s only 3.6 Roentgens,” variants of which are said many times by hacks seeking to convince themselves and others that the radioactivity is less than catastrophic, ought to enter the language as shorthand for inept damage control. While Mazin led the chorus who suggested the series had something to tell us about a certain radioactive occupant of the White House, what it actually provided was a stark lesson about a political idea that will apparently be glowing menacingly for thousands of years. The series depicts how socialism, with its collectivist view of the polity, shuts out dissent, oversight, and competing political actors when these are most vital. Whenever anyone tells you American politics is too fractured and quarrelsome to “get things done,” suggest he give Chernobyl a watch.
• A critic for The Atlantic , reviewing the new Broadway revival of Oklahoma! , mentions seeing numerous empty seats after the first intermission. Then, he continues, “as the second act wore on, still other theatergoers walked out, evidently repelled by the director Daniel Fish’s dark and daring reinterpretation of this enduring classic” — thereby missing the “quivering, feel-bad ending.” These remarks wouldn’t work as excerpts for newspaper ads, but they were actually part of a rave review. The New York Times agreed, calling Oklahoma! “the coolest new show on Broadway . . . wide-awake . . . altogether wonderful,” as well as “jolting,” “disturbing,” and “guaranteed to haunt your nightmares” (these are all meant as compliments). Oh, and some of the actors carry guns, but don’t freak: “ Oklahoma! is the first ‘gun neutral’ production in Broadway’s history. For every visible prop gun onstage, a donation is made to organizations ‘committed to helping solve the gun violence crisis by destroying firearms that should be out of circulation.’” As the moderator of a panel discussing “the use of guns in media” explains: “That’s why we make art — to talk about things as this way of communicating. And to evoke change.” If you feel like paying $150 a pop to get depressed and then be lectured on gun control, go right ahead.
• Franco Zeffirelli was one of the outstanding directors of our time, and indeed one of the outstanding artists. He directed opera, film, and television alike. His Romeo and Juliet movie (1968) was embraced by the world. His TV miniseries Jesus of Nazareth (1977) still leaves a deep impression on many. He was more popular with the public than he was with the critics. The main charge was excess, or extravagance. Indeed, the obit in the New York Times was headed “Franco Zeffirelli, Italian Director With Taste for Excess, Dies at 96.” One Times critic once lamented that Zeffirelli’s production of Turandot , the Puccini opera, was critic-proof: The critics could not kill it, because the public loved it so much. The public was right. Bravo, maestro, and R.I.P.
• Martin Feldstein was a realist. As chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan administration, he advocated the cause of old-fashioned balanced budgets over the excessive optimism of the more excitable supply-siders. He warned against the creation of the euro on the grounds that powerhouses such as Germany had economic interests different from those of countries such as Greece. The world did not heed his advice, but it would have been better off if it had. Feldstein took a doctorate from Oxford in 1967 and won the John Bates Clark Medal. He ran the National Bureau of Economic Research and taught freshman economics at Harvard for 20 years. His students included a young Larry Summers, who wrote that for Feldstein economics was “a calling, . . . never an intellectual game or political tool.” He was a thoroughgoing conservative, but unconstrained by partisanship: He gave Ronald Reagan good advice, and Barack Obama, too, serving on the latter’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. He was an advocate of dispassionate, empirical research in a field whose scholars are from time to time overwhelmed by bias. Dead at 79. R.I.P.
• Those who knew David Boyd Kennedy describe him as “humble” and “discreet.” From 1985 to 2003, he served as the president of the Earhart Foundation, whose low profile belied its record of accomplishment. Nine of its grantees, including Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, went on to win the Nobel Prize in economics. The foundation closed in 2015 after its trustees decided to spend down to zero, to prevent institutional drift and eventual betrayal of the intent of the founder, Harry Earhart. An Ann Arbor boy, Kennedy studied at Michigan, Indiana, McGill, and Yale and did a stint in Germany, at the Goethe-Institut. He served in the U.S. Army in the 1950s and picked up his Russian studies, which he had begun in college. Next stop, Wyoming, where he was elected to the legislature before being appointed state attorney general. He was active in the Republican party and held positions on the national as well as state committees. Born into the Silent Generation, Kennedy lived his life as a model of quiet purpose. He died in March, at 85, and was laid to rest in June. R.I.P. FOREIGN AFFAIRS The Example of Hong Kong
I f you need an example of man’s desire to be free, and his willingness to resist tyranny, look to the streets of Hong Kong. Some 2 million residents of the city gathered there, in protest. The population of the city is only 7.3 million. It was a stirring sight — one of the most stirring the world has seen in recent years.
The protests in Tiananmen Square were stirring, too. That was exactly 30 years ago. It ended in a massacre of protesters by the Communist authorities. Every Hong Konger in the streets this year knew that.
The immediate object of their protest was an extradition bill, which would have sent Hong Kongers accused of a crime to the mainland, for trial. On the mainland, there is nothing like justice. Instead, there is torture, a sham trial, and a gulag (called laogai ).
Yet the protest in Hong Kong had a more general object. Citizens are intent on keeping their freedoms, or not letting them go without a fight.
When the British turned over the city to the Chinese Communist Party in 1997, the promise was “one country, two systems,” for 50 years. This was always chimerical. Year by year, month by month, the CCP has been chipping away at Hong Kong’s autonomy. The Party will not tolerate Hong Kong’s brash, uppity independence until 2047.
Five years ago, democratic protests broke out. These were dubbed the “umbrella movement,” because people used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray. Earlier this year, eight leaders of the movement were sentenced. One of them, Chan Kin-man, a retired sociology professor, said, “In the verdict, the judge commented that we are naïve” (naïve to believe that a protest movement can attain, or retain, democracy). “But what is more naïve than believing in one country, two systems?”
In Taiwan, there were street protests in behalf of the umbrella-movement leaders sentenced. Why? Because Taiwanese know that their fate, and their democracy, is linked to Hong Kong.
In the wake of the extradition bill, the umbrellas came out again, as people tried to shield themselves from pepper spray, tear gas, and rubber bullets. Faced with this massive demonstration, which caught the attention of the world, Hong Kong officials backed down. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced the suspension of the extradition bill, and even offered an apology for its introduction.
Some protest leaders demanded her resignation. Others pointed out that whoever followed her would be in the same position — a servant of Xi Jinping, the PRC’s supreme leader (for life).
“Hong Kong’s bravery has bought it some time.” So said Edward Lucas, the British foreign-affairs analyst, and he put it well. We think back to “Finlandization,” which is often misunderstood.
Finlandization was the process by which Finland was rendered essentially neutral in the Cold War. The Finns did not set out to be Finlandized; they wished to be with the Free West. They fought like hell to avoid Sovietization, which resulted in their (mere) Finlandization.
In a similar vein, Hong Kongers are fighting like hell to keep the noose relatively loose around their necks. They are fighting to retain a little breathing space.
The ruling Communists in Beijing hate the example of Hong Kong, as they hate the example of (even worse) Taiwan. They don’t want other Chinese — more than a billion of them — to get ideas: ideas that Chinese people, in some places, can live freely and democratically. News of the drama in Hong Kong was blocked on the mainland."
Plowing the Web,www.nationalreview.com,James Lileks,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/plowing-the-web/,"June 20, 2019 11:14 AM Donald Trump appears at a campaign rally in Sioux City, Iowa. (Carlo Allegri/Reuters)
T rump gives a speech in Iowa, says something, Fox drops the feed. Vox writer Aaron Rupar tweets: “Beyond parody — Fox Business cuts away from Trump’s speech right after he laments, bizarrely, that tractors can’t hook up to the internet.”
It’s as if he thought they hit the kill switch because Fox has a standing rule about cutting away from the president when he enters Spontaneous Rumination Mode. What? Tractors connecting to the Internet? Did that go out? Tell me that didn’t go out!
“That might have made it out,” the producer says with a tremulous voice, “but the part where he said the threshing machines were like Pac-Man, going down rows and eating things, and asked the farmers whether they were pursued by small colored ghosts, I think we shut off by then.”
“Sir!” the social-media intern says. “A Vox reporter heard him say the part about the tractors.”
“ Vox ?” The Fox producer goes pale. “Of all the people to hear that, why did it have to be Vox ? How are we ever going to come back from this?”
The Vox reporter was speaking for the rest of the chattering types who live in the urban bubble. And by “bubble,” we mean a steel bathysphere that can descend to the bottom of the Mariana Trench without admitting a molecule of the surrounding water into the pressurized interior.
Apparently the Vox idea of a farmer comes directly from Green Acres , where tractors belch smoke and go rapita-rapita-rapita, and the farmer dude sits bouncing on a metal butt-bucket, gripping a steering wheel the diameter of tympani, chewing on a stalk of wheat while he plows the earth with his, er, plow? Is that what it’s called? Man, those farmers have a real complex language, don’t they. I will plow with the plow and then I will get in my truck and truck to town.
Idiots, the Vox writer thinks. Trump voters, all of them. Good thing they’re getting screwed by tariffs, and ha ha they’re all welfare queens now getting subsidies from that dad-blang’d gummint they hate so much. Welp, better get started on that piece about how the Democrats can find a message to win over the rural areas.
The reporter was quickly corrected in Twitter replies by people who pointed out the necessity of Internet connections for modern agriculture. No, they do not say, “Alexa, how high is the corn?” and Alexa, using the Internet, does not reply, “The corn is as high as an elephant’s eye.”
Not that farmers need the Internet the way modern urbanites do. Your average Vox writer’s Internet search history probably has things like “Do I need the socket’s consent when screwing in a light bulb?” Self-reliance, for this cohort, is when you walk to the take-out place instead of having DoorDash deliver to your apartment. If you look at a farmer’s search history, it does not have things like “How to remove arm caught in auger,” because they know from the start that that is a thing to be avoided.
Of course, if the farmers were smart, they would be in big cities writing pieces for websites like BuzzFeed , home of such deathless journalism as “eat five of these sixteen Madagascar beetle species and we’ll tell you which Disney Prince you’ll marry.” (There are similar quizzes for women.) In fact, BuzzFeed recently cast an approving eye towards the mysterious interior of the country and celebrated a Good Ol’ Country Boy who decorated his pickup for Pride Month, the seemingly 52-week-long festival of rainbow branding.
“On June 6,” the story said, “he decorated his truck with rainbow duct tape and mailbox letters that spell out ‘Not all country boys are bigots. Happy Pride Month.’”
Since we’re about a year or two away from a truckmaker running Pride ads that say “We don’t care whether you like a stick or prefer an automatic or whether you’re more comfortable with a hybrid, if you know what we mean. Just be yourself. Ford. Celebrating whatever road you take” or something, Truck Guy isn’t exactly that brave, but you’d think he was like a Democrat in 1944 adding school desegregation to the national platform.
From their giving him an attaboy for saying, in essence, that most country boys are bigots, you might infer they think most of your Bubba demographic sits around listening to Hank Williams — Junior, that is, not his Commie papa — peeling off beer-bottle labels with their thumbnails, waitin’ for their pack leader to stand, adjust his belt buckle, and say, “Well, boys, I say we can sit here all night and drink, or we can subsume our latent homosexual urges by projecting our fears onto a vulnerable member of the community. Who’s up for lettin’ the air out of the tires of that fella what teaches thee-ater o’er at the schoolhouse?”
“I don’t know, Billy. What if he makes an advance? What if’n he comes out dressed like a girl? I seen them cartoons where Bugs Bunny dresses like a girl and they always made me feel kinda funny, and not in a bad way.”
“Don’t worry, buddy, I got your back.”
“Yeah, well, what if he says that, too?”"

TV Is Terrible,www.nationalreview.com,Heather Wilhelm,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/tv-is-terrible/,"June 20, 2019 11:14 AM (Pixabay)
‘W hen television is bad, nothing is worse,” famously declared Newton Minow, former Federal Communications Commission chairman, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters in 1961. “I invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the air . . . . Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland.”
Today, of course, that wasteland is bigger, badder, and more impressive than ever. Television, especially when it comes to our growing bumper crop of streaming-on-demand options, is an endlessly chatty slot machine that never signs off, never breaks a sweat, and never shuts off the lights.
Despite its outward verve and vigor, however, have you noticed that the bulk of today’s TV seems a bit, well . . . down in the dumps? Dear television: We don’t see that much of each other, but I’m kind of worried about you! Much of what today’s critics hail as “great television,” in fact, is so dark that it could send one right round the bend.
In case you’re rolling your eyes and silently debating whether I’m a hopeless old fogey right now, here’s the interesting twist: Generation Z, filled to the brim with teenagers, seems to agree.
Take pop sensation Billie Eilish, 17. Eilish, whose shows sell out across the country, talks openly about her struggles with depression. As ’90s nostalgia flourishes, she almost appears as if she just stumbled off of a bus from the heart of the Seattle grunge era. Billie Eilish sings of quiet angst; her fans, largely teenagers, go wild.
Eilish’s new hit album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? , features tracks entitled “Bury a Friend” and “All the Good Girls Go to Hell.” But one of her most intriguing songs — and I’m not going to lie, I kind of like one or two of them — is titled “My Strange Addiction.” Lest you jump to any sordid conclusions, Eilish’s strange addiction has nothing to do with chemicals. Instead, she’s addicted to the very goofy and now-defunct NBC hit sitcom The Office .
“When I wake up, I put on The Office . If I’m making a burrito, I turn on The Office ,” Eilish told Elle in March . “I need the distraction so I don’t think. It’s like therapy for me.” The singer says she has watched each episode of The Office eleven times. This is impressive dedication: It adds up to approximately 814 hours, or roughly one-tenth of a year.
Eilish is not alone. During its tenure on Netflix, The Office has far and away served as one of the network’s most popular features, followed by reruns of the very cheery Friends and the ironically cheery Parks and Recreation . “It has become perhaps the defining post-Millennial rite of passage to binge the entirety of The Office on Netflix as fast as humanly possible, then binge it all over and over and over again, then quote and meme it as if to create an alternate internet world where the show is still going,” Vulture reported in April. To be addicted to The Office , the piece adds, is “extremely Gen Z.”
This is particularly fascinating when you consider that many of the show’s jokes — together with jokes from, say, The Hangover , plus the jokes from about 5,000 other movies made before approximately 2014 — likely wouldn’t fly in today’s ultra-woke, hypersensitive shame-o-sphere. Meanwhile, this particular rerun-fest isn’t just for Gen Z: When suffering from occasional brain burnout, my very Gen X self recently started rewatching The Office , too. This is because it is light, it is funny, and I know that it will scorch neither my eyeballs nor my soul with painfully detailed reenactments of regular maiming rituals performed by evil, scheming, hygiene-challenged fairy-folk. (Cough, ahem, Game of Thrones , cough.)
“Watch Ozark ,” my friends said. (I was traumatized after about four episodes.) “Watch Breaking Bad ,” my friends said. (I am still trying to purge the image of Walter White’s underwear from my mind.) “Watch The Handmaid’s Tale ,” my friends said. (Ha, ha! No!) “Watch Black Mirror ,” my friends said. (Oh, dear: I am way too paranoid for Black Mirror , which serves up a new technology-related horror story with every episode. Black Mirror makes me want to unplug all my WiFi in a panic and move to an off-the-grid rustic-chic yurt in the middle of the Texas desert. To be honest, I kind of want to do that anyway, but that’s another column.)
“Okay, watch Game of Thrones ,” my friends said. “Everyone’s watching Game of Thrones !” (Please see my note about painfully detailed reenactments of regular maiming rituals performed by evil, scheming, hygiene-challenged fairy-folk above; the show was described as a “wonderfully bleak journey” by the review clearinghouse Rotten Tomatoes. Help!)
Anyway, when my brain is too fried to read — I know, I know, I should be reading instead of watching The Office , so judge me as you will — there is at least one new television series that I have settled into: HBO’s Chernobyl. "

T he unfinished business of the Democratic party is socialism . Don’t take my word for it — consult Bernie Sanders.
Senator Sanders gave a madcap speech in which he ridiculed past conservative critics, beginning with Herbert Hoover and Ronald Reagan, for characterizing the expansive welfare-state ambitions of the New Deal and the Great Society as movements toward socialism . And then he . . . characterized the expansive welfare-state ambitions of the New Deal and the Great Society as movements toward socialism . Advertisement Advertisement
“This is the unfinished business of the Democratic party and the vision we must accomplish,” he said. “These are my values, and that is why I call myself a democratic socialist.”
President Hoover, the prescient man, is owed an apology.
As my colleagues and I recently documented over the course of two special issues of National Review, socialism — not exactly progressivism , certainly not liberalism — is ascendant among Democrats, including Democratic elected officials, and on the American left more generally. Senator Sanders is a declared and avowed socialist, one who is attempting to posthumously recruit the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. to his cause. (King took a hard economic turn toward the left in his later years and spoke of socialism on a few occasions, but to deputize him on behalf of the gentleman from the whitest state in the Union is a bit much, and more than a bit unseemly.) Advertisement
Senator Sanders is not alone in this. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the callow young Democrat from New York, is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), as is Representative Rashida Tlaib, the Jew-baiting strange-o from Michigan, along with about 40 other candidates who were elected as Democrats in 2018. “We are building a pipeline from local positions all the way to national politics,” the Socialists said in a statement after the 2018 elections. Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper was hooted and jeered at when he affirmed on the stage of the California Democratic convention that “socialism is not the answer.” Advertisement
And yet . . .
Ronald Reagan, an FDR man, spent his entire career insisting that he was a New Deal Democrat estranged from his party: “I didn’t leave the Democratic party — the party left me!” Many conservatives see in the tax-cutting, Cold War–fighting John Kennedy a kindred spirit. Much of the Republican criticism directed at the hilariously misnamed Affordable Care Act asserted that it would undermine Medicare, the jewel of Lyndon Johnson’s so-called Great Society program — and some of those Republicans even meant it. Advertisement
Richard Nixon insisted that by the 1970s we were all Keynesians. Are we all socialists now? Advertisement
There are two important factors at play here: The first is ignorance of the past, and the second is ignorance of the present.
Socialism is an idea with a history. (And a body count of some 100 million human beings in the 20th century, but leave that aside for the moment.) The most ordinary and traditional kind of government spending is on public goods , which are defined in economics as non-rivalrous and non-excludable in consumption. Think of a missile-defense system: Missile defense is a non-excludable good in that a system that protects the civic-minded taxpaying citizens at No. 7 Main Street also protects the freeloading deadbeats at No. 9 Main Street, whereas a guy selling apples can exclude those who do not pay; it is non-rivalrous in that Smith’s enjoyment of protection from Nork nukes does not diminish Jones’s possible enjoyment of the same, whereas every apple Smith eats leaves one less apple available for Jones.
In theory, spending on such public goods as defense and law enforcement is most of what liberal governments are supposed to do, with some political disagreement over what counts as a public good. (Roads? There are both public and toll models.) In reality, most of what modern liberal governments spend their money on is social welfare , the public provision of non-public goods such as food and education, both of which can be (and historically have been) provided on an ordinary market basis. These are not public goods rigorously defined, but they are publicly provided in practically all modern democracies on the theory that a society as a whole is better off if there is guaranteed universal access to a minimum of them. Advertisement
The public provision of non-public goods is sometimes described as socialism, but it is distinct in that socialism requires an additional factor: central planning, often but not necessarily in concert with state ownership of the means of production. Food stamps are social welfare, but government-run farms and groceries are socialism; housing-support vouchers are welfare, but government-owned housing projects are socialism. American conservatives spend a fair amount of effort trying to convert or partially convert such genuinely socialistic projects as the monopoly K–12 education system (in which the means of production are state-owned and the workers are state employees) into more conventional social-welfare programs by replacing or augmenting direct-provision models with vouchers or other market-enabling alternatives. There is a significant difference between government funding of services and government provision of services, which is why, for examples, most Republicans have made their peace with Medicare but resist a British-style socialist-monopoly model of health care.
But, then, most European countries resist that model, too, which is why there is no NHS-style national single-payer system in France, Germany, Sweden, etc., and no state-provided health care at all in happy, well-governed Switzerland. And this is where the ignorance of socialism as an idea with a history meets the ignorance of actual political and economic practice in the European states, particularly the Scandinavian ones, that America’s self-proclaimed democratic socialists claim to admire. Senator Sanders et al. point to countries such as Sweden and Denmark and conclude that the lesson to be learned from them is that the United States should do . . . exactly what Senator Sanders et al. always have desired and always will desire to do: enact punitive redistributive taxes notionally targeting the wealthy and corporations (as though middle-class workers, particularly in the public sector, were not major corporate shareholders through their retirement funds) while building new entrenched and centralized bureaucracies to be staffed by comfortable, highly compensated Democratic constituents. Advertisement Advertisement
This response to the example of Sweden — which is in many ways a well-governed and prosperous nation — makes sense only if you do not know very much about Sweden. Senator Sanders, for example, desires to radically increase the tax on inheritances for moralistic reasons. Sweden’s inheritance tax is 0.00 percent. Senator Sanders wants to centralize the provision of health care in a federally funded and federally administered cluster of bureaucracies; health care in Sweden is radically decentralized, funded and administered mostly at the local level. Left-leaning Democrats such as Senator Kamala Harris of California have criticized Republicans for not doing enough to cut middle-class taxes (Senator Harris, who does not seem to know how tax refunds work, blasted the 2017 bill as “a middle-class-tax hike”), but what in fact distinguishes the Scandinavian model (and most Western European countries) from the United States is not how they tax the rich but how they tax the middle class — which is to say: They do it. While about half of U.S. households pay no federal income tax, and middle-class households pay relatively little, middle-class earners in Denmark pay about 50 percent in taxes. Taxes in the United States are disproportionately paid by those with high incomes — disproportionately even when you take the income difference into consideration: The top 1 percent takes home less than 20 percent of total income and pays almost 40 percent of federal income taxes. Taxes in the Scandinavian countries fall heavily on the middle classes, which also are the main beneficiaries of the programs those taxes fund. Advertisement
Senator Sanders is an ideologically blinkered man, and he is not an intellectually curious one. His views have been set since he was honeymooning in the Soviet Union as a young man, and his speeches and writing testify that he simply lacks the intellectual capacity for growth and change. Sweden has changed radically since the 1970s, but Bernie Sanders has stood still in time, an irritable red ant suspended in amber.
But the so-called intellectuals of the Democrats’ new socialist vanguard have no such excuse. Some of them are simply dim and poorly educated (poorly but expensively, in the case of Representative Ocasio-Cortez), but many of them are intellectually dishonest. A particularly dishonest young socialist writer with something of a following recently published an income-disparity ranking of countries that was supposed to show how the Scandinavians had cracked the inequality problem. And Northern Europe was well represented on the list, which also included France, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Estonia, among other nations, in the top ten. Which is to say, the top ten countries represented radically different modes of government, radically different health-care systems, different labor markets, and different tax systems (Switzerland, for example, does not tax capital gains, something our progressive Europhiles rarely mention), to say nothing of radically different cultures. (And many scholars of governance agree that culture is a key ingredient in the Scandinavian secret sauce.) But even among the Nordic countries, there are very large differences: Iceland, for example, has one of the world’s highest work-force-participation rates; Finland’s is down about where ours is, and ours is higher than the overall EU rate. There isn’t a single, unified policy story to be derived from all that diversity.
But that is beside the point, for the Democrats. What Senator Sanders stands for is the continuation of a very old and very dumb kind of politics: adolescent anti-Americanism. It does not matter that Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland have fundamentally different political and economic models: These countries are only rhetorical cat’s-paws deployed in the fundamental progressive project: establishing that the United States and its institutions are hopelessly corrupt, and that they may therefore be cleared away to make room for something new. In this regard, the energetically nationalistic Franklin D. Roosevelt is a poor model for them — their actual lineage traces to Woodrow Wilson, whose racism and warmongering make him an unattractive totem but whose frank rejection of the Constitution and the founding principles of the nation presages their own. In this way, the socialist renaissance may be understood as distinct from the broader progressive project but also subsumed within it. The overall economic model is essentially the Democrats’ health-care model writ large: Destroy and discredit what’s there, and then . . . improvise. Advertisement
Senator Sanders, in his speech, gives some thought to the Constitution — and finds it wanting. What good is the Bill of Rights, he asks, when one must struggle so hard for mere material existence? “Are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week?” The median American work week is, as of this writing, less than 35 hours a week, significantly lower than it was in 1980. What in fact distinguishes low-income households is not on average that they have too many hours of work to do but that they have too few: Only 40 percent of the working-age poor (those below the federal poverty line) in 2014 worked at all . Among those who do work, many are involuntarily relegated to part-time or seasonal work. High-income households average more work hours, not fewer, than low-income households. The unemployment rate for those without a bachelor’s degree is twice that of those with one. The problem the poor face is not long hours at the salt mine but unemployment.
But what are a few inconvenient facts when there’s a utopia to be built?"
The Post-Liberals’ Incoherence,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/the-post-liberals-incoherence/,"June 20, 2019 11:13 AM (Carlos Barria/Reuters) They say they have a real solution; we’d all love to see the plan
I n some quarters of the American Right, it has become fashionable of late to blame our classically liberal order for the ills that afflict American conservatism, and then to hint vaguely that an alternative system of government might deliver more-salutary results for religious and social conservatives. This argument — insofar as one can call it that — is a poor one, and perhaps even a dangerous one. It should be resisted. Advertisement Advertisement
​​The critique offered by the “post-liberal” or illiberal-curious crowd contains a number of fatal flaws. It relentlessly confuses the bones of our political system with the meat that free people put upon them, and thereby becomes both incomprehensibly vague and nigh on impossible to interrogate and find any meaning in. It badly misidentifies its enemy, which leads its progenitors to turn, mistakenly, upon their allies. It is wantonly self-destructive, in that, if followed to its natural conclusion, it would limit, rather than increase, the power of those who advance it. And, because it is not tethered to any specifics, it inevitably invites respondents to inquire, “So let’s assume you’re right about classical liberalism — so what do you want to do about that? ” Taken together, these defects reduce it to little more than a whine — a lament that can be summed up in terms familiar to the three-year-old: “That’s not fair.” And whines do not great political systems make.
​​Defenders of our classically liberal order such as I contend that its purpose is not to deliver endless victories to one group or another within society, but to create a framework within which people who hold markedly different conceptions of what constitutes the Highest Good can coexist without going to war. In America, this end is achieved in part by our constitutional structure, which is designed to protect the individual and to foster the pluralism that is necessary for peace, and it is achieved in part by the inclusion of democratic elements that ensure that the losing side in any dispute has a chance to win in the future. Ultimately, the classically liberal order places only one condition on participants, and that is they agree not to try to abolish it or to permanently take it over. Beyond that, it doesn’t much care how it is used. The result is a country in which the Amish and Silicon Valley can coexist, and in which the Mississippi Baptist and the Brooklyn hipster can thrill to the same flag. It is a country in which Texas can thrive, and so can Massachusetts. It is a country that can host both Franklin Graham and Marilyn Manson (but not Charles Manson). Advertisement
​​Critics of the liberal order reject this characterization, charging that the system is unjust because it merely pretends at neutrality and toleration while in fact smuggling in its own values and imposing them on the public square. This critique is similar in kind to the progressive claim that, say, neutral and expansive free-speech protections are not, in practice, neutral and expansive but rather serve to reinforce a particular view of the good life — say, white supremacy or patriarchy or Christianity or capitalism. If this critique were correct, it would be damning. Fatal, even. But it is not. And, in fact, it is entirely backwards. Advertisement
​​To grasp why , one needs only to look at the examples of failure and hypocrisy that are offered up against the classical-liberal order. The Obama administration forced religious business owners to pay for contraception. Aha! Jack Phillips can’t run his bakery in Colorado without his conscience rights being assaulted. Aha! College campuses are shutting down speakers! Aha! And so on. Now, it is true that these things have all happened. But it is also true that they are not reflective of the classically liberal order but of an illiberalism that seeks to amend or undermine it. Or, to put it another way, these infractions are the products not of our system working correctly, but of its being rejected by a progressivism that is openly hostile to its presumptions. Advertisement
Moreover, these departures are being fought — and remedied — on the back of liberal provisions such as the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That the owners of Hobby Lobby had to sue for their rights is an indictment of the Obama administration, certainly. And yet they won — and at a Supreme Court that was less likely to protect religious liberty than is today’s. Jack Phillips may have been targeted and abused in a way that no man in a free society should be, but he also won 7–2 at the Supreme Court in a case whose holding is likely to be expanded in the future. And the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education reports that, while there are still free-speech problems on campus, the number of institutions that earn its “red light” warning has dropped from 74.2 percent to 28.5 percent over the last decade. There is no easy way to prevent attempts to crush the individual in any society, but there is an easy way to repel them. The liberal order is the dissenter’s best friend. Advertisement
​​What of the culture? Doesn’t the liberal order eventually corrupt that, even as it insists that it is merely a framework within which all people may thrive? Writing at First Things , Sohrab Ahmari has argued vaguely that it does, and he has pointed to the existence of something called “drag-queen story hour” at a library in Sacramento, Calif., the existence of which apparently demonstrates that we are sliding to Gomorrah on John Locke’s back. Leaving aside that there is nothing intrinsic to the liberal order that prompted such an event — America had the same political, judicial, and constitutional system in 1930, and there is no way that this would have happened then; what has changed is the culture on top of that system — it is hard to discern in what alternative nonauthoritarian political system such a practice could easily be ended. Which is why, I imagine, Ahmari has not presented a plan of any sort. Advertisement Advertisement
What could he offer? Does he want more local control over libraries? If so, he’ll be disappointed when he learns what the locals in much of California choose to permit. Does he want free-speech zones imposed, as on college campuses, the better to limit the taking of offense? If so, he must explain how he differs in principle from his political rivals, and why he uses the illiberalism of progressive college campuses as an example of the problem with the status quo. Or does he just want to win — that is, to ban drag-queen story hours nationwide by any means necessary? If he does, he has only one option: to stage a coup and to replace the American system with a new order headed by those who think like him. Given that he doesn’t mention such a plan, I shall assume he does not want to do this. That being so, there are only two other ways that Ahmari can win this fight. The first is to move somewhere else — someplace where this sort of thing does not happen anywhere within the polity. (It is worth noting, incidentally, that Ahmari does not actually live in Sacramento.) The second is to win the argument culturally so that such behavior is marginalized and disdained, even if it is not illegal. Advertisement Advertisement
​​Despite having no other solution, Ahmari disdains this final option, which he disparagingly calls “David Frenchism.” He is wrong to do so even on his own terms . Why? Well, because absent the establishment of a dictatorship, any non-cultural solution to what ails America will itself be reliant on the culture. Ultimately, in America, everything falls under democratic control — yes, even the Bill of Rights, which can be amended by a supermajority and which relies for its execution on judges who are chosen by the executive and legislative branches. And that democratic control is the product of our culture; if the culture is fallen, the democracy will be, too. Ahmari seems to imply that there is some way of taking over the government in order to fix the culture while that culture is the “enemy.”
But what, exactly, would that look like? I do not for a moment believe that Ahmari seeks a sinister alteration to our order. I do think, however, that he has a duty to explain himself in detail.
I think, too, that he ought to be extremely careful what he wishes for. The irony here is that if the post-liberals were somehow able to establish a set of institutions that could direct the culture as they wished, they would likely be setting themselves up for persecution. It should be obvious that any organization imbued with sufficient power to win cultural battles without democratic backing would also be imbued with sufficient power to crush social and religious conservatives without democratic backing. And then what would the persecuted do, having agreed to dispense with the guardrails? "
The Incredible Guts of Thae Yong-ho,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/the-incredible-guts-of-thae-yong-ho/,"June 20, 2019 11:13 AM Thae Yong-ho at the Oslo Freedom Forum, May 2019 (Jay Nordlinger) An emissary from North Korea Oslo
P eople who manage to leave North Korea are often known as “defectors” — even when they are ordinary citizens, rather than government officials or military personnel. That’s because, when you are born in North Korea, you are deemed to belong to the state. If you leave, you have defected, and you are a traitor. Advertisement Advertisement
Thae Yong-ho is a defector in a more widely understood sense. He was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom when he went over to the South Koreans in 2016. He is one of the highest-ranking North Korean officials ever to defect. He is something rare in the world: a messenger from a closed and isolated society, a “hermit kingdom,” as North Korea is called.
I have met him at the Oslo Freedom Forum, the annual human-rights gathering in the Norwegian capital. Thae speaks good English with a slight British accent. He is elegant, knowledgeable, and self-assured — a man you can imagine in diplomatic work.
He was born in 1962, and he grew up a true believer. There is little choice in North Korea. You are commanded to worship the Kims as gods. You know hardly anything about the outside world (although this is less true now than it was when Thae was growing up). He read books about Communist liberators who sacrificed their lives for the equality of man. Thae wanted to dedicate his life to that end too. Advertisement
He went to the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies. He joined the WPK, the Workers’ Party of Korea, i.e., the ruling party. He entered the foreign ministry in 1988. And, in 1996, he had his first foreign posting — to Denmark. Advertisement
That was a revelation. He expected beggars in the street and the ruthless exploitation of workers. Instead, he found a happy, peaceful, healthy society, with ample social welfare. This pricked at the young diplomat’s brain.
He also started to see North Korea, and its ruling Kims, as outsiders saw them. In the mid 1990s, there was a terrible famine in North Korea. Thae understood that this was the result of natural disasters, and that the leader, Kim Jong-il, was doing everything possible to relieve the problem. Advertisement
All North Korean diplomats, wherever they were posted, were instructed to get food aid from their host governments. Thae went to the Danish foreign ministry. They were happy to oblige. But they had questions: Why was Kim Jong-il investing millions in nuclear weapons when people were starving? Why was he spending millions on a mausoleum for Kim Il-sung (his father and predecessor) when people were starving? These were hard questions to answer.
Thae came face to face with the hypocrisy of the regime he was serving, and had been taught to revere. North Korean delegates arrived in Denmark to buy cows, for the special use of the Kim family. This would keep the Kims in dairy products and beef. Other delegates arrived to buy beer for the North Korean elites. These things were a far cry from the equality of man. Advertisement
Thae began to experience “doublethink,” in Orwell’s immortal and useful coinage. Part of him held on to the true faith, the North Korean Communist faith; another part of him had plain doubts. Advertisement
He was later posted to Britain. One of his duties was to speak to Communist and socialist groups, to whom he sang the praises of North Korea, knowing, already, it was a false song. These British leftists were true believers, as he had once been. He felt sorry for them.
Then there was the matter of his boys: his two sons. In an atmosphere of freedom — namely, Britain’s — they too were experiencing doublethink. They had some hard questions for their father at the dinner table: “Why is there no Internet in North Korea? YouTube helps you do your homework. Isn’t our government supposed to care about education?” What was their father supposed to say?
Periodically, the family would go home to North Korea. Naturally, the boys’ friends there were curious about life in Britain. What was it like? It was not really safe for the boys to say, “Great!” They asked their father how they should respond. He suggested that they reread Oliver Twist , and give them some stories out of that book.
You can read Dickens in North Korea, for his depiction of urchins and such. In April, I talked with Vladimir Bukovsky, the Russian dissident. He spent twelve years in the Soviet Gulag. He told me that, in prison libraries, you could read Dickens (and Dreiser). Advertisement Advertisement
Thae Yong-ho pondered his fate, and his family’s, and North Korea’s. Maybe he could wait the Kim regime out. Maybe it would collapse before too long — certainly in his lifetime. Then, in 2009, Kim Jong-il announced that his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, would succeed him. This dispirited Thae. The end of the regime was not in sight.
Incidentally, Thae would have an encounter with Kim Jong-un’s older brother, Kim Jong-chul, in London. Kim Jong-chul is a big fan of Eric Clapton, the British rocker. In 2015, Thae accompanied Kim Jong-chul to hear Clapton in the Royal Albert Hall.
Slowly, inevitably, defection crept into Thae’s mind. He would not consider it while his family was separated. Diplomats could not have all of their children with them abroad — someone had to be left hostage, back in North Korea. So, Thae and his wife would have one son or the other with them in Britain. But in 2014, Kim Jong-un changed the policy. Now they had both of their sons with them — which changed the equation.
But what about other relatives back home? The Kim regime is a firm believer in guilt by association. If one person steps out of line, his family and even his friends and colleagues pay for it. This keeps North Koreans in line. Advertisement
There came a time when Thae Yong-ho was recalled from London to Pyongyang. Why was a mystery. Maybe they were going to punish him, for some infraction unknown to him. This happens to North Koreans routinely. They don’t know they have done something wrong until they are being imprisoned, tortured, or killed.
Thae thought about his sons. What kind of future would they have in North Korea? Could he really consign them to that kind of life, when they had already enjoyed a free life? And what about their children, and their children? Thae decided he would “cut off slavery at my generation,” as he puts it. This far and no farther. No matter what, his sons and grandchildren and so on would not be slaves. He made a break for it.
The North Korean government called him “human scum” and, for good measure, accused him of child rape. (This accusation is a specialty of Communist governments, and of some post-Communist ones too, such as Putin’s.)
A delicate, awful question: What happened to Thae Yong-ho’s brothers, sisters, and other relatives in North Korea? Sitting here in Oslo, I don’t ask him. But previous interviewers have. He assumes his relatives are in camps. It weighs very, very heavily on him. Unspeakably so. Knowing this already, I don’t need to ask.
I do ask him about his personal security. Does he have worries? “I have a lot of worries,” he says, “but I am heavily protected when I am in South Korea. The South Korean government knows that I am No. 1 on the assassination list.” And “I know this will go on till the last day of the Kim regime.”
Let me pause, now, to relate something that happened in the days after Thae Yong-ho and I talked. Do you know about the recent fad of “milkshaking”? Protesters throw milkshakes on public figures they dislike. This happened to Thae as he was entering the Grand Hotel here in Oslo. The attacker, or “milkshaker,” was a Norwegian leftist, apparently.
In the Free World, hard as it may be to believe, some people despise North Korean defectors as traitors, liars, and defamers. They take essentially the same view as the Kim regime itself.
When Thae was “milkshaked,” his guards quickly subdued the attacker, and the man was soon arrested. Online, his comrades celebrated him. One of them said, “He got arrested for ruining a rich defector’s coat and deserves a lot of support and love right now.”
It was just a milkshake, true — nothing serious. But Thae didn’t know that at first. He thought of Kim Jong-nam, the dictator’s half-brother, who was killed when two women smeared him with a foreign substance in the Kuala Lumpur airport.
Back, now, to our conversation, and another question: How do South Koreans, his brother Koreans, treat Thae? It depends, he says. South Korea is polarized on the issue of North Korea. People on the left treat him with scorn. I remark that they might try living in North Korea, if they think it’s so great — which makes Thae smile. Advertisement
I further ask him what he thinks of the unusual relationship between President Trump and Kim Jong-un. He says that he understands the need to discuss nuclear issues — but does not understand why Trump depicts Kim as a “nice guy” or even a “normal person.” “Kim Jong-un is a tyrant, a dictator, and a criminal.”
Thae’s goal, or dream, is nothing less than the end of the regime. He would like to see the Korean Peninsula reunited on democratic terms. He opens his mouth, whatever the risks, every chance he gets. He wants to tell the outside world about the realities of North Korea. And he wants to encourage North Korean elites, first and foremost, to recognize what they surely know or suspect already, in their doublethinking: The Kim regime is corrupt, nasty, and lying. He does not think this regime will fall tomorrow. But he thinks it will fall, as North Koreans learn more about themselves and others, and, in disgust at having been misled and oppressed, rise up. "
Great Writing by Women,www.nationalreview.com,David Mamet,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/great-writing-by-women/,"About David Mamet June 20, 2019 11:13 AM Condoleezza Rice poses while promoting her book Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom , May 8, 2017. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) Which is not the same category as women’s writing
C ondoleezza Rice was approached by a professor of English and asked to recommend a book by a black woman, to round out the racially and sexually sensitive curriculum. Rice said, “How about my The Soviet Union and the Czechoslovak Army, 1948–1983 ?”
The other woman was, of course, nonplussed, for (if an explanation is required) she did not want a book by a black woman, but a book by same about being a black woman: that Rice had other interests and excellences was moot; she was to be admired not as a writer, but as a prop. Advertisement
We have long suffered through the mantra that “we need to have a dialogue about race,” in literature. Such (or a dialogue about “gender,” whatever that may be) must necessarily be written by a member of one and only one of the two groups in question.
Should that debar the writer from having opinions?
Are the opinions of one of the momentarily petted groups to be accepted only on the subject of their (supposed, arguable, or actual) oppression? Are women, for example, to be ignored (no matter how great their talent) for writing about something other than their “plight”? Does possession of a “plight” exempt authors from the traditional requirements of skill, clarity, novelty, or insight? Advertisement
We have, if not a tradition, then certainly a history of excluding women writers from our literary pantheon. It’s all very well and charming to rant about “dead white males,” and it is environmentally praiseworthy, as their books are not, as of this writing, actually burned. Advertisement
Literature is an approach, via fiction, to truth. Truth is useful not because it is beautiful or will prevail (it will not) but because it is true. It is both wicked and absurd to praise, as to dispraise, writing based upon genetics; this is, of course, barbarism.
A more moral and less savage approach would be to discover and enjoy the productions of great American writers, per se and irrespective of their subject or gender. Advertisement
Fashions in literature, of course, change. When I was young, Willa Cather was out of print, and generations of schoolchildren have had their interest in reading destroyed by The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye .
But here is a list of women authors not “out of favor,” but, today, forgotten and unread. Their works should be cherished. Among the earliest American novels is Charlotte Temple , by Susanna Rowson (1762–1824), a romance of the early colonial period. See also The Linwoods (1835), by Catharine Maria Sedgwick. Miss Sedgwick wrote here of the Revolutionary War and the battle between the colonials, based in Boston, and the royalists in New York. For anyone interested in Washington and that war, this is as close as you’re going to get and a smashing yarn. Advertisement
She wrote at the same remove (50 to 60 years) as did Tolstoy from the Napoleonic wars, Margaret Mitchell from the Civil War, and, for that matter Mario Puzo from the Mafia turf wars. That is, they, and Sedgwick, wrote of the Grandparent Stories, which they had heard at the kitchen table and which had become part of family lore.
Imagine, in The Linwoods , one reads the impressions of people who actually knew Washington. Advertisement
The great novel of the antebellum South is Uncle Tom’s Cabin . Mrs. Stowe wrote the hell out of it. It is an indictment of slavery, which, as Lincoln said, “started the Civil War”; it has been overlooked and, indeed, excoriated (by those who cannot have read it), as the phrase “Uncle Tom” has come to mean an appeaser. But his character is nothing of the kind; he is a Christian trying to live a godly life in the midst of human horror. (See also Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning .)
Per contra, there is Margaret Mitchell’s Gone with the Wind , published in 1936, a compilation and reimagining of the Grandfather Tales. I find it unreadable, but there is certainly nothing in American law or culture to debar women, like men, from writing badly.
On the subject of race I will mention Laura Ingalls Wilder, and her beautiful Little House on the Prairie books, which, I understand, have recently been denounced by the American Library Association, or some other ship of fools, on the basis of racism; Miss Wilder, it seems, having used some of the language of the pioneer days in referring to Native Americans.
That association and its like will not, yet, have gotten around to banning the two authors below, their reserve, I am sure, borne not of sloth but of ignorance. And it may be that I, in these notes, am exposing these two superb authors to a notice that can only end in (may it be but momentary) anathema. Advertisement
Perhaps when the transfer of human knowledge from print to electronics is complete, and when the Internet inevitably crashes and is commandeered by some central authority, perhaps, some cached remnant will remain, to be discovered by a future generation, which will find itself charmed by historic evidence of free expression.

These two women were pioneers, crossing the plains in covered wagons and living well into the 20th century. Mari Sandoz (1896–1966) grew up in a log cabin in Nebraska. See her reminiscences in Old Jules and her beautiful novels. I mention in particular Miss Morissa, Doctor of the Gold Trail .
Miss Sandoz was the state historian of Nebraska. Her pioneer sister, in New Mexico, was Agnes Morley Cleaveland. Her No Life for a Lady is a thrilling report of a cow-woman, rancher, genteel gun-toting rustler, and if that don’t get you running to Amazon I don’t know what all. Advertisement
Further, on the subject of race, I recommend Anzia Yezierska’s Bread Givers (1925), a harrowing tale of Jewish immigrant women in New York’s Lower East Side ghettos. And recently reprinted by Penguin are two classics on race worthy to sit beside Native Son : See Passing (1929) and Quicksand (1928), by Chicago’s Nella Larsen.
The greatest war correspondent of the 20th century was Martha Gellhorn.
Collier’s sent her, just out of Vassar, to Spain, after which she covered the fall of Czechoslovakia, all of World War II, and Vietnam. She is the only woman to have landed on D-Day. She dressed as a man, bribed her way onto a hospital ship, and landed among the first waves, working as a stretcher-bearer. She was at the liberation of Dachau.
No one wrote better than Martha Gellhorn.
Here is a list of her books that would take you through a winter you’d hold in memory. War correspondence: The Face of War ; short stories: The Trouble I’ve Seen , The Heart of Another , The Honeyed Peace ; novels: A Stricken Field , The Wine of Astonishment . This brings us well into the 20th century, which gave us the (currently) acknowledged masterpieces of Edith Wharton and Willa Cather, and the southern fiction not only of Kate Chopin and Ellen Glasgow but of Carson McCullers, Harper Lee, and Flannery O’Connor.
I also mention Mary McCarthy (1912–1989), next to whose work Salinger’s stuff reads like a greeting card; the heart-wrenching tragicomic novels of Dawn Powell (1896–1965) and of Renata Adler (b. 1937), and, of course, the superb novels of Joyce Carol Oates, Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart , etc. See also Boots of Leather, Slippers of Gold and Leslie Feinberg’s Stone Butch Blues , both stunning reports from lesbian life, and the wicked wisdom of Fran Lebowitz. Here are three outliers: the hit Broadway plays The Drag , Pleasure Man , Diamond Lil , and Sex , by Mae West; the whodunit by her literary sister Gypsy Rose Lee, The G-String Murders ; and the magnificent monologues of Ruth Draper (1884–1956), among the best dramatic writing of the American Century.
I had the privilege of growing up in the open stacks of fiction, in the Chicago Public Library. I was free to browse, to take down now this and now that, to read a bit, and, if the novel did not please, to replace it and try again. The books there were classified not by characteristics of the author, but by subject . "
John Roberts: A Political Judge?,www.nationalreview.com,Carson Holloway,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/07/08/john-roberts-a-political-judge/,"June 20, 2019 11:13 AM United States Chief Justice John G. Roberts (Jim Young/Reuters) The Chief: The Life and Turbulent Times of Chief Justice John Roberts , by Joan Biskupic (Basic Books, 432 pp., $32)
A merica’s longstanding debate about the politicization of the judiciary is by now so familiar that we have lost sight of its enigmatic character. Practically everybody, left and right, agrees that courts should somehow be above politics. At the same time, however, practically everybody can point to numerous instances of what they sincerely regard as egregious examples of politicized judging — important cases that courts have determined according not to law but to the political preferences of the judges. It is strange to find a phenomenon that is apparently prevalent despite being almost universally condemned. Advertisement
This enigmatic problem is illustrated by the public career of America’s most famous — and perhaps most enigmatic — judge: John Roberts. Roberts is famously associated with the claim that judges should not be political. During his confirmation process he insisted that judges should be only “umpires” and not players in the game of politics. At the same time, Roberts has not been able to shake the accuastion — made by his enemies, and sometimes even by his friends — that he himself is a political judge, that he has let considerations other than the Constitution and the laws determine the outcome of important cases.
This difficulty — Roberts’s desire to avoid politics while perhaps being unable to do so — is a key theme of Joan Biskupic’s new biography. Biskupic covers Roberts’s whole life. The book includes revealing accounts of his youth and education, his work in the Reagan administration, his distinguished career as an appellate litigator, his brief service on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and his early elevation to chief justice of the Supreme Court. Biskupic’s principal concern, however, is how Roberts’s work as a judge is influenced by his politics — both by his own political conservatism and by his concern for the Court’s public reputation. Advertisement
As the author of previous biographies of Justices Scalia, O’Connor, and Sotomayor, Biskupic is an experienced observer of the Supreme Court. As a result, The Chief is unfailingly informative and engaging. Nevertheless, the book’s account of the nexus between law and politics is marred by two defects. These defects might be considered fortuitous, however, insofar as they help to illustrate the difficulties involved in grappling with the problem of politicized judging.
In the first place, Biskupic’s account is somewhat biased. This is not to say that the book is malicious. Biskupic seems to respect and like the chief justice. But she is part of the liberal legal establishment, and it shows. The book seems to be organized more around her own preoccupations than around those of its subject. Issues that involve race — such as voting-rights cases and challenges to affirmative action in higher education — receive extensive treatment, while other, no less interesting and important questions are scanted or ignored. Advertisement Advertisement
The constitutionality of capital punishment, for example, is both inherently interesting and reliably controversial. Biskupic treats it only cursorily. Even more strange is the lack of any discussion of Boumediene v. Bush (2008), in which the Court, over the objections of Roberts and three other conservative dissenters, for the first time declared that enemy combatants held outside the United States have a right to habeas corpus. This case was the capstone of a series of controversies in which the Court had engaged in a tug of war with the presidency and the Congress over the rights of enemy combatants detained in the American prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. One would certainly think that it merits inclusion in any book that wants to give a complete and impartial account of Roberts’s time as chief justice.
It is therefore hard to suppress the suspicion that Biskupic has lavished attention on areas of the law where she thinks she can plausibly suggest that Roberts has allowed his legal thinking to be shaped by politics, but she has studiously avoided those areas where it would look like the liberal justices were guilty of the same thing. This is a commonplace fault of most arguments about what is often called “judicial activism.” Political judging is a real problem, but the criticisms of it often turn out to be “political” or partisan themselves. That is, they turn out to be not principled calls for courts to remain above politics but argumentative weapons to be wielded against judges who have disappointed our political hopes. Advertisement
This brings us to the book’s second defect. To get a clear understanding of how political considerations influence the work of the courts, we would need judges to speak candidly and publicly about this question. This they are famously reluctant to do, however, and Biskupic has not succeeded in piercing their reticence. To judge from her footnotes and acknowledgments, she extensively interviewed a number of the justices, including Roberts himself. But none of them spoke with her on the record about the deliberative process in particular cases. Advertisement Advertisement
This drawback undermines what many readers will find to be one of the most interesting parts of the book: its behind-the-scenes account of how the Court reached its decision in the Obamacare case, NFIB v. Sebelius (2012). According to Biskupic, Roberts began by thinking that the law’s “individual mandate” was unconstitutional and that its Medicaid expansion was constitutional. During the course of the Court’s private deliberations, however, he began to think that the mandate could be upheld under Congress’s taxing power, but also started to think that the Medicaid expansion unconstitutionally coerced the states into participation. On Biskupic’s telling, Justices Breyer and Kagan joined in Roberts’s rejection of the Medicaid expansion in order to shore up his support for the individual mandate. If true, this amounted to something close to political horse trading. But it is difficult to know how much to credit the story when none of the participants would vouch for it on the record. Advertisement
Here again, however, the defect itself is instructive. If politics should not and did not influence the courts, then judges would be able to say so publicly and convincingly, even about important and controversial cases. Or, if it were unremarkable and permissible for politics to influence the courts, judges would be able to say this publicly and explain how the process works. That they do neither suggests that something is wrong. Advertisement
As The Chief reminds us, this sense that something is wrong is underscored by Roberts’s own recent behavior, viewed in light of his earlier pronouncements. Last fall, President Trump ramped up his frequent complaints about the liberal politicization of the courts by lamenting that one of his administration’s initiatives had been blocked by an “Obama judge.” In response, the chief justice stepped into the limelight, apparently to rebuke the president. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” said Roberts, but “an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.” "
"R.I.P., Charles Reich, Justice Alito’s Con Law Prof | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/r-i-p-charles-reich-justice-alitos-con-law-prof/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter June 20, 2019 9:12 AM
The Washington Post ’s obituary of onetime Yale law professor, and 1960s counterculture guru, Charles Reich reminded me that Reich was assigned to teach Samuel Alito constitutional law at Yale. Not that he actually did. It would seem that Reich was eager to put the con in con law.
Here’s Alito’s memorable account (from an interview with Bill Kristol):
My Constitutional Law course was taught by someone you may, whose name you may remember, most people today may not remember, Charles Reich….
By the time, he taught me he was experiencing, I think, some personal turmoil and it was a most bizarre course…. I had him for Constitutional Law, and I kept notes of any Supreme Court or any other case that was even mentioned during the course of the term, and at the end of the term, there was exactly one that had been mentioned….
[H]e began by saying that his thesis was there were no livable lives to be lived in the law. That was his phrase. So he went around the room and he’d say, “Why did you come to law school?” And in those days nobody would say, “I came to law school because I want to become a partner at a Wall Street firm and make a million dollars,” so everyone would say, “I came to law school because I think it’s a way of achieving social reform or helping society” or something like that. And then he would engage in a long debate with each student to try to prove that this was not a good reason for going to law school. Basically, he was telling us you really shouldn’t be here. And this went on for weeks. And then he went on to other subjects. That was my ConLaw course.
The professor who taught the big section that term on Constitutional Law was somebody who wasn’t that well-known at the time, Robert Bork. And I went to – as soon as I saw that I had been assigned to Charlie Reich’s class – I had read The Greening of America, and I really was not interested in being in this class. I went to the Assistant Dean and said, “Can’t you possibly switch me so I can be in the regular Constitutional Law class?” Never in the history of Yale Law School has anyone ever switched a class….

How to Pay Teachers More without Busting the Bank,www.nationalreview.com,Marcus A. Winters,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/how-to-pay-teachers-more-without-busting-the-bank/,"About Marcus A. Winters June 20, 2019 4:03 PM Signs at a rally as public school teachers strike for a second day in Denver, Colo., Feb. 12, 2019. (Michael Ciaglo/Reuters) By balancing the ratio of salaries to retirement benefits and reforming pension structures, we can vastly improve the quality and cost of teacher compensation.
A mong Democratic presidential hopefuls, it’s become an article of faith that all teachers in America deserve a raise. Bernie Sanders says the starting salary for teachers should be at least $60,000. Kamala Harris wants to give teachers an average raise of $13,500 — at a cost of $315 billion over ten years, according to her campaign. Advertisement Advertisement
Sanders, Harris, and other politicians are astutely responding to demands leveled by educators who participated in the national wave of teacher strikes that started around this time last year. But is teacher pay too low, or are the taxpayer dollars that fund salaries simply being misallocated? The question is worth investigating before we commit to breaking the bank.
It’s true that public-school teachers are paid less than private-sector professionals with similar amounts of training. But the difference in total compensation is smaller when teachers’ generous retirement packages are taken into account. Too much of a teacher’s total compensation goes to retirement relative to salary, and that compensation structure is due for an upgrade. Studies suggest that teachers would rather bring home larger chunks of their pay. Cornell University economist Maria Fitzpatrick estimates that public-school teachers value $1 of additional retirement benefits at only 20 cents. A recent study by University of Missouri economists Cory Koedel and P. Brett Xiang found that a pension enhancement designed to increase retention, at a taxpayer cost of about $183 million, essentially failed to deliver.
Many professionals undervalue retirement savings. But combine teachers’ low valuation of retirement dollars with the funky payment allocation in their field (smaller salaries with bigger pension benefits) and it’s no wonder they feel underpaid. Advertisement
Reallocating a portion of teachers’ retirement benefits to salary is a good first step toward fixing the problem using existing resources. But by also redesigning the teacher-pension apparatus, states could actually offer new teachers a retirement plan that is more attractive and less lopsided, if also less hefty on average, than it’s been in the past. Advertisement
Private-sector professionals commonly receive annual retirement benefits based on a percentage of their salary. In contrast, public-school teachers receive little to no employer-sponsored retirement benefits in their early- and mid-career years, and then suddenly become eligible for bloated benefits as they near retirement.
This phenomenon, known as backloading, means that the total compensation for longer-tenured teachers is much higher than for younger teachers. For instance, my Manhattan Institute colleague Josh McGee and I calculated that in New York City, a teacher in their 35th year earns about 27 percent more, salary-wise, than a teacher in their tenth year — but 79 percent more in total compensation when the value of their retirement benefits is taken into account.
In short, backloading means that when early- and mid-career teachers leave the profession, they do so before they have accrued meaningful retirement benefits for the time they worked. Bellwether’s Chad Alderman calculates that in only one state (Utah) do the majority of entering teachers remain employed long enough to receive pension payments that are larger than their own retirement contributions. In the median state, only about 20 percent of teachers remain long enough to maximize their retirement benefits. Advertisement Advertisement
States should replace their existing backloaded plans with cash-balance plans that similarly guarantee a teacher’s benefits — but also provide annual benefits based on a percentage of their salary. Cash-balance plans are more valuable to entering employees because they eliminate the risk of forgoing retirement benefits if teachers transition out of the field."
Rory Stewart and the Crisis of British Conservatism,www.nationalreview.com,Sahil Handa,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/rory-stewart-and-the-crisis-of-british-conservatism/,"June 20, 2019 3:25 PM Rory Stewart speaks to the media in Westminster in London, England, June 19, 2019. (Peter Nicholls/Reuters) When many no longer consider a man such as Stewart conservative, the Conservative party must surely be at a crossroads.
Y esterday, Rory Stewart was knocked out in the third round of the British Conservative party’s leadership election. When he announced his bid, his chances were placed at 150 to 1. He had spent one day as a cabinet minister and nobody expected him to get past the first hurdle. Two months later, #rorywalks — the hashtag denoting viral selfie-style videos of Stewart wandering through Britain’s streets and talking to voters — was trending on Twitter. He’d attracted hundreds to his campaign rallies from across the political spectrum, many of them disaffected Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters saying they wanted to vote Tory for the first time. Advertisement Advertisement
Commentators are now labeling “Rorymania” a blip in the pan. Unfortunately for the Tories, their crisis may be only just beginning. The party’s base is fundamentally at odds with its parliamentary leaders, and some Tory MPs are so disillusioned that they are refusing to vote for a single one of the candidates remaining in the race. This is all on top of an already weak majority in the House of Commons and a disastrous showing in the recent European elections. If the party wants to survive, it would do well to look at Stewart’s rise. * * *
I first came across Stewart roughly six months ago, when he appeared on an edition of the BBC’s Question Time . I expected to see another Tory minister peddling the government line with prefab soundbites. Instead, I encountered a decent man trying to honestly explain the difficulty of his country’s political situation.
Impressed, I decided to do a little Googling. And like anyone who has read a profile of Rory Stewart, I found myself struck by his life story. Son of a spy. A childhood spent in Hong Kong. Five years as a diplomat in Indonesia and another five in military service in Iraq and Afghanistan. A 6,000-mile trek through Asia. The founder of an NGO in Kabul. Lecturer at Harvard, best-selling travel writer, and a profile in The New Yorker nine years ago that inspired Brad Pitt to snap up the movie rights to his biopic.
But what has continued to strike me most about Stewart is the constants throughout his life: a commitment to democratic government and a respect for the ordinary voter. Yes, these are platitudes — but platitudes put into practice.
What do I mean? On Monday afternoon, Stewart held his final campaign rally. Another rousing speech to a packed-out crowd of supporters from all Britain’s major parties — most of whom, due to the current political quagmire, won’t be picking the country’s next leader. But this time, midway through the Q&A session, a young man from South London picked up the microphone:
You lot in government are talking about all this bullsh**. You’re living a nice life in the country house, but I’m seeing young kids having problems [with] . . . suicide . . . gangs . . . homelessness. I am dealing with so much in my community and everybody is asking me about fu**ing Brexit.
It’s become a common sentiment. Brexit has consumed the country, and it’s not a stretch to wonder whether there’ll be a country left after it’s all over. Massive numbers view the government as a group of indecisive, privileged, petulant schoolchildren. Stewart, unfazed, waited for the man to finish and tried to reply.
But the man kept heckling. More shouting. More anger. More fury. More disdain for a political class that he considers completely oblivious to the suffering faced by its constituents. Stewart spent another minute trying to respond, and then moved on to the next question. But the man only grew louder, until the crowd started to jeer. At this point, most politicians would have asked a security guard to escort the man out. But Stewart got down from the stage, walked over to him, looked him in the eyes, put an arm on his shoulder, gave him a hug, and asked if they could sit down and have a conversation. He said he understood the rage and was here to listen — that they could talk about gang violence and go through the details together. Afterward, the young man told Rory he loved him. And at the end of the event, the two met again and arranged a time and place to have their talk. Advertisement
To many, this was mere posturing — the kind of quaint little campaign stunt that has turned Stewart into a media darling. I understand their cynicism. Politics is not about being a nice guy. But democratic politics is built on the electorate’s trust of its representatives. Currently, that trust is at an all-time low , and every month a new book is written about the possible demise of democracy. In Britain, the Brexit party built mass support by telling citizens that their vote was being ignored and that the political elites think they’re stupid. Hence, the Brexit crisis personifies the crisis of representation : It has become a vehicle to propagate hatred for the political class. Solving the impasse will help, but the problem runs deeper. It is not only Brexit-party voters who feel alienated by their politicians, but voters across the political spectrum. Advertisement Advertisement
It remains to be seen whether the Conservative party will manage to implement Brexit. If it doesn’t, it is likely finished. But if it does, serious problems will remain. Fewer young people are voting conservative than ever before. The candidate most likely to become leader is trusted by less than 10 percent of the public. And if that candidate does lead the country out of the EU without a deal, he and his government will have to bear the inevitable economic consequences. If Conservative MPs want their party to survive the year, let alone beyond, they might do well to pay attention to the nice guy. His story is worth examining for anybody who wants to understand the British political landscape. * * *
S o, who is Rory Stewart really then? I’ve spent hours watching his speeches in Parliament, talks about foreign intervention, and award-winning documentaries. All of it was deeply impressive. But a few moments stick with me, and they might go some way toward explaining the man who captured the British public’s imagination. Advertisement
On the Desert Island Discs program in 2008, Stewart was asked to describe the moment his military team was shelled at its compound in Iraq. “I realized that we should never have invaded. We were unprepared, we didn’t know what we were getting into. It was a mistake and a failure, and I was completely wrong to believe that it would be a success.” While you can debate the merits of his position, you cannot doubt the courage to admit his mistake. The technocrats in government had spoken in abstractions, but the reality of sectarian conflict had taught him that he should have listened to people on the ground. Advertisement
He went on to describe his walk across Iran, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal. He had taken a sabbatical from the Foreign Office and left home without a phone, going on to stay in 550 village houses, knocking on doors, asking for hospitality in local languages, and talking to people about their attitudes toward their government. Here again, he experienced the surreal gap between political rhetoric and lived experience — between lofty theoretical ideals and particular problems. He learned, in other words, the true essence of his conservatism: respect for tradition, suspicion of bureaucracy, and belief in protecting the rights of the individual. Honesty, moderation, realism, localism.
He wore the shalwar kameez and a Peshawari cap, hid money behind cushions in people’s houses, and adopted the same level of piety toward the countries’ peoples that you can see in his interactions with Brits today. Scroll through his campaign videos and you’ll see very few rehearsed, cookie-cutter speeches. Instead, you’ll see him wandering from Woking mosque to a Brexit party rally in Peterborough, showing up and talking to citizens on the street. Advertisement
Another thing about Stewart is that he’s absolutely and unapologetically ridiculous. His disc picks were Gilbert and Sullivan’s hilarious “I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General,” a popular dance hit from the Jakarta nightclub scene, and some Schubert he’d played to the members of his team while they were under siege in Iraq. On the Political Party podcast, Stewart was asked why so many Tory candidates had put themselves forward in the party’s leadership race. His response? “I think it’s somewhere between our enormous egos and the praise of our mothers.” No hubris, no rehearsed speech. Just an honest joke. He’s unashamedly ambitious but isn’t afraid to admit it. Watch his Twitter clips, and you’ll be greeted with a wide-eyed, spindly soul who says “Thank you” with the kind of enthusiasm you’d expect from a posh cartoon character. He clenches his teeth when he’s listening and closes his eyes when he’s speaking. He exclaims “Brilliant!” “Fantastic!” and “Great!” so many times that you can’t help but wonder if he’s making up for never having had many friends.
But that’s exactly why he’s a fascinating character: He momentarily managed to put a human face on the Tory party. In this vein, Stewart has more in common with Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage than Theresa May — he doesn’t shy away from public engagement, but thrives off it. It’s a power that, ironically enough, Boris Johnson once had in his back pocket. Advertisement Advertisement
Seeking to explain away Stewart’s success, some have dismissed him as a London-centric politician, because most of his campaigning over the last few weeks took palce on the streets of London. Others, such as National Review ’s own John O’Sullivan, have labelled him the “media candidate” — a quaint, charming chap, but devoid of any real substance. Both accusations have little to substantiate them. Stewart wrote a book about a walk through the North of Great Britain, represents a constituency on the England–Scotland border, and is one of the fiercest unionists you’ll ever meet. He had to balance a campaign with media and job commitments in Westminster, and yet still managed to make it to across parts of England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As for the second charge, Stewart made his name on social media, and social media relies on user interaction. As prisons minister, he promised to reduce crime in prisons and fulfilled that promise before he moved into the cabinet. The first MPs who backed him — David Gauke, Ken Clarke, and Nicholas Soames — have some of the best records in delivering successful policies.
Here are a few others who have showered heavy praise on Stewart: Scientist Brian Cox, conservative historians David Starkey, Tom Holland, and Niall Ferguson, ex-footballer Gary Lineker, leftie academic Peter Sarris, conservative commentators Andrew Sullivan and Camilla Cavendish, ex-soldier Jonny Gray, arch-Remainer James O’Brien, long-time Brexiteer Isabell Oakeshott, and A. I. expert Jamie Bartlett. It is an eclectic group — one that could only be assembled by somebody with a vision, a leader at a time when British politics is sorely lacking them. * * *
O ne of the greatest ironies of the United Kingdom’s current political debacle is that the Conservative and Unionist party has long stopped being conservative or unionist. According to the latest polling , its members would now prefer to damage the economy or risk the union between England and Scotland than risk not implementing Brexit. Most candidates have brandished their so-called conservative credentials by peddling standard anti-Marxist rhetoric, un-costed tax cuts, and outrageous spending promises. The only coherent identity of the conservative party is a common antagonism toward Jeremy Corbyn. Advertisement
Curiously, the common consensus among party members is that Stewart is not a proper conservative. The great irony of this charge is that it’s leveled at a man preaching patriotism, limited government, restraint abroad, and fiscal prudence. Stewart represents what was Tory orthodoxy for decades, only he offers it in such a way that people actually trust him. Of the candidates left in the race, Saajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt come from the Thatcherite wing of the party, prioritizing economic growth above almost everything else. Johnson’s constant flip-flopping makes him hard to pin down, but he is certainly a pro-business, one-nation conservative. Michael Gove is a smart, modernizing, liberal conservative, but he is detested by the public — and has not exactly helped change their minds over the last few years.
Stewart, by contrast, belongs to a long-forgotten part of the British conservative tradition: He is a romantic, centrist Tory, not a free-market buccaneer. He was the first and only candidate besides Gove to sign a fiscal-responsibility pledge and is strongly tied to the Anglo–American relationship. He has serious expertise in state-building but warns against reckless foreign intervention. He wanted to expand Britain’s car-manufacturing industry, whereas Patrick Minford, one of the main economists supporting a no-deal Brexit, seems happy to do away with the industry and others like it entirely. Stewart made his top priority a reformation of social care — the same mission that his party embarked on in the 2017 election. Back then, it arguably cost the Tories their majority and set in motion the horror show that has been the Brexit negotiations. Yet this previously little-known oddball managed to make thousands see it as a winning pitch.
Most remarkably, he built his entire campaign on a message of local stewardship: His charity in Afghanistan focused on removing street litter and cleaning public facilities, and he went on to help dramatically improve the conditions of British prisons at home. His campaign promised to do the same with hospitals and schools — and while he was at it, he made a conservative case for action on automation (through mid-life retraining) and climate change (not through a lurch toward socialism, but through research funding, nuclear power, and cooperation with larger nations). He wanted to build beautiful homes, plant thousands of trees, and heal the North/South divide. He sees a Britain renowned not for her military might, but for her wisdom, realism, and humility. In other words, he is a traditionalist Burkean conservative — not a Republican governor. Advertisement
When many no longer believe that a man like Stewart belongs in the country’s Conservative party, British conservatism must surely be facing an identity crisis. He has thrown himself in with the “remoaners,” his critics say. He’s a “traitor,” because he voted Remain in the referendum three years ago. Never mind that Stewart wanted to honor the democratic vote to leave the European Union, and that his plan was the only one that provided the slightest possibility of leaving before November without peddling fantasies . What is truly incredible is that those equating hardline Euroscepticism with British conservatism are often the same people who label the Marxist Jeremy Corbyn a staunch Brexiteer.
This split threatens to divide the Tories in a manner not seen since the 1846 Corn Laws crisis . If they are to emerge from Brexit intact, they will have to incorporate Stewart’s brand of conservatism into their ranks. And, more importantly, they will have to recognize the roots of his campaign’s success. The Conservative party has won only a single majority in 25 years. Beneath the Brexit charade, its helm remains occupied by liberal conservatives. But alarmingly, its own membership doesn’t follow suit. As the same polling demonstrates, Conservative-party members are far closer to Margaret Thatcher than David Cameron. They would sooner see the destruction of their party than risk any delay to Brexit."
St. Louis Abortion Clinic Will Flout State Pelvic-Exam Requirement,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead McArdle,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/st-louis-abortion-clinic-will-flout-state-pelvic-exam-requirement/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter June 20, 2019 4:28 PM A Missouri State flag waves outside of Planned Parenthood St. Louis Region, Missouri’s sole abortion clinic, in St. Louis, Mo., May 28, 2019. (Lawrence Bryant/Reuters)
Missouri’s lone abortion clinic has called a requirement that patients seeking an abortion undergo a pelvic exam days before the procedure “disrespectful and dehumanizing” and said it will refuse to abide by the requirement.
A spokeswoman for the St. Louis Planned Parenthood said the clinic no longer performs the “unethical” pelvic exam at least 72 hours before an abortion as required by the state health department, but does administer the exam immediately prior to performing the abortion. The clinic has insisted that the exam is not required by state law, while the state has argued that it is.
“We believe continuing to force an additional invasive and uncomfortable vaginal exam on patients at least three days before her abortion procedure, when it is not medically indicated, and when she will have the identical exam on the day of the abortion procedure, is not patient-centered; it is disrespectful and dehumanizing,” said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an abortion provider at the clinic.
Missouri’s Republican governor, Mike Parson, signed a law last month prohibiting abortions after eight weeks, one of a number of extremely restrictive state abortion laws designed to spark court challenges that could potentially lead to the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Ben Sasse: Planned Parenthood Dictates Democratic Party's Abortion Policy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/ben-sasse-planned-parenthood-dictates-democratic-party-abortion-policy/,"June 20, 2019 5:16 PM Sen. Ben Sasse (File photo: Jim Bourg/Reuters)
On the Senate floor this afternoon, Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) knocked Democratic presidential candidates as they prepare to participate in a “women’s health” forum, hosted this weekend in South Carolina by abortion provider and political-activist group Planned Parenthood.
“Planned Parenthood is the country’s largest abortion business. That’s their main staple operation,” Sasse said in his remarks, noting that the group reported performing more than 330,000 abortions last year alone and that Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen admitted that “providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion” is part of the organization’s “core mission.”
Sasse criticized his Democratic colleagues for embracing Planned Parenthood’s hardline stance on abortion: that it ought to be available for any reason, at any stage of pregnancy, funded entirely by the U.S. taxpayer. “Today, the radical things that the nation’s largest abortion business wants are basically indistinguishable from the position of almost every Democrat running for president: Abortion — anytime, anywhere, for any reason, for free,” he said.
The Nebraska senator reminded listeners of comments from Virginia governor Ralph Northam suggesting that infants born alive after an attempted abortion procedure could be denied medical care, at least in some circumstances, as well as the fact that Democratic presidential contenders voted against his own bill earlier this session to protect those infants from neglect. This position is morally abhorrent to be sure, but it’s also, as Sasse noted, highly unpopular with the public, including with Democratic voters and with Americans who call themselves pro-choice. More from Sasse’s remarks:
Gallup polling over the last two decades has consistently shown that a majority of Americans are opposed to unrestricted abortion access beyond the first trimester. The Gallup numbers show that well under one-third of Americans support abortion beyond the first trimester. And a new NBC/PBS/Marist poll found that only fully four out of five Americans are opposed to abortion in the third trimester — and that includes a majority of self-identifying pro-choice voters.
In particular, Sasse called out New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand — who is attempting to run for the Democratic presidential nomination but continues to linger at the bottom of the pack — for recent remarks in which she equated being pro-life to being racist. “According to a sitting United States senator, and a candidate for the Democratic nomination to be president of the United States,” Sasse said, quoting Gillibrand’s comments, “holding pro-life views is ‘no longer acceptable.’ It is not a ‘fair’ position, she tells us. It is the ‘moral equivalent’ of ‘racism’ or ‘anti-Semitism.’ Perhaps in the senator’s next interview, my colleague will suggest that pro-life Americans belong in a basket of deplorables.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

He went on to note the historic connection between the abortion industry and the eugenics movement in the U.S. “It’s in part because of this ugly history that black women in America are three-and-a-half times more likely to have an abortion than white women,” he said. “In some parts of Senator Gillibrand’s home state, black children are actually more likely to be aborted than to be carried to term.”"

What Gundy v. United States Means for the Nondelegation Doctrine | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/fragmented-gundy-court-suggests-the-nondelegation-doctrine-might-have-a-future/,"June 21, 2019 10:02 AM The U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., June 11, 2018 (Erin Schaff/Reuters)
Yesterday a fragmented Supreme Court announced its judgment in Gundy v. United States , which upheld a provision of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) that allows the attorney general to decide whether and how sex offenders convicted prior to passage of the Act need to register under the comprehensive national system of registration established by the statute. That delegation of authority to the attorney general was challenged under the nondelegation doctrine, under which Congress, the branch vested by the Constitution with legislative power under the Constitution, may not transfer such power to another branch. Advertisement Advertisement
The Court added a gloss to this doctrine in 1928, when it stated that Congress may delegate authority provided that the statute lays down an “intelligible principle” to which the body exercising such authority is required to conform. That remains the law to this day, but since the New Deal, when it struck down delegations in two cases decided in 1935, the Court has upheld every other delegation it has faced. That has contributed to the unprecedented proliferation of a vast administrative state over the last eight and a half decades, prompting many observers to wonder whether the nondelegation doctrine is a virtual dead letter.
Gundy did not yield an opinion by a majority of the Court, but a plurality opinion written by Justice Kagan and joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. That opinion did not take issue with precedent or the nondelegation doctrine, but tried to argue around it by putting an interpretive gloss on the statute: SORNA, Kagan maintained, requires the attorney general to register pre-Act offenders as soon as feasible, and the only discretion granted to the attorney general is to address feasibility issues based on technical challenges presented by the prior patchwork of sex offender registration systems.
Justice Gorsuch’s dissent, on the other hand, noted the statutory text, which mentions nothing about feasibility and expressly gives the attorney general “the authority to specify the applicability” of the statute to pre-Act offenders. This amounts to “vast” discretion for a category that consists of more than 500,000 people, and a succession of attorneys general exercised their discretion in a variety of different directions. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The dissent continued with a discussion of the pedigree of the nondelegation doctrine going back to James Madison and John Marshall and why it is necessary to take the separation of powers seriously. Proceeding into the twentieth century, Gorsuch also explained how the Court’s “‘intelligible principle’ remark eventually began to take on a life of its own,” one with “no basis in the original meaning of the Constitution,” which brought us to where we are today. Instead, a correctly rooted “intelligible principle” test must ask:
Does the statute assign to the executive only the responsibility to make factual findings? Does it set forth the facts that the executive must consider and the criteria against which to measure them? And most importantly, did Congress, and not the Executive Branch, make the policy judgments?
Gorsuch’s dissent was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas. Justice Kavanaugh did not participate in the case, which was argued before his confirmation.
The fifth vote for the Court’s judgment came from Justice Alito, but he wrote his own separate concurrence without joining the plurality opinion. Sounding more like the dissenters, he criticized the Court’s blanket rejection of nondelegation challenges since 1935, which meant it “upheld provisions that authorized agencies to adopt important rules pursuant to extraordinarily capacious standards.” Alito expressed his “willing[ness] to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years” if a majority of justices were willing to do so, but absent that majority, he found the statute to be in line with precedent.
That leaves four justices on record as willing to breathe new life into the nondelegation doctrine, with the possible fifth vote in Justice Kavanaugh when the issue comes before him. Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network. "
Ninth Circuit Victory for Trump Administration’s Defunding of Planned Parenthood | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/ninth-circuit-victory-for-trump-administrations-defunding-of-planned-parenthood/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter June 21, 2019 9:42 AM
Amidst the downpour of Supreme Court rulings, I just wanted to highlight an excellent ruling yesterday from the Ninth Circuit. In California v. Azar , a Ninth Circuit panel granted the motion by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a stay of orders of three separate district courts that preliminarily enjoined HHS from implementing its revised regulations imposing restrictions on funding of pre-pregnancy family planning services. The plaintiffs in the underlying actions included some two dozen states and various Planned Parenthood affiliates. Advertisement Advertisement
In its per curiam order, the panel (which consisted of three Republican appointees) explained that the HHS regulations are substantially similar to—indeed, in one respect less restrictive than—the 1988 regulations that the Supreme Court found permissible in its 1991 ruling in Rust v. Sullivan . Further, the panel explained, the district courts were wrong to contend that two provisions of law adopted since Rust impliedly repealed or amended the underlying statutory provision or otherwise disallowed the HHS regulations.

I understand that a similar case is pending in the Fourth Circuit, arising from a preliminary injunction imposed by a district court in Maryland. If the Fourth Circuit doesn’t likewise promptly overturn that injunction, look for HHS to seek and obtain relief from the Supreme Court.

Nazi Comparisons From Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Christopher Tremoglie,06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-50-year-history-of-the-worst-comparison/,"Follow Christopher Tremoglie on Twitter June 21, 2019 2:00 PM
Everything old becomes new again, and such is the case for comparing Republican presidents to Nazis. Last weekend’s “nationwide day of protest” were filled with placards and signs insinuating so. Salon recently published an article that compared President Trump’s criticism of the media to that of Hitler. Protesters in London decried Trump and his supporters as “Nazi scum.” In April, Democratic presidential hopeful alleged that the president’s rhetoric “echoed Nazis.” On June 18th, CNN’s Don Lemon once again deployed this technique and compared President Trump to the Nazi leader. Aside from being old, tired, and untrue, this trope is nothing new. For decades, left-wing activists have compared Republican political leaders to Adolf Hitler.
As Larry Elder has recounted , liberals have compared everyone from Barry Goldwater to George W. Bush to Nazis. It’s a history that dates back at least 55 years. And as Steven Hayward has recounted, even Ronald Reagan met with the calumny :
Democratic Rep. William Clay of Missouri charged that Reagan was “trying to replace the Bill of Rights with fascist precepts lifted verbatim from Mein Kampf.” The Los Angeles Times cartoonist Paul Conrad drew a panel depicting Reagan plotting a fascist putsch in a darkened Munich beer hall. Harry Stein (later a conservative convert) wrote in Esquire that the voters who supported Reagan were like the “good Germans” in “Hitler’s Germany.”"

Norman Rockwell’s 'Four Freedoms': A Closer Look | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brian T. Allen,06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/norman-rockwell-four-freedoms-paintings/,"About Brian T. Allen June 22, 2019 5:30 AM Detail of Freedom of Speech , 1943, by Norman Rockwell. Story illustration for The Saturday Evening Post , February 20, 1943. (Collection of Norman Rockwell Museum. ©SEPS: Curtis Licensing, Indianapolis, IN. All rights reserved. www.curtislicensing.com). His pictures of plain people in everyday life are sublime, not subversive.
O n June 1, I wrote the first part of my piece on Norman Rockwell’s Four Freedoms pictures. Done for The Saturday Evening Post in 1943, these scenes are part of the visual vocabulary we carry in our heads when we think about what it means to be an American and to live in America. Freedom of speech, freedom of worship, which together are freedom of conscience, as well as freedoms from fear and want are more broadly achieved in America than anywhere else in the world, or at any time in human history. Advertisement
The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has been touring the Four Freedoms paintings by Norman Rockwell (1894–1978), which the museum owns. The show, Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt, and the Four Freedoms , opened recently at the Museum of Fine Arts in Caen in Normandy as part of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on June 6. Next, it will go to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, then to the Denver Art Museum, and back to the Norman Rockwell Museum in September 2020.
It’s a brilliant idea to show these pictures in Caen at this time. Caen was a center of fighting in the hours and days after the invasion started. The French in Normandy have never forgotten the American role in their liberation but, for younger audiences, a thorough presentation of the Four Freedoms pictures is timely. The show does a great job situating Rockwell’s work in the context of its time and establishing the relevance of these works today. It’s a show about the past, the present, and, for young French people, the future. With so much social and political stress in France today, the show — and the Four Freedoms — are effective primers on the civic ideals all decent people want to achieve. Advertisement
These pictures, based on a speech Franklin Roosevelt made, became the visual mission statement for America’s war effort. I think it’s a good time to give them a close look.
There’s another reason, though. An art-historian friend told me a few weeks ago that he used Freedom of Speech in a seminar at a high-achieving, selective college. He showed a slide of the picture, which students didn’t recognize. That’s fair. They’re young. World War II, Rockwell, Roosevelt, and bond drives are ancient history. I get that. History is badly taught, almost everywhere. That’s a very sad given. We let it continue at our peril. Advertisement Advertisement
What disturbed me was how students interpreted the picture, knowing nothing about it. They thought Freedom of Speech depicted a white supremacist meeting.
When I heard this, I was speechless, freedom to speak or no freedom.
In thinking about this, my take is that the students saw that the subjects were mostly plain people who worked with their hands. Even the tie-wearers in Freedom of Speech weren’t dressed by Brooks Brothers. Everyone is neat, but they’re unadorned, untanned, uncool. They’d look and feel awkward in the faculty lounge, the tech start-up, or that chic financial-services firm. These students — taken collectively, they’re our future leaders — assumed the worst about these hard-working, most unassuming people.
Yet another reason to revisit Rockwell. The biggest change in Rockwell’s working method when he went to Vermont was his new use of models who weren’t professionals. “Now my pictures grew out of the world around me, the everyday life of my neighbors,” he said. “I didn’t fake anymore.” His range of characters widened, too, since he wasn’t confined to the pool of professionals available in New York. He recruited models from the square dances, from factories in Arlington, from shops, gas stations, and farms. Most of Rockwell’s models were working-class. Some were self-employed, among them Carl Hess, the model for the central figure in Freedom of Speech . He owned his own business, a gas station and auto-repair shop. He pumped the gas and fixed the cars himself. He’d never worn a suit until he went on the nationwide war-bond tour with the Four Freedoms paintings in 1944. He never wore one again.
Standing like a skyscraper, Rockwell’s Hess is spare and taut. Rockwell thought he looked like the beardless Lincoln. That’s why he used him for a model. He could not have imagined how much Gary Cooper would resemble Hess a few years later in High Noon . By 1952, when the movie came out, Freedom of Speech was known everywhere.

Arlington was hardly riven by income inequality. It was a farm town, mostly working-class, with some small businesses and a few factories. There was no suburban-style track housing, no affluent neighborhoods, no country clubs, and no private schools. Vermonters in the 1930s and early 1940s would wryly ask, “Depression . . . what depression?” Vermont didn’t waltz unscathed through the worst calamity ever endured by the American economy. The quip only acknowledged that Vermont was in a chronic slump that started around the 1850s. That’s when the sheep bubble burst, ending a time when a million merino sheep grazed its deforested hills. Vermont had only one town — Burlington — with a population of more than 25,000. No other town came close. Its population in 1940 had been flat since the early 19th century. Vermont produced marble, lumber, maple syrup, and milk, all hit hard by the collapse in commodity prices that started in 1930.
Poverty was widespread but different in Vermont. No one went hungry. People hunted for food. Garden patches were ubiquitous. The worst canard surrounding the Four Freedoms concerns the Freedom from Want picture. During the war, Europeans who saw it resented the scene of well-fed Americans enjoying a feast. Famine was a Continental calling card. Of course, it didn’t happen by accident. Europe brought its legion of miseries on itself, but that’s beside the point. In the 1960s and 1970s, many American intellectuals found the picture smug. Amidst the Thanksgiving prosperity, there’s no guilt. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The meal in Freedom from Want was almost all locally sourced, to use Slow Food lingo. No one went hungry in a place where about 30 percent of the people lived on farms. Hunting then and now is ubiquitous. In the 1940s, most people still lived off the land, close to abundant food and water but not to opportunities to get rich. The table and food in the picture are actually modest.
Rockwell didn’t look at his characters or his models as remote. He often knew them, though sometimes he didn’t. He conceived of a theme and a composition and shopped for people who looked the part. Generally, his instructions were simple. “Be yourself,” he usually said. It’s easier, and possibly instinctive, for a more cosmopolitan artist to invest in country people a heroic, grim persistence or a tinge of tragedy at one extreme or buffoonery on the other. They’re hard for the academic mind obsessed by “isms” to fathom. Rockwell’s pictures aren’t subversive or ironic. His figures aren’t gleaners or ragpickers or serfs or slaves. They’re not oppressed, marginalized, downtrodden, or manic. It’s not that complexity or difficulty didn’t exist in the lives of Rockwell’s people. They just processed it and expressed it differently. The best solace was silence. Silence is a trait Vermonters have honed to a fine art. So is stoicism. So is fatalism. And no one thought of himself as a victim. Advertisement
Rockwell’s Freedom of Worship picture isn’t set in a house of worship. Unlike the three other pictures, it has no setting at all but is a stacked array of bust shots similar to what he used often in the 1960s. Rockwell was criticized for using a stereotype of Jews — the “Tevye type,” to portend Fiddler on the Roof . Walter Squiers, the model for the figure, was a Methodist carpenter but, with some costuming, looked the part. I’m not convinced the figure is even meant to represent a Jew but, rather, a generic “exotic religion” type. It looks like a Muslim kufi to me. In any event, it’s a good stab at ecumenicalism.
It’s also Rockwell’s first use of an African-American subject. He wanted a look that was more diverse than Arlington and the surrounding towns could provide. It’s the only time in his Vermont years that he hired a model, in New York, for the figure in the upper-left-hand corner. In the 1960s, Rockwell’s civil-rights scenes essentialized the issues at hand and moved public opinion. Left : Freedom of Worship , 1943, by Norman Rockwell (1894-1978).

Rockwell’s Four Freedoms pictures concern fundamental, timeless values, like protecting and feeding one’s family, praying to one’s God, respecting the beliefs of others, and preserving a destiny and purpose shared by everyone. Violence, misery, brutality, and hate were, to him, situational rather than enduring, eruptions to be suppressed and defeated rather than balls and chains always with us and practiced by oppressors against victims. Yes, the pictures are propaganda, but they’re far from atrocity propaganda. Rockwell came of age during the First World War, when atrocity propaganda ruled the war-marketing roost. After the war, investigation committees established that many of the German atrocities arousing the public in 1915 or 1916 never happened. Angry and jaded, Americans weren’t in the mood to buy another batch.
Rockwell’s pictures were a more oblique type of propaganda, drawing on the head as much as on the heart. He often sought the spot where the two are in equipoise, a spot Vermonters would say is called “common sense.” Roosevelt was criticized for a Wilsonian idealism, presenting the Four Freedoms as abstractions, as universal. Rockwell made them concrete and placed them in the context of everyday life, at home, at a local meeting, and at church or a synagogue. He presented them — faith, democracy, peace, and family — as things for which a man could die on the battlefield. And there’s no anger or resentment in Rockwell’s pictures. Advertisement
In Freedom of Speech , a single figure, with rough hands, wearing a bomber jacket and a flannel shirt, speaks at a meeting. He looks very much like a man who works with his hands. He’s surrounded by better-dressed people listening attentively. He’s Everyman, and he lives in a classless society, at least at that moment. His vote counts as much as anyone’s. Advertisement
The picture is a rarity for Rockwell. It shows an event that actually happened. His inspiration was a meeting that occurred in Arlington in 1941. It’s a Town Meeting, the distinctly New England form of local government in which the town “legislature” isn’t a small, elected town council but a meeting of every voter in town. Every citizen is a legislator. Jim Edgerton, a farmer and Rockwell’s closest neighbor, spoke against the construction of a new high school in Arlington. He was concerned about the impact on his property taxes. He’d just lost most of his cows to hoof-and-mouth disease. His income had plummeted earlier through the collapse of milk prices. The crowd listened politely, yes, and then outvoted him. He didn’t cry about a rigged election. He wasn’t a sore loser. Like every Vermonter, he was practical. He got a job on the construction crew that built the new high school.
When it came to creating Freedom of Speech , Rockwell didn’t want Edgerton as a model. He looked too much like Charles Lindbergh. The Lindbergh look wasn’t compromised in Rockwell’s mind because of the America First movement of the 1940s. The look, to Rockwell, was too Arrow Shirt Man handsome, too blond, too blue-eyed. Hess looked the spartan, on-edge part.
Rockwell originally conceived a different composition. The central figure was more animated, in mid-performance, his body moving. Rockwell, like most people, was a moviegoer. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , from 1939, climaxed with Senator Smith’s angry speech orchestrated by director Frank Capra, and it seems Rockwell quoted it, though in Freedom of Speech . Abe Lincoln in Illinois , from 1940, starring Raymond Massey, might have been another source. The young Lincoln, like the speaker in Freedom of Speech , was not a polished speaker but moved by strong, deeply held feeling. In Freedom of Speech , the central figure is not in the middle of speaking but in that split second of thinking and speaking. The scene is still, hieratic, like an altarpiece. Thought and speech — thought’s public projection — are both combined and spiritualized. The figure looks upward. The scene is filled with ears. Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and Raymond Massey in Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940) (Columbia Pictures, RKO/Photofest)
Freedom of Worship is the only one with neither a discernable setting nor even a whiff of narrative. He used props like rosary beads, books, and the single piece of exotic headgear to evoke religious difference, but the most effective elements are the hands. Rockwell was an unusually effective interpreter of hands. Some of the hands in this picture are in prayer. One figure’s hand is in chin-scratching “hmmm, I’m still thinking about this” mode. An old woman’s hands are wrinkled and worn rough. Her wedding ring looks like she’s never taken it off, a nod to the durability of her marriage. Hands are for praying, but they’re also for doing.
If the ears in Freedom of Speech propose respectful linking, the hands in Freedom of Worship link religious belief and feeling with practical, everyday use. To have faith means to live it, to make it real. Faith and religious belief might be considered private and internal, but Rockwell made it real. His use of weather-beaten Arlington models made faith a part of the work-a-day world. “Each according to the dictates of his own conscience” is the unnecessary, distracting headline Rockwell painted, one of the few times he used a device seen in newspapers and magazines, where stories have titles. I think Rockwell reached for an analogy he didn’t need. Freedom of Worship has the feel of church stained glass, which often has figures arranged in registers and a title, usually a line from the New Testament.
Rockwell grew over the years to dislike Freedom from Fear . That’s the picture he felt was smug. He called it “smug” in his autobiography because children in London and elsewhere in Europe were dying in nighttime air raids. He was too hard on himself. Yes, it’s not Guernica . The father figure holds a newspaper signaling the storyline. “BOMBINGS” and “HORRORS” convey the state of most of the world. It’s the front page of the Bennington Banner , the local daily in Bennington County.
It’s the most simply composed picture in the series, with only four figures. Its palette is limited. The setting is modest. It’s structured by a handful of horizontals, verticals, and diagonals. Rockwell’s studio was filled with books about art, and more than most illustrators, he was immersed in art history. This picture is his Whistler moment, with muted blues and yellows, vaguely japonisme wallpaper, lots of diagonals, and figures more languid than sternly upright. Advertisement
Is it smug? It’s not about atrocity or danger. It’s about gratitude.
Freedom of Speech became the most renowned of the Four Freedoms pictures, if for no other reason than the American Civil Liberties Union’s use of it as its flagship image during the time it had an expansive view of freedom rather than a view tethered to “it depends on whether we approve.” Freedom from Want is by far the most ubiquitous and most parodied. All the takes I’ve seen are a mix of fun and serious, including a version from 2010 by Matt Wuerker in which every figure except the turkey has a device, including Grandma, who speaks in an earpiece while she delivers the goods.
When I was a curator, I felt less bound by theories and categories than most. At the Clark Art Institute, there were only three curators. We had to know a lot not only about our narrow specialties but the scope of the collection, which ranged from Old Master prints to Renoir to Homer to Sargent and to silver and Sèvres porcelain.
This helped develop my catholic taste and broad-mindedness in judging good and bad art. I grew to admire Robert Rosenblum, the art historian and curator whose scholarly and aesthetic sensibilities were eclectic, convivial, and humane. He saw quality in many things, breaking barriers along the way. In the late 1990s, he was among the leaders in Rockwell’s revival. He thought academics who deplored Rockwell were prigs and faddists and were themselves to be deplored. To love Rockwell, and to love all good art, as Rosenblum said, “all you have to do is relax and look and think.” "
Why Nancy Pelosi Continues to Deflect the Censure Gambit | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/nancy-pelosi-president-trump-censure-impeachment/,"June 22, 2019 6:00 AM House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill, June 20, 2019. (Al Drago/Reuters) The House speaker is playing the long game.
O ne-quarter of House Democrats publicly support impeaching President Trump. It is an oft-reported talking point in media-Democrat circles. Not much mentioned is the corollary: That means three-quarters would rather see the question go away.
This is the challenge that Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to navigate — deftly.
When last we visited this issue, the speaker was deflecting impeachment chatter by insisting that she would prefer to see the president prosecuted and sent to prison. Advertisement Advertisement
Now the latest: Pelosi is deflecting censure chatter by insisting that she’d rather see the president impeached.
It is a delicate dance. Advertisement
As we have noted, only about one-third of the country, mostly Democrats, is interested in pursuing impeachment. The number that sticks with me is 37. That is the rough percentage of people who show up in poll after poll as strongly disapproving of the president and his policies.
I am no psephologist, but that seems like a very high number to me. At any given time, even when things are going well, the total number of people who disapprove is apt to be a good deal higher than those who strongly disapprove. So, if the latter is at 37, the likelihood is that the president will be underwater most, if not all, of the time. (As this is written, the RCP average has him down about 9 percent — 44 approve versus 53 disapprove.)
Now, as a conservative Republican, I think both more and less of this than ardent Trump supporters do. More, because I take the polls seriously — I don’t think an adult reaction to ominous polls is to dismiss the polls ( and the pollsters! ) as “fake news.” Less, because I never thought Trump won in 2016 because of Trump. Advertisement
I thought the president won because his opponent was awful. I don’t see that much has changed. The economy is good but there are signs it is slowing. The tariffs are likely to bite him in key states (as our Kevin D. Williamson brilliantly explains here ). The president seems content to play to his base and temperamentally turns off many people who would support a less volatile, less self-absorbed personality. I don’t see how he could win the popular vote given his unpopularity in huge Democratic strongholds (California and New York), so if he is going to win an Electoral College majority, it is going to be very tight. Advertisement
Once again, then, everything will hinge on Trump’s opponent — will he or she have such deep flaws (in addition to the baggage of unpopular Democratic policies) that Trump becomes more palatable by comparison than he seems to be in a vacuum? We won’t know that for a while, and I won’t get too excited over polls until we do. Advertisement
Speaker Pelosi reads the same polls, and she is certainly better at this than I am. She has to figure the Democrats have a very good chance of defeating the president. I am betting she spends most waking hours asking: How could we screw this up ? And the answer probably is: By taking rash, futile action aimed at prematurely ejecting a guy we can beat the old-fashioned way 17 months from now .
For Pelosi, the chance of beating the president and the value of beating him are both diminished if she cannot protect the Democrats who won seats in districts where Trump is popular. If Democrats anger voters in those districts, they may turn out in the droves Trump needs to win; or, if not, they could still flip the House back to the GOP. With Republicans likely to hold the Senate, this would guarantee a rough go for a new Democratic administration.
On the other hand, the hard-left base that wants Trump impeached represents most of the energy and much of the money in a presidential-election cycle. Pelosi has to hold them off while demonstrating that she is still one of them at heart. Advertisement
The solution: In House committees, keep the anti-Trump investigations churning but on a tight leash. These proceedings need to look, feel, and be covered like an impeachment inquiry, but not actually be one. Keep calling witnesses, keep railing about lawlessness and obstruction, but don’t do anything that calls for Congress to take formal action. That is a big Pelosi objective: Spare the Democrats in Trump districts from having to take tough votes.
An example: A couple of weeks ago, the House voted (along party lines) to make it easier for chairmen of key investigative committees to go to court to try to enforce subpoenas issued to the Trump administration. They tried to gussy it up as if it were a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr. In reality, it was nothing of the sort.
It was shrewd, though. Ordinarily, an effort to enforce a subpoena or hold an administration official in contempt would call for a vote of the full House. But now, the chairmen will just need a nod from a five-person leadership committee (three Democrats, two Republicans) controlled by Pelosi. Advertisement Advertisement
Why? The speaker is trying to protect her vulnerable members. Constituents in Trump-friendly districts see such votes as unduly hostile to the president. They are increasingly irritated by the Democrats’ mulish persistence in an anti-Trump impeachment gambit at the expense of dealing with pressing national problems. Why force members who will have to face these voters to go on record — knowing the base will fry them if they resist the Resistance?
Ditto censure. Some members of Congress are attracted to the notion of formal legislative censure of the president, in lieu of impeachment. We learned this in the Clinton impeachment. Censure is classic Washington: It would enable lawmakers to register disapproval of presidential misconduct yet avoid an accountable vote on whether the president should be removed.
Pelosi is shrewd enough to see salient differences between the Clinton and Trump scenarios. There was no doubt that Clinton violated the law and engaged in condemnable personal misconduct; nor was there doubt that most Americans (including many who did not like Clinton) did not want him removed from office. Therefore, the idea of censure was popular among Democrats (and some Republicans) who were pro-Clinton and saw it as an escape hatch from the Constitution’s impeachment remedy for presidential misconduct. Advertisement
In the Trump situation, to the contrary, there is significant dispute about whether the president violated the law. Even people who deeply disapprove of the behavior outlined in Special Counsel Mueller’s report have serious qualms about whether it rises to the level of obstruction. (Many of those people have become inured to Trump’s character traits; they’ve learned to sigh and go on with their day, rather than wonder why the grand jury has not yet filed an indictment.)
A censure vote on Clinton would have been popular (probably even with Clinton himself), and might have been seen as sparing the country a futile impeachment trial. But a censure vote on Trump would be unpopular: It would not satisfy anti-Trumpers for whom there is no alternative to impeachment; and it would anger the president and his supporters, who see the collusion caper as a farce and want the matter dropped."

So MBD, we had the big reelect launch in an arena in Orlando, which was about a 50-minute rehearsal of the greatest hits of 2016. I am not sure really anything changed except for some of the villains, because the investigations unspooled in the ensuing two or three years. And then the last ten minutes or so, you had a real case for his reelection made from prompter. What did you think about it? Advertisement
Michael : It was interesting. I thought the last ten minutes was some of the strongest stuff, and it was some of his best prompter reading in his career. But the feeling of it being a little stale, at least, for me, was there. I sort of judged these events in 2015 and 2016 by the kind of . . . it was a performance, it was a kind of a happening. It had to have this kind of crackle to it. And this felt a little bit too much like a reprise of the greatest hits to generate the kind of participatory excitement that I think was part of his election in the first place. Advertisement
So I’m a little worried about that. However, the pattern with Trump rallies in his previous campaign was that he just kept trying new material, almost like a standup comic and gradually found what resonated, and what improved, and what bits people liked participating in. And I think as it becomes clear which candidates are at the top of the Democratic party, I expect these to improve a bit. Advertisement
Rich : So what did you think, Xan? Did you think it is too much of the same old, or is this the same old just works for him?
Alexandra : Well, I wasn’t sure quite what to make of it until I read this Time magazine interview that just came out this morning with Trump in which he said, “I don’t need to court swing voters because my base is strong the way it is.” And so, he clearly thinks he’s just going to roll right through 2020 talking about Hillary Clinton until there’s somebody at the top of the Democratic ticket. And whether that’s Joe Biden, it seemed like probably they’re thinking it will be Biden because that’s who Don Jr. attacked and his remarks at the rally. But I think Trump is just kind of figuring his base is going to keep eating up whatever he has to say the same way they always have. He doesn’t really have to talk about what he’s done or didn’t do. He’s going to talk about immigration as if he’s done a lot more than he actually has, and fingers crossed, people continue to like it. Advertisement
Rich : What’d you make of it, Charlie? Advertisement
Charlie : Well, Donald Trump is an anti-candidate as much as he’s a candidate. People find this creepy because they think that it makes him in some way hateful. But politics is geared this way at the moment. You tend to motivate people to vote more by scaring them into what their opponents might do than by telling them what you’re going to do. The myth is that what people really want is to be inspired, but they don’t. What they really want to do is be scared, and Trump’s pretty good at that.
I’m not sure he was at his best the other night because he focused too much on a candidate who’s not going to run again. And he was reliving the greatest hits. So that will be a temptation for him. It was probably a great surprise to him that he won, and it was probably the greatest night of his life, but he’s not gonna lack opportunities to play the anti-candidate. He’s going to be running against a candidate from a party that has moved dramatically to the left, that has adopted in some quarters a preference for late-term, if not post-birth, abortion that thinks that running camps to detain illegal immigrants temporarily is akin to replaying the Holocaust, that is so obsessed with identity politics as to switch a lot of people off, that’s talking about 70 percent tax rates and wealth taxes, and openly boasting about socialism, canceling debts, and so on and so forth, some talking about reparations. Advertisement
So the style of it worked for him before and may work for him again. If he can build a coalition of people who don’t especially like him but just don’t want the other person, then he may do well, and what he did the other night may do well, but he will have to adapt from Hillary Clinton because she’s not going to be that person this time around. Advertisement
Rich : So, Michael, I wrote a column about this today where I think Trump, the way he conducts himself, the constant controversies, the high-wire threats he’s always making, and he doesn’t necessarily follow through on all of them, kind of obscure what’s basically been kind of an incrementalist center-right government, some risks — pulling out of the Iran deal when it’s not clear what they’re hoping to get from it is a risk. The trade war with China is a risk, although I think he has off-ramps if he wants a fake deal. But then you look at it, and it’s basically kind of expansionary fiscal policy all about preserving the recovery and then no new major foreign wars. So peace and prosperity.
Michael : Yeah, it is. So there are a couple of aspects to the pitch. One is the strongest thing he can point to is the continued recovery, the growing labor participation rate, I think, is actually the biggest selling point on that. I thought some of his lines, like he was just barely starting to gesture toward a kind of politics I would like to see from a populist Republican, which is reaching out to African-American voters and saying, “Hey, African-American unemployment is really low. We’re making strides. We’re protecting you from Chinese competition, competition from illegal labor pools coming over the border.” Advertisement
But on the other side, I wonder when I watch these rallies the second time around, if there are not voters who projected onto Trump in the first election and kind of believed his promise of “I’ll change when I’m in office, you won’t believe how presidential I can be.” And he kind of joked about being boring and getting the job done. And I think that there probably is a real subset of normally Republican voters who wanted him to make good on that promise and are disappointed that the administration has felt chaotic and out of control at times.
Charlie : That’s why it’s smart for him to play the anti-politics card and say, “Whatever I am, whatever my flaws, yes, the economy is good, yes, there are no foreign wars, but the other people will destroy you,” which is something he said literally.
Michael : Yeah, and that is the thing is like how many . . . My theory of Republican electoral success is partly that the party has gotten away with a more astringent fiscal policy in the past, more austerity, more costs are slowing the growth of government. Partly because people elected for the cultural reasons that they want to check on . . . they don’t want a united government between media and the presidency and Congress on cultural issues. And so, Republicans are like a political check on the cultural power of the left.
And we are seeing, because I think Democrats think they have such a good shot at beating him, we’re seeing just a lot of expressiveness about how America is going to be changed in the future, and I think it’s going to freak out larger and larger subsets of voters. So yeah, the Democrats are going to be crucial in making Trump’s reelection case for him.
Rich : So, Xan, let’s look back to the Stephanopoulos interview, which dominated for about four or five days. It was breaking just when we recorded last week. And, for me, it’s a little bit reminiscent of the Katie Couric interview with Sarah Palin, and we’re like, “When is this going to end?” It’s just so there’s all these clips. Okay. Stephanopoulos, and now he’s with them in the Oval Office. Now he’s sitting in the garden with him. Now he’s in the car with him. Advertisement
And of course, the biggest news to come out of this was Trump defending kind of in a muddled way the way he usually does, defending the idea of getting assistance from a foreign government and not necessarily calling the FBI, although he said, in the course of his back and forth initially with Stephanopoulos about this, “Oh, I would do both. I’d accept it and then I’d call the FBI.” And then he said on Fox and Friends the next day, “Well, I would call the FBI, but I’d have to look at the information first, make sure it was bad. And if this was bad, I’d hand it over to the FBI.” What did you make of it?
Alexandra : Well, it definitely did seem to go on and on, and I think, for Trump, that’s always a problem because the longer he’s talking, the odds just go up, and up, and up that he’s going to say something crazy or something wrong or something off message. And so, you’d kind of see him starting out on his talking points, maybe saying something that sort of made sense about some accomplishments of his administration. And then one sentence later, for some reason, he’s on the witch hunt or talking about no collusion or talking about himself.
And I think Jonah put it really well in his column earlier this week that if Trump’s talking about himself, he’s unpopular, and that’s not how he’s going to win reelection. He has to focus on maybe the top two or three things his administration has done that people are happy about or talk about himself as a stopgap against whatever the lefts going to do in contrast to all these crazy Democrats who are trying to run against him. And so, I think the longer he’s talking, the worse it gets.
Rich : Charlie, what do you make of the question of whether someone should go to the FBI? You have complicated feelings about the FBI. So if Norway approaches you, do you need to go the FBI in your view?
Charlie : Yes, you do. And I think if you’re the president of the United States there is really only one answer here. I saw it being parsed afterwards. I agree, not everybody does. I agree that there’s a double standard here, perhaps around the Steele dossier. I agree that you probably wouldn’t know that information was salient, or not unless you looked at it in some way. But that’s not really the point. I think what happened here is partly that Trump doesn’t have much experience still of public life and is prone to saying what he instinctively thinks.
And the other thing is I think he sees every single question like this and all discussion of this as an attempt to discredit his presidency. I think he thinks that if he acknowledges that there was any attempt to disrupt the election or to help him in some way or to discredit Hillary Clinton, that he’s endorsing the idea that that’s why he won. And therefore he’s undermining his own mandate. It’s a bit odd and somewhat dangerous that he thinks like that because it’s prevented him from being able to draw an entirely reasonable distinction between what was attempted, how politics always works, and what was achieved.
He doesn’t have to concede that he won the election because Russia did this or that, I don’t think he did, in order to accept that Russia is a bad actor and that foreign powers try to intervene. But he does seem to see them as inextricable. That said, the freakout is a little boring now. We know this is who he is. He said as much during the last election when he, whether you like it or not, joked, half-joked, semi-joked about accepting foreign aid and asking the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton. This is who he is. He has a responsibility as president not to behave like that. He just doesn’t live up to it.
Rich : I think the other thing he obviously considers is that conceding anything on this is undermining legitimacy of his own election. But he also doesn’t want to throw Don Jr. under the bus and doesn’t want to admit implicitly or explicitly that he made a mistake in taking that meeting with the Russians. And this whole exchange started with Trump really expressing his sincere outrage and anger that people were talking about Don Jr. being prosecuted and going to jail potentially for having taken a meeting that nothing ultimately came of. So I’ll ask a question on this, MBD, at this juncture, what percentage odds would you give Donald Trump of getting reelected in 2020? Advertisement
Michael : 48 percent. I think he’s just under the halfway mark. Yeah, I think he should be higher given the state of the economy and the multiplicity of candidates on the other side. But a few undelivered promises, especially at the border.
Rich : Xan?
Alexandra : I’d say 60 percent mostly because —
Rich : Wow.
Alexandra : . . . even the most —
Rich : Bold.
Alexandra : . . . popular Democrat is not too impressive. And so, yeah, I think he’ll be helped out a lot by whoever he runs against.
Rich : Charlie?
Charlie : I think it’s about 45. And I think whether that changes, is ceteris paribus as regards to the economy, and his foreign policy up to him.
Rich : I’d say 50.1. The 0.1 is the power of incumbency. The 50 is basically, we don’t know who the nominee is going to be. If it’s Biden, I would go down, probably lower than even Charlie is. But if it’s Sanders or Buttigieg, I probably won’t go as high as 60, but I’d go high 50s. So speaking of Joe Biden, Xan, he’s been embroiled in another woke controversy. At a fundraiser he said, “We all need to get along.” And let me tell you how this used to work 50 years ago when I was in the Senate, in 1992 when I got a Senate committee assignment, and there were the segregationists and I didn’t agree with the segregationists, but we all got along. We got things done.
And yeah, I think he’s right that civility is really an important value in its own right. I think if you traveled back in time, 40 years, there were segregationists in the Senate, and they were part of Joe Biden’s own party, which is sort of — the bizarre point of this also is that he’s trying to make a point about bipartisanship, but this was really unit partisanship. All the segregationists were in the Democratic party, or the lion’s share of them, almost all of them. But anyway, there are many other ways to get this point across, though without talking about segregationists, which is obviously going to be triggering to a lot of people on your own side, and Cory Booker made a lot of hay out of this by calling on Biden to apologize. And Biden sort of Trump-style said, “No, Cory should apologize.” What did you make of it?
Alexandra : I think it shows Biden is really an incredibly weak candidate. And if you look at polls, even at the start of this month, he was ahead of Sanders, the next closest guy by 20 points. Now, that’s down to a single digit, even the latest poll I saw. So I think he’s clearly faltering here. And even if he hadn’t been touting his work with segregationists, the fact is he’s talking about what he was doing in the Senate multiple decades ago, and I’m not sure that’s really the best pitch you want to be making as probably the oldest or one of the oldest candidates in the race, you are already kind of weak.
He’s been flip-flopping every which way on the Hyde Amendment. That’s pretty much the biggest news he’s made this month for switching a decades-old position without really any explanation, looking like he was bullied into it by the ACLU, saying that he misheard the question about it. And then finally coming out that his staffers, Alyssa Milano,,are the ones who talked to him into switching his position on this issue.
So even if you kind of think that as a Democrat he should be upholding taxpayer-funded abortion at this point, and it was a good move to make, he didn’t look like a strong candidate doing it. And so, I think kind of every step so far, every big news he’s been making, he looks weak. And that’s why Booker and Kamala Harris are starting to hit him on it. Advertisement
Rich : Charlie, I think another thing at play here is just kind of old dog can’t learn new tricks. I’m sure he’s been saying this literally for 40 years since it happened, and it didn’t occur to him that it’s kind of tone-deaf in the contemporary context.
Charlie : I think his problem here, aside from whether one thinks it’s substantively moral to praise segregationists on any front, is that in 2019 there’s just not much of an audience for this on either side and that many people on the left believe that civility, the entire concept of civility is a cover for racism and bigotry, is a means by which people who should be expelled from society, who should be marginalized, who should be deplatformed are treated with respect and therefore normalized. You see this a great deal in opinion columns from progressive writers that civility is a carapace under which the people on the wrong side of history tend to hide. And it’s not good for Joe Biden that the vast majority of the people who believe that are in his party, and a lot of them vote in primaries.
It’s also not a view that is going to win him many plaudits on the right, because he doesn’t live up to it in a bipartisan fashion. Now, there are many people on the right who argue that indeed we should be civil and indeed we should accept pretty much everyone even if we don’t like them. Ross Douthat, for example, has asked in the New York Times , “Well, what if there is a sizable portion of the electorate that’s racist? What if there are people who are xenophobic? What do we do?” And he concluded that, “Well, we still have to work with them. We still have to debate with them. We still have to compromise with them because they vote too. And they have the right to vote too. And we live in a country that has to take stock of all opinions,” and that’s fine.
But Ross Douthat is prepared to live with the consequences of his views. Joe Biden is a man who said in 2012 that Mitt Romney, of all people, would put you all back in chains, and that “you all” in the sentence referred to African Americans. He was addressing primarily African Americans. He’s a guy who has not shied away from condemning people for mistakes that they have made, or if they’ve ever shown any modicum of interest in white supremacy. Now, that’s fine. But to then praise actual segregationists, people who voted against the Civil Rights Act, just looks to, I think most conservatives, as opportunism and hypocrisy. They’re not going to give a pass to somebody on principled grounds who accused Mitt Romney of wanting to put African Americans back in chains, whether literally or figuratively.
So I’m not quite sure who this was aimed at. And I think we just have to accept here that if a Republican had said this, every opinion column in the New York Times and the Washington Post and The Atlantic for a week would characterize it as a dog whistle intended to bolster an inbuilt advantage in the South. They would point out that the comments were made on Juneteenth. It would be a real problem. So Joe Biden, I think, has managed to annoy people on the left who think that civility is a sort of false consciousness. He’s managed to annoy people on the right who say, “Well, hold on a moment. If you’re going to say that we need to be civil to those people, why weren’t you civil to Mitt Romney in 2012, why aren’t you more civil to Republicans that you dislike?”
And I also think that he’s got a slight problem here, and that the response was somewhat Trumpy. He said “Apologize for what? Cory Booker should apologize.” But there are different imperatives in Republican and Democratic primaries. The Republicans have felt for a long time that their candidates don’t fight. They felt for a long time that you can’t speak up on any topic of controversy lest you be accused of racism, lest political correctness rear its head.
Trump came along, he smashed right through that. He smashed through it in a good way and he smashed through it in a bad way, but he smashed through it, nevertheless. There is a contingent within the Democratic party that believes its candidates don’t fight. There’s also a contingent within the Democratic party, and I think it’s larger, that thinks that its candidates don’t apologize enough, that we don’t see enough struggle sessions, that we don’t see enough learning, that we don’t see enough people educating themselves. And the site of an older white man telling a younger black man to apologize to him for criticizing him for praising segregationists and men who voted against the Civil Rights Act is just not going to play especially well in that context. So if Joe Biden thinks that he can win this primary by behaving in a Trump-like way, like a bull in a china shop and just saying, “I don’t care,” he might in some ways be right, but he’s going to have to pick his battles a lot more carefully than he did this week. Advertisement
Michael : I thought saying that Booker should apologize was a step too far. I think I agree with almost everything that’s been said so far, but I would say those criticisms applied to him in the primary, that the primary electorate for Democrats is not anxious to hear about compromise, and civility, and certainly not with segregationists. But I think it is wrong. I think a lot of liberal commentators have been wrong when they say that Democrats as a whole have internalized the premise that Republicans are hard-headed obstructionists and wicked and just need to be defeated. And that’s the rhetoric Democrats want from their general-election candidate. Maybe the primary electorate feels that way.
But I think the premise of Joe Biden’s campaign, which is that the Trump moment is an aberration in American history plays into something that I think is very powerful and dormant in American political life, which is a sense that politics seems more anxiety-inducing and fraught now than it did in the past. And that one of the geniuses of America’s democratic system is compromise, and that we haven’t seen big compromises in a long time in politics, and there’s a nostalgic longing for it.
I think this is a powerful sentiment among the least engaged partisans and voters. And I think Biden is right to keep that card in his hand. I think he’s playing it at the wrong time. But his instinct, I think, is sound. I think it also shows a willingness on his part to not campaign exclusively to Twitter, which is a problem with other Democratic campaigns.
Rich : I don’t think he is praising segregationists. By the way, Charlie, I think you’re saying you work with people you disagree with, but I think calling on Cory to apologize went too far. And also, I think Cory kind of nails on, maybe there’s some other interpretation, but it just seems like the most readily available interpretation is that he’s kind of joking about these guys calling African Americans “boy,” because he said Talmadge or Eastland, I forget which, called me “son” instead of “boy.” And I can see that really rubbing people the wrong way. So exit question to you, Charlie, are you more or less bullish on Joe Biden’s chances of winning the Democratic nomination than you were the day he announced?
Charlie : I am less bullish. I think if you add up everything we’ve seen over the last two or three weeks, he is a weaker candidate than he seemed when he announced.
Rich : Michael.
Michael : I mean, this is the Joe Biden verbal meltdown.
Rich : Yeah. It’s never a good sign when they got to keep you on prompter, and then they all talk about what you did wrong and why they are right, and all your advisers, why they are right and which celebrities were calling to lobby the candidate. It’s not a great look. Xan, more or less?
Alexandra : Definitely much less bullish. I think he started out with a lot of capital, and he’s just been finding a bunch of different ways to squander it.
Rich : So I’m going to say more because I was not very bullish at the outset, so I got more bullish based on his polling strength than I was. But that’s not a very high standard because I’ve always been a bit of a Biden skeptic, and he just seems soft. I don’t think he’s a great political performer. We’ll see the proof is in the pudding in the debates and the months we have left until Iowa.
Rich : And I think when your campaign is based by and large, almost entirely on electability, it’s really vulnerable. There’s no floor for you. And if you have some really horrific thermonuclear gaffe, if you seem to lose some exchange with Trump or you lose an early contest, and he’s only ahead by eight. And in Iowa, you can just sink to nothing really quickly.
Rich : So it’s that time of the podcast for a fierce Charlie Cooke–MBD internal conservative debate, which I assume we’ll at least get some of, and a discussion over the legislation introduced by Josh Hawley to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He wants Big Social Media, Internet platforms, Charlie, to have to prove basically to an FTC board or commission that their algorithms and other standards for monitoring their content and deciding what’s on the right side of the line and the wrong side of the line doesn’t have any political bias, if they’re going to maintain what Hawley characterizes as this exemption or as he puts it sometimes, a sweetheart deal that holds them harmless for content that is published on their platforms. What do you make of it?
Charlie : Well, it’s not a sweetheart deal. It’s not. And I think David French is correct about this. There is really no way of reconciling the statute. There’s no way of reconciling Section 230 with the idea that Facebook or Twitter are publishers in the way that National Review is or in which Random House is. Moderation is not the same thing as publication. My book was not moderated. Michael’s columns are not moderated. They’re edited and published. There is some moderation and some removal of posts on Facebook, but the vast majority are not. And indeed when they are moderated and removed, it is after the fact.
The idea that Section 230 can be neatly characterized here is wrong, I think. And I think David’s also right when he says that complying with rules on a website, on a social-media platform, does not render his speech the speech of the rule makers or of the moderators. There’s a big jump being made, and I understand why because I find it frustrating too, the way these companies choose to exercise their power, but that doesn’t change the fact that the jump is too big.
The second thing is, well, what are we going to do about it then, if we are so upset with Facebook and Twitter that we want to involve the government? It looks to me as if we’re going to turn the government into the censor. Censorship will always be capricious. It’s just too much activity for it not to be true of social media, but it was also true 100 years ago when the Espionage Act was being used. How many people stood out there in the square in Washington D.C., the 1916, ’17, ’18 argument against the American involvement in the war, and then went home that night. A lot. It’s capricious, and it’s going to be inconsistent, and it’s going to be subjective.
It is that at the moment, that’s frustrating. It will be that if we enable this board to look at the content on social media and to try to ensure that there is no political bias, it will add yet another feather to the bow of the executive branch and the administrative state. It will probably become an election issue. We’ll see differences between Republican administrations and Democratic administrations. I do not think that the solution to misbehaving or uncivil big business is to empower misbehaving or uncivil government, and that is what this law would do. I think it’s all conceived. I think it’s premised upon a big jump in logic, and I hope it is defeated as a result.
Michael : [ inaudible 00:33:30 ]. So Hawley’s bill, the problem with it, I take some of the criticism Charlie has that Hawley in some ways has mischaracterized section 230. In one way, the bill doesn’t go far enough. The government’s appropriate response to an enormous unaccountable spy agency that’s launching a currency that it wants to compete with the U.S. dollar is to nuke it from space, and the fallout should land wherever it does across California, I don’t care anymore.
My cards on the table, I think Facebook is extremely harmful and dangerous. I think it’s dangerous in the way it collects information. I think it’s dangerous in the way it concentrates that information in a way that makes the data pile almost like nuclear waste that has to be regulated. As far as the rules under which it publishes, I would argue that Hawley’s solution here is not exactly right, but his instincts that there is a conservative instinct that would be suspicious of Facebook’s power over the public square over which it’s taken so much of the space, which is that 230 effectively gives a business model on the Internet the ability to publish and compete on different rules than other media with which it’s competing.
It’s kind of perfect regulatory arbitrage by Facebook to have speech for which it is not responsible, but from which it is licensed to profit forever. And of course, it’s great too that they’re not legally responsible, so they can effectively republish on their news feeds through their algorithms, making these decisions, all the gossip tattles, slander or whatever that would be illegal to publish in National Review .
Charlie : Do they publish it or do they host it passively?
Michael : I mean, that is the other good question, right? Is that —
Charlie : But if I go out into the town square, and I live with somebody, that’s not the town’s fault. If there would be any lawsuit that arose from that it would be against me.
Michael : But there is a decision being made to not only . . . See, what is interesting here is there are a bunch of debates, like is it republishing, right? So if I take the libels and slanders that someone says in the town square, I photograph and videotape it and then mash it up into my own collage, video collage and then publish that, am I just a host of what has happened? I mean —
Charlie : You’re the one in that circumstance, Michael, who would be liable, not the social-media platform on which you were presumably posted. What I’m saying is that the town’s square analogy is important because if you go out into the town square where you live and start rambling, maybe even start libeling, slandering somebody, and then I call up the town and say, “There’s a guy in your square that’s saying the most outrageous things. He knows they’re not true. They’re determined only to hurt and to damage.” The town might credibly say to me, “Well, we don’t know anything about this guy. We didn’t know that he was there. We don’t have policemen standing all the time. We don’t have lawyers standing in the square,” which is, of course, what Facebook would correctly say because there is not anybody sitting there reading every Facebook post. That can’t happen.
Michael : I agree.
Charlie : They can still go after you if you film it and give it to a lawyer.
Michael : I agree. However, there is this . . . I mean, my objection, I think David may be totally right on the law, but my objection is kind of almost a primordial conservative objection to power without responsibility or accountability. Facebook effectively now has a license in the media business have published and profit off of every bit of gossip, tattle, personal drama in your social circle —
Charlie : But this is the —
Michael : . . . which naturally it shows eyeballs, right, cause it’s kind of degrading content that a normal institution wouldn’t publish, and it profits from this, sells advertising against this, the newspaper industry is destroyed. All the traditional institutions that grew up with democracies are being eaten away by this, and there’s nothing we can do about it. And further —
Charlie : What do you mean by license? Because I look at it and I see it doing some of those things, albeit not actively. I’m not sure what you mean by license, and I think that matters.
Michael : How do you mean? I mean, these regulations —
Charlie : Well, at least, it’s licensed. When you license something, you endorse it. If you give somebody a concealed-carry license, you’re saying that you as the state agree that they fulfill the necessary preconditions to carry a gun. What do you mean by a license?
Rich : In the absence of 230, they couldn’t do this. They just be liable for everything. So that’s how it’s seen by the law —
Charlie : So Michael sees 230 as a government sanction.
Michael : Well, this regulation, the way it was, I’m not sure it was intended to create Facebooks, I think it was intended to protect hosting services, server businesses, and others that host content that has things like this. I don’t think it anticipated what Facebook would become or what Twitter has become. That’s fine. Of course, it hasn’t. I’m not sure that we have a great solution for this consonant with the First Amendment besides the nuclear bomb, of course, which doesn’t violate anything.
But the other argument I want to get rid of or at least want to take a swipe at is an argument some people have made that, okay, well, 230 says the individual users’ speech is the user speech on Facebook and they can be held liable for it, but Facebook can’t. And the algorithms that Facebook uses to republish this in a dynamically created news feed or whenever, the software that governs that is Facebook’s free speech.
Now, there’s some software that’s clearly free speech, right? If you write an HTML page that generates italics around text, that is a kind of speech. But I’m worried that this argument that basically software running on the Internet is free speech is sort of like saying, “Well, you can make a sculpture out of steel, so bridges are artistic and . . .”
Charlie : We do expect the government, for example, to treat printing presses as protected by the First Amendment because they enable speech. You can’t burn ink around the First Amendment.
Michael : I’m not saying being —
Charlie : I know you’re not, I’m just asking quite where that’s going.
Michael : I’m not asking being servers space. But we have had regulations of media spaces that are intended to open up debate, right, and that was 230’s intent, was to keep the Internet open for its own kind of First Amendment space where institutions that grow up on the Internet can set their own rules and the government’s not going to tell them exactly what to do.
Rich : So let me ask you, Charlie, just as a matter of principle, following on from that point from Michael. Let’s say in theory, dispense with any prudential concerns of whether the government would actually do this or whether the government will create its own distortions and biases. But if in theory, the government could say to these big social-media platforms, in order to enjoy 230 protections, you must adopt this standard for policing speech on your platforms, and it’s written by David French. It’s the David French standard that he’s advocated that is drawn directly from the First Amendment jurisprudence. Would you be okay with that or would you consider that just in principle wrong, even though its effect would be to protect and extend free speech on these platforms?
Charlie : Well, I think that still has two problems. One is that it’s built on a misunderstanding of what 230 is supposed to do, which is to make sure that the right person is blamed if they write something libelous or say something slanderous. And I understand the hypothetical, but I’m not sure that one can have a hypothetical around that because I don’t think that there is such a thing as a bill that could achieve those ends even if it were written by David. Even if I’ve got to write it, if I were king for a day, I simply don’t think that you can write —
Rich : But we wrote down the First Amendment. I mean, we wrote down 230, right, which I assume you support, and thanks, actually protection.
Charlie : Well, 230 is different than the First Amendment. And what 230 does is say, you can’t prosecute the forum or you can’t sue the forum. You have to sue the speaker. It doesn’t protect the speaker.
Rich : My point is you seem to be saying on principle, there’s no way for a government to write a law that enables or creates a space for speech. But we obviously have, or we have robust free speech in this country. So I don’t think it’s in principle impossible to be done for anyone to do it.
Charlie : I mean, I suppose if the laws said the First Amendment now applies to Facebook. So Facebook would be unable to remove anything unless it could be reasonably be construed as inciting violence imminently, then that could work. Yes.
Michael : I mean —
Charlie : But it’s still a category mistake because Facebook is not the government.
Michael : I think, my worry is that the fundamental separation we’re making where this law allows a company to profit off of other people doing speech that could be criminally liable. And remember, the speech that is unprotected, this is a very extremely narrow category in American law. This is not like everyone who uses . . . I mean, relatively few people who use Facebook get arrested for what they write on it today, and Facebook wouldn’t . . . I mean, I suppose I just don’t see the social calamity from making Facebook as responsible for what its algorithm republishes across tens of millions of news feeds for profit to sell ads against, to making them as responsible as a normal publisher.
Charlie : But how on earth could they possibly, Michael, enforce that? I don’t know the numbers, but there are billions of tweets. There must be billions of Facebook posts, maybe every day. Well, there must be because it’s more than a billion users.
Michael : I agree.
Charlie : How on earth could it ever police it? You end up with a capricious, probably corrupt, subjective mess. People who are connected would get any speech they didn’t like removed first, people who wrote things that were on the margins would find themselves not only in trouble but possibly then sued.
Michael : I agree that making them responsible for what appears on their site and what they republish across like a bazillion-dollar infrastructure wouldn’t, in fact, be extremely dangerous to their business model. But I’m not sure that their business model should exist.
Charlie : The things that [inaudible 00:46:51] or moderate here is he doesn’t think they —
Michael : I mean, [inaudible 00:46:55], it does exist, but it’s just, like I said, it is based on this fundamental divorce between who is profiting from the speech and who’s generating the speech. It’s like it’s a machine. It’s like a legal hole for the kind of accountability that normal publishers and people have —
Charlie : But there’s a big difference —
Michael : And it’s a hole in which they make a bazillion dollars of profit.
Rich : We better move on here. So Charlie, exit question to you, the Hawley legislation, even if it doesn’t pass, and it won’t, will succeed in making these social-media companies more mindful of conservative concerns about their biases, yes or no?
Charlie : No.
Rich : MBD.
Michael : No. They’re responding to what Merkel and the elite media and other political class, their anger from 2016, Brexit, and Trump, and populism, and they’re going to continue to increase the pace of shadow banning and downgrading content that they think, if it propagates across their platform, will lead to the wrong electoral results.
Rich : Xan, who so patiently waited out this argument?
Alexandra : No, I don’t think it will. And for what it’s worth, I think Charlie and David are right. I have more thoughts, I’ll share some other day.
Rich : I’d say maybe a speck, yes, like the tiniest speck, yes. But what sort of clinched this for me is that here’s Jack Dorsey, has this company that is under fire from really prominent conservatives for allegedly being biased, and goes out of his way to sign on to a extremely pro-abortion, and I’m using that phrase advisedly — it wasn’t pro-abortion rights, it was pro-abortion advertisement in the New York Times , which just goes to the political and social [inaudible 00:48:56], all these guys swimming and can’t get away from even if they wanted to try, and they don’t seem to want to try very hard or at all.
Rich : So let’s hit a couple of topics before we run out of time here. Just exit-question style, and I’ll go to you first, Xan. How long, and the context of this is AOC’s statement about concentration camps at the border, how long will her ignorant and obnoxious statements garner as much attention as they do today? For another year, for another two years, for another three years, forever?
Alexandra : I would say probably for another two years. And I guess that’s just sort of because I think the glow will wear off, and we’ll find some people find something else to pay attention to. But I think for now she’s kind of the rising star on the left. And while the primary, the hustle and bustle, is going on, no one has anything better to talk about.
Rich : Charlie, go.
Charlie : I think it will last until the Democrats win a presidential election.
Rich : MBD.
Michael : I adopt Charlie’s answer.
Rich : Yeah, I think it will wear off at some point here. It’ll get a little old. And especially if once there’s a nominee and especially if there is an actual Democratic president, it will end. In the meantime, it’s entertaining in its way, and at the same time it’s extremely depressing and boring. So let’s hit one other thing. MBD, in your view, we will hit an Iranian ship or other military facilities sometime in the next six weeks. Yes or no?
Michael : Yes."

2005 —In an act of judicial passivism, a five-justice majority, in an opinion by Justice Stevens, rules in Kelo v. City of New London that the City of New London satisfies the “public use” requirement of the Takings Clause when it takes private property from homeowners in order to transfer it to another private owner as part of an economic redevelopment plan. The majority correctly observes that its diluted reading of “public use” to mean “public purpose” accords with precedent, but its bare assertion that a genuine “public use” test “proved to be impractical given the diverse and always evolving needs of society” shows how unreliable the “living Constitution” is as a guarantor of rights not favored by the elites from which the Court’s members are drawn.

It’s hardly a surprise that justices who willy-nilly invent rights that aren’t in the Constitution ignore rights that are. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Campus Free-Speech Protections: New South Dakota Law Could Be Model for Nation | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Frederick M. Hess,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/south-dakota-campus-free-speech-protections/,"A new law strengthening First Amendment protections at state universities is among the first to tackle this growing problem.
T his Wednesday, June 26, the South Dakota Board of Regents will meet to discuss the implementation of one of the nation’s more forceful efforts to protect intellectual diversity and free inquiry on campus. Earlier this year, South Dakota enacted a new law intended to counter the stifling orthodoxy that weighs so heavily on the nation’s colleges and universities. The bill, S.D. 1087 , requires public institutions of higher education in the state to “maintain a commitment to the principles of free expression” and to foster civil, intellectually diverse environments. It protects student organizations from viewpoint discrimination, requires an annual report to the legislature on campus intellectual diversity and speech suppression, and safeguards the use of outdoor spaces as forums for free speech. Advertisement Advertisement
Unsurprisingly, the bill has been dismissed by the higher-education industry as burdensome and unnecessary. A member of the South Dakota Board of Technical Education objected , “It’s pretty certain to increase costly bureaucratic mandates . . . it’s likely to lead to lawsuits . . . [and] I don’t think it has much of an effect on campus speech at all.” Student government leaders from the University of South Dakota (USD) and South Dakota State (SDSU) testified in opposition to the bill, which the president of USD’s student government association called, “an attempt at a solution to a problem that does not exist.”
And yet, lots of evidence in recent years has suggested that there is a problem on South Dakota campuses. Advertisement
In 2015, USD shut down an on-campus viewing of a film on the “honor killing” of women in Islamic cultures, suggesting that the documentary was an example of anti-Muslim bigotry. In 2018, when a student at South Dakota State hung an American flag in his dorm to commemorate family friends who died in the 9/11 terror attacks, university officials removed the flag. The student told reporters that when he protested, he was informed “that the school’s speech policy was deliberately vague to allow for decisions based on the feelings of the community.” And just this February, the USD administration urged the hosts of a campus “Hawaiian Day” party to change the theme , deeming it insensitive to indigenous Hawaiians. When concerns about administrative bullying were raised, USD legal counsel A.J. Franken archly opined, “Students have the right to speak. They also have the right to refrain from speech.”
South Dakota’s experience is a microcosm of what’s unfolding across American higher education, and the resolution and implementation of S.D. 1087 may have national implications. After all, across the land, liberal faculty members outnumber their conservative counterparts five to one , and the disparity is starker still when it comes to the social sciences and humanities. Such a lack of intellectual diversity affects who gets hired at colleges and universities, who enjoys the platform provided by prestigious institutions, what gets researched, and what gets taught. As Luana Maroji recently pointed out in The Atlantic , when campus communities are thoroughly in the grasp of particular views and values, a natural result is self-censorship that is bound to affect what professors teach and how they teach it.
Indeed, in too many cases, the academy has abandoned its core values of free inquiry in the service of ever-more-rigid political dogmas. President Harry Truman, that voice of an older, more sensible left, made those values plain in his 1948 address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science:
Continuous research . . . may be made impossible by the creation of an atmosphere in which no man feels safe against the public airing of unfounded rumors, gossip, and vilification. Such an atmosphere is un-American . . . Science means a method of thought. That method is characterized by open-mindedness, honesty, perseverance, and, above all, by an unflinching passion for knowledge and truth.
Not only has the increasing dominance of certain views and values within the academy raised questions about the ability of campuses to support free inquiry, but research suggests that the quality of scholarly work suffers when the academics producing it all think alike. Educators, like anyone else, can fall prey to confirmation bias — and the more ideologically uniform a research environment, the greater the risk of that bias going unnoticed and tainting results.
The implementation of S.D. 1087 presents a number of practical challenges, but also a great opportunity. The goal, after all, is to encourage principled academics to defend their own core values against the efforts of an ideological vanguard of administrators, faculty, and students. Advertisement"
"An Exemplary Journalist: Mike Brown, Editor of the Rockdale Reporter | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/mike-brown-small-town-newspaperman-exemplary-journalist/,"June 24, 2019 6:30 AM Mike Brown in front of the office (Jay Nordlinger) The exemplary Mike Brown of the Rockdale Reporter
Editor’s Note : The below is an expansion of an article that Mr. Nordlinger had in the June 24, 2019, issue of National Review . This expansion is written in the style of his Impromptus column, with bullet points and some photos.
L ocal papers are dying, fast. Some are migrating to the Web, in some fashion. Many are simply … bidding farewell. The Rockdale Reporter is hanging on. Its editor, Mike Brown, is one of my favorite journalists in America. One of my favorite writers. I have often quoted him, over the years. In my view, he exemplifies what a newspaperman ought to be. Advertisement Advertisement
• Rockdale is in Central Texas, about 160 miles south of Dallas. The town used to be 60 miles from Austin, says Mike, but Austin has spread out so much, the distance is now 48. Rockdale is in Milam County, whose seat is Cameron. The county is named after Ben Milam, a military hero of the Texas Revolution (1835–36).
• The population of Rockdale is 5,500, and the Reporter ’s circulation is 3,500. Not all of those readers are Rockdale people. The paper goes out to nearby communities and even beyond. It is a weekly, the Reporter — always has been, since its founding in the 19th century. The paper comes out on Wednesdays. Many readers don’t want to wait for a copy to arrive by mail — so they come in to the Reporter ’s office to buy one (for a dollar).
• The office is a museum, in part: There is old, outdated equipment around, just for show, just for fun. There is a Linotype machine, for example, and a few job presses. Have a look at a shelf or three:
And here’s Mike Brown in front of some back issues:
Every now and then, a police scanner squawks, just as it’s supposed to in a newspaper office, or many of them.
As you might guess, Mike knows everyone in town, pretty much, and they know him. Is it ever awkward to report on them, when they get arrested or something of that nature? Maybe, yes, but Mike, a professional, does it anyway. He is the genuine article (and writes them). Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
• Rockdale was incorporated in 1874, once a railroad had reached the area. When in town, you might like to visit the Rockdale International & Great Northern Railroad Depot & Museum . Trains still come through here, whistling loudly (I can attest). But they no longer stop.
Two prominent founding citizens were the Loewenstein brothers, Benjamin and Joseph, Jewish merchants. They started with tents and grew from there — a classic American story. They were of special help to black residents — again, classic.
• In November 1920, Warren G. Harding, the president-elect, stopped in Rockdale on his train. He was headed for the Panama Canal Zone. Have an excerpt from the account in the Reporter :
Mrs. Harding, the Nation’s coming “first lady,” also appeared on the platform with her husband and graciously greeted the people. She seemed particularly pleased with the college yells given for her husband by the Rockdale High School boys present, and when she thanked them for their courtesy they responded with another battery of “rahs” for Mrs. Harding herself, this drawing forth from her the remark, “Boys, that’s mighty sweet of you.”
• Ceramic tigers dot this town. Why’s that? The high-school sports teams are the Tigers. Mike Brown figures that 60 percent of the high schools in Texas are either the Tigers, the Eagles, or the Bulldogs. “We cover three teams, and one of them is the Tigers, one is the Eagles, and the other is the Bulldogs.” That’d be Rockdale, Milano, and Thorndale.
Have a tiger — a Rockdale Tiger:
• We wait a long, long time before we can cross Main Street. Traffic is fierce. “I live in Manhattan,” I tell Mike, “and I work near Times Square, and the traffic is not nearly as bad there.”
I exaggerate a bit — but just a bit. Advertisement
• Twisted Scissors is an unusual, interesting establishment: a “salon and boutique.” Get your hair cut and shop for select products. I can’t pretend to be a restaurant connoisseur when it comes to Rockdale, but I can highly recommend Coronas Mexican.
• The library is the Lucy Hill Patterson Memorial Library, donated by her son, George Hill Patterson, who was a prominent Hollywood neurosurgeon. His mother had lived in Rockdale briefly, when a child. He was looking for a way to honor her.
The library has a collection of rare books — Dr. Patterson’s — and there is also an interesting letter. Patterson wanted Margaret Mitchell’s autograph. (She is the author of Gone with the Wind .) He wrote to her to ask for it, and she replied that she did not give out autographs — but, of course, signed the letter. Advertisement
Mike Brown’s wife, Sue, works at the library. When I tell her I’m a fan of Mike’s, she has to concede, “Yeah, he’s awesome.” (He thinks the same of her, clearly.) Advertisement
• He was born in 1950 — not in Rockdale but in Alvin, a town south of Houston. Its other claim to fame is Nolan Ryan, the pitcher (born three years before Mike). The Browns moved to Rockdale when Mike was two. His father was a minister and his mother a music teacher.
As a kid, Mike loved to read the newspaper: the Reporter and also the Houston Press , “a scandal sheet,” he says. He also loved astronomy (and still does). When he was a sophomore in high school, he and his dad built a telescope.
But back to journalism: During his senior year, Mike drew up a parody, the Rockhead Reporter . In it, he poked a little fun at some of his teachers. One teacher, a civics teacher, was none too pleased, and he and Mike went down to the principal’s office to have a talk.
There was no great harm, however — at least to Mike. That very year, he won the civics award. Advertisement
• He entered the University of Texas in 1968, that radical year — the year of the barricades. His parents drove him over to Austin, and he checked into Brackenridge Hall. He worked at the undergraduate library, shelving periodicals, and one day he came across a magazine with a blue border. “I looked inside and thought two things,” he says. “First, these people think like I do. And second, that’s really good writing.”
He subscribed to the magazine — National Review — and eventually got his first two issues. They arrived in non-consecutive order. And the cover of one of them had been torn off. Left-wing sabotage at the post office or just a mishap? Mike, generously, suspects the latter.
Over the years, he would enjoy reading such writers as Keith Mano and John Greenway (an English-born folklorist). And, of course, he greatly admired William F. Buckley Jr. “I devoured everything he wrote.”
One afternoon, when Mike was a senior, WFB came to the university to speak. “The talk was in the old Gregory Gym,” Mike remembers, “and it was packed. Standing-room only.” How did WFB do? “He was every bit as impressive in person as he was on the page. He showed that you could be both conservative and cool. And that was a big thing.” Advertisement
The next day, the Daily Texan — UT’s paper — had a report. It showed a picture of WFB, with the (apt) caption “Beaming, Biting Buckley.” “The student audience seemed attentive despite stifling heat inside the gym.”
In due course, Mike wrote to WFB — as one did. And WFB wrote him back — as he did.
• Mike loved astronomy, but he majored in that other love, English. His favorite poet is Yeats. Mike is smitten with words, as writers tend to be. He is also naturally humorous — and does not disdain puns.
Some years ago, Truman Lamb was succeeded by Joel Pigg in a key agricultural position. A number of headlines suggest themselves. Mike Brown chose “Pigg Replaces Lamb as County Agent, No Kidding.”
He tells me a story, related to humor. One night, he was very low and doing some laundry. The Carol Burnett Show came on. And he laughed and laughed. “I would like to meet Carol Burnett someday to tell her what she already knows: what a gift she has, and how important it is to people. It’s important to laugh.”
• Mike started at the Rockdale Reporter on this wise: In 1973, he called up the paper and said, “Would you like a story about Comet Kohoutek?” The lady on the other end of the line said, “What the hell is that?” It was the hottest thing in the sky, named after Lubos Kohoutek, a Czech astronomer. Mike wrote the story. Then he did further freelancing for the paper.
In 1974, Rockdale marked its centenary with a two-week-long party. The Reporter hired Mike on a part-time basis to cover this party. When it was over, they hired him full time. He has been at the paper ever since. He became its editor in 1998. Advertisement
When you start out at a community newspaper, you do everything — including those fundamentals, birth notices and obituaries. The former used to be called “stork reports,” Mike notes. “That was so long ago, the people who had the babies were married.”
The truth is, Mike still does everything, or virtually everything: editing, of course, and writing and picture-taking — the works.
• For over a century, the paper has been in the same hands — those of the Cooke family, which owns it. Mike apprenticed under J. W. “Bill” Cooke, the grandson of the first Cooke owner. “He taught me everything I know,” says Mike, “so you can blame him .”
• The Reporter once had a motto that went, “The only newspaper in the world that cares about Rockdale.” There is potency in that motto. Who cares about your city-council meetings and funerals and school sports and ice-cream socials except your local paper, if you have one?
I’m looking at a headline on the front page of the Reporter that says, “Legion plans turkey shoot for Sunday.” (“Food and drinks will be available at 11 a.m. with shooting starting at noon.”) On the front page of the sports section, I’m told that Rockdale High’s soccer team — the boys team — has had a “historic season.”
There is one letter to the editor, in which the writer, Billy Eugene Strelsky, responds to a column concerning black diamond watermelons and yellow catfish. He also takes the opportunity to correct a quotation — a Biblical quotation — from a previous letter of his. “I tried to quote this from memory, and I got it wrong. I do apologize for getting God’s Holy Word wrong.”
Mr. Strelsky would make a good journalist himself — correction is important.
The Rockdale Reporter contains serious news, all too. Indeed, the front page of the edition I’m looking at tells of a man on Death Row. Years ago, he attended Rockdale High.
“We’ve had three murders in the last two years,” Mike Brown tells me. One murder was of a child. The accused is a person “transitioning” from male to female. When Mike writes about the case, and refers to the accused, he avoids pronouns altogether.
• The Reporter persists, and so does Rockdale, but times are not easy — for either the paper or the town. “Great things happen here,” is the city motto. Yet Rockdale has had the misfortune of losing its two biggest employers in the space of ten years: a smelting facility and a power plant. The paper is thinner than it was, with fewer ads.
When Mike talks to students, he gives them a quiz: “What is news?” They come up with various answers, some of them quite good. Mike then quips, “The news in a newspaper is the stuff around the ads.” Without them, no newspaper.
• I ask Mike, “How many people work at the Reporter ?” “About half of us,” he quips. The real answer is eight or so — depending on how you count (and not all of these are full time). I ask Mike, “Do you feel you’re the last of the Mohicans, the end of the line?” He calls up a memory of his grandmother.
“She lived in Kansas City, and she lived to be 97. When she found out that I was working for a newspaper, she said, ‘I’m so glad. Newspapers kept going right through the Depression.’ No matter how poor her family was, they always took the Kansas City Times and the afternoon paper, the Kansas City Star . They couldn’t do without them. So, I’m hanging in there with my late grandmother.”
• Whatever the future may be, Mike Brown has had a very rewarding, deeply satisfying career, he says. The best part about it has been getting to know a variety of people — “people I never would have met but for this job.”
• He is very patriotic, but not in a jingo way. Far from it. Indeed, he says it’s not for him to call himself a patriot. He gives me a story. “When my dad and I built that telescope, during my sophomore year, I told a friend of mine, ‘I’m an astronomer.’ My friend said, ‘It takes more than that.’”
For some 20 years, Mike gave a Fourth of July speech at a large picnic. One time, he got a compliment from a lady he had known for years — the mother of friends of his. Beaming, she grasped his hand and said, “Mike Brown, until tonight, I never knew you had any sense.” Advertisement
• Undoubtedly, he has reported many stories that have meant a lot to him. Asked to cite one, he names a story from 2004. In December of that year, he went to Fort Hood, 70 miles away, where soldiers were returning from Iraq. One of them was a teacher at Rockdale High, Art Free.
“There was no formal ceremony,” Mike wrote. The soldiers filed into a gym and their commander told them, “I have but one order for you: Dismissed!”
“Then all heaven broke loose,” wrote Mike. “A screaming, crying wave of families roared out of the bleachers and met an oncoming wave of soldiers. The first wave included Lt. Col. Free’s wife, Susan; their children, Jere, Patti, and Erin; and his parents, Woody and Joan.”"

1992 —In Lee v. Weisman , a 5-justice majority, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy, rules that a nondenominational prayer delivered by a rabbi at a public school graduation ceremony violated the Establishment Clause because students who chose to attend the ceremony were psychologically coerced “to stand as a group or, at least, maintain respectful silence” during the prayer. Who knew that Judaism had briefly become the established religion of Providence, Rhode Island? Advertisement Advertisement
In dissent, Justice Scalia observes that the majority “lays waste a tradition that is as old as public school graduation ceremonies themselves, and that is a component of an even more longstanding American tradition of nonsectarian prayer to God at public celebrations generally.” Scalia states: “I find it a sufficient embarrassment that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence regarding holiday displays has come to ‘requir[e] scrutiny more commonly associated with interior decorators than with the judiciary.’ But interior decorating is a rock-hard science compared to psychology practiced by amateurs.” Further: “I see no warrant for expanding the concept of coercion beyond acts backed by threat of penalty—a brand of coercion that, happily, is readily discernible to those of us who have made a career of reading the disciples of Blackstone, rather than of Freud.”

Washington Post & 'Rational Suicide' -- Paper Boosts Elderly Rational Suicide | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-washington-post-boosts-elderly-rational-suicide/,"June 24, 2019 12:33 PM The Washington Post Company building in Washington, D.C., 2012 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)
The media abandoned unequivocal opposition to suicide long ago. Most publications editorially support legalizing assisted suicide, and the news sides — such as the New York Times and the Associated Press — have even gone so far as to run stories lauding suicide/euthanasia “ parties, ” at which people celebrate the life of the host just before their death by overdose or lethal injection. PARTAY! Friends and family were so supportive, don’t you know!
Now, the Washington Post moves the ball another few yards downfield in a story from Kaiser Health News that furthers the normalization of “ rational suicide ” for the elderly by treating it as a respectable topic of discussion–rather than lamenting suicidal desires by oldsters as a serious mental health problem requiring unequivocal prevention efforts by a loving community. From, “ As Seniors Go into Twilight Years, Some of them Privately Mull Rational Suicide : ” New Jersey recently became the eighth state to allow medical aid in dying, which permits some patients to get a doctor’s prescription for lethal drugs. That method is restricted, however, to people with a terminal condition who are mentally competent and expected to die within six months. Patients who aren’t eligible for those laws would have to go to an “underground practice” to get lethal medication, said Timothy Quill, a palliative care physician at the University of Rochester School of Medicine. Quill became famous in the 1990s for publicly admitting that he gave a 45-year-old patient with leukemia sleeping pills so she could end her life. He said he has done so with only one other patient. Quill said he considers suicide one option he may choose as he ages: “I would probably be a classic [case] — I’m used to being in charge of my life.” He said he might be able to adapt to a situation in which he became entirely dependent on the care of others, “but I’d like to be able to make that be a choice as opposed to a necessity.” Quill is deemed a hero in assisted-suicide circles. He’s apparently now expanding his advocacy to include people who are not terminally ill who want to commit “ rational suicide. ” And why not? Once we accept assisted suicide for the terminally ill, why not others who want to escape current or feared future suffering? Shouldn’t they also have the right to die in the “ time and manner of their own choosing? ” In fact, this story reminds me very much of the pieces ubiquitously published about assisted suicide in the 1990s, which would present quotes from opponents (often, yours truly), but focused the emotional heart of the narrative on people who just wanted to “ die on their own terms ” and the compassionate doctors who wanted to help them, but couldn’t because of the cruel laws. Indeed, the the emotional heart of this story is on seniors who want to kill themselves before falling ill or becoming debilitated:"

One thing the gang are at pains to make clear, as they lovingly cover the scope of The Beach Boys’ first five years of existence (from 1961 through to Pet Sounds ) is that, even given the Legend of Brian Wilson, Lonely Genius, the band is still somehow underrated compared to their peers. If you thought Brian Wilson’s talents were more or less limited to Pet Sounds , “that lost album,” and a few songs about cars and surfing, then this show will hopefully be an education for you in what the sudden flowering of musical genius sounds like. If you already know just how good The Beach Boys were, then this show will be a glorious celebration. Catch a wave, ho-daddys. "

On Monday morning, Florida senator Marco Rubio sent a letter to the Trump administration calling on the United States to render aid to a woman in the United Kingdom who was ordered by a judge to undergo a forced late-term abortion.
“I write with grave concern about the case of a 22-week pregnant Catholic woman with developmental disabilities in the United Kingdom who — against the wishes of her and her Nigerian-origin mother — is being required by a British court to undergo a forced late-term abortion, in what I believe to be a clear human rights violation,” Rubio wrote in a letter addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and DHS acting secretary Kevin McAleneen. “I urge your Departments to quickly investigate this case and, within all applicable laws and regulations, to offer assistance to her and her mother in seeking alternative medical care either in the United States through a temporary non-immigrant visa or through humanitarian parole for a temporary period due to this urgent humanitarian emergency, or at medical facilities in a third country that will not compel her to undergo a forced late-term abortion.”
On Friday, the Press Association and the Catholic News Agency first reported that an unidentified woman was being ordered by British judge Nathalie Lieven to undergo a forced late-term abortion because the pregnant woman, who is mentally disabled, could suffer from mental distress if the child were put up for adoption."

Last week, I attended the Coptic solidarity conference in Washington, D.C. The title of the two-day long conference was “Egypt’s Copts: Prospects of Equality in a Radicalized Society.” The conference was appropriately scheduled in time for this week, which is Religious Freedom Week, and those in attendance came from all backgrounds. There were Coptic Americans, government representatives, religious-freedom advocates, and civilians interested in learning about the status of Copts in Egyptian society — a society that is more often than not treating Copts as second-class citizens rather than as fellow Egyptians.

Cory Doctorow's New York Times Column -- Lobbying Is Not the Decoder Ring of American Politics | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D.

Cory Doctorow has written a very silly column in the New York Times , in the form of an op-ed from the future. From the time-traveling column, we learn that efforts to regulate social-media platforms and other technology companies served mainly to stifle online political discussion, did little to reduce the communication of unpopular political ideas, etc. Doctorow, a science-fiction writer, presents no moral case against censorship — it is, we apparently are to conclude, mainly a practical technological problem.

He spells out another possible mode of regulation that he thinks might have proved more effective: More stringent antimonopoly enforcement, he writes, “would have challenged the Big Tech giants, eroding their profits and giving them less lobbying capital.”
There are many people who believe that the world of politics looks the way it does because of spending on lobbying. But that is not the case. Apple, for example, spends almost nothing on lobbying: less than $7 million in 2018 . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by way of comparison, spent almost $95 million. Relatively big-spending Alphabet, the only of the Internet giants among the top-ten lobbying spenders last year, spent about $21 million . Facebook spent $12.6 million . Add those three firms up and you end up with just a little over half of what the National Association of Realtors spent on lobbying in the same year . Stay Updated with NR Daily

The tech firms would have to up the spending quite a bit before catching up to George Soros’s Open Society Policy Center or the American Hospital Association. "
"Partisan & Political Divide Study: Most Educated, Politically Engaged Americans Know Least about Opponents | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,David French,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/americas-most-educated-engaged-citizens-are-making-politics-worse/,"Follow David French on Twitter June 24, 2019 2:22 PM President Donald Trump at the State of the Union shakes hands with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in Washington, D.C., February 5, 2019. (Doug Mills/The New York Times/Pool via Reuters) It turns out that the people who care the most about politics have the least understanding of their political opponents.
T he More in Common project has just released the results of its latest deep dive into American polarization, and they make for a deeply discouraging read.
It turns out that most Americans have fundamentally mistaken notions about their political opponents, consistently believing that they are substantially more extreme than they really are. For example, Democrats are far less likely to support open borders, far more likely to support private ownership of firearms, and far more friendly to police than Republicans believe they are. Republicans support controlled immigration far more than Democrats believe, and an overwhelming majority believe that racism and sexism still exist in the United States. Advertisement Advertisement
At one level, these conclusions are hardly surprising. After all, previous research has shown that Democrats and Republicans have wildly false notions of the demographic make-up of the opposing party. Democrats think Republicans are older, richer, and more Evangelical than they really are. Republicans think Democrats are more secular, black, and gay than they really are.
And more broadly, surveys showing civic ignorance are squarely in the dog-bites-man category. Spend nine seconds on Google, and you can find depressing studies that show “ more than half of Americans can’t name a single Supreme Court justice ” or more Americans know that Randy Jackson was a judge on American Idol than know John Roberts is the chief justice of the United States.
But the More in Common survey is different, and disturbing: It shows that political ignorance about the opposing party is driven by America’s most engaged and (at least on the left) most highly educated citizens. In other words, the more you pay attention to political media, the less likely you are to understand the true beliefs of your political opponents.
The survey found that “the most partisan, politically active Americans – a group we call the ‘Wings’ – have deeply distorted perceptions of the other side.” Crucially, “politically disengaged” Americans were “fully three times more accurate in their estimates of political opponents” than those on the right and left edges of American politics:
But not all media are created alike. If you follow the much-derided (at least by the “wings”) broadcast news, you’ve likely got a more realistic view of the other side. If you follow the partisan outlets that often purport to tell the “real story” about your opponents, you’re likely wildly wrong:
Then there’s the education factor. Better-educated Republicans don’t gain materially improved understanding of Democrats, while Democrats’ knowledge of Republican beliefs “actually gets worse with every additional degree they earn.” Moreover, “this effect is so strong that Democrats without a high school diploma are three times more accurate than those with a postgraduate degree” in their perceptions of Republicans.
Spend any time reading online political commentary — or hearing campus progressives describe American conservatives — and these findings make intuitive sense. Going all the way back to my law-school days, I consistently heard descriptions of Republicans, Evangelicals, and conservatives that made little sense to me, a lifelong Republican, Evangelical, and conservative. It was as if I was hearing anthropologists describe primitive tribes from faraway places rather than my neighbors and fellow citizens. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The problem is compounded by both social media and clickbait journalism. Perhaps the single best term to describe modern discourse was coined by Mother Jones writer Kevin Drum more than a decade ago. The term is “nutpicking” and it refers to the practice of finding an extreme and outrageous member of a group and attempting to make them emblematic of the whole. Entire business models are built on nutpicking, and it’s constantly justified as the practice of finding the person who will say what the other side “really thinks” — or, to use a phrase popular on parts of the left, the person who says “the quiet part out loud.”
Let’s take two real-life examples that I’ve dealt with recently in my own work. For the better part of a month I’ve been fending off criticisms from people who demand to know why my political philosophy won’t shut down or inhibit something called “drag queen reading hour,” a series of events held at a handful of libraries across America attended by a truly insignificant numbers of Americans. The very existence of this voluntary association has been heralded, by these critics, as a sign of a cultural emergency that classical liberalism simply can’t handle. Advertisement
Conversely, I recently participated in a panel discussion at a fascinating and thought-provoking environmental conference in San Francisco. My panel was focused on the religion and the environment, and my role was to discuss Evangelical attitudes toward modern environmentalism. Advertisement
One of the panelists made an earnest and sincere case that it can be extremely difficult to work with religious groups in part because their beliefs can be so unscientific and strange — and as evidence he highlighted a person I’d never heard of who has exactly zero political influence over the Evangelical political movement. The person he cited had extreme ideas about the environment, and he was being “nutpicked,” used as emblematic of people of faith more generally.
So that’s where we are, and if you think the phenomenon doesn’t have a malignant effect on our national discourse, I’m going to show you one more chart. This is what Democrats and Republicans think of each other:"

The tax law enacted by Republicans at the end of 2017 capped the federal deduction for state and local taxes. Democrats, especially from high-tax states, want to lift the cap. Who would benefit? Based on the same methods Democrats usually use to judge the distribution of tax cuts, the answer is: Households that make more than a million dollars a year would get most of the benefit .

John Irving's Pro-Abortion Nonsense | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/john-irving-pro-abortion-nonsense-new-york-times/,"June 24, 2019 5:55 PM John Irving in 2002 (Michael Kooren/Reuters)
The novelist has put up a lot of easy targets in his New York Times op-ed . I am going to take aim at six of his points, starting with his strongest one.
First: Irving asserts that abortion was legal in our country from Puritan times until the 1840s, at least before “quickening.” That’s an overstatement. Courts disagreed about whether abortion before quickening was illegal, as did legal treatises. One of the later-nineteenth-century treatises argued that lack of knowledge of embryonic development had sometimes led authorities to use quickening as a distinction. Modern historians on both sides of the abortion divide have suggested that the distinction arose for evidentiary and not substantive reasons. Advertisement Advertisement
Second: Irving claims that we have no idea why doctors lobbied to make abortion illegal from the mid-nineteenth century onward, or why legislators agreed with them. There is actually plenty of historical material on this subject. See, for example, James Mohr’s book on it, which notes, “The nation’s regular doctors . . . defended the value of human life per se as an absolute.” Or Carl Degler’s, which reports that “during the Nineteenth century feminists and free lovers alike condemned abortion because it destroyed a human being.” Or go to source material such as the New York Times article from 1871 saying of abortion, “Thousands of human beings are thus murdered before they have seen the light of this world.” The basic reasoning behind the prohibitions on abortion is completely obvious, and you have to go to great lengths to pretend not to understand what it was and is.
Third: Irving takes it upon himself “to remind the Roman Catholic Church of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,” which supposedly mandates legal abortion by protecting religious liberty. (Apparently the Catholic church was much stronger in nineteenth-century America than anyone has previously imagined.) The condescension is ill-judged, considering that the Supreme Court, even while it has protected abortion, has never done so on religious-liberty grounds; during its most extensive consideration of the question, in Harris v. McRae (1980), six justices rejected the argument and the other three did not stick up for it; and only one justice has ever embraced it in the entire post-Roe history of the Court. Advertisement
Fourth: “In 1976, with the passing of the Hyde Amendment, prohibiting the use of federal funds for most abortions, opposition to abortion gained support among Republicans.” What is this sentence even supposed to mean? Are we supposed to think that the Hyde amendment passed because Republicans increasingly opposed abortion—in which case Irving has just presented a banality in subliterate fashion — or that Republicans increasingly opposed abortion because of the Hyde amendment?
