You can prove a negative and Mueller didn't find the goods. And there wasn't a crime to begin with so you had to have a pretty high bar for intent. However I do hope the dems listen to people like you and proceed with the impeachment path. It will spell disastor for the dems in 2020. To that point following today's interview on CNN, the usual gang of dem commentors were speculating that the dems will only impeach if they feel they can benefit politically from it. Which is exactly what we have come to expect from this party. All of this is based on political calcuation by the dems."

Mueller also clearly stated that he didn't bring criminal charges against Trump because he was following the DOJ rules on not indicting a sitting president but that congress had those powers where he did not. You should actually read the report and stop regurgitating Trumpian talking points. In no way did Mueller say there was nothing there. He said there were things there that might amount to a crime but since he couldn't haul Trump into court, he would not indict. And stop the silly lectures on political calculation and overreach. Your side does not have clean hands to presume to lecture. It's laughable really that you would accuse dems and ignore that your own side will put up with a criminal just to maintain power."

In the meantime, there are at least 4 other ongoing investigations that are not hampered by the DOJ rule about not indicting a sitting president. I'm on the fence with impeachment. On the one hand, the complicit GOP Senate will not impeach him so for the Democrats in the House to go forward on it at this point is a waste of time and resources. On the other hand, if we don't go forward and call for impeachment, I am sure they will use it against us to attempt to get him reelected.
