Sheriff Margaret Mims: ""There could be an MS-13 member I know about — if they don’t reach a certain threshold, I cannot tell ICE about it.""
President Donald Trump: ""We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — and we’re stopping a lot of them — but we’re taking people out of the country. You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals. And we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before. And because of the weak laws, they come in fast, we get them, we release them, we get them again, we bring them out. It’s crazy.""

#AOC Mobile Office Experience | The Real McTeag,therealmcteag.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://therealmcteag.com/2019/04/06/aoc-gianris-open-office-experience/,"≈ 2 Comments
Well it looked like I was headed to an idyllic small town in the big city moment as I walked to my local library here in Woodside to see our local Representative to United States House of Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the areas State Senator Michael Gianaris make a few statements and hopefully talk to them or their staffs.
Just as a reminder to those who aren’t from New York City; while she is from the Bronx and represents part of that borough, don’t forget that she also represents Woodside and some nearby parts of Queens as well. So she’s OUR rep. It’s safe to say she’s very, very popular here.
I walked over at precisely 230 in a snappy mood. I had shaved with a fresh razor and worn a nice a very ‘spring’ button down green short sleeved collared shirt. It was that nice out; and I wanted to be taken seriously should I talk to anyone. It surely wouldn’t matter in Queens anyway, but I was ready to make a decent impression and at least try not come off crazy just from how I looked. So no Yankee hat either.
It sure seemed like I was strolling leisurely towards a Mayberry in New York moment. A glimpse of one of the many local neighborhoods that makes up New York City. A quiet, beautiful day with seemingly less noise from the overhead 7 Train. It was like, hey; here’s my government right up the block waiting to talk to me! This was going to be outright bucolic! Roosevelt Avenue side of Library like any other day
Then I saw the OTHER side of the library! There were all sorts of people, numbering maybe a thousand and some change in my quick glance of the line up the next two blocks. Behind the short, organized very front of the line, block one was sort of four or five people thick, whereas block 2 was just all across the sidewalk. Everyone seemed upbeat and happy.
People weren’t likely going to get to see her and they had to know it and they still had concerns worth just the chance of talking to anyone working for her or Gainaris on this day. I was sort of proud, It was a throng that had showed up out of a belief in our democracy. Right here in New York City. There had to be plenty of Small d Democrats out there too as well as the part y loyalist and huge AOC fans. There was simply just too many people.
It felt good to see. Not to mention the office doesn’t cease to exist in just two hours. People who didn’t get to see anyone today, if indeed anyone didn’t, are far from cut off from those offices or their services. The offices will still be open this week as usual.
So lets face it, as far as turnout was concerned this was a huge success and the biggest event here since last months Saint Patrick’s Day for All Parade. Looks like a lot of people will get direct access to their district office people today. Thats great. This is a working class neighborhood, we need to have weekend office hours for our politicians. Seems they get it. Based on the turnout we need a lot more of them. Here’s hoping this new tradition takes root. I would think. however, there’s just no way theyre going to see these people in 2 hours or even 8. But who knows?
Clearly, however, I wasn’t going to get to speak to anyone today. the Skillman Ave side of the library revealed hundreds if not a thousand more people
That’s fine, the offices are open most of the time at its usual location and my concerns will be relayed there by phone. In fact in light of the crush it might be best to try to talk to them later.
I also voted on an informal poll about allocation of resources in my city council area. It’s Yes on the Hydroponics Science lab for the local junior high school from me!
But I saw AOC and got to hear her speak, while i could hear her by straining the camera didn’t get the video. It would have been nice to have 3 minutes for reference and see what the news carries instead, but she’ll be back. I’ll have other chances.
When I got there she was wrapping up what couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes with the press between her and Gianaris based on it being almost over at 2:32 pm when I strolled in. I heard her defend having been a bartender against the attacks from the right that seem to find this disqualifying. I’ve been a bartender to so I related.
So here’s a couple of pictures I got, only to be seen here for now. NY State Senator Michael Gianaris and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at Woodside Library April 6, 2019 NY State Sen Michael Gianaris and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Woodside Library April 6, 2019
I’m a local and it’s my library so I simply walked in and listened to AOC speak to the press spray. It’s MY library, so I had the only press credential I needed. FOX was the only news cube I saw on a mic or camera, but there were a couple of cameras there. Lots of audio mics too. It was intimdiating momentarily to see the News happenng right in front of you. I enjoyed being a firsthand witness.
So like I said, its my Library Branch and I have every right to go there anytime its open. It was totally cool. I belonged there anyway technically. Besides democarcy takes place in public buildings, why not a place of learning? It was the perfect forum and just big enough (not that we wouldnt a new bigger library!).
It was just fluke-y Real McTeag luck that l got there in time to hear her speak a little to the press spray while many hundreds waited outside. And the Real McTeag attitude that walked me through that door like I belonged there without being bothered or asked for my card (which I had). maybe it was because I was so well-groomed today, I’ll note that for the future. I also just had the best timing ever.
There was one law enforcement officer in a uniform I didn’t recognize. It could have been uniformed Secret Service or some sort of New York State Police Officer (Reactions by horrible people on AOC’s Twitter threads show that’s warranted). Validated my concern for AOC. Shes’s become a hated symbol to the wacky Right and the Trumpists. Glad to see someone watching out for her. She’s the future.
Meanwhile it remained Woodside. Lots of people had an agenda that only included the library. Some never even stopped reading or using the computer. The library remained a library during the press availability, held on an elevated area where there’s some reading tables and shelves of books. Thats Queens, right? Some people just don’t give a shit. At ant rate the operation of the Library was not all that impacted either, so that was great since the neighborhood needs it.
Leaving mostly the crowd was locals. Sure, I saw a few unfamiliar face-lifts here and there. I guess a few people came here on safari to Queens from Manhattan just to see Ocasio-Cortez. The very first person I saw walking out of the library, occupying the front of the line, had a very Un-Woodside, more Manhattan-like air about them, but hey, it’s their government too. She can stand on line and discuss her issues just like anyone else I guess. Didn’t really bother me. Theres was still a huge amount of obvious locals there on top of any people just drawn to her star.
It was also a shot in the arm to the image of poor old Woodside,
So I’ll be contacting both representatives offices directly.
Talking to the Neighbors Later
In conversation with my neighbors where they relax in the alley everyone was proud she’d come to town and was proud of her. One older hispanic lady was the hesitant person, who supported AOC fully but was dogged by a feeling she was moving too fast and maybe being disruptive to a fault. She seemed really pleased and surprised when I said I considered her a pace setter and that great things had already come from electing her. We both agreed she had already done a couple of things to advance women. The multi racial group that compromised my neighborhoods version of the King of the Hill behind the garage beer gaggle all had positive feelings enjoying the added boost of pride that came from a member fo Congress showing up 500 feet away. Who wouldn’t?
Til now that woman just walked right by me in the hallways. Maybe we’d said hi. Now we’re sort of friends. To me this shows AOC brings people together.
A small success for governing on the most local of levels.
By 420 pm when it was about over despite the event scheduled to wind down it seemed to be going strong still with the overflow now on Roosevelt Ave as well. So while I’m not a professional at counting crowds it seems she’s not going to need to lie about just how many people came out to see her. Whatever the real number is its impressive for a 2 hour Mobile Office visit to part of the District.
Just in case anyone care tomorrow consists of cheap seats with with a buddy to see the Mets play the Nats at Citifield. You already know I like the Yankees, but I live in Queens, and hey DeGrom is pitching and I still love Bobby Cano.
Thats it from Queens for now. Advertisements"
Five things to watch in Trump tax-return fight,thehill.com,Naomi Jagoda,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/437659-five-things-to-watch-in-trump-tax-return-fight,"Five things to watch in Trump tax-return fight By Naomi Jagoda - 04/06/19 05:22 PM EDT
House Democrats this week formally requested President Trump Donald tax returns from the IRS, kicking off a new battle with the administration.
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund Neal Five things to watch in Trump tax-return fight Congress should look into its own taxes and travel, not just Trump's GOP senator rips Dem rep seeking Trump taxes: 'It must really suck to be that dumb' MORE (D-Mass.) asked for six years of both Trump’s personal tax returns and the returns of several of his business entities. ADVERTISEMENT
Trump, who has long said he won’t release his tax returns because he’s under audit, quickly indicated that he did not want the administration to comply with the request.
Given the disagreements between Democrats and the administration, the matter is widely expected to result in a court battle.
Here are five things to watch in the fight for Trump’s tax returns.
What legal arguments are emerging on both sides?
Democrats and their supporters say that the law provides no leeway for the administration to deny their request.
They point to the fact that Neal made the request under a provision of the federal tax code that states that Treasury secretary “shall furnish” tax returns upon request from the chairmen of Congress’s tax committees, provided that documents associated with a particular taxpayer are viewed in a closed session.
Courts have ruled in the past that congressional requests for information need to be complied with when they have a legitimate legislative purpose.
Democrats say their request has that. In his letter to the IRS, Neal focused on the Ways and Means Committee’s interest in legislative proposals and oversight pertaining to the IRS’s audits of presidents.
Trump and Republicans, however, are already starting to argue that the request doesn’t have a legitimate legislative purpose.
An outside lawyer for Trump, William Consovoy, said in a letter to the Treasury Department on Friday that Neal doesn’t really want Trump’s tax returns to examine the IRS, and that the request is about “scoring political points” against the president.
Consovoy also said that it would set a bad precedent for the IRS to provide the returns because it would allow politicians to use tax returns to harass their political opponents. And he argued that it’s inappropriate for Neal to request returns related to an ongoing IRS audit.
Who takes the lead on defending Trump?
Trump has retained Consovoy to represent him and his business entities with regard to the request. But there are also a number of administration officials who could be crucial in any attempt to fight the requests for Trump’s tax returns.
One official who is being closely watched is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner Mnuchin Five things to watch in Trump tax-return fight On The Money — Presented by Job Creators Network — Trump lawyer urges Treasury to reject tax-return demand | How the fight is testing Mnuchin's loyalty to Trump | Economy rebounds with 196K jobs in March | Trump calls on Fed to cut rates Trump admin imposes fresh sanctions targeting Cuba, Venezuelan oil industry MORE , since the IRS is part of Treasury and the statue Democrats invoked specifically mentions the Treasury secretary. Mnuchin is one of Trump’s most loyal allies .
Mnuchin has said he would discuss the legality of a request for Trump’s tax returns with Treasury’s lawyers. Consovoy’s letter was addressed to Treasury General Counsel Brent McIntosh.
Another official to watch is IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, to whom Neal’s letter was addressed. The IRS typically handles requests under the tax code section Neal invoked.
Trump also wants Attorney General William Barr William Pelham Barr Five things to watch in Trump tax-return fight Trump: I have not read Mueller report, 'though I have every right to do so' Border fencing labeled first section of Trump's wall was approved under Obama: report MORE to get involved.
When reporters asked Trump if he would tell the IRS to not provide his returns to Democrats, the president said, ""They’ll speak to my lawyers, and they’ll speak to the attorney general.” And Consovoy’s letter said that the IRS should not provide Neal with Trump’s tax returns until the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has provided an opinion.
Do divisions among Democrats deepen during the fight?
Neal made the request for Trump’s tax returns several months after becoming Ways and Means Committee chairman, saying he wanted to be methodical because he expects the issue to end up in court. But some progressives were frustrated that he didn’t make the request earlier.
Liberal groups that were pressuring Neal praised his request, and several are now planning to focus efforts on making sure that the administration fulfills the chairman’s request. But they’re not expected to completely take pressure off of Neal and Democratic leaders.
Tax March spokesman Ryan Thomas said that his group and its partner organizations will still press Democrats to demand that the IRS provide the documents, but that “a lot of our efforts will be pressuring the IRS to comply.”
Will Simons, press secretary for Need to Impeach, a group founded by billionaire Tom Steyer, said that the group plans to stay active in Neal’s district to ensure that lawmakers release the information they learn during their investigations.
How much do voters care about the fight?
Several of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have already released their own tax returns in an effort to contrast themselves with Trump, and more are expected to follow suit in the coming days.
But it’s unclear how large of an issue Democrats' fight for Trump’s tax returns will be for voters.
There are some indications that the tax-return issue can energize Democrats. About 125,000 people attended Tax March events in 2017 to urge Trump to release his returns, according to the group.
But Trump won the 2016 election even though Democrats repeatedly attacked him then for refusing to release his returns. Some Democratic strategists think the party's candidates should focus more on issues such as health care than on investigations of Trump.
Will the public ever see Trump’s returns?
While Neal wants the IRS to provide Trump’s returns by April 10, the odds are high that he won’t get them by then, given the president’s opposition to the request.
Democrats have been bracing themselves for a court fight, and such a battle may end up being lengthy.
Andy Grewal, a law professor at the University of Iowa, said that it could take a while for the courts to decide whether the House would even have the right to sue over the matter.
“Just the question of whether they have the right to sue could take years to resolve,” he said.
If Democrats receive Trump’s tax returns, the documents wouldn’t immediately become public. For return information to become public, the Ways and Means Committee would need to include it in a report and vote to submit that report to the full House.

"Onnoghen’s resignation, a heavy blow to judicial independence – Uwazurike",hallmarknews.com,Obinna Ezugwu,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://hallmarknews.com/onnoghens-resignation-a-heavy-blow-to-judicial-independence-uwazurike/,"Onnoghen’s resignation, a heavy blow to judicial independence – Uwazurike Chief Uwazurike
By OBINNA EZUGWU
Lagos based lawyer and president emeritus of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, has described the circumstances leading to the resignation of Justice Walter Nkanu Onnoghen from office as Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) as very unfortunate, noting that the status of the judiciary as the fulcrum of democracy has been damaged.
Uwazurike who made his position known in a statement made available to Business Hallmark on Friday, recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari had also in 1984 humiliated another Chief Justice, the late Justice George Sodeinde Sowemimo when he was military head of state.
“This resignation was like a thunderbolt!,” Uwazurike lamented. “This man has been humiliated in the worst way possible for a judge to be treated in this country since 1984.
“1984 was the year Chief Justice of Nigeria, Sowemimo was removed from office by the then Military Head of State, Major General Muhammadu Buhari! ! Ever since, the dignity of the judiciary was never trampled upon by any government, military or civilian.”
He said Onnoghen’s travails is an assault on the judiciary which, according to him, is regrettable.
“As a lawyer, I weep for the other members of the judiciary who did not understand that a new benchmark has been set for whipping any independent and courageous judge into line!
“Truly, the fulcrum of democracy has been damaged! Whether the 3rd arm of the government, the judiciary, shall recover is a matter of conjecture! But one thing is certain, our judiciary will not be respected all over the world and in Nigeria!” © 2019, Obinna Ezugwu . All rights reserved. Related News"
