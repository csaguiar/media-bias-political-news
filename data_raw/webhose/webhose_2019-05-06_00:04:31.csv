Scarborough Blasts Barr: ‘He Trashed His Reputation for Donald Trump’ (VIDEO),www.therussophile.org,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/scarborough-blasts-barr-he-trashed-his-reputation-for-donald-trump-video.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Early on Friday’s Morning Joe, co-host Joe Scarborough accused Attorney General William Barr of attempting to “whitewash” findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the Russia investigation, going so far as to claim that Barr had “trashed his reputation for Donald Trump.” All of the anchor’s assertions were based on anonymous second-hand accounts alleging that Barr’s summary of the Mueller report was misleading.
The discussion began with Scarborough reveling in “the fact that Donald Trump received absolutely no bounce from this William Barr attempt…to whitewash his client,” referring to the President’s approval rating. He then gleefully seized on the anonymous reporting: “And I actually think reading these stories show what many of us expected at the time, that the Trump team and right wingers on Twitter would overplay their hands. And they have overplayed their hands.”
On Thursday, even Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd warned his press colleagues that reporters were “playing two levels of telephone” with those stories.
Scarborough confidently proclaimed: “I mean, there’s evidence that’s going to be coming out from this Mueller report that again shows what we all know, that the Trump campaign, the Trump team, the Trump family were manipulated by members of either the Russian government or Russian intelligence and Barr’s sanitized version of that.”– READ MORE

"Mark Zuckerberg Proposes Regulating Political Discussion, Immigration Debate",www.therussophile.org,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/mark-zuckerberg-proposes-regulating-political-discussion-immigration-debate.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg proposed in an interview this week that political discussion on social media, including the immigration debate, should be regulated in an effort to crack down on foreign influence.
In a Good Morning America interview with George Stephanopoulos, Thursday, Zuckerberg declared, “All of the laws around political advertising today primarily focus on a candidate and an election, right, so, ‘Vote for this candidate in this election.’ But that’s not, primarily, what we saw Russia trying to do and other folks who were trying to interfere in elections. And what we saw them doing was talking about divisive political issues.”
“They’d run, simultaneously, different campaigns on social media trying to argue for immigration or against immigration. And the goal wasn’t, actually, to advance the issue forward. It was just to rile people up and be divisive. But the current laws around what is political advertising don’t consider discussion issues to be political,” he continued. “So that’s just one of the examples of where you know, it’s not clear to me, after working on this for a few years now, that we want a private company to be making that kind of a fundamental decision about, you know, what is political speech? And how should that be regulated?”
“I think, broadly, we would say that setting the rules around political advertising is not a company’s job, right? I mean, there’s been plenty of the rules in the past. It’s just that, at this point they’re not updated to the modern threats that we face or the modern kinds of nation-state trying to interfere in each other’s elections,” Zuckerberg elaborated. “We need new rules, right? It’s not, you can’t say that an election is just some period before people go to vote. I mean, the kind of information operations that these folks are trying to do now are ongoing, permanently. So I just think that we need new rules on this. Now, at Facebook, we’re doing the best that we can on each of these issues. But I think, ideally, you would have standards that you would want all of the major companies to be abiding by.”– READ MORE

Democrat Hank Johnson Suggests Attorney General Barr May Have ‘Obstructed Justice’,www.therussophile.org,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/democrat-hank-johnson-suggests-attorney-general-barr-may-have-obstructed-justice.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Some Democrats in Congress are suggesting that Attorney General William Barr broke the law in announcing the principal conclusions of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report last week, according to a report.
Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) — who once asked during a hearing whether Guam could tip over and capsize if more Marines were added, suggested Friday that Barr’s handling of the report may have “obstructed justice.”
“If it turns out that he has obstructed justice by how he has handled the Mueller report that will be a deep stain on his legacy,” said Rep. Hank Johnson, member of the House Judiciary Committee, according to Politico .
Barr, in a letter to leaders of the Judiciary Committee, wrote that the special counsel did not establish any collusion, conspiracy, or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
He also said Mueller declined to take a position on whether the president obstructed the investigation, which he said left him to make the decision. Barr said he, in consultation with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, concluded Trump did not obstruct the special counsel investigation. – READ MORE

VIDEO: Eurasianism vs. Atlanticism – Flores on U.S Sabotage of the EU,www.therussophile.org,FRN Editorial Board,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/video-eurasianism-vs-atlanticism-flores-on-u-s-sabotage-of-the-eu.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
In this piece, Flores explains part of the history of the EU, and the US designs to sabotage the EU. The video is after the text, and the text adds little for those able to watch the video.
Summary:
The EU currency was launched at the end of the last century, and the US was supportive of this based on the strategy that the EU would be developed on a market basis. The US saw that the Euro ‘dollar’ would be a valuable single currency that would hold together European foreign policy, because they saw, naturally that there were different loci of European power, and if they couldn’t brought together in a coherent way, then NATO could become weaker.
At the same time, and what is an interesting twist, is that there was a strong view among European leaders that if Europe would ever carve and independent course, if there would ever be an EU Army, that this would also require a European single currency in the EU.
History of the EU Crisis:
In 1996 and 97, the US experienced a very large market crisis which it pushed onto the Tiger Economies in Asia, and that created a market crash then. There was a significant bailout around this, which resulted in a speculative bubble, which in turn burst – and this crash was known as the ‘Dot Com Crash’ within four or so years in 2001.
The response to this for the US, and how this ended being Europe’s problem, is that they ended up using a lot of European capital to build up in this bailout in 2001 or 2002, to invest into two areas: the military – and necessarily the expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe purchasing these goods, and the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, was the housing market bubble which was created then.
This resulted in the 2007 period housing market crisis in the U.S, where the too-big-to-fail banks were ultimately bailed out. But this problem was pushed onto Europe, because Europe was sold these repackaged debts, and from Europe the crisis was pushed onto Greece.
Now today, we are seeing pushes from EU elites to have an independent course. EU would like to have its own multipolar policy, including investment with the US, with Russia, with China – they actually opposed the Iran sanctions, and US interference had very little to do with European prosperity.
So, the US, to punish Europe and create problems, we saw the use of the refugee crisis by the US against the EU. Atlanticist leaders in the EU signed onto this, as that is their role. The idea was to have the start of the Russian campaign in Syria, line up with the start of the refugee crisis.
The plan was to make the claim that because Russia was bombing civilian areas, Russia had created a humanitarian crisis in Syria, and that was the cause of the refugee crisis. The idea was to blame Russia for the refugee crisis, and even to insinuate that the crisis itself was planned by Russia in order to destabilize Europe.
That last notion is a ludicrous one, which the U.S has promoted in its narrative, and which opponents of FRN/CSS have tried to say outright. The reality is that both European civil wars bubbled up into wars upon Russia, WWI and WWII – Russia knows that destabilization of Europe is always caused by outside influencers, and that the ‘final solution’ of this conflict is the destruction of Russia. So it is Russia that wants stability and prosperity in the EU. They need reliable trade partners, and always aim towards regional de-escalation of tensions.
The refugee crisis was in part manufactured by the U.S, instead. We can recall that at the end of the Summer of 2015, Russia indicated that soon they would be involved openly in the Syrian war by way of invitation from Syria, using the Russian air-force. – Advertisement –
So the U.S planned with its Atlanticist partners in the EU (against the needs of the EU’s Europeanists and EU’s Eurasianists) to time the start of the refugee crisis with the start of the Russian air campaign.
This was for sure to be a media simulacrum, a holographic reality, because these refugees would be coming primarily from Turkey, and secondly from Lebanon, where many had lived since the start of the war years ago. But the ‘idea’ that audiences would take away from this is that these Syrian refugees were coming directly from where Russia was ‘bombing civilians’.
Russia saw this was the plan, and so announced the start of the campaign, but misled the world. Europe issued an open border decree, and Turkey worked to help, pushing a migrant march through the Balkans. Except their was a problem. Russia lied about the start of their campaign, the EU announced open borders, and the ‘migrant march’ began a month before the Russian campaign.
Therefore, it was very difficult for the US to claim that the Russian campaign was the source of millions of people suddenly ‘fleeing’ from Syria.
Still, we can see all of this as an example of the US successfully using pressure politics on the EU. We could see from this that Turkey and the U.S coordinated this pressure move on the EU – the US does not want to see the EU develop its own foreign policy. That is the primary issue.
In the future, we should expect the US to promote ‘New Europe’ a preferable to ‘Old Europe’, to create an Intermarium. But this is not a viable project, and the US is misleading leaders of Eastern Europan, Baltic and Balkan states that this is a viable project. The main idea is to contain Russia.
Because Eurasian and European ties continue to grow despite political interference of Atlanticism in the EU, the US wants to create a military cordon-zone in middel-europa separating Russia and the EU.
One of the reasons this problem came about is that the US has inherited a fallacious view of Russia from England, based on the state of geopolitics in the 19th century. This view is that Russia represents the core of Heartland (Eurasia), that if Russia controls all of the Heartland (Eurasia) then it will dominate the world. But this was not the world, but the world of concern to England.
But the US does not need to have this view and this geostrategic orientation. The US is not England, it is not a small island that needs to dominate European politics through divide and conquer. The US which spans from the Atlantic to the Pacific and also has tremendous influence across the two continents of the Americas, could be its own independent New World land-power, without interference in Eurasian-European and Mid-east affairs.
But the US is committed ideologically and economically to Atlanticism, a globalist agenda, they push to establish institutions around the world. There are not only economic dimension of this, but cultural. So the destruction of Europe is connected to the US wanting to uproot any civilizations that have indigenous roots at all. Whether these are indigenous Europeans, indigenous Africans, indigenous Asians – the US is committed to a neoliberal vision of the world which atomizes people, tears them apart, turns communities into individuals making them easier to manipulate through advertising, towards being good consumers.

Visiting the US-Mexico border in Calexico, California, President Donald Trump declared America “full” and repeated that illegal crossings constituted an emergency, vowing to send more troops to the border and build the wall.
Trump argued that many migrants crossing the border illegally are making bogus asylum claims. “It’s a scam, it’s a hoax. I know about hoaxes, I just went through a hoax,” he said at one point, indicating ‘Russiagate.’
He also said that Mexico was apprehending migrants “by the thousands,” doing more in the past four days than they have ever done before, but if that does not stem the flow of migrants he is “totally willing to close the border.”
The “colossal surge” in border crossings is overwhelming the US immigration system, and “we can’t have that,” Trump said.
(Starts at 59:00)

Border Patrol agents at the meeting agreed with the president about the crisis on the border, and informed Trump that they had apprehended almost 200 “fake families,” migrants fraudulently claiming children in order to avoid detention.
CBP El Centro Sector chief Gloria Chavez presented Trump with a segment of the newly built border barrier, as a symbol that the “wall works.”
US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) is building the border barrier and expects to have approximately 450 miles done by the end of 2020, General Todd Semonite said.
Not everyone agreed with the Border Patrol, however. Protesters in the area deployed the giant “Trump baby” balloon ahead of the president’s visit on Friday.
Democrats are challenging Trump’s border emergency declaration in the courts and have called it a “manufactured crisis.”

Western “Rights Advocates” Rush to Chechen “Activist’s” Aid,www.therussophile.org,Darryl Paolucci,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/western-rights-advocates-rush-to-chechen-activists-aid.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Human Rights Watch (HRW) executive director Kenneth Roth recently decried legal proceedings against the alleged “leading human rights defender in Chechnya,” Oyub Titiyev.
But as with much of what HRW decries, Titiyev has less to do with actually defending human rights, and more to do with ongoing US-subversion in Russia’s southern Chechen Republic.
Roth, in a social media post , would claim:
The Russian government’s “case” against the leading human rights defender in Chechnya, Oyub Titiyev, is farcical–as many holes as Swiss cheese–but authorities have still locked him up for 14 months and are threatening a four-year sentence.
The article Roth’s post would include, leads to an opinion piece in The Moscow Times (written by fellow HRW regional director, Rachel Denber) who insists Titiyev is innocent of drug charges based entirely on Titiyev and his lawyer’s own claims.
Whether Titiyev is guilty or not is for Russia’s courts to decide. However, the entire process of mobilizing supposed human rights advocacy organizations like HRW to rush to Titiyev’s aid illustrates how “rights advocacy” is transparently used to advance politically-motivated agendas, not to actually advance human rights.
No matter what the evidence against Titiyev, HRW and others would claim the charges against him were politically motivated. It is an example of foreign-funded organizations attempting to assert themselves over a nation’s sovereign right to manage its own internal affairs, including by overriding local law enforcement and judicial processes.But there is much more to consider regarding Titiyev’s case than this.
Terrorism as Washington’s Sword, “Rights Advocacy” as its Shield
Russia’s Chechen Republic had previously seen two wars as armed separatists attempted to carve out an independent region from Russian territory. From 1994-1996 and again from 1999-2009 militants waged both open war and an armed insurgency against Russian forces until eventually Moscow prevailed.
Today, attempts to rekindle divisions, upheaval and even violence have been the primary goal of both US-funded and directed “rights advocates” like HRW and US-backed militants, though admittedly Russia now has the upper hand.
As the United States has been revealed to have done elsewhere, the Russian government has accused it of lending direct aid to Chechen militants.
A 2015 BBC article titled, “ Russia’s Putin: US agents gave direct help to Chechens ,” would note:
Vladimir Putin has accused US agents of directly aiding rebel fighters in the second Chechen war.
In order for fighters to have contested Russian control over Chechnya, they would require equal or greater financial and military support than that committed by Moscow. State sponsorship would be the only way of achieving this and the list of potential states both capable and motivated to back Chechen militants is exceedingly short.
That the US and its partners now currently offer many of these same Chechen militants who have shifted their fighting over to Syria both weapons and financial backing is further evidence of Washington’s deep commitment to menacing Russia and its interests both domestically and abroad with Chechen militancy.
US state sponsorship of Chechen militancy serves as the sword of Washington’s policy, aimed at the Chechen Republic and anywhere else it feels it can wield it effectively (such as Syria).
And if the Chechen militancy is Washington’s sword, US-backed “rights advocacy” is its shield.
So-called “human rights defenders” like Oyub Titiyev and the US-funded organizations he is a member of work to frustrate Russian efforts to root out extremism in the Chechen Republic.
Titiyev and others attempt to claim obvious counter-terror operations somehow violate human rights. His organization’s work along with many others funded out of Washington D.C. is then used to place official pressure on Moscow to complicate counter-terror operations and undermine Russia’s ability to maintain peace and stability in Chechnya.Such organizations are used as a “shield” to protect militants from the full force of efforts undertaken to uproot them.
Oyub Titiyev is Funded by the US Government
The Moscow Times’ article cited by HRW’s Kenneth Roth would make mention of at least one of the organizations Oyub Titiyev worked for, stating:
Titiyev has headed the office of the Russian human rights group Memorial in Grozny for nine years, collecting harrowing evidence of abuses and injustices committed by Chechen authorities.
Memorial, funded by the US government, is registered in Russia as a, “non-profit organization acting as a foreign agent.” On Memorial’s own website in a barely noticeable footnote at the very bottom of its website, it admits to its status as a foreign agent, but insists it is “self-governing,” a claim made by many supposed nongovernmental organizations whose US government funding has been exposed.
Memorial no longer transparently discloses its funding, nor does the US National Endowment for Democracy which in 2011 had openly listed Memorial as one of their many grantees in Russia. Human Rights Watch’s Kenneth Roth and Rachel Denber in her op-ed in The Moscow Times also omitted Memorial’s US government-funding.
But under Memorial’s own post on Titiyev’s arrest, it would admit (emphasis added):
Titiev has worked at Memorial and its sister organization, Civic Assistance Committee, since 2000, documenting human rights violations and carrying out a range of humanitarian projects, including support to schools in Chechnya’s mountain areas.
The “Civic Assistance Committee” is also registered in Russia as a “non-profit organization acting as a foreign agent,” and does list its foreign sponsors , which include the European Commission and George Soros’ Open Society-funded Amnesty International.
Had Human Rights Watch mentioned Titiyev’s role as a foreign agent amid Russia’s internal political affairs, or the fact that the people whose “rights” he was “defending” were terror suspects, their message would have failed to invoke sufficient public sympathy for Titiyev or public anger against the Russian government.
Sword and Shield Used Worldwide
Washington’s use of Chechen terrorists to menace Russia along with dubious “rights advocates” like Titiyev and the US-funded fronts he works for protecting these terrorists from counter-terror operations represents a “sword and shield” method used extensively by Washington worldwide.
We can see examples of this in Syria where supposed US-backed “human rights activists” and “rescue workers” like the White Helmets embed with Al Qaeda and its many affiliates, working exclusively in territory occupied by terrorist organizations even listed by the US State Department itself as such.
US-armed terrorists used to overthrow the Libyan government in 2011 were likewise protected by extensive “human rights” networks set up by the US and Europe to portray militants as “pro-democracy activists.” The efforts of these “human rights” networks were used by the US and its allies to justify airstrikes under the pretext of the “responsibility to protect” doctrine, also known as “R2P.”
Just as a knight brings his sword and shield to whatever battlefield he fights upon, the United States brings its sword of state-sponsored terrorism and shield of “human rights advocacy” to every region and nation it seeks to undermine and eventually overthrow.
Oyub Titiyev’s role in abusing human rights advocacy to frustrate state security services attempting to maintain peace and stability in Russia’s Chechen Republic is just one of many hundreds of examples the US and its allies are using worldwide. By following characters like Kenneth Roth of HRW on social media, we can see several examples aired out per day, in numerous countries.
By understanding this tactic and exposing it, the blade of Washington’s sword will grow dull, and cracks will begin to appear in its shield.

War With Russia Is Not “Inevitable”… Keep Repeating That,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/war-with-russia-is-not-inevitable-keep-repeating-that-2.html/,"Authored by James George Jatras via The Strategic Culture Foundation,
Well, that didn’t take long! No sooner had Robert Torquemada Mueller wrapped up his obscenely expensive inquisition without finding any so-called collusion with Russia than the obstacles to rapprochement between Washington and Moscow immediately dissipated. Calls for a new détente issued from sound thinkers such as Daniel R. DePetris of The American Conservative (Trump now has his “first opportunity to settle on a Russia policy without the risk of an extreme political backlash”) and Srdja Trifkovic of Chronicles :
‘Now that the Russian Collusion Myth has been revealed to be a mendacious conspiracy by the Deep State, the Democratic Party and the media, President Donald Trump needs to move on with his election promise to improve relations with Moscow. That is a geopolitical and civilizational necessity.’
The undeniable wisdom of such recommendations was instantly recognized by the Washington establishment. Not only did Democrats and Never-Trump Republicans back off their Nazi-Putin paranoia , Trump’s own team, starting with National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rushed copies of DePetris’ and Trifkovic’s musings onto their boss’s desk.
The most striking (though, oddly, little commented upon) evidence of the now-liberated Trump administration’s beeline towards a new realist overture towards Moscow was explicit US recognition of Crimea as part of Russia. The newfound respect for Russia’s security needs is evident:
The White House
Proclamation on Recognizing Crimea as Part of the Russian Federation
Issued on: March 25, 2019
The Russian Federation took control of Crimea in 2014 to safeguard its security from external threats. Today, aggressive acts by NATO, including US forces, in the Black Sea and Ukraine continue to make Crimea a potential launching ground for attacks on Russia. Any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for Russia’s need to protect itself from NATO and other regional threats. Based on these unique circumstances, it is therefore appropriate to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that, the United States recognizes that Crimea is part of the Russian Federation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand nineteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-third.
DONALD J. TRUMP
Oh wait, that actually didn’t happen. The genuine March 25 proclamation related to something entirely different .
Nevermind .
Let’s get something straight. It is a fantasy to believe that Trump has been freed by Mueller’s goose egg. The Democrats will use his work as a starting point (not as a finish) to keep digging into Trump’s private and business affairs to find something for which they can impeach him. As far as Russia goes, sure there was no direct “collusion,” but on the other hand the report, even before its release, is being cited across the political spectrum as proof that Russia “interfered” in our election to undermine our “democracy” and thus as reason to keep the demonization campaign against Russia going. Pathetically, Trump will continue to defend himself by boasting that “ nobody’s been tougher on Russia ” than he has while futilely calling for better relations (and even mutual decreases in military spending , which will join his nonexistent Mexican wall, his national infrastructure rehab, his Syria pullout, his … ).
In that sense Mueller has changed nothing. We will continue to sputter along like this for the remainder of Trump’s presidency in a continued downward slope. If anyone in Moscow thinks Trump now will be able to move towards normalized relations they are sadly mistaken.
Aside from occasional pipe dreams that supposedly “ declining power ” Russia can be pressed into service as a check against China ( without offering Moscow any positive incentive , of course) what we can count on is continuation of the coordinated campaign to render Russia’s strategic situation untenable: deployment of intermediate-range weapons in Europe to make warning virtually nonexistent (and a strong possibility that START will follow INF into oblivion); strategic bomber probes with prototype nuclear-armed cruise missiles to prepare the aircraft for the possibility of launching the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) weapon ; NATO maneuvers around Russia’s land and sea borders (but only to deter aggression, of course!); more sanctions; yet more expansion of NATO ( Ukraine and Georgia still on the agenda !); vilification of Russia and, particularly, of President Vladimir Putin; militarization of Ukraine; attacking the Orthodox Church ; the Skripal hoax; more chemical false flags in Syria ; trying to tank South Stream 2; blaming Russia for “undermining democracy” in every western country in addition to the US – all are components of a full-spectrum operation to destroy Russia’s economy, to destabilize its society, to replace its “regime” with one more to their “partners’” liking, and ultimately to dismember Russia.
In the face of this, one is mystified why Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and other Russian statesmen continue to refer politely to their Western “partners” even when it’s painfully clear that they have no Western partners. While these “partners”– who, it should be noted, never that use that term about the Russians – claim they only want to change Moscow’s “behavior,” that isn’t true. There is nothing Russia could do short of surrendering its sovereignty and returning to the 1990s that would even begin mollify Russia’s “partners.” As US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put it in December 2018, America’s “mission is to reassert our sovereignty [and] reform the liberal international order,” and “we want our friends to help us and to exert their sovereignty as well.” But Russia and other countries that haven’t “embraced Western values of freedom and international cooperation” to Pompeo’s satisfaction aren’t our “friends” and thus have no such sovereign liberty.
In short, these Western “partners” hate Russia not for what it does, but for what it is: an obstacle to absolute global domination by a US-led “liberal international order.” Russia’s deployment of the most powerful weapons imaginable perhaps can limit the military aspect of that agenda, but it cannot reverse it. Quite to the contrary, such actions, like Moscow’s defensive moves after the 2014 regime change in Ukraine or Russia’s 2015 deployment in Syria or current presence in Venezuela, are held up as further “proof” of Russians’“typically, almost genetically driven” aggressiveness, in the words of former CIA Director James Clapper.
Does this mean that western war planners are preparing for a redux of the 1812 Grande Armée or 1941 Operation Barbarossa rolling across Belarus or Ukraine into Russia? No. Rather, western officials, mainly in the US, are confident (aren’t they always?) that under constant moral, economic, financial, and military pressure a tipping point will be reached in Russia’s internal instability and strategic vulnerability (the latter including the knowledge that leadership decapitation without warning is possible), forcing Moscow to fold, either through revolution, or coup, or inflicting a (we would hope, limited) military humiliation on them somewhere.
Notwithstanding their soft rhetoric, the Russian leadership understands this quite well. As Professor Stephen Cohen observes:
‘Moscow closely follows what is said and written in the United States about US-Russian relations. Here too words have consequences. On March 14, Russia’s National Security Council, headed by President Putin, officially raised its perception of American intentions toward Russia from “military dangers” (opasnosti) to direct “military threats” (ugrozy). In short, the Kremlin is preparing for war, however defensive its intention.’
Just over a year ago, in March 2018 , Putin unveiled a new set of deterrent capabilities against “all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, [and] introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development.”(Hint: he was talking about the US and NATO.) “Nobody listened to us,” Putin said then. “Well, listen to us now.”
Of course, they didn’t listen a year ago. And they’re not listening today, either.
Gilbert Doctorow likens the current situation to that in depicted by Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace . Today as then, what happens next will be less due to this or that policymaker making this or that bad decision as much as the existence of a “near universal acceptance of the logic of the coming war” (Must read: “‘ War and Peace’: The Relevance of 1812 as Explained by Tolstoy to Current Global Affairs ,” Antiwar.com ):
‘Transposed to our own day, this issue finds its parallel in the informational war the United States and the West more generally have been waging against Russia. The defamation of Putin, the denigration of Russia all have been swallowed whole by the vast majority of our political classes, who today would view with equanimity, perhaps even with enthusiasm any military conflict with Russia that may arise, whatever the immediate cause.’
Hardheaded observers, notably military men, might reject this notion. Where is mobilization of NATO armies in offensive strength? The Russians know NATO is a joke – they won’t even cough up Trump’s lousy two percent of GDP! General Shoigu isn’t stupid!
Objectively that’s true. But that doesn’t change the fact that western, especially American, policymakers have defined our attitude towards Russia as an existential struggle that can have only one outcome – Russia’s collapse, leading to regime change – either via war or means short of war. All elements of western policy are geared to that one inalterable objective.
That this policy won’t and cannot succeed is never even considered by its authors. It continues because, literally, they cannot think of Russia in any other way. Nikolai Gogol likened the Russia of his day to a speeding troika , wordlessly hurtling towards its fate while “all things on earth fly by and other nations and states gaze askance as they step aside and give her the right of way.”
Today, that reckless plunge describes not Russia but America and our craven satellites. As Israel Shamir concludes :
‘Russians have few ambitions. They do not want to rule the world, or even to dominate their neighbors. They do not want to fight the Empire. They would be content to be left in peace. But if pushed, and now they are being pushed, they will respond. In [the] Russian view, even the most hostile American politicians will desist before the Doomsday collision. And if not, let it be.’
The question that no one in Washington seemingly is asking themselves is not whether war is inevitable but whether the Russian leadership, despite their polite talk, have come to believe (rightly) that positive change in their “partners’” behavior is very unlikely and that therefore war is much more likely than not, according to the “logic” of things described by Doctorow. “Fifty years ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one rule: if a fight is inevitable you have to strike first,” Putin told journalists at the 2015 Valdai conference. Even if, from the west’s point of view war is not inevitable, what if the Russians have come to believe it is? (Suggested viewing: the films 1612 (2007) and the Taras Bulba (2009) as psychological war preparation of the population comparable to Sergei Eisenstein’s World War II-era Alexander Nevsky (complete with a western bishop with a swastika on his miter ) and the two-part Ivan the Terrible .)
Even more than a year ago , when the writing was already on the wall that Russiagate would turn out to be a whiff as far as nailing Trump goes, it was clear that in one important sense it had exceeded beyond all expectations : achieving permanent enmity between the US and Russia . Now, with the pointless investigation concluded, nothing has improved, nor can there be much expectation that it will. As Doctorow notes:
‘Indeed, no one wants war, neither Washington nor Moscow. However, the step by step dismantling of the channels of communication, of the symbolic projects for cooperation across a wide array of domains, and now dismantling of all the arms limitation agreements that took decades to negotiate and ratify, plus the incoming new weapons systems that leave both sides with under 10 minutes to decide how to respond to alarms of incoming missiles – all of this prepares the way for the Accident to end all Accidents. Such false alarms occurred in the Cold War but some slight measure of mutual trust prompted restraint. That is all gone now and if something goes awry, we are all dead ducks.’
Barring a miracle, this does not end well.

Among the American people—if not historians—John F. Kennedy regularly ranks as one of the best presidents in various opinion polls. There is, undoubtedly, something magnetic about the Kennedy administration, dubbed “Camelot” by the president’s wife, Jacqueline, soon after his assassination. However, one wonders if sentiments like this are little more than post-mortem nostalgia for a young, handsome president. JFK memorialization and mythology are such that it seems the memories contain something for everyone. Today, mainstream liberals tout his efforts on civil rights; defense hawks laud the toughness of his Cuban Missile Crisis stand; conversely, antiwar types insist that Kennedy was about to pull the U.S. troops out of Vietnam when his presidency was ended by an assassin’s bullets. To the scholar, however, much of the passionate praise for JFK seems unwarranted for a short administration that boasted so few tangible accomplishments.
A detached, probing view of the Kennedy years elucidates a generally popular president who was nevertheless a conventional Cold Warrior, a tool of the military-industrial complex, forever stalled on domestic legislation and reactive rather than proactive on black civil rights. This Kennedy—the human president—was also a highly political creature, motivated as often by partisan rancor and opinion polls as by the national interest. It is this Kennedy who fell into the Cold War-era trap that ensnared all Democratic presidents since and including Harry Truman; ever since Truman was accused of having “lost China,” a string of Democratic executives (that by no means ended with JFK) became obsessed with conveying “toughness,” avoiding the well-worn “Munich analogy” of appeasement , and out-hawking the Republicans in foreign affairs. It was a highly insecure Kennedy who escalated the doomed American war in Vietnam and terrorized Cuba’s popular government throughout his 34-month administration.
Perhaps forever Americans will remember these words from Kennedy’s sunlit inaugural address: “Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country. … Ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.” It is the final, less famous, clause in this passage that rings as problematic and, ultimately, hollow. From the perspective of a working-class Cuban, a Vietnamese peasant or an unemployed, disenfranchised black American, JFK was no champion of man’s “freedom.” Rather, he hedged on African American civil rights, accelerated warfare in Southeast Asia, cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans and obsessed himself with overthrowing the Castro administration in Cuba.
Our story, though, must not center only on the singular figure of Kennedy. “Camelot” went far beyond a compelling, photogenic politician, and far beyond his attractive wife and children. JFK assembled a team of youthful, energetic, elite advisers—many of them academics—forever christened the “best and the brightest.” Kennedy made a show of crafting this highly educated team, which included Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, national security adviser McGeorge Bundy, Secretary of State (and Rhodes scholar) Dean Rusk, informal adviser and Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and his brother Robert “Bobby” Kennedy as attorney general. Two of Kennedy’s choices might seem peculiar for a supposedly liberal administration—McNamara and Bundy were Republicans. The oddness did not stop at politics: The appointment of Bobby was unashamedly nepotistic, and the vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, was a rough-hewn—some would say crude—Southerner. Despite the odd mix, the glossy aura of the team seemed to stick, especially in Americans’ collective memory.
Let us consider, now, how this group of the “best and brightest” led an optimistic generation of Americans into leaving so much undone at home, blundering further into an unwinnable war and bequeathing an ever more dangerous world.
Rethinking Kennedy, as such, is also to normalize and provincialize him. Some will find much left to like about this less glamorous Kennedy, others far less. Regardless, this—the Kennedy of history, not fantasy—is the president who must inform America’s present moment.
Looks and Charm: Riding Charisma Into the White House
It began with a debate; with television cameras, to be more exact. Kennedy faced off against Richard Nixon, an anti-communist hawk and Dwight Eisenhower’s vice president, in the 1960 presidential election. Theirs was only the second televised U.S. presidential debate in history, and it mattered, as nearly all Americans (90%) now had a TV set. It was Sept. 26, 1960, and the face-off between the two candidates was broadcast live on CBS, NBC and ABC. It was an uneven fight. Nixon, though a highly skilled debater, had been sick (and hospitalized) for 12 days and was less prepared than usual. Nevertheless, most Americans who listened on the radio thought Nixon—trained in high school debate—had “won.” The more numerous TV viewers, however, favored Kennedy—freshly tanned and seemingly cool and composed—over Nixon, who appeared unshaven (he had refused to wear any heavy makeup).
The common memory of the 1960 election tends to contrast the youthful Kennedy (43 years old when he was elected) with the old Washington hand Nixon—but the vice president was only three years older than his rival! The coarse, insecure and petulant Nixon was seen by many as lacking style, making Kennedy seem the much younger man. Nixon had “no class,” JFK had said, and a Washington Post editor (and Kennedy supporter), Ben Bradlee, claimed that Nixon had “[n]o style, no style at all.” In the end the race was tight, one of the closest popular votes in American history, with JFK counting just a 13,000-vote margin of victory. So close was the election that Nixon believed the vote had been rigged and seriously considered contesting it. He may well have been right: Evidence existed for fraud in Illinois and Texas (Democratic vice presidential candidate Lyndon Johnson’s home state). “We won, but they stole it from us,” Nixon would say, and none other than a 13-year-old member of the Young Republicans named Hillary Rodham would volunteer to search for such fraud in Chicago.
That Kennedy would ultimately prevail seems obvious to modern readers. He has become, after all, a “liberal” phenomenon. Yet this was less than clear at the time. Indeed, JFK seemed, in 1960, a lukewarm choice for most Democrats in the party’s left wing. Progressives distrusted him due to his silence—and at times support—of McCarthyism when Kennedy was a senator. Others, Eleanor Roosevelt for instance, resented that black civil rights had not seemed a priority for Sen. Kennedy. Journalist Eric Sevareid of CBS complained of the Kennedy image itself, noting that Jack and his advisers were all “tidy, buttoned-down men … completely packaged products. The Processed Politician has finally arrived.” The Massachusetts senator’s wealth also drew the ire of some on the left. After losing to JFK in the key West Virginia primary contest, the prominent Minnesota senator (and later Johnson’s vice president) Hubert Humphrey complained, “You can’t beat a million dollars. The way Jack Kennedy and his old man [the multi-millionaire Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.] threw money around, the people of West Virginia won’t need any public relief for the next fifteen years.” This much was certain: The Kennedy of 1960 was no reincarnation of FDR. Such hagiography only came later.
Kennedy also ran a dirty, dishonest campaign. He campaigned against the outgoing incumbent Eisenhower administration from the right. He crowed about a nuclear “missile gap” with the Soviets—which was, by implication—Vice President Nixon’s fault as well—even though he had been told by high-ranking defense officials that none existed! Kennedy went with the lie. In reality, the U.S. then possessed overwhelming nuclear superiority; it counted the equivalent of 1,500 atomic bombs and 3,000 planes capable of carrying atomic bombs, while the Soviets had only 50 to 100 missiles and just 200 long-range bombers. It didn’t help that the gentlemanly Eisenhower kept mostly quiet: He refused to divulge the classified information that would have disproved the “gap”—and provided only lukewarm support for his vice president. In truth, Ike never much cared for Nixon.
Beyond Kennedy’s “redbaiting” over the nonexistent “missile gap” and his composure at the television debate, the candidate’s success was bolstered by his image. He inspired frenzy at campaign rallies, where groups of people—mainly women—jumped barriers and chased his car. A prominent journalist at the time, Haynes Johnson, described Kennedy as “the most seductive person I’ve ever met.” It was this mystique, a carefully cultivated portrait, that helped nudge JFK over the finish line. Personal appeal mattered! The historian Jill Lepore has concluded that “Kennedy prevailed, in part, because he was the first packaged, market-tested president, liberalism for mass consumption.” Furthermore, she noted that JFK certainly “looked more like a Hollywood movie star than like any man who had ever occupied the Oval Office.” So, for better or worse, it was John Kennedy who took the national helm in January 1961.
After the inauguration, the Kennedy family continued to awe the media and refined American elites. As the historian James Patterson noted, many reporters (themselves often liberal) “lavished attention” on the king and queen of Camelot. Jack had “unparalleled access” to the media, and he used it well. He was the first president to allow his press conferences to be televised live, and within six months some 75% of Americans had watched one. Among these TV viewers, 91% reported a favorable impression of Kennedy’s performances. The telegenic first lady , Jackie, 31 years old when her husband was elected president, would also proudly show off to reporters, and eventually America’s TV viewers, the elegant ways in which she redecorated the White House. Furthermore, the first couple made sure to invite famous artists, musicians, writers and other celebrities into their official home. No doubt this cultivation contributed to the fact that although he had serious politically opposition, Kennedy remained personally popular throughout his short tenure. This son of great wealth seemed to represent the hopes, dreams and sanguine ambition of an entire people. Whether Americans were duped—then and now—is another question entirely.
Great Expectations: A New Frontier at Home?
Although JFK is revered as a specifically liberal icon by most American Democrats and independent progressives, his actual record hardly warrants such a label. On the surface, of course, high expectations for legislative success seemed more than appropriate. The Democrats had captured both houses of Congress and the Oval Office in 1960, after all. Newsweek predicted that Kennedy would enjoy a “long and fruitful ‘honeymoon’ with the new Democratic 87th Congress.” Kennedy, Newsweek continued, “will find Congress so receptive that his record might well approach Franklin D. Roosevelt’s famous ‘One Hundred Days.’” Furthermore, the magazine noted that with the capable House Speaker Sam Rayburn in place, and the former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson on board as VP, matters couldn’t have been more favorable for the new administration.
It was not to be, and such dramatic and hyperbolic predictions would seem foolish within precious few years. Sure, the fervent Kennedy would count some modest early accomplishments. His creation of the Peace Corps encouraged a spirit of selflessness and international service in a hopeful young generation. Speaker Rayburn also ushered through Congress a small bump in the federal minimum wage and modest public funding for job training in depressed areas such as Appalachia. But that’s about it for “liberal” social and economic legislation. Most of the rest of Kennedy’s agenda was either blocked by Congress’ many conservatives, both Democrats and Republicans, or proved to be far more amenable to the political right than to the left. Furthermore, the supposedly enlightened Kennedy administration actually appointed fewer women to high-level federal postings than did his predecessors. His Cabinet, in fact, was the first since Herbert Hoover’s not to include a single woman. JFK, in short, was no political reincarnation of Franklin Roosevelt.
When it came to economics, for example, Kennedy was rather centrist and—for the times—right of center. His tax cut dropped the top marginal rate on individuals from 91% to 70%, and corporate rates from 52% to 48%. His predecessor, the Republican Eisenhower, had maintained higher taxes. Observers noted that the tax cut, though sold otherwise, mainly benefited the most well-off Americans. The only thing particularly Keynesian about Kennedy economics was the deficit-spending largesse he rained upon the military-industrial complex. Rapid increases in defense spending, as they usually do, provided a short-term bump for the health of the economy and lowered unemployment.
Kennedy’s domestic failures can be attributed to a combination of factors. Firstly, Jack was never very enthusiastic about “kitchen-table” issues. Even when he was in Congress (where he was known as a less-than-average senator and not particularly hard-working), his passion was for foreign policy over domestic issues. As president, Kennedy quickly tired of domestic affairs and never much cared for the more liberal lawmakers, referring to them as “honkers” and refusing to court them personally. This was apparent from the outset. As his adviser Theodore Sorensen diligently worked on the inaugural address, JFK burst in and exclaimed, “Let’s drop the domestic stuff altogether.” And he did! This famous speech is notable for almost completely ignoring homefront issues. This focus continued throughout his presidency. Kennedy, in fact, once noted to Nixon—of all people—that “[f]oreign affairs is the only important issue for a president to handle, isn’t it? … I mean, who gives a shit if the minimum wage is $1.15 or $1.25, compared to something like Cuba?” No doubt millions of U.S. workers did.
Congress, as it existed in the early 1960s, was stacked against the new president. The Democratic caucus was far from united. Indeed, the party was already coming apart—even if it would take later developments in civil rights and the Vietnam War to irrevocably break it. Conservative Southern Democrats continued, as they had since the latter part of the New Deal , to form reactionary coalitions with far-right Republicans. This alliance was usually strong enough to either vote down or fatally filibuster a liberal bill. And, since almost all leadership assignments in Congress were based on seniority and Southerners generally faced no Republican challengers in elections, the powerful committees were usually chaired by conservative Southern Democrats. These committee heads often “buried’ progressive—especially civil rights—legislation and refused to bring bills to the floor for open debate and voting. It was this coalition between Southern conservative Democrats and their Republican colleagues that killed all the potential laws favored by Kennedy’s progressive base, including health insurance for the aged and the creation of an urban affairs department.
Finally, Kennedy, though seen as “tough” on foreign affairs, didn’t demonstrate much courage on seminal domestic matters. He usually hedged bets and avoided controversy in order to bolster his image and avoid political losses for himself or for his party at the ballot box. Raised in a highly competitive family, JFK also hated to lose! Pressured by liberals in his party to fight for key legislation, he said, “There is no sense in raising hell, and then not being successful. There is no sense in putting the office of the presidency on the line on an issue, and then being defeated.” Only in the “manly” matters of foreign affairs would Jack go “all in!” As such, whatever the claims of his defenders, JFK’s legislative record was rather weak. Just 10 days before the assassination, The New York Times noted that “[r]arely has there been such a pervasive attitude of discouragement around Capitol Hill. … This has been one of the least productive sessions of Congress within memory.” Kennedy’s politicized caution in legislative decision-making had real consequences for certain desperate constituencies in America—none more prominent than African Americans fighting for civil rights.
Hope and Despair: Kennedy and Civil Rights
The partisans and apologists for the mythical Kennedy and his posthumous promoters cling to the false belief that as a Northern “liberal,” JFK was some sort of civil rights crusader. That he was not. Though Kennedy was, at times, genuinely horrified by the most overt Southern bigotry—and particularly shocked by images of young black protesters being attacked by police dogs in Birmingham, Ala.—for the most part the president hedged his bets and treated civil rights like any other political issue. He rarely stuck his neck out for the cause, and he took the side of righteousness only when it was politically palatable, or absolutely necessary, to do so.
The story of Kennedy and civil rights began with his 1960 presidential campaign. During the run-up to the 1960 election, the young civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. was imprisoned in Georgia for a minor traffic violation and sentenced to four months at hard labor. This draconian punishment was an obvious attempt to stifle the black civil rights movement, and African Americans and Northern liberals led a large public outcry. Both major-party presidential candidates felt the need to take action. Nixon worked behind the scenes to quietly intervene with Georgia’s governor but said nothing publicly. Kennedy, however, after receiving a telephone call from King’s wife, Coretta, decided to publicly express sympathy while brother Bobby telegraphed the judge and demanded King’s release. The move succeeded, and King was soon out on bail. The Kings and their backers were thankful and seem to have urged some black voters to back Kennedy in the November election. Whatever the cause, black voters chose the Democrats by a margin seven points higher than they had in 1956, potentially swinging a few key Northern states to Kennedy. Indeed, Eisenhower was later quoted as attributing the Republican defeat to “a couple of phone calls.”
But what motivated the Kennedys? That would remain to be seen. Civil rights activists, by the early 1960s, were becoming angrier about the slow pace of social and political change in America. The author James Baldwin summed up the feeling in 1961: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage all the time.” In that spirit, an increasing number of black students affiliated with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) took “freedom rides” on interstate buses throughout the South in order to test the recent court integration orders. In Alabama and Mississippi, the riders were brutally attacked time and again. Their leaders pleaded for federal protection from the new Kennedy administration. Such protection wasn’t initially forthcoming and arrived only slowly. Attorney General Robert Kennedy would later defend his slow reaction by blatantly lying, stating that he had not been notified beforehand about the protests.
In response to the “freedom rides” and other ongoing civil rights protests, the Kennedys generally remained in a cautious reactive mode. After all, though their hearts were—partly—sympathetic to the movement, they were still Democrats in the 1960s. As such, they feared the ire of the prominent and powerful Southern faction within the party and the loss of its votes. Jack would, no doubt, make many symbolic moves that improved on the civil rights record of the proceeding administration—hiring more blacks in federal jobs, appointing five African Americans as federal judges, including Thurgood Marshall, and instructing the Justice Department to heavily increase its oversight of voting rights cases. Nonetheless, more often, political considerations stifled Kennedy’s action on civil rights. He worried about formidable Southerners in Congress such as Sen. James Eastland of Mississippi, chair of the important Judiciary Committee. In fact, as a favor to Eastland, Kennedy would appoint four ardent bigots to federal judgeships in the Deep South. One of these judges once described African Americans in his courtroom as “niggers” and compared them to chimpanzees.
Furthermore, JFK took precious little tangible executive or legislative action during his first two years in office. He refused to introduce a civil rights bill—part of the 1960 Democratic platform—in 1961-62 and reneged on his campaign promise to declare an executive order to integrate federal housing. He would wait, he decided, until after the 1962 midterm elections before issuing the housing order or introducing a civil rights bill (the legislation would not pass until after his death). The bottom line remained the same as ever: Kennedy lacked passion for any domestic affairs, including civil rights, and moved forward only ever so cautiously on these issues.
Indeed, at times the president and his attorney general were concerned that the civil rights movement was moving too fast, and they sought to slow down racial unrest. During the height of the “freedom rides,” President Kennedy yelled to an aide, “Tell [the riders] to call it off!” When the riders refused, Kennedy called for a “cooling-off period.” This wouldn’t do for the activists, and CORE chief James Farmer retorted that African Americans “have been cooling off for 150 years. If we cool off any more, we’ll be in a deep freeze.”
Nor would Kennedy protect Martin Luther King Jr. from the obsessive hatred and harassment of FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover, convinced that King was a Soviet-run communist (he wasn’t), asked Attorney General Robert Kennedy to allow the bureau to tap the civil rights leader’s phones. Bobby acquiesced, and Hoover developed a “blackmail file” full of King’s sexual infidelities. (The FBI found that King and his staff had little to no connection with radical socialists.) Historians still speculate over why the Kennedys acquiesced to Hoover’s unwarranted harassment of King. What seems clear is that Hoover—who assiduously acquired dirt on all Washington figures—had one heck of a file on JFK. He knew about Kennedy’s extramarital affairs, including one with Judith Campbell—also the mistress of a Mafia gangster—and of the president’s concurrent collusion with the U.S. mob to assassinate Cuba’s Fidel Castro .
When Kennedy did worry about civil rights he did so cautiously and mainly out of foreign policy concerns. He feared that the U.S. could not lead the “free world” effectively if the Soviets could point to a hypocritical America that mistreated its black citizens. It was here that the issues of the Cold War and civil rights collided. So it was, then, in the aftermath of the police chief of Birmingham, Ala., unleashing dogs and water cannons on peaceful black protesters that Kennedy finally gave the order to prepare a civil rights bill and gave his most inspiring speech on race:
The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities. … If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant … if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote … if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place?
This was, no doubt, a powerful and persuasive bit of oratory, but even after the speech Kennedy remained cautious and sought to temper the movement. Indeed, many rights activists thought Kennedy’s bill was too late and didn’t go far enough—in fact, it did only cover desegregation of public facilities without addressing voting rights. It dealt, too, only with de jure segregation while ignoring de facto housing denials, police brutality and employment discrimination. Thus, when the bill went forward—and got caught up in the expected filibuster of Southern congressmen—civil rights activists continued (against the president’s will) to take direct actions.
Most famously, in May 1963, a coalition of civil rights leaders organized what they dubbed a massive March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (in their historical memory, Americans tend to, instructively, omit the “jobs” portion of that title!). The march was designed to force legislative action by shutting down the capital through prolonged sit-ins by many thousands of demonstrators. Young radicals, such as John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), also planned to join seasoned leaders (like MLK) on the stage and make fiery addresses. Kennedy and his brother were panicked, and they labored, effectively it turned out, to tone down the march. Older black moderates compromised under pressure from the president, and, in line with an agreement reached between the administration and the organizers of the protest, the march was limited to one day, liquor stores were closed and demonstrators were required to dress in “respectable clothing.” Kennedy aides even read the proposed speech of the firebrand Lewis and forced other black leaders to seek to soften the SNCC leader’s message and tone at the last moment. Lewis was furious but agreed. Had he not, administration officials stood ready to disconnect the public address system. Still, the march would go down as an important event in American history. It is celebrated by centrist “liberals” to this day.
Nonetheless, at the time many young black activists felt stifled and were frustrated by the lack of tangible results from the event. It didn’t change intransigent Southern opinions on Capitol Hill, and according to Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota “had not affected a single vote” on the proposed, and stagnated, Civil Rights Act. To the more radical demonstrators, the event had been a sellout of the movement: Its leaders, they charged, were little more than “Uncle Toms.” The fiery Black Muslim Malcolm X labeled it the “Farce on Washington” and declared:
It was the grass roots out there in the street. It scared the white man to death, scared the white power structure in D.C. to death. … They [the Kennedys] called in these national negro leaders that you respect and told them, ‘Call it off!” And Old Tom [MLK] said, ‘Boss, I can’t stop it because I didn’t start it. … I’m not even in it, much less at the head of it.’ And that old shrewd fox [JFK], he said, “If you ain’t in it, I’ll put you in it. I’ll put you at the head of it. I’ll endorse it. … This is what they did with the March on Washington … they joined it … they took it over. And as they took it over it lost its militancy. It ceased to be angry. It was a sellout. It was a takeover.
Malcolm X may have been hyperbolic and impassioned, but he wasn’t exactly wrong, either. The march had been, on some levels, precisely as he described. Kennedy’s adviser and later biographer Arthur Schlesinger Jr. admitted as much when he described Kennedy’s civil rights strategy and achievements in the wake of the march. “So in 1963,” he wrote, “Kennedy moved to incorporate the Negro revolution into the democratic coalition. …” To some extent he did, but at what cost? Undoubtedly, this co-opting of existing civil rights efforts contributed to sanitizing and de-radicalizing a vibrant grassroots movement.
So it was, when an assassin took the president’s life, that his proposed Civil Rights Act—like JFK’s entire record on this moral issue—remained in political deadlock on Capitol Hill. It would take a new president and ever more public sacrifice from grassroots black activists to get the act through. Kennedy could, and ultimately would, only do so much for racial equality in segregated America.
To the Brink: Kennedy’s Cold War A 1962 British political cartoon by Leslie Gilbert Illingworth, published right after the Cuban Missile Crisis, depicts President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev locked in confrontation. Their fingers are poised above buttons that would set off the hydrogen bombs they are sitting on.
In his abbreviated administration, Kennedy would fulfill his dream of being an ardent Cold Warrior, pressing the Russians and combating communism the world over. In this way, whatever his defenders later surmised, Kennedy was little different than—and was perhaps more hawkish than—his predecessors and successors. He regularly escalated crises, and, along with the foolish Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, brought the planet to the brink of destruction. JFK would leave behind an ever-colder Cold War, and he did little to usher in even a modicum of detente with the Soviets. The tragic part, the disturbing bit, is that Kennedy—an astute student of foreign affairs—seems to have known better; to have known that communism was no global monolith, that the Soviets and Chinese were actually enemies, that, in fact, the U.S. had a nuclear program far superior to the Soviets’. Even so, with such knowledge in hand, Kennedy went ahead anyway—whether due to his insecurity, political fortunes or toxic notions of masculinity—and faced off against the Russians at every turn and in many places.
Kennedy had already presented his simplistic views on the campaign trail. “The enemy,” he said, “is the communist system itself … increasing in its drive for world domination. … It is also a struggle for supremacy between two conflicting ideologies: freedom under God versus ruthless, godless tyranny.” Despite the obvious flaws, hyperbole and factual inaccuracy of this Manichaean worldview, Kennedy would use his often-quoted inaugural address to lay out America’s resultant plan of action. “We shall pay any price,” he exclaimed, “bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and success of liberty.” And, in a sense, Kennedy would have American troops, diplomats and spies do just that. What was less clear was whether the subjects, targets and victims of America’s liberty burden had desired U.S. intervention in the first place. Individual and collective notions of freedom and liberty are often complex, subjective and prisoners of context. In Kennedy’s (at least public) view there was no room for such nuance.
The Cold War only heightened under JFK for a number of reasons. One was his personal style as a competitive, aggressive statesman unwilling to back down. Another was the continued and growing power of a military-industrial complex that stepped up its demands for more contracts, more weapons and more cash throughout the administration. Finally, there was the provocative and often foolish behavior of Kennedy’s counterpart, Soviet Premier Khrushchev. Perhaps bolstered by recent successes in nuclear and space technology, or due to Kremlin readings of Kennedy’s youth and inexperience, Soviet policy during the Kennedy years was particularly combative, especially in the so-called Third World.
Kennedy took some of his action based, no doubt, on political considerations. In the election campaign he had run, dishonestly of course, against Eisenhower’s supposed “missile gap” and weakness toward the Soviets. Thus, the new president rolled out a strategy, known as “flexible response,” as a rebuke of Ike’s notion of “massive retaliation”—reliance on nuclear weapons over conventional war. Flexible response simply meant that the U.S. would maintain the capability and stated intent to check the Soviets anywhere, on any level, from diplomacy to espionage to limited war to outright land war to an apocalyptic nuclear exchange. In truth, however, the new strategy was little more than a gift to the Pentagon and arms industry. To wit, a pre-inaugural task force on national security determined that significant defense spending increases were both desirable and necessary. Such spending, even if it weren’t necessary, the task force concluded, would be a boon to the national economy—a sort of defense Keynesianism or military welfare state. The report concluded that “[a]ny stepping up of these [defense] programs that is deemed desirable for its own sake can only help rather than hinder the health of our economy.” Over the next three years, the military budget would grow 13%, from $47.4 billion to $53.6 billion. Defense spending for defense spending’s sake was to be the mantra of the Kennedy years.
If JFK loved and was enamored by the military—he famously formed the “Green Berets” Army Special Forces unit to conduct counterinsurgency missions, keeping a beret on his desk—he could barely stomach diplomats. For him, the diplomats at the State Department were little more than “striped-pants boys” who did little but shuffle papers. Indeed, as an undersecretary of state in the Kennedy administration complained, the president and his team were “full of belligerence” and “sort of looking for a chance to prove their muscle.” Kennedy (and Khrushchev) would ensure there was opportunity for that to happen. JFK also funded many other expensive ventures related to national security, such as the Apollo program—announced in response to the Soviet launch of its Sputnik satellite—to put U.S. astronauts on the moon. Though celebrated in retrospect, the U.S. space program cost $35 billion before an American set foot on the lunar surface in 1969 but produced, according to historian James Patterson, “relatively little scientific knowledge.” As a competition with the Russians, however, Apollo proved quite popular with the American people, and Kennedy knew it!
In his Cold War adventures, Kennedy—like many politicians of his postwar generation—became obsessed with the vague notion of “credibility,” the idea that anything that smacked of compromise with the Soviets displayed only “weakness,” or “softness,” and was comparable to Britain and France’s ignominious Munich deal with Hitler in 1938. For example, in preparing for a May 1961 summit meeting with Khrushchev, he said, “I’ll have to show him that we can be as tough as he is. … I’ll have to sit down and let him see who he is dealing with.” For JFK, it was a toxic vision of a face-off between alpha males on a world stage … with nukes. This flawed and simplistic thinking grounded just about every Kennedy decision in world affairs from 1961 to 1963. It would bring the world to the brink of destruction in the Cuban Missile Crisis and suck the U.S. military into a disastrous, unwinnable war in Vietnam. But that was yet to come.
Kennedy’s first disaster came in Cuba. And here the backstory mattered. Fidel Castro, a popular communist insurgent leader, had—in a direct threat to American business interests—overthrown the dictatorial U.S.-backed Batista regime in 1959. At that time, U.S. corporations controlled 80% of Cuba’s utilities, mines and oil refineries, 40% of its (mainstay) sugar industry and 50% of its railways. Furthermore, the Italian-American Mafia controlled many lucrative Cuban casinos. Once in power, the populist Castro confiscated millions of acres from the American United Fruit Co. and set up national systems of housing, education and land redistribution. These programs were highly popular among Cuban peasants, many of whom had suffered greatly under the U.S.-backed dictatorship. In response, the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations pressured the International Monetary Fund not to lend much needed money to Cuba. Unsurprisingly, in response, Cuba signed trade agreements with the Soviets, who agreed to buy all of the sugar crop—a crop that previously had gone mostly to the United States and that the U.S. was now refusing to buy.
So it was that Eisenhower and the even more Castro-obsessed Kennedy decided to destabilize and eventually overthrow the revolutionary Cuban government. All this, particularly the later U.S.-sponsored mercenary invasion, was a violation of the law. President Harry Truman’s earlier treaty with the Organization of American States had proclaimed that “[n]o state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of another state.” And, for the public record, the new American president—though he knew of ongoing plans to invade Cuba—seemed to admit as much. Kennedy told a press conference that “there will not be, under any conditions, any intervention in Cuba by United States armed forces.” It is true, of course, that when the Bay of Pigs invasion came it was mostly conducted with dissident Cuban mercenaries. Nonetheless, Americans piloted the supporting attack planes, armed the fighters and served as CIA spy liaisons leading up to and during the invasion. And, when four Americans piloting those planes were shot down and killed, the U.S. government refused to tell the families the truth about how their loved ones had died.
In addition to approving the disastrous Eisenhower plan to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy’s administration had actually considered even more drastic, immoral action. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, in fact, proposed Operation Northwood—a plan to conduct “ false flag ” terror attacks killing American civilians and then blame the deaths on Cuba—in order to drum up support for war. Kennedy and other civilian leaders refused to back the outlandish plan. However, its existence and acceptance by the top military service chiefs demonstrated the paranoia, frenzy and Cuba-obsession of the era.
Kennedy should have known better than to go through with the invasion. He hadn’t planned it himself, first of all, and had been given much dissenting advice from within his own administration. Arthur Schlesinger was against it, as was the liberal Adlai Stevenson, a two-time Democratic presidential candidate and Kennedy’s ambassador to the United Nations. So was the Marine Corps commandant, who warned that Cuba was 800 miles long and hard to conquer. As was the respected Sen. J. William Fulbright, who presciently predicted in a memo to the president that “[t]o give this activity covert support is of a piece with the hypocrisy and cynicism for which the U.S. is constantly denouncing the Soviet Union.” So too was Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles, who wrote Secretary of State Dean Rusk that “[o]ur national interests are poorly served by a covert operation. … This would be an act of war.” And so it was.
Though Cuban nationals would serve as ground troops in the ill-fated invasion, U.S. Navy destroyers escorted the landing crafts and U.S.-piloted planes provided the pre-emptive bombing raids. It wasn’t enough. Castro was tipped off by spies and even U.S. press reports and was prepared. Furthermore, the Cuban civilians living near the landing site were highly supportive of the generally popular Castro; there would not be—as the CIA and dissidents had wrongly predicted—an uprising around the Bay of Pigs. Within 24 hours Cuban fighters and Soviet-made tanks operated by Cubans checked the invasion and inflicted heavy casualties on the attackers. Most surrendered, many were killed.
When the dissidents realized they were in serious trouble they requested additional airstrikes, and a stoic but rattled Kennedy balked. For this some U.S. military leaders would never forgive him. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Lyman Lemnitzer, called the decision “reprehensible” and “almost criminal.” This was an overstatement. What the military brass seemed unable to comprehend was that Cuba’s new leader was popular, and no token force of a mere 1,400 dissidents (only 100 or so trained soldiers) could overthrow Castro. That would have required a direct U.S. military commitment and a risk of war with Russia. In reality, Kennedy was, not for the last time, poorly served by the assessments of his Pentagon and CIA spymasters. The Bay of Pigs fiasco was their failure as much as that of the actual invaders.
Still, Jack and Bobby Kennedy wouldn’t quit. The brothers seemed genuinely obsessed with Castro and determined to save face and win back the ever-vital “credibility” they had lost in the Bay of Pigs. Jack would put Bobby, the attorney general, personally in charge of the secretive Operation Mongoose, a CIA-coordinated program to damage the Castro regime. “My idea,” Bobby said, “is to stir things up on the island with espionage, sabotage, general disorder.” And indeed he did, as agents contaminated Cuban sugar exports, bombed factories, led paramilitary raids and attempted (33 times) to assassinate a sovereign head of state, Castro. All of this was illegal under the Truman-era treaty or any standard application of international law, and it constituted, truthfully, state terrorism.
The unintended consequences of U.S. bellicosity toward Cuba were manifold. The Bay of Pigs failure heightened tensions with the Soviets and added a personal pugilism to the rivalry between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Furthermore, the U.S. neo-imperial invasion whipped up Cuban nationalism and increased Castro’s popularity. Furthermore, both Cuba’s leader and his ally Khrushchev were now certain the Kennedy administration intended to invade the island with U.S. forces and depose the government. Castro pleaded for help and got it. Soon after the Bay of Pigs action, the Soviets began sending thousands of military personnel to the island and by the spring of 1962 had armed Cuba with missiles, some of them nuclear. A new, ever more dangerous crisis would result.
It must be said, first, that Khrushchev, ultimately, had foolishly blundered in secretly stationing nuclear missiles just 90 miles from Florida. The net gain to his ability to strike the United States homeland was far too negligible to warrant the risk of a U.S. invasion, airstrike or even an accidental escalation by either side of the conflict. He was placing Soviet credibility on the line, on the global stage, with neither an effective exit strategy nor the (thank God) willingness and intent to actually wage nuclear war. For these and other perceived failures, eventually, the Soviet Politburo would remove the premier and replace him in 1964.
Still, one can—given the context—understand Khrushchev’s motives. The United States had been the illegal aggressor in the failed invasion of Cuba and seemed intent on overthrowing a Soviet ally; besides, the U.S.-led NATO military alliance had long encircled the Soviet Union with nuclear-armed bases adjacent to Russian territory. Should the U.S. really go berserk over one such base in the Caribbean? As he stated before the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev argued that “[t]he Americans surrounded our country with military bases and threatened us with nuclear weapons. Now the Americans will learn what it feels like to have enemy missiles pointed at you.” He wasn’t wrong, but that didn’t make his move in Cuba a smart play.
Kennedy would later be memorialized for his cool handling of the ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis, and it must be admitted that he did ignore his more bellicose advisers and ultimately avoid a nuclear war. Still, he operated within rather narrow bounds of imagination, and must bear some of the responsibility for how close the world came to destruction. In many ways he got lucky. Firstly, JFK never even seriously considered early advice from liberals in his own party like Adlai Stevenson, who recommended immediate, reasonable compromise: foreign demilitarization in Cuba, a no-invasion pledge by the U.S., a removal of Soviet missiles followed by a concurrent removal of similar U.S. missiles in Turkey. After all, Stevenson asked, why risk nuclear war over a few missiles in Cuba when both great powers already possessed enough long-range ICBMs to destroy the other many times over? But the Kennedys would have none of it. They wouldn’t “appease” the Soviets.
Besides, there were political considerations. Congressional midterm elections were imminent, and JFK couldn’t have the Republicans attacking him from the right for being “soft” on Russia. No, he decided, there would be no secret tit-for-tat deals—he would publicly denounce the Soviet move and place a naval quarantine around the island. There would be no further shipments of Soviet military equipment, and Khrushchev would have to be the one to back down. It ultimately worked out, of course, despite many close calls (the shooting down of a U.S. spy plane pilot, and the timely refusal of a Soviet submarine captain to fire a nuclear torpedo when a U.S. Navy destroyer targeted his vessel with what turned out to be non-lethal depth charges), and thus we forget how dangerous a move Kennedy had made. Absolute terror gripped the world before the Soviet ships approaching the quarantine turned around and Khrushchev eventually folded. The famous American evangelist Billy Graham even preached about the “end of the world” during the crisis. America’s NATO allies were terrified equally by the escalatory moves of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
To the president’s credit, Kennedy was not taken in by the staggering lunacy of many of his advisers, especially some in the military. His national security adviser and his vice president called for immediate (no warning) airstrikes on the Cuban missile sites. So, eventually, did every single member of the military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. Jack opposed them, as did Bobby, who astutely noted, “We’ve talked for 15 years about a first strike, saying we’d never do that.” To launch such a strike would make his brother the “Tojo of the 1960s,” Bobby said in referring to the official who was Japan’s prime minister and head of the military at the time of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.
What’s interesting, in retrospect, is that eventual agreement hashed out between the Soviets and the Americans ultimately resembled the early deal that the “dovish” Stevenson had proposed. The Soviets would pull out all the nuclear weapons, and the U.S. would lift the quarantine and promise not to invade the island (though, the record shows, it did continue its espionage and harassment). That was the public end of the deal, the one that made the USA look strong and allowed Kennedy to boast that he had “cut his [Khrushchev’s] balls off!” But secretly, Kennedy had actually opened negotiations to remove U.S. mid-range missiles from Turkey—which were becoming obsolete anyway. The weapons were indeed removed by April 1963.
Kennedy’s military advisers, in particular, were incensed by the deal. Air Force Gen. Curtis “Bombs Away” Lemay crowed “We’ve been had!” to the president’s face and banged on the table. The deal was, he exclaimed, “the greatest defeat in our history. … We should invade [Cuba] today!” It wasn’t—by any stretch of the imagination—but for Lemay (the war criminal who had firebombed Japanese civilians in 1945) and an entire generation of military intellectual mediocrities groomed in the early Cold War, the deal was a personal defeat, a lost chance to use their “toys” in a once-and-for-all shootout with the Ruskies! As for the (mainly civilian) deaths that would ensue if the great powers did go to war over Cuba, that mattered not, according to another Air Force general, Thomas Power, who thundered to the president, “Why are you so concerned with saving their lives? The whole idea is to kill the bastards. … At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win.” It was this level of absurdity from some of his most senior advisers that Kennedy had to deal with. This, too, helps explain history’s kinder view—in hindsight—of JFK’s crisis leadership.
The president, even if his blunders and aggression toward Cuba had ultimately caused the crisis he “solved,” did seem to learn one valuable lesson from the standoff: Don’t trust the military! The military and CIA had called for open invasion and escalation during both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis. They, along with many of Kennedy’s civilian advisers, seemed genuinely prepared to fight it out with the nuclear-armed Soviets over a relatively small Caribbean island. Speaking about the Joint Chiefs’ unanimous advice to bomb and invade Cuba, Kennedy curtly remarked, “These brass hats have one great advantage, if we … do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them they were wrong.” And, finally, late in his presidency, JFK also had something important in mind that he never got the chance to impart. “The first thing I’m going to tell my successor,” he explained, “is watch the generals, to avoid feeling that just because they’re military men, their opinions on military matters are worth a damn.” He was an intelligent man, Jack Kennedy, capable of complex thinking and great achievements. His flashes of brilliance and lucidity—such as this appraisal of his military leaders—demonstrate his potential.
Unfortunately, as substantiated in both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, he was just as apt to cause as solve a crisis. He avoided escalation of the ill-advised mercenary invasion he green-lighted; he called off the military attack dogs when they sought to start a war over a missile crisis he and his flawed Cold Warrior mentality helped cause. Such were the tragedies and triumphs of John F. Kennedy—stuck in the Cold War box and unable to escape his outdated conceptions of masculinity and toughness, as well as his competitiveness and insecurity.
* * *
Kennedy’s blunders included the escalation of the war in Vietnam. He would continue to back a corrupt South Vietnamese regime that lacked legitimacy and funnel ever more military advisers into the country until there were some 16,000 on the ground. He even tacitly backed an illegal military coup that overthrew and murdered the formerly U.S.-backed president of South Vietnam. In essence, Kennedy’s Cold War bellicosity and flawed Manichean worldview would—just as they almost sparked a nuclear war over Cuba—lead the U.S. inexorably deeper into its greatest military fiasco and defeat in a place few Americans could find on a map: Vietnam. But that is a story best told comprehensively across several administrations, and it will be the topic of our next segment in the series.
What, then, must we conclude about Kennedy? Perhaps a comparison is in order. Like a later young president who promised hope and possessed both a handsome family and cultivated taste—Barack Obama—Kennedy seemed the polite, enlightened choice for the self-styled elites. His knack with the media, his pop culture chic and his propensity to surround himself with the famous and the celebrated invoked praise and admiration from America’s supposed cultured class. This style, this image, allowed many Americans to ignore his relative lack of substance. What, truly, did Kennedy do to improve life for impoverished peasants in the Third World, disenfranchised and terrorized blacks tilling sharecrop soil or suffering in urban ghettos, for the long-oppressed people of Cuba, for, well, anyone in real need? The answers can be argued. What is clear is that it is time to re-evaluate Kennedy and hold him to the same standard as presidents who were not martyred. His death was a tragedy among America’s population, but for countless millions across the world, so was his presidency.

PARIS, April 6. /TASS/. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations called on Moscow to be compliant with its international obligations, says the final communique released after the ministers’ two-day meeting in France’s Dinard.
“We urge Russia to live up to its international obligations, as well as its responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council (UNSC), to uphold international peace and security and respect territorial arms embargoes,” the ministers stated reiterating their standard accusations against Russia.
“We are committed to protecting and promoting the rules-based international order. This stands against the background of a pattern of irresponsible destabilizing and malign Russian behavior, including interference in other countries’ democratic systems,” the communique said.
The G7 will continue to “bolster our capabilities to address other threats from Russia in the areas of cybersecurity, strategic communications and counter-intelligence.”
They are content with the measures taken “to constrain Russian hostile intelligence-driven activity and to enhance our collective security.”
“Notwithstanding, we will continue to engage with Russia on addressing regional crises and global challenges. We are increasingly concerned about the grave situation of human rights in Russia, and will continue to stand in solidarity with human rights defenders. We are committed to engage with members of civil society and in people-to-people contact,” the G7 foreign ministers said in their joint communique.

ISTANBUL, April 6. /TASS/. Having purchased Russia’s S-400 missile defense systems, Turkey will ensure security not only of own borders but also of the European Union and NATO member states, Omer Celik, spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, said on Saturday.
“You know perfectly well that initially we had wanted to buy US Patriot air defense missile systems, but the United States offered unfavorable conditions for a loan. In this regard, we struck a deal with Russia on the S-400,” Celik told reporters, among them was a TASS correspondent.
“Certainly, we are acquiring them first and foremost to ensure protection of our own borders from attacks from Syria. However, we will simultaneously defend the borders of the European Union and NATO,” he stressed. “The S-400 systems will be delivered this July. We will not refuse from them.”
Celik pointed out that Ankara was forced to strengthen its capabilities in air defense after “certain NATO partners had pulled their units with the Patriot air defense systems from Turkey several years ago.”
“When missiles were launched into the Kilis region from Syria, nobody offered us anything to prevent such attacks,” the spokesman said.
Celik mentioned the Western partners’ policy of double standards.
“Turkey and Greece are NATO members. Greece has the S-300 and we will soon have the S-400. Why should it be a problem for us? Turkey is a sovereign state and it is wrong to ban us from using the S-400 we are buying,” Celik said.
It was reported in November 2016 that Turkey was in talks with Russia on purchasing S-400 air defense missile systems. The contract’s signing was confirmed by the Russian side on September 12, 2017 and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan announced at the time that Turkey had already made an advance payment under the contract. The United States is taking active efforts to prevent Turkey from purchasing Russia’s S-400 air defense systems.

DOHA /Qatar/, April 7. /TASS/. Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan develop dynamically, including in a parliamentary field, Russian State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said at a meeting with Kazakhstan’s Mazhilis (parliament) Speaker Nurlan Nigmatulin on Saturday.
“The Russian-Kazakh relations are dynamically developing, including in the parliamentary field. Kazakhstan’s First President Nursultan Nazarbayev played a huge role in that,” Volodin said at their meeting on the sidelines of the 140th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Qatar.
Nigmatulin assured Volodin that Kazakhstan would continue the policy of a strategic partnership with Moscow in all fields.
“Russia is a major strategic partner for Kazakhstan. We have achieved very good results in multifaceted cooperation in various fields. So the recent change in Kazakhstan’s top political leadership will in no way affect our good-neighborly relations,” he said.
A delegation of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament) is on an official visit to Doha on April 6-7.

Union Locals Build Support for the Green New Deal’s “Just Transition”,www.therussophile.org,candice,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/union-locals-build-support-for-the-green-new-deals-just-transition.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
Undeterred by the Senate’s recent dismissal of the Green New Deal, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) recently accepted Congressional Coal Caucus member Rep. Andy Barr’s (R-Kentucky) invitation to tour a coal mine in his district and meet with mine workers and voters in Appalachia to talk about how they could benefit from the resolution’s “just transition.”
That transition, as laid out in Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s plan, would include a federal jobs guarantee for U.S. workers. This includes former fossil fuel sector workers as they transition to build the infrastructure needed to shift the country to 100 percent renewable energy within 10 years.
Even as many of the resolution’s proponents are now turning their focus away from passing the Green New Deal on the heels of March’s procedural vote in the Senate, climate change legislation remains a priority for the Democratic Party. The resolution’s supporters are now looking at multiple bills in hopes of advancing standalone elements of the broader initiative as grassroots groups like the Sunrise Movement continue efforts to build support for the plan. Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
But what exactly would a Green New Deal or another piece of climate chance legislation focused on transitioning to renewables mean for the Kentucky coal workers Ocasio-Cortez is set to meet?
The plan backs union jobs and outlines commitments to “wage and benefit parity for workers” affected by the energy transition. The resolution also supports collective bargaining rights for workers while calling for “trade rules, procurement standards, and border adjustments” with strong labor protections.
Still, labor leaders like those on the AFL-CIO’s Energy Committee remain skeptical of the resolution’s call for a just transition. The Energy Committee sent an open letter to the resolution’s authors, Sen. Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts) and Ocasio-Cortez, blasting the resolution last month. “We will not stand by and allow threats to our members’ jobs and their families’ standard of living go unanswered,” wrote Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, and Lonnie Stephenson, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
The March 8 letter comes on the heels of a February letter sent to the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-New Jersey), and its ranking member, Rep. Greg Walden (R-Oregon), outlining the “grave concerns about unrealistic solutions such as those advocated in the ‘Green New Deal,’” by seven unions representing workers in the building industry.
The strongest support for the plan has come from the joint executive board of the 163,000-member East Coast property service union, 32BJ SEIU, which passed its own resolution in February in support of the Green New Deal. Union President Héctor Figueroa recently condemned the Senate’s procedural vote to reject the plan, saying in a statement that, “Creating good jobs in this exciting new industry is as doable as it is necessary, but only if we work together in unity rather than giving into Washington’s divisive tactics.” Rank-and-File Support Is Key
But even while national leadership among unions like the IBEW and others have shown an early reluctance toward such legislation, leaders at the local level are working to build support for the plan among their membership in hopes of pushing their unions in the right direction. “The thought of losing their jobs is so horrifying to them that they can’t even wrap their head around it.”
Dave Campbell, treasurer-secretary of United Steelworkers (USW) Local 675 in Los Angeles, whose membership largely works in oil production and refining, told Truthout he is working through legitimate critiques that have been raised by the local’s members whose livelihoods would be impacted by a transition to green jobs. “The thought of losing their jobs is so horrifying to them that they can’t even wrap their head around it,” he said.
While USW has not taken a position on the Green New Deal at the national level, Campbell, who is on union leave from Chevron, has worked to build support among his local’s membership by engaging with leaders of the union’s NextGen program, which works to educate the union’s youth members. In fact, his local’s executive board even recently passed a resolution in support of the Green New Deal that was adopted last month by the second-largest Central Labor Council in the country, the AFL-CIO’s LA County Federation of Labor.
How environmentalists and Green New Deal proponents respond to workers’ concerns, Campbell says, is paramount in building the critical mass of support from labor needed to move forward on any comprehensive climate legislation.
Among those concerns is whether such workers will continue to be paid what they’re currently earning and maintain comparable benefits. Further, some workers have expressed skepticism about renewable jobs, saying renewable energy firms have been less gracious than the oil and gas sector on wages. Their criticism “is right on the money,” Campbell says, “But that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to enact a Green New Deal that holds up the concepts of just transition for workers and the community.”
Campbell invited members of the local’s NextGen committee to attend a convergence in LA being put on by the Labor Network for Sustainability (LNS), which trains environmentalists in how to effectively engage with the labor movement. LNS is currently in dialogue with some of the AFL-CIO Energy Committee unions like the IBEW that authored last month’s letter.
LNS Founding President Joe Uehlein tells Truthout that these unions can’t be “pushed” on this issue. Instead, he says, it’s much more crucial that rank-and-file members engage with leadership in such a way as to make clear that a just transition is in their own self-interest. The real job killer, according to Uehlein, isn’t the Green New Deal — it’s climate change itself. A federal jobs guarantee “is the best way to tighten labor markets, which then forces wages and benefits up because companies are competing to get the best workers.”
Further, he adds that, “all these good fossil fuel jobs did not start as ‘good’ jobs. No job does. So there’s a certain level of disingenuousness to say, ‘Well, those renewable energy jobs don’t pay as much.’” The Green New Deal’s federal jobs guarantee, he says, “is the best way to tighten labor markets, which then forces wages and benefits up because companies are competing to get the best workers. That allows unions then to do their core function the best, which is negotiate good contracts that ripple through the economy.”
LNS Executive Director Michael Guerrero also stresses that the IBEW is a good example of a nationally reticent union that, at the local level, has gotten out in front of the issue in places like California, where some locals have developed apprenticeship and training programs “that have shown that it’s possible to actually do this work” with prevailing wages and benefits.
“So models are already there, where unions are taking the lead on a transition that works for workers in these industries,” Guerrero says. “That’s what it’s going to take: It’s going to take the unions stepping up and organizing in these industries to strengthen them, and if the Green New Deal can create the political space for that to happen, than I think it helps everybody.”
But if labor doesn’t get on board and play a leadership role soon, he says, then some unions are going to be left behind as policies are shaped without them. “This is an all-in moment,” he stresses. “Models are already there, where unions are taking the lead on a transition that works for workers in these industries.”
Likewise, Uehlein adds that it’s workers who must make sure that the resolution recognizes collective and non-collective bargaining forms of worker representation. “It needs to have things in it that unions would look at and see that as a path to the future for them,” he says. A Green New Rural Electrification Administration?
The New York City-based Trade Unions for Energy Democracy (TUED) is another organization currently in dialogue with a number of unions about the Green New Deal’s objectives. TUED Director Sean Sweeney says it’s just a matter of separating the good-faith criticisms of progressive labor unions from those of energy-sector unions looking to position themselves to benefit from the Trump administration’s energy export agenda.
These unions — such as the Laborers’ International Union of North America, which support the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, for instance — can’t be won over. Meanwhile, progressive unions with earnest concerns are looking dig in to the resolution’s promises a bit more programmatically to determine what’s actually possible at this stage. “Those unions tend to like what AOC is saying; they like the new Democrats coming through, and they’re in constructive conversations with them,” Sweeney says.
For him, the more important question is whether the renewable energy sector and, potentially, emerging carbon-capture technology, will come under public control. He points to the original New Deal’s Rural Electrification Administration (REA), which Congress backed in 1936 by passing legislation that provided federal loans to member-owned cooperative electric companies to power the country’s rural areas. “If we’re trying to find some way to make money out of it then it’s a neoliberal approach that can’t solve the problem.”
The privatized renewable energy sector, Sweeney says, has completely failed to survive without subsidies, and has only recently become cost effective, in part, because of cheap imports of materials from China and a reliance on non-union labor. “Emissions reductions are a public good. That means everybody should contribute to it because everybody will benefit, and if we’re trying to find some way to make money out of it then it’s a neoliberal approach that can’t solve the problem.”
Sweeney says Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1935 REA represents the type of “means of implementation” that public transport, construction and electricity unions working in the energy sector would understand. Instead of heading in this direction, he says, “too many people in the environmental movement believe that carbon pricing is a good idea,” even though it does not reduce emissions or change investment practices, and passes carbon prices “downstream to consumers.”
Indeed, organizations like the BlueGreen Alliance — which partners unions like USW with environmental groups — backed a 2009 cap-and-trade bill , but still has not taken a position on the Green New Deal, recently denying Truthout ’s request for comment. The organization’s hesitancy comes after the Laborer’s International Union quit the alliance in 2012 amid clashes over the Keystone XL pipeline.
“The environmental narrative has filled a gap for labor so the progressive unions have tended to support the environmental narrative, including the progressive-sounding ‘polluter-pays’ principle, but in fact it’s the ‘worker-pays’ principle,” Sweeney told Truthout .
Uehlein cautions, however, that bringing newly created jobs into the public sector could drive private-sector unions farther away. “I think it would create a different kind of a fight within organized labor than what we already have over what a Green New Deal is.”
Further, publicly reticent energy-sector unions are backing emerging technologies for capturing carbon from the atmosphere, which the Green New Deal resolution doesn’t explicitly rule out of its 10-year plan.
While the fossil fuel industry and its energy-sector unions may be eyeing carbon capture as critical to their ability to continue polluting in the future, scientific evidence is mounting that large-scale implementation of such technology may be necessary for reducing emissions globally. “Unions can call for carbon capture, but I think it’s a ritualistic call.”
“Unions can call for carbon capture, but I think it’s a ritualistic call, because unless the economic problems and the problems of storage are solved, it’s a non-starter,” Sweeney says. “It becomes an environmental policy [for unions] because they don’t have one. They can’t just say, ‘Well, carry on burning coal.’”
Still, such technology, developed to scale, would necessitate publicly controlled infrastructure in any case, argues Uehlein, because it’s not likely that it could become cost competitive so quickly. “It’s kind of like when the unions say, ‘the Green New Deal is unrealistic,’ I would say carbon capture and sequestration is equally unrealistic, so if we’re going to choose our ‘unrealistic’ paths, I’d go with the Green New Deal,” Uehlein says. “The labor movement, unless it changes, dramatically, quickly, is going to alienate an entire generation of young people.”
The Sunrise Movement — which largely touched off support for the resolution after young members occupied House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office in November — is continuing to build support for the resolution with its #road2GND tour. Beginning this month, activists will hold more than 100 town halls across the U.S. ahead of the 2020 election.
“The labor movement, unless it changes, dramatically, quickly, is going to alienate an entire generation of young people who will be going to work someday. That’s I think just a tragic mistake for organized labor to make,” Uehlein says. Copyright © Truthout. May not be reprinted without permission ."
Settler Colonialism Lurked Beneath the Christchurch Massacre,www.therussophile.org,candice,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/settler-colonialism-lurked-beneath-the-christchurch-massacre.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
In the commentary connecting the bloody dots between the mosque massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the 2017 one in Quebec, Canada — an association made by the Christchurch attacker himself, by inscribing the name of the Quebec mosque shooter on one of his weapons — the fact that both acts of carnage occurred in white supremacist, settler-colonial states has received scant attention.
Emergent critiques of Islamophobia as a systemic, transnational phenomenon have tended to stop short of any truly materialist analysis and any deep historical reading of the conditions that support these mobilizations of anti-Muslim sentiment in settler societies like Canada and New Zealand (known to the Indigenous Māori people as Aotearoa) — in which the racism deployed to rationalize European genocide against Indigenous nations has long been intertwined with anti-Muslim as well as anti-Black, anti-Asian and anti-Jewish discourses. For example, the Doctrine of Discovery that continues to constitute the foundations of colonial sovereignty in settler states emerged from papal edicts permitting the seizure of non-Christian lands and property during the Crusades.
The relationship between Islamophobia and settler colonialism means that anti-Muslim violence cannot be addressed simply as a problem of “hate crime,” or ameliorated by more draconian immigration restrictions or anti-terrorist measures — the very types of measures through which the white settler state has been constructed. Indeed, our fear is that such initiatives have (and will continue to) fan the flames of Islamophobia, with the combined arsenal of both formal and informal state apparatuses and private and ad hoc vigilante-type violence. The stories you care about, right at your fingertips

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s relationship of solidarity with Muslim communities in the wake of Christchurch has been beautiful to watch; our concern here is with the deeper structures of power and violence that too often remain out of sight. A similar set of national mythologies works to render the persistent and permeating presence of settler colonialism invisible in both Canada and Aotearoa/New Zealand: Both are represented as predominantly peaceful, pluralistic societies led by progressive governments, in stark and flattering contrast to their more powerful and prejudiced neighbors (the United States and Australia).
While both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and New Zealand Prime Minister Ardern have been praised for the alacrity with which they condemned the mosque massacres in their respective countries as acts of “terrorism,” the framing of “terrorism” serves to analytically sever the apparently exceptional violence of the far right from the everyday racial violence embedded in the very structure of the settler state itself. The framing of “terrorism” serves to analytically sever the apparently exceptional violence of the far right from the everyday racial violence embedded in the very structure of the settler state itself.
Media commentaries depicting the Christchurch shooter’s manifesto as a “mirror image” of the discourse of ISIS perform a similar function. They imply that the mass violence at Christchurch can only be understood as an emanation of a foreign phenomenon — perpetuating Islamophobic representations of Muslims as the benchmark for barbarism — as if the historical ledgers of European colonialization are not replete with atrocities of far greater magnitude: deliberate mass killing and maiming, starvation, enslavement, torture and concentration camps.
The frequent description of the Christchurch killings in international media as the deadliest incident in Aotearoa/New Zealand’s history, portrayed as otherwise exceptionally irenic, erases events like the 1864 massacre at Rangiaowhia, in which as many as 100 Indigenous Māori were slaughtered in a military raid on a shelter for non-combatant women and children.
The assault was part of a war launched to dispossess the Māori of their land, a process that has continued by less overtly bellicose means such as extinguishment of title through land claim settlement processes — a tactic also employed by the government of Canada. As eminent Māori academic Margaret Mutu has observed, “large sections of the white population have strongly amnesic tendencies about the atrocities committed as they illegally seized control of huge tracts of Māori land.”
White supremacist ideology is not a pale, inverted reflection of ISIS, but a projection of settler colonialism’s own inherent systems of racism. The Christchurch mosque attacker’s manifesto, “The Great Replacement,” not only references memes of the contemporary far right, but also evokes themes deeply rooted in settler colonial discourse.
Concerns about inadequate white birthrates, for example, not only incensed the Christchurch shooter, but also motivated 19th- and 20th-century British imperial projects to transplant single women to the colonies to multiply the settler population; as one of the “founding fathers” of the colonial project in Aotearoa/New Zealand, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, remarked: “in colonization [unlike nearly every other pursuit that occupies mankind in masses] women have a part so important that all depends on their participation in the work.”
Anxieties over environmental depredation — a recurrent topic in the Christchurch manifesto, in which the problem is attributed to an influx of racialized immigrants — produced government conservation projects that ultimately served to further increase settler control over natural resources in the name of rectifying the effects of ecocide largely produced by European settler exploitation in the first place. (For example, Aotearoa/New Zealand’s forest cover was denuded by 50 percent from the beginnings of intensive British settlement in 1840 to 1900, while in Canada the rate of destruction of the boreal forest is greater than in the Amazon). White supremacist ideology is not a pale, inverted reflection of ISIS, but a projection of settler colonialism’s own inherent systems of racism.
Fears of being inundated by non-white migrants not only stimulated 20th-century “ White Australia ,”“ White New Zealand ” and “ White Canada ” immigration policies, but also acts of murderous violence by individual white supremacists like Lionel Terry, who shot dead an elderly Chinese man in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1905. “I will not under any consideration allow my rights and those of my brother Britons to be jeopardised by alien invaders: to make this perfectly plain I have this evening put a Chinaman to death…. I have nothing to say except that my action was right and justifiable,” Terry wrote in a letter to the local governor — articulating a logic of racial entitlement echoed one century later by the Christchurch shooter, who attempted to justify his rampage as an act of self-defense.
The transnational conceptualization of white identity invoked by the Christchurch shooter to explain why he should not also be considered an immigrant invader from Australia is not an innovation, but a continuation of 19th-century imperial formulations of whiteness as a global category. “The imagined community of white men was transnational in its reach … [and] sought, in effect, dominance over four continents,” as Australian historians Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds write in Drawing the Global Colour Line: White Men’s Countries and the International Challenge of Racial Equality .
The offensiveness of the “great replacement” thesis — that a “pure” white race is slowly but steadily being “replaced” by other races through migration and inter-marriage, but also by being ideologically challenged as well — lies not only in its representation of Muslims as an existential threat, but also in its erasure of the fact that the white populations supposedly being replaced in places like Aotearoa/New Zealand are themselves the product of a concerted effort to replace, in state-endorsed systematic processes, Indigenous nations. Over the course of the 19th century, the Māori population was halved from around 100,000 to 45,500, while the number of settlers in New Zealand increased from 1,000 to 770,000; Māori communities are now reduced to only 5-6 percent of their original land base.
The manifesto’s repeated denigration of racialized immigrants (particularly Muslims) as “invaders” and “colonizers,” without any apparent sense of irony, reflects the pervasive normalization of the idea that settler colonies are properly “white men’s countries”— a normalization reproduced in analyses undertaking to allay racist fears of “white genocide” or “replacement” by assuring white communities that they remain dominant and have nothing to fear from Muslim birthrates. Repeated denigration of racialized immigrants reflects the pervasive normalization of the idea that settler colonies are properly “white men’s countries”
The idea of an oxymoronic “native White” population in danger of being replaced also drove the shootings at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as the murder of civil rights activist and attorney Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia. Both attacks occurred in the United States, another settler country founded and nurtured by the genocide of Indigenous peoples and the enslavement and incarceration of Black people, as well as the labor of Latinx and Asian bodies, which were then faced with deportation and exclusion once their work was done.
Robert Bowers , the killer in Pittsburgh, had used social media to spawn hatred, calling immigrants “invaders,” distributing racist memes and asserting that Jews were the “enemy of white people.” Before starting on his rampage, he posted, “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.”
In Charlottesville, the fact that statues of Confederate generals were going to be removed prompted one of the largest gatherings of white supremacists in recent memory. They too yelled out, “We will not be replaced,” along with anti-Semitic slurs. When James Alex Fields Jr. drove his car into a crowd of protesters, injuring scores of people and killing Heyer, it was with the intention of clearing out those he felt were endangering the white race.
The president of the United States has in fact himself been one of the most vocal proponents of exclusion, deportation, indefinite confinement and punishment. But rather than attribute any of these behaviors to a single person or a “phobia” that has infected swathes of the population, it is critical to recognize that the very foundation of these nations is sunk into the bedrock of racism. The ideologies of racism are manifested not only in mass shootings by civilians, but also actions of agents of the state and its bureaucracies, as well as in the economic and political systems of deprivation and exclusion.
The disconnection of individual acts of mass violence from the systemic racism that produces them enables governments deeply invested in institutionalized Islamophobia to posture as opponents of interpersonal Islamophobia. Immediately after the Christchurch massacre, for instance, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered his condolences on Twitter , even while Israel’s military has destroyed 161 mosques in Gaza. In 2014, The Washington Post noted that such bombings hardly drew any protest at all, largely because they are so commonplace. So too are attacks on Muslims during holy days and prayers — the most horrific being the 1994 killing of 29 Palestinian men and boys and the injuring of many more at the Ibrahimi Mosque during Ramadan, by an U.S. Jewish settler who was later honored as a “hero” by many Zionists.
In nearly all these attacks, we see the resurgence of settler violence against those who are either holding steadfast to their land or making forceful claims to return and re-possess. The issue of land and territory is inseparable from the white supremacist fear of both “white genocide” and “ replacement .” In both cases, whites fear losing a sense of ownership of public space and public discourse. Fascism is little more than colonialism turned inwards.
In fact, activist groups in New Zealand have made the connection between Israel’s persecution of Palestinians and the repression of the Māori. For example, Janfrie Waken from Palestine Human Rights Campaign-Aotearoa New Zealand notes : “The forces of America, Europe and Britain, enabled them to become not only the colonising group but also the military power that has enforced military occupation of the colonised, disposed people, the Palestinians. I would see Māori as being very much the brother and sisters of the Palestinian.”
The persistent tendency to abstract racist “hate crimes” from the contexts of settler colonialism in which they have occurred perpetuates the belief that expanding colonial state institutions of “counterterrorism” can provide a solution to white supremacy, when in fact they are part of the problem. As former New Zealand Green Party MP Keith Locke warned shortly after the Christchurch killings, “Given the Islamophobic ethos of Western intelligence agencies, led by the United States, we should be against strengthening our anti-terrorist laws or allowing more intrusive state surveillance. Such an approach won’t help the Muslim community.”
To the contrary, it risks further imperiling the Muslim and Indigenous communities that have long been in the crosshairs of state counterterrorism. The first targets of the post-9/11 Terrorism Suppression Act in New Zealand were Māori and environmental activists, while Indigenous Land and Water Protectors in Canada defending their internationally recognized rights to free, prior and informed consent have been some of the primary subjects of national security surveillance and repression, alongside Muslims.
In his manifesto, the Christchurch shooter identified himself as a fascist — but fascism, as scholars like Aime Cesaire helped us understand, is little more than colonialism turned inwards. The state’s treatment of those contesting systems of white supremacy as terrorists obscures the terror inflicted by the white supremacist settler-colonial state itself. A political system built on colonial and racial violence will continue to produce violence against colonized and racialized communities: the massacres that kill quickly, and the insidious forms that kill slowly. To return to the rhetoric of “replacement,” if what is to be replaced are the violent histories and contemporary re-enactments of that original violence, then those are things worth replacing.

Trump Administration Revokes ICC Prosecutor’s Visa Over War Crimes Probe,www.therussophile.org,Anton Woronczuk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/trump-administration-revokes-icc-prosecutors-visa-over-war-crimes-probe.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
In a move human rights defenders decried as “shameful,” the Trump administration revoked the visa of the International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor this week for trying to investigate alleged war crimes committed by American forces in Afghanistan.
“What we can confirm is that the U.S. authorities have revoked the prosecutor’s visa for entry into the U.S.,” Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda’s office said in a statement . The decision, per her office, shouldn’t interfere with her travel to the United Nations headquarters in New York City.
“Washington’s attempt to intimidate the ICC by canceling the ICC prosecutor’s visa over a possible Afghanistan investigation is the Trump administration’s latest shameful attack on the rule of law,” said Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch. Don’t miss a beat
Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.
Katherine Gallagher, an international human rights attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, condemned the move as “interference with judicial proceedings” that violates international law.
While the decision was widely criticized in the international community, it was not a surprise.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced last month that the administration would revoke or deny visas for any court personnel who try to probe or prosecute American officials or key allies—which critics called a “blatant effort to intimidate and retaliate against judges, prosecutors, and advocates seeking justice for victims of serious human rights abuses.”
Pompeo’s announcement came after John Bolton, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser and a longtime critic of the ICC, threatened to impose sanctions on court officials in September if they continued to pursue an investigation into U.S. service members’ conduct in Afghanistan.
Under the H.W. Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, the United States has refused to join or support the Hauge-based court, which probes and prosecutes crimes of aggression, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide under international law.
In November of 2017, Bensouda requested a probe of potential war crimes committed by U.S. military forces and members of the CIA in Afghanistan. The ICC has not yet made a final decision about whether to open a formal investigation.
Though critics oppose the Trump administration’s visa ban on ICC personnel who are pushing for the investigation as an intimidation tactic, it does not appear to be having that impact on Bensouda, a Gambian lawyer.
“The Office of the Prosecutor has an independent and impartial mandate under the Rome statute of the ICC,” the statement from her office said.
“The prosecutor and her office will continue to undertake that statutory duty with utmost commitment and professionalism,” it concluded, “without fear or favor.” This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

The Crisis of Violence Against Transgender People Is Not a “Myth”,www.therussophile.org,Anton Woronczuk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-crisis-of-violence-against-transgender-people-is-not-a-myth.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
I learned a lot about myself while sitting in the first U.S. congressional hearing about the Equality Act this week.
As debate about the act—which would extend federal nondiscrimination laws to LGBTQ people nationwide— began in earnest , I learned that I and other transgender women are tricksters and frauds intent on supplanting “real” women throughout public life. I learned I’m a threat to women’s sports , a topic many committee members only seem to care about when it can be wielded as a cudgel against transgender people. And perhaps most shockingly, I learned that the well-documented crisis of violence transgender people face across this country is, in the words of one witness at the hearing, a “myth.”
Just a few days before the hearing and a few miles away from where it took place, Ashanti Carmon had been shot and killed near the line dividing D.C. and Maryland. Ashanti is the second known Black transgender woman to be murdered in 2019; Dana Martin was the first, in January in Montgomery, Alabama. Last year, of the 28 known transgender people murdered, 17 of them were Black transgender women. Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about.
Even these rates are likely an undercount, reliant as they are upon faulty reporting by police and the media. The federal government regularly fails to collect the basic data that would tell us the true rates of violent death in our communities, but even the Federal Bureau of Investigation ’s own hate crime statistics showed anti-transgender violent hate crimes spiking 9 percent from 2016 to 2017. This was part of a larger rise in all hate crimes nationwide following the election of Donald Trump.
The proximity of Ashanti’s death to this hearing is a grim and tragic reminder of the targeted violence and persecution many transgender people still face. Advocates like myself are not basing our beliefs on purely hypothetical risks or absurd theories like those floated by the minority’s witnesses and committee members. We want our society to grow past the prejudice that puts people in real danger today. While transgender people have made much social and political progress in recent years, the bigotry and violence we still face are undeniable—and the very reason we need the Equality Act in the first place.
According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS) from the National Center for Transgender Equality (for which I’m the spokesperson), 1 in 10 transgender people was physically attacked in the past year, and half of all transgender people are survivors of sexual violence.
Family rejection, unemployment, poverty, and a lack of stable housing increase the likelihood anyone will face violence. This is most certainly true of transgender people, and Black and Latina transgender women in particular. The USTS found that transgender people are three times as likely to be unemployed as the rest of the United States, and Black transgender women are four times as likely to be unemployed as the general U.S. population. The survey found 1 in 6 transgender people have been fired from a job because of their gender identity, and 1 in 4 Black respondents experienced the same.
Indeed, one of them stood before the committee on Tuesday. Carter Brown, a Black transgender man, told of the pain his family faced after he was outed as transgender at a prior job before promptly being fired. None of the committee members eager to dispel the reality of anti-transgender bias bothered to speak to him during the hearing or even acknowledge his testimony.
Employment discrimination still keeps many transgender people on the peripheries of the economy, making it harder for many to find stable housing, escape the poverty cycle, and build other supports that lower their chances of experiencing violence. In housing, too, transgender people face discrimination: Our survey found that 1 in 6 transgender people have been evicted or denied a home because of their gender identity, and 1 in 4 Black transgender respondents have been similarly humiliated.
More likely to be homeless and to be forced into criminalized livelihoods—such as sex work—transgender people are left especially vulnerable to all forms of violence. While not often discussed in these terms, the Equality Act’s protections for employment, housing, and other key areas of public life will clearly help mitigate these risks, while eroding the deadly stigma that drives this violence in the first place.
To be sure, the violence faced by women like Ashanti is a function of transphobia and homophobia as much as it is a result of a racist criminal justice system that profiles and targets Black transgender women, leaving them vulnerable to targeted violence and few places to turn if they are in danger. Rejection of transgender people by their families also feeds this harm, acting as a risk multiplier.
No single piece of legislation can hope to correct these shortcomings of our society, and the Equality Act itself leaves much work to do. This includes improvement in public education about the rights and experiences of transgender people, as well as broader solutions to the poverty, homelessness, and other challenges facing trans people and too many other Americans.
But to argue against the basic protections the Act does entail by calling the pervasive violence trans people face a “myth,” and to frame the victims of this violence as villains and bogeymen, is a particularly cruel and dangerous form of recklessness with the truth.
This week’s hearing is one step in the long-running project of ensuring fairness and respect for all. That makes it all the more crucial for it to focus on the facts of what transgender people face in our daily experiences. As transgender people, we are forced to prove our existence and our experience at every step of our lives. If we ever hope to end transphobic violence, we must agree on its existence, its urgency, and the tools needed to stop it. This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

Alabama Could Make It Illegal to “Aid” Someone Seeking an Abortion,www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/alabama-could-make-it-illegal-to-aid-someone-seeking-an-abortion.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
For much of the last three months, I have been traveling the United States — mostly in the South — and discussing my new book about how to prepare for when Roe v. Wade is overturned. In mid-March, I toured Alabama, where I spoke to a group of abortion rights supporters in Montgomery about how to best support organizations who would help pregnant patients travel to states where abortion would be legal in order to get care.
“But what if helping them becomes illegal?” one activist asked.
“Well, we could see a time where maybe helping a minor get across a state line to access an abortion without parental permission could be illegal,” I answered, referring to CIANA — the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, a failed federal bill that could someday maybe become law. “But just helping an adult get an abortion? I don’t see that ever happening.” The stories you care about, right at your fingertips
Get Truthout’s daily edition delivered to your inbox.
Ironically, now Alabama itself is proving me wrong.
According to abortion rights activists on the ground, the Alabama Pro-Life Coalition is about to introduce a brand new abortion ban that could go further than any before.
“Eric Johnston, an attorney and member of Alabama Pro-Life Coalition, helped draft the bill on the outright ban,” reports AL.com . “He said one or more legislators will propose the bill next week banning abortion outright, without any rape or incest caveats. The bill would make it a crime to perform or aid a person in getting an abortion, he said. Johnston did not provide a copy of the bill to AL.com.”
Doctors always knew they would be a target if abortion is made illegal. But “aiding” someone who is getting an abortion? That’s a whole new level — and one that at this point is alarmingly and purposefully vague.
There are some pretty direct ways a person can “assist” with an abortion that we have already seen result in jail time, like when Jennifer Whalen obtained medication abortion for her daughter after they were unable to access a clinic in Pennsylvania. But there are also indirect ways of assisting a person with getting an abortion — such as driving them to a clinic, providing them with funding when they don’t have enough money to pay, giving them a place to stay overnight or any other number of ways of offering financial, practical or emotional support when a pregnant person needs it.
The Alabama ACLU is already on the scene, warning the state that it will litigate any attempt to completely ban abortion in defiance of Roe v. Wade , which — at least for now — is still the law of the land. As the civil rights group emphasizes, it will be the citizens of Alabama who will literally bare the costs.
Randall Marshall, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama, explained in a press release :
These lawsuits are a part of a plan to overturn Roe v. Wade at the Supreme Court. They know they will not win in federal, district, or appeals courts because these bills are flagrantly unconstitutional. However, if a state loses in lower courts, appeals to the Supreme Court and is denied review, then they will owe potentially hundreds of thousands of taxpayer money in attorney fees. None of these states including Alabama can afford to throw money away like that.
But if Roe is gone — as could easily be the case as soon as 2021 — well then, every state gets to decide exactly what they want to do with their own abortion laws. And Alabama could very well set the bar on seeing just how extreme one state can go.
That means that by making it illegal to “assist” in an abortion, Alabama is at the very least trying to intimidate those who are already actively working in the abortion support network — and hoping to make them fearful that they may be viewed as potential future perpetrators of illegal acts.
It seems unfathomable that helping a pregnant person buy an airplane ticket to the closest abortion-providing state could potentially land someone in jail. Then again, until recently it seemed unfathomable that an ex-boyfriend could sue an abortion clinic on behalf of an embryo , yet somehow this case has yet to be dismissed.
I always tell people that when Roe is overturned, each one of us needs to think about what actions we are willing to take and what risks we are willing to undergo in order to be sure that those who still want abortions can access them. Now, that we are seeing just how great that risk may become, I encourage everyone to weigh these considerations even more thoroughly than before.

Logging Is the Leading Driver of Carbon Emissions From US Forests,www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/logging-is-the-leading-driver-of-carbon-emissions-from-us-forests.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers
Climate change is having a growing impact on Americans and, as the crisis escalates, communities face growing challenges. The latest report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change underscores that we have eleven short years to make “rapid transformation across all industrial sectors.
Protecting forest ecosystems is critical in the fight to limit global warming — when forests are disturbed they release carbon, but when left to grow they actively pull carbon out of the air and store it. When left standing, forests also provide optimal natural protection against extreme weather events, like flooding and droughts.
As the Trump Administration and industry allies push for increased commercial logging of America’s forests, we feel compelled to call attention to the elephant in the room: the profound ways in which industrial logging not only decimates ecosystems but also exacerbates climate change. Never miss another story
Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.
Many people are aware of the importance of protecting rainforests in Brazil to help mitigate climate change, but few realize that more logging occurs in the US, and more wood is consumed here , than in any other nation globally. The rate and scale of logging in the Southeastern US alone is four times that in South American rainforests.
The Trump Administration and industry have been aggressively promoting misinformation about forests and wildland fires, while advocating for large increases in logging under the guises of “forest health,”“fuel reduction,”“renewable energy,” and reducing carbon emissions. A version of this industry narrative was on display during the recent climate change hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee .
But the promotion of logging to supposedly curb carbon emissions is just part of the Administration’s ongoing alignment with industry and troubling pattern of climate science denial. Carbon emissions from logging in the US are ten times higher than the combined emissions from wildland fire and tree mortality from native bark beetles. Fire only consumes a minor percentage of forest carbon, while improving availability of key nutrients and stimulating rapid forest regeneration. Within a decade after fire, more carbon has been pulled out of the atmosphere than was emitted. When trees die from drought and native bark beetles, no carbon is consumed or emitted initially, and carbon emissions from decay are extremely small, and slow, while decaying wood helps keeps soils productive, which enhances carbon sequestration capacity over time.
On the other hand, industrial logging — even when conducted under the euphemism of “thinning”— results in a large net loss of forest carbon storage, and a substantial overall increase in carbon emissions that can take decades, if not a century, to recapture with regrowth. Logging also tends to make fires burn faster and more intensely while degrading a forest ecosystem’s ability to provide natural protections against extreme weather events.
Consider this: About 28 percent of tree carbon is contained in branches , and this is emitted when they are burned after logging operations. An additional 53 percent of the carbon in trees removed from forests is emitted as waste in the manufacturing and milling process. Overall, about two-thirds of the carbon in trees that are logged for lumber quickly become greenhouse gas emissions.
When trees are cut down and burned to generate “biomass” electricity under the guise of “renewable energy,” 100 percent of the carbon is emitted. Incinerating wood for energy emits even more CO2 than burning coal , for equal energy produced. Yet, the expansion of US production of wood pellets to fuel power stations in Europe has been spreading like wildfire across the Southeast, accelerating the destruction of some of our nation’s most ecologically-important forests and putting the health of some of the nation’s most vulnerable communities at increased risk.
The Administration’s efforts to demonize standing dead trees (“snags”) in forest ecosystems is also factually challenged. We have considerably less fire now on the landscape than we did historically , and the “snag forest habitat” created in some places by fire and native bark beetles is an ecological treasure — comparable to old-growth forest in terms of native biodiversity and wildlife abundance. Woodpeckers and shrub-nesting birds flourish in forest ecosystems following fire, as do elk and deer because of the abundance of nutritious understory vegetation that rapidly grows there.
To effectively mitigate climate change, we must stop burning carbon for fuel and greatly increase forest protection. If we take ambitious steps to protect vastly more of our forests from industrial logging, we can avoid emissions while also actively absorbing large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere and storing it back on land in the forest where it belongs.
Now is the time for such bold action. We can protect our National Forests and scale-up protection on private lands, while ensuring a just economic transition by redirecting logging subsidies into green jobs that help create fire-safe rural communities in the West and restore natural flood control in the Southeast. We must create new incentives for landowners who protect forests instead of logging them. This approach has recently been endorsed by over 250 climate change and conservation organizations, scientists, and policymakers. We simply cannot solve the climate crisis without reducing the climate impacts associated with the large-scale industrial logging of America’s forests.

The IRS Tried to Take on the Ultrawealthy. It Didn’t Go Well.,www.therussophile.org,Anton Woronczuk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-irs-tried-to-take-on-the-ultrawealthy-it-didnt-go-well.html/,"Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers On June 30, 2016, an auto-parts magnate received the kind of news anyone would dread: The Internal Revenue Service had determined he had engaged in abusive tax maneuvers. He stood accused of masking about $5 billion in income. The IRS wanted over $1.2 billion in back taxes and penalties. The magnate, Georg Schaeffler, was the billionaire scion of a family-owned German manufacturer and was quietly working as a corporate lawyer in Dallas. Schaeffler had extra reason to fear the IRS, it seemed. He wasn’t in the sights of just any division of the agency but the equivalent of its SEAL Team 6. In 2009, the IRS had formed a crack team of specialists to unravel the tax dodges of the ultrawealthy. In an age of widening inequality, with a concentration of wealth not seen since the Gilded Age, the rich were evading taxes through ever more sophisticated maneuvers. The IRS commissioner aimed to stanch the country’s losses with what he proclaimed would be “a game-changing strategy.” In short order, Charles Rettig, then a high-powered tax lawyer and today President Donald Trump’s IRS commissioner, warned that the squad was conducting “the audits from hell .” If Trump were being audited, Rettig wrote during the presidential campaign, this is the elite team that would do it. Don’t miss a beat
Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. The wealth team embarked on a contentious audit of Schaeffler in 2012, eventually determining that he owed about $1.2 billion in unpaid taxes and penalties. But after seven years of grinding bureaucratic combat, the IRS abandoned its campaign. The agency informed Schaeffler’s lawyers it was willing to accept just tens of millions, according to a person familiar with the audit. How did a case that consumed so many years of effort, with a team of its finest experts working on a signature mission, produce such a piddling result for the IRS? The Schaeffler case offers a rare window into just how challenging it is to take on the ultrawealthy. For starters, they can devote seemingly limitless resources to hiring the best legal and accounting talent. Such taxpayers tend not to steamroll tax laws; they employ complex, highly refined strategies that seek to stretch the tax code to their advantage. It can take years for IRS investigators just to understand a transaction and deem it to be a violation. Once that happens, the IRS team has to contend with battalions of high-priced lawyers and accountants that often outnumber and outgun even the agency’s elite SWAT team. “We are nowhere near a circumstance where the IRS could launch the types of audits we need to tackle sophisticated taxpayers in a complicated world,” said Steven Rosenthal, who used to represent wealthy taxpayers and is now a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Because the audits are private — IRS officials can go to prison if they divulge taxpayer information — details of the often epic paper battles between the rich and the tax collectors are sparse, with little in the public record. Attorneys are also loath to talk about their clients’ taxes, and most wealthy people strive to keep their financial affairs under wraps. Such disputes almost always settle out of court. But ProPublica was able to reconstruct the key points in the Schaeffler case. The billionaire’s lawyers and accountants first crafted a transaction of unusual complexity, one so novel that they acknowledged, even as they planned it, that it was likely to be challenged by the IRS. Then Schaeffler deployed teams of professionals to battle the IRS on multiple fronts. They denied that he owed any money, arguing the agency fundamentally misunderstood the tax issues. Schaeffler’s representatives complained to top officials at the agency; they challenged document requests in court. At various times, IRS auditors felt Schaeffler’s side was purposely stalling. But in the end, Schaeffler’s team emerged almost completely victorious. His experience was telling. The IRS’ new approach to taking on the superwealthy has been stymied. The wealthy’s lobbyists immediately pushed to defang the new team. And soon after the group was formed, Republicans in Congress began slashing the agency’s budget . As a result, the team didn’t receive the resources it was promised. Thousands of IRS employees left from every corner of the agency, especially ones with expertise in complex audits, the kinds of specialists the agency hoped would staff the new elite unit. The agency had planned to assign 242 examiners to the group by 2012, according to a report by the IRS’ inspector general. But by 2014, it had only 96 auditors. By last year, the number had fallen to 58. The wealth squad never came close to having the impact its proponents envisaged. As Robert Gardner, a 39-year veteran of the IRS who often interacted with the team as a top official at the agency’s tax whistleblower office, put it, “From the minute it went live, it was dead on arrival.” * * * Most people picture IRS officials as all-knowing and fearsome. But when it comes to understanding how the superwealthy move their money around, IRS auditors historically have been more like high school physics teachers trying to operate the Large Hadron Collider. That began to change in the early 2000s, after Congress and the agency uncovered widespread use of abusive tax shelters by the rich. The discovery led to criminal charges, and settlements by major accounting firms. By the end of the decade, the IRS had determined that millions of Americans had secret bank accounts abroad. The agency managed to crack open Switzerland’s banking secrecy, and it recouped billions in lost tax revenue. The IRS came to realize it was not properly auditing the ultrawealthy. Multimillionaires frequently don’t have easily visible income. They often have trusts, foundations, limited liability companies, complex partnerships and overseas operations, all woven together to lower their tax bills. When IRS auditors examined their finances, they typically looked narrowly. They might scrutinize just one return for one entity and examine, say, a year’s gifts or income. Belatedly attempting to confront improper tax avoidance, the IRS formed what was officially called the Global High Wealth Industry Group in 2009. “The genesis was: If you think of an incredibly wealthy family, their web of entities somehow gives them a remarkably low effective tax rate,” said former IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, who was one of those responsible for creating the wealth squad. “We hadn’t really been looking at it all together, and shame on us.” The IRS located the group within the division that audits the biggest companies in recognition of the fact that the finances of the 1 percent resemble those of multinational corporations more than those of the average rich person. The vision was clear, as Doug Shulman, a George W. Bush appointee who remained to helm the agency under the Obama administration, explained in a 2009 speech : “We want to better understand the entire economic picture of the enterprise controlled by the wealthy individual.” It’s particularly important to audit the wealthy well, and not simply because that’s where the money is. That’s where the cheating is, too. Studies show that the wealthiest are more likely to avoid paying taxes. The top 0.5 percent in income account for fully a fifth of all the underreported income, according to a 2010 study by the IRS’ Andrew Johns and the University of Michigan’s Joel Slemrod. Adjusted for inflation, that’s more than $50 billion each year in unpaid taxes. The plans for the wealth squad seemed like a step forward. In a few years, the group would be staffed with several hundred auditors. A team of examiners would tackle each audit, not just one or two agents, as was more typical in the past. The new group would draw from the IRS’ best of the best. That was crucial because IRS auditors have a long-standing reputation, at least among the practitioners who represent deep-pocketed taxpayers, as hapless and overmatched. The agents can fritter away years, tax lawyers say, auditing transactions they don’t grasp. “In private practice, we played whack-a-mole,” said Rosenthal, of the Tax Policy Center. “The IRS felt a transaction was suspect but couldn’t figure out why, so it would raise an issue and we’d whack it and they would raise another and we’d whack it. The IRS was ill-equipped.” The Global High Wealth Group was supposed to change that. Indeed, with all the fanfare at the outset, tax practitioners began to worry on behalf of their clientele. “The impression was it was all going to be specialists in fields, highly trained. The IRS would assemble teams with the exact right expertise to target these issues,” Chicago-based tax attorney Jenny Johnson said. The new group’s first moves spurred resistance. The team sent wide-ranging requests for information seeking details about their targets’ entire empires. Taxpayers with more than $10 million in income or assets received a dozen pages of initial requests, with the promise of many more to follow. The agency sought years of details on every entity it could tie to the subject of the audits. In past audits, that initial overture had been limited to one or two pages, with narrowly tailored requests. Here, a typical request sought information on a vast array of issues. One example: a list of any U.S. or foreign entity in which the taxpayer held an “at least a 20 percent” interest, including any “hybrid instruments” that could be turned into a 20 percent or more ownership share. The taxpayer would then have to identify “each and every current and former officer, trustee, and manager” from the entity’s inception. Taxpayers who received such requests recoiled. Attacking the core idea that Shulman had said would animate the audits, their attorneys and accountants argued the examinations sought too much information, creating an onerous burden. The audits “proceeded into a proctology exam, unearthing every aspect of their lives,” said Mark Allison, a prominent tax attorney for Caplin & Drysdale who has represented taxpayers undergoing Global High Wealth audits. “It was extraordinarily intrusive. Not surprisingly, these people tend to be private and are not used to sharing.” Tax practitioners took their concerns directly to the agency, at American Bar Association conferences and during the ABA’s regular private meetings with top IRS officials. “Part of our approach was to have private sit-downs to raise issues and concerns,” said Allison, who has served in top roles in the ABA’s tax division for years. We were “telling them this was too much, unwieldy and therefore unfair.” Allison said he told high-ranking IRS officials, “You need to rein in these audit teams.” For years, politicians have hammered the IRS for its supposed abuse of taxpayers. Congress created a “ Taxpayer Bill of Rights” in the mid-1990s. Today, the IRS often refers to its work as “customer service.” One result of constant congressional scrutiny is that senior IRS officials are willing to meet with top tax lawyers and address their concerns. “There was help there. They stuck their necks out for me,” Allison said. The IRS publicly retreated. Speaking at a Washington, D.C., Bar Association event in February 2013, a top IRS official, James Fee, conceded the demands were too detailed and long, telling the gathering that the agency has “taken strides to make sure it doesn’t happen again.” The Global High Wealth group began to limit its initial document requests. The lobbying campaign, combined with the lack of funding for the group, took its toll. One report estimated that the wealth team had audited only around a dozen wealthy taxpayers in its first two and a half years. In a September 2015 report, the IRS’ inspector general said the agency had failed to establish the team as a “standalone” group “capable of conducting all of its own examinations.” The group didn’t have steady leadership, with three directors in its first five years. When it did audit the ultrawealthy, more than 40 percent of the reviews resulted in no additional taxes. The inspector general also criticized the IRS broadly — not just its high-wealth team — for not focusing enough on the richest taxpayers. In 2010, the IRS as a whole audited over 32,000 millionaires. By 2018, that number had fallen to just over 16,000, according to data compiled by Syracuse University. Audits of the wealthiest Americans have collapsed 52 percent since 2011, falling more substantially than audits of the middle class and the poor. Almost half of audits of the wealthy were of taxpayers making $200,000 to $399,000. Those audits brought in $605 per audit hour worked. Exams of those making over $5 million, by contrast, brought in more than $4,500 an hour. The IRS didn’t even have the resources to pursue millionaires who had been hit with a hefty tax bill and simply stiffed Uncle Sam. It “appeared to no longer emphasize the collection of delinquent accounts of global high wealth taxpayers,” a 2017 inspector general report said . In recent years, the number of Global High Wealth audits has been higher — it closed 149 audits in the last year — but tax lawyers and former IRS officials say even that improvement is deceptive. A major reason is that the audits are much less ambitious. “They were longer at the beginning and shorter as the process moved on,” Johnson, the tax attorney, said. Inside the IRS, agents seethed. “The whole organization was very frustrated,” Gardner said. “They were just really not sure what the hell their mission was, what they were supposed to be accomplishing.” * * * Georg Schaeffler, 54, has flowing salt-and-pepper hair that makes him look like he could’ve been an actor on the 1980s TV show “Dynasty.” The impression is offset by the wire rim glasses he wears and by the bookish disposition of a person who, as a teenager, once asked for a copy of the German Constitution as a present. As a younger man, Schaeffler tried to escape his legacy. He left Germany and the family company at a young age and lit out for the American West. He was trying to make it on his own “where people don’t know who you are,” as he would tell a reporter for a magazine profile years later. Some might escape to Texas to live a bit wild. Schaeffler became a corporate lawyer. Schaeffler’s law firm colleagues didn’t know much more than that he spoke with an accent, and certainly not that he was vastly wealthy. That is, until he landed on the Forbes list of global billionaires. Rueful at the loss of his privacy, Schaeffler once declared: “I hate Forbes.” The family’s riches stemmed from ball bearings and other automobile parts manufactured by the Schaeffler Group, which was founded by Schaeffler’s father and then passed to his mother after his father died. By 2006, Georg (pronounced GAY-org) owned 80 percent of the enterprise and his mother the remaining 20 percent. (As a Texas resident at that time, Schaeffler was required to pay U.S. income taxes.) He very nearly lost it all. In 2008, Schaeffler Group made a big mistake. It offered to buy Continental AG, a tiremaker, just days before the stock and credit markets experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression. Even as Continental’s stock price crashed, Schaeffler was legally obligated to go through with its purchase at the much higher pre-crash price. Schaeffler Group flirted with bankruptcy and pleaded for aid from the German government. The media began to pay closer attention to the private company and the low-profile family that ran it. German press accounts dismissed Schaeffler’s mother as the “ billionaire beggar ” for seeking a bailout and pilloried her for wearing a fur coat at a ski race while seeking government help. No German government aid came. The Schaeffler Group teetered, and the family’s fortune plummeted from $9 billion to almost zero . Amid the crisis over Continental, Georg accepted his fate and took up a more prominent role at the company; he’s now the chairman of its supervisory board. To pay for Continental, Schaeffler Group borrowed about 11 billion euros from a consortium of banks. At the time, Schaeffler’s lenders, including Royal Bank of Scotland, were desperate, too, having suffered enormous losses on home mortgages. They wanted to avoid any more write-downs that might result if the company defaulted on the loans. So in 2009 and 2010, Schaeffler’s lenders restructured the debt in a devilishly complex series of transactions. By 2012, these maneuvers had caught the eye of the Global High Wealth group. Paul Doerr, an experienced revenue agent, would head the audit. Eventually, the IRS discerned what it came to believe was the transaction’s essence: The banks had effectively forgiven nearly half of Schaeffler’s debt. To the IRS, that had significant tax implications. In the wealth team’s view, Georg Schaeffler had received billions of dollars of income — on which he owed taxes. The auditors’ view reflects a core aspect of the U.S. tax system. Under American law, companies and individuals are liable for taxes on the forgiven portion of any loan. This frequently comes up in the housing market. A homeowner borrows $100,000 from a bank to buy a house. Prices fall and the homeowner, under financial duress, unloads it for $80,000. If the bank forgives the $20,000 still owed on the original mortgage, the owner pays taxes on that amount as if it were ordinary income. This levy can seem unfair since it often hits borrowers who have run into trouble paying back their debts. The problem was particularly acute during the housing crisis, so in late 2007, Congress passed a bill that protected most homeowners from being hit with a tax bill after foreclosure or otherwise getting a principal reduction from their lender. Tax experts say the principle of taxing forgiven loans is crucial to preventing chicanery. Without it, people could arrange with their employers to borrow their salaries through the entire year interest-free and then have the employer forgive the loan at the very end. Voila, no taxable income. The notion that forgiven debt is taxable applies to corporate transactions, too. That means concern about such a tax bill is rarely far from a distressed corporate debtor’s mind. “Any time you have a troubled situation, it’s a typical tax issue you have to address and the banks certainly understand it, too,” said Les Samuels, an attorney who spent decades advising corporations and wealthy individuals on tax matters. But the efforts to avoid tax, in the case of Schaeffler and his lenders, took a particularly convoluted form. It involved several different instruments, each with multiple moving parts. The refinancing was “complicated and unusual,” said Samuels, who was not involved in the transaction. “If you were sitting in the government’s chair and reading press reports on the situation, your reaction might be that the company was on the verge of being insolvent. And when the refinancing was completed, the government might think that banks didn’t know whether they would be repaid.” This account of the audit was drawn from conversations with people familiar with it, who were not authorized to speak on the record, as well as court and German securities filings. The IRS declined to comment for this story. Doerr did not respond to repeated calls and emails. A spokesman for Schaeffler declined to make him available for an interview. “Mr. Schaeffler always strives to comply with the complex U.S. tax code,” the spokesman wrote in a statement, saying “the fact that the refinancing was with six independent, international banks in itself demonstrates that these were arm’s length, commercially driven transactions. The IRS professionally concluded the audit in 2018 without making adjustments to those transactions, and there is no continuing dispute — either administratively or in litigation — related to these matters.” Schaeffler’s lenders never explicitly canceled the loan. The banks and Schaeffler maintained to the IRS that the loan was real and no debt had been forgiven. The IRS came not to buy that. After years of trying to unravel the refinancing, the IRS homed in on what the agency contended was a disguise. The banks and Schaeffler “had a mutual interest in maintaining the appearance that the debt hadn’t gone away,” a person familiar with the transaction said. But the IRS believed the debt had, in fact, been canceled. In the refinancing, the banks and Schaeffler had agreed to split the company’s debt, which had grown to 12 billion euros at that point, into two pieces: A senior loan, to be paid back first, worth about 7 billion euros and a junior piece worth about 5 billion euros. Schaeffler’s income-producing assets were placed into the entity that held the senior debt. Schaeffler was required to repay the debt according to a schedule and to pay a meaningful interest rate: 4.25 percentage points above the rate his lenders charge each other to borrow money. In short, it appeared to be a relatively straightforward debt transaction. The junior debt was another matter — and its provisions would raise the hackles of the IRS. To begin with, the entity that held the junior debt did not directly hold income-producing assets. There was no schedule of payments that Schaeffler had to make on the junior debt. He wasn’t obligated to make principal payments until the end of the loan’s term. And it carried a nearly nonexistent annual interest rate of 0.1 percentage points above prevailing interbank lending rates, plus an additional 7 percent per year, which Schaeffler could choose to defer and pay at the end of the term. The banks attached two other provisions to the refinancing: A “Contingent Remuneration Payment” and a “Contingent Upside Instrument,” according to German securities filings. The two additions called for Schaeffler to make payments to the future performance of the company. The IRS and Schaeffler’s team fought especially over the Contingent Upside Instrument. Its value was tied to the Schaeffler Group’s future profitability, just like a share of stock would be. The IRS argued that not only was this an equitylike sweetener to the banks, but that it tainted the entire junior portion of the debt. To the IRS, it looked like the banks had a claim on future payments from Schaeffler, but they didn’t know when they’d receive it — or even if they would ever get anything. To the IRS, these steps all added up to the effective cancellation of about $5 billion worth of debt, for which the banks had received something in return. That something looked and acted very much like equity. * * * The Schaeffler audit was one of the biggest for the Global High Wealth group. The IRS assigned a larger than normal team to the exam. The agency would send 86 separate document requests to Schaeffler through July 2013. But there were problems almost from the beginning, according to people familiar with the audit, who provided this account and chronology. The IRS examiners disagreed with one another over strategy. The debates sometimes spilled into the view of Schaeffler’s team. “I remember a tremendous amount of turnover from the exam team and infighting. They were not presenting a coherent message,” a person in the Schaeffler camp said. By contrast, Schaeffler’s team of lawyers and accountants was large and unified. “These taxpayers aren’t exactly represented by H&R Block,” Gardner, the retired IRS official, said. Schaeffler’s advisers threw as much as they could back at the agency. Document requests are typically voluntary at the outset. But at one point, an IRS auditor was frustrated at what the team saw as the Schaeffler team’s resistance and delays and demanded, “Would a summons help?” according to a person familiar with the exam. Schaeffler’s team complained about the perceived threat. The IRS scolded its employee, and Doerr, the lead auditor, apologized to the Schaeffler side, according to the person. In another instance, the IRS could not get information it sought from Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, related to its advice to Schaeffler. So it sued the accounting firm in early 2014. Ernst & Young contended the material was privileged because it was prepared in anticipation of litigation. The IRS won in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, but Ernst & Young appealed. In early November 2015, with the Ernst & Young appeal unresolved, top IRS officials gave the Schaeffler audit team the permission it was looking for. They allowed the auditors to notify Schaeffler that they believed he’d failed to disclose about $5 billion in income and that he could expect a $1.2 billion tax bill. That included some $200 million in penalties because the agency viewed the transaction as abusive. Only days later, the IRS was dealt a defeat that would further hamstring its ability to press its case. On Nov. 10, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district judge, slapping down the IRS’ efforts to get the Ernst & Young documents, ruling they were in fact protected by privilege. The IRS had no choice. It would have to proceed without the documents. The IRS took solace that despite the adverse ruling on the documents, the appeals court appeared to bolster the IRS’ view of the transaction. Describing it as a “complex and novel refinancing,” the court said the consortium of banks “essentially insured” Schaeffler “by extending credit and subordinating its debt.” The opinion found that Schaeffler’s team had known that litigation over the transaction was “virtually inevitable,” underscoring the sense that the billionaire’s lawyers and accountants knew they were pushing legal limits. The two sides wrangled even over routine procedural matters. The statute of limitations was about to run out. Usually the taxpayer voluntarily agrees to extend the time limit rather than antagonize the agents doing an audit. But Schaeffler’s team raised the prospect of refusing an extension. They ultimately relented, but succeeded in amping up the pressure on the auditors. Even as the antagonism built between the two sides, the IRS showed deference to the Schaeffler camp. Doerr gave Schaeffler’s attorneys a heads-up that the agency was going to deliver bad news, an action that was viewed as overly solicitous, according to one person. It gave an opening for Schaeffler’s lawyers to raise their concerns with the audit team’s bosses. They expressed how wrongheaded they thought the IRS’ position was and how inappropriate its actions had been. In June 2016, the IRS sent Schaeffler the official notice that the agency would seek unpaid tax and penalties. Schaeffler’s attorneys continued to argue, often above the heads of the audit team, that the auditors’ interpretation was incorrect. They held conference calls with top IRS officials, saying the audit team had given the Schaeffler side mixed messages. Some on the team had assured Schaeffler’s attorneys that he would not face a large tax bill or be subject to a penalty. Top officials then met with the Global High Wealth team to discuss the issues. “The pushback is incredible,” one knowledgeable person recalled. The pushback worked — and here’s where an audit is radically different from a court case. Court cases are typically accompanied by publicly available decisions and rulings that explain them in detail. By contrast, audits are shielded by the secrecy of the IRS’ process. They can end with no scrap of publicly available paper to memorialize key decisions. In August 2016, in Schaeffler’s case, officials several rungs up the IRS hierarchy told the Global High Wealth team to withdraw the penalty from its request. Even without a penalty portion, Schaeffler would still owe the original $1 billion in taxes if the IRS maintained its contention that the banks had cancelled his debt. Schaeffler’s team then went to work on that, too. It succeeded. By 2017, the IRS had abandoned its assertion that debt had been transformed into equity. After six years on a hard-fought case, the agency had effectively given up. The IRS had a few stray quibbles, so the agency said it required a payment in the “tens of millions,” according to two people familiar with the audit. There the trail goes dark. Tax experts say Schaeffler’s team would likely have appealed even that offer, which in many instances leads to further reductions in money owed, but ProPublica could not ascertain that that occurred. Thanks in part to the U.S. government’s bailout of the auto industry and the global economic recovery, the Schaeffler Group’s business rebounded. Despite a recent dip in the car market , things have turned out OK for Georg Schaeffler. Today, Forbes estimates his fortune at over $13 billion.

US President Donald Trump has said that he has not yet read Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report into the alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as House Democrats call for the release of the document publicly.
“I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so. Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion. Likewise, recommendations made to our great A.G. who found No Obstruction,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Saturday morning.

“13 Angry Trump hating Dems (later brought to 18) given two years and $30 million, and they found No Collusion, No Obstruction. But the Democrats, no matter what we give them, will NEVER be satisfied,” he continued. …..years and $30 million, and they found No Collusion, No Obstruction.

Public is fed up.”
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 6, 2019
Trump has claimed “complete and total exoneration” after the Justice Department announced Mueller’s 22-month investigation found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the 2016 election.
Attorney General William Barr, a Trump appointee, said in a four-page summary of the report released last month that Mueller’s team had concluded that no one in Trump’s campaign “conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.”
However, Mueller’s findings left unresolved the issue of whether Trump obstructed justice by undermining the investigations.
Many of the president’s opponents had accused him of obstructing the Russia probe when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017.
Echoing Trump, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the American public knows “there was no collusion, they know there was no obstruction and it’s a complete and total exoneration of the president.” But she also said President Trump would have no problem with the release of the full report.
Democrats have rejected the determination made by the Justice Department on the evidence presented by Muller following his extensive investigations.
They said they wanted to see Mueller’s report for themselves as they launch congressional investigations of their own into the 2016 election and Trump’s business and financial dealings.
Democrats accused Barr of putting his own finding on Mueller’s report, saying that the special counsel did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice.
Democratic lawmakers have tried repeatedly to pass a House resolution that claims there is “overwhelming public interest” in the administration releasing the contents of the Mueller report.

Iran denies floods affected joint oil fields with Iraq,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-denies-floods-affected-joint-oil-fields-with-iraq.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
File photo shows a view to the oil installations in Yadavaran Field near the Iraqi border in southwestern Iranian province of Khuzestan.
Iranian authorities have reject reports that massive floods have affected crude production in joint oil fields with neighboring Iraq.
Head of Iran’s Petroleum Engineering and Development Company Turaj Dehqani said on Saturday that historic flash floods that inundated parts oil-rich province of Khuzestan in southwest of the country over the past days had not caused the crude production in joint fields with Iraq, located to the west of the Karun River, to stop or slow down.
“Areas to the West of Karun have always been exposed to flooding, however, despite these difficult conditions, the oil development activities have continued unabated,” Dehqani told the official IRNA agency, adding that flash floods had caused some minor problems to current operations in the joint fields.
Heavy floods, described by authorities as unprecedented in the past 70 years, have affected around two thirds of Iran’s 31 provinces with areas in northeast, west and southwest of the country suffering the worst. Nearly 70 people have been killed since the heavy downpours began to hit Iran on March 19.
All the five oil fields shared between Iran and Iraq are located near the Hawizeh Marshes which straddles the border between the two countries and is known to the locals as Hurolazim.
Dehqani also rejected reports that authorities had decided to divert the flood waters from the Hurolazim in order to protect the oil installations in the area. He said all environmental standards have been observed during years of development of the joint oil fields.
Dehqani said Iran’s oil production from joint fields with Iraq had reached some 350,000 barrels per day, generating some USD 10 billion for the country.

After weeks of power cuts and limited access to water, tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets on Saturday, to back opposition leader Juan Guaido and protest against President Nicolas Maduro, who they accuse of wrecking the economy.

Venezuelans, already suffering from hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine, say the crisis in the chaotic country has worsened over the past month. That is when crippling nationwide power outages began to leave vast swaths of territory in the dark for days at a time, cutting off water supplies and cell phone service.
Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly and recognized as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state by most Western nations, called for Saturday’s marches to mark the start of what he has billed as a new wave of “definitive” protests to oust Maduro.
Guaido invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, denouncing Maduro as a “usurper” after he began a second term following a 2018 national election widely considered fraudulent.
Maduro, who retains the support of the military and allies including Russia and China, has derided Guaido as a US puppet and said he will face justice.

April 6, 2019 If You Think They’re Crazy Now, Imagine The Liberal Meltdown If President Trump Wins Re-election In 2020
By Susan Duclos – All News PipeLine
Left-leaning pollsters are busy running their models and declaring that President Trump is losing support in some states that handed him the electoral college victory in 2016, the same states that those same pollsters declared Hillary Clinton had in the bag in 2016, yet on election night we found out they all got it wrong . Liberal news outlets, on behalf of their democrat puppet masters are harping on President Trump’s (and now Bernie Sanders!) tax returns. Democrats and their propaganda pushers in the media are still obsessed with their Russia collusion narrative, despite the nearly two year special counsel investigation concluding there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump 2016 campaign.
The media is still chasing their tails every time the president “tweets” something they don’t like.
It is almost like we are replaying the 2016 election cycle leading up to the 2020 presidential election. All that is missing is Hillary Clinton as a candidate. This time, to date, we have 18 Democrats that have tossed their hats in the ring , and more are expected.
Since the 2016 presidential election we have seen Hollywood celebrities and liberal media personalities melt-down, on-air, inciting hundreds of liberals to attack Trump supporters or people wearing MAGA hats, the most recent ANP reported on the other day , where a mohawk-wearing freaky woman verbally attacked a 74 year old Jewish man at a Starbucks because he was wearing a MAGA hat.
We have seen a rising number of hate crime hoaxes exposed, the most high profile to date a black, gay actor in Chicago claiming he was attacked by white thugs who yelled “This is MAGA country,” which police determined after weeks of investigating, he orchestrated the entire attack.
We have seen liberals marching in the street, crying, and anti-Trump protesters “ screaming helplessly at the sky ,” with others claiming they have needed therapy, were depressed, anxious and therapists declaring many are suffering from Trump Anxiety Disorder , which is commonly referred to as Trump Derangement Syndrome.
(If you appreciate stories like this, please consider donating to ANP to help keep us in this battle for the future of America .)
IMAGINE TRUMP WINS 2020
Despite the media’s consistent 90 percent negative media coverage of all things Trump, 70 percent of Wall Street thinks President Trump will be reelected in 2020.
Before the special counsel finding that there was no collusion with Russia established, 54 percent of voters said they “would think about voting for Trump” in 2020, and 24 percent of those that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, said they would “would at least consider,” voting for Trump in 2020, and 95 percent that voted for Trump in 2016, say they “could find a reason vote for him again in 2020.”
Add in the Jexodus (Jewsih exodus from Democrats) movement, the #WalkAway campaign and the #Blexit (Black exit from Democrats) movement, and Wall Street might have it right.
If you think the #Resistance liberals are crazy now, just imagine those that have steadily become more and more infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome over the past two years, including the liberal media, democrats, Hollywood celebrities, and unhinged violent liberals, reacting to a 2020 election win by President Donald Trump.
I am not referring to the entertaining on-air crying like we witnessed in 2016 on election night, by pundits that started the night confident the candidate they promoted would win easily, then slowly went into shock and total meltdowns as they were forced to report that Donald Trump won, but the unhinged masses that are allowing the media to take them down the same path they took them down in 2016.
The violent ones, the crazed, the dangerous…… Should President Trump win in 2020, that will kick off the most dangerous moment this nation has ever seen because the violence, harassment and threats we have witnessed and documented here at ANP by crazed liberals over the course of the past three years (before the election and after) will look like a walk in the park.
(Nov. 2016 – Oakland, CA riots after Presidential election)
PREPARE FOR MASS CIVIL UNREST
Anyone that thinks that statement is hyperbolic needs to look back at what followed the 2016 presidential election, a brief reminder of the rioting, the protests and chaos that followed the election results.
Flashback, November 9, 2016 -Daily Mail : Anti-Trump protests turn violent: Cops clash with 6,000-strong crowd in Oakland and activists block roads in LA amid nationwide demonstrations that saw Madonna and Cher join 7,000 in NYC. • In Oakland protesters set fires in streets and threw bottles at cops, as police retaliated with tear gas.
• In Los Angeles, a disorganized protest of thousands saw fires on City Hall steps and 110 Freeway taken over.
Violence has broken out at anti-Trump rallies across America overnight as tens of thousands marched against the President-elect before angry mobs attacked police, started fires and shut down highways.
The streets of downtown Oakland in California were choked with smoke Thursday as police launched tear gas and protesters lit fires, in what became by some distance the most violent of the many protests against the election of Donald Trump.
More than 6,000 protesters were seen on the streets of Oakland with an initially peaceful march down a cop-lined street turning nasty after some protesters threw bottles at officers and torched a police car. An office block was also attacked, daubed with ‘f*** Trump’ and ‘kill Trump’ graffiti and then set alight.
And thousands more filled streets in Los Angeles before taking over the 110 Freeway while other protesters gathered outside City Hall, lighting fires and waving Trump heads on sticks. There were 14 arrests.
In New York, home of the President-elect, at least 30 people were arrested when cops cracked down on twin demonstrations in Columbus Circle and at Trump Tower.
As many as 7,500 demonstrators were believed to have been split between the two locations, chanting ‘Black Lives Matter’ and ‘Donald Trump, go away, racist, sexist, anti-gay.’
Cher and Madonna were among the NYC protesters, with Cher telling one supporter they needed to ‘fight.’
Trump’s poll-defying win has sparked a wave of similar rallies across the country. Protests stopped traffic in Chicago, Illinois; Portland, Oregon; and San Francisco, California, among many others.
It wasn’t just the temper tantrum protests that immediately followed the November 8, 2016 election, but they “resisted” straight up to the January 2017 inauguration of president Trump. Mass protests, rioting, with more than 200 arrested on inauguration day , just in DC alone.
Now imagine these people, after being fed a steady stream of negative coverage against president Trump and his supporters, since before the 2016 election, throughout the first two years of the Trump presidency, and looking like it will continue to be the same throughout the 2020 presidential campaign cycle.
Does anyone think the liberals will be less unhinged by November 2020?
If so, contact me, I have a bridge in Brooklyn and some swampland in Florida to sell you!
As I headed this bullet point, prepare. Prepare for mass civil unrest if President Trump wins re-election. If you live near a large city, and get your groceries, gas, anything from liberal areas, stock up on supplies ahead of time, and stay away from the larger cities, especially if there are any protests planned around your area.
Get some gas canisters and fill them up, so you don’t have to enter the danger zone. Triple, or quadruple your regular grocery purchases. Avoid crowded areas. Dip into your emergency survival foods if you have to, you can always get more when the most violent of protests are over.
BOTTOM LINE
The bottom line here is the headline of this article, if you think they’re crazy now, just imagine the liberal meltdown if president Trump wins re-election in 2020.

AIPAC gathering is full of lies and liars
The harm done by the Israeli connection to policy formulation in Washington and to U.S. troops based in the Middle East has been noted both by Admiral Thomas Moorer and General David Petraeus, with Moorer decrying how “If the American people understood what a grip those people have got on our government, they would rise up in arms. Our citizens certainly don’t have any idea what goes on.” Petraeus complained to a Senate Committee that U.S. favoritism towards Israel puts American soldiers based in the Middle East at risk. He was quickly forced to recant, however.
Former CIA Deputy Director Admiral Bobby Inman has also rejected the claim that Israel is a security asset by observing that “Israeli spies have done more harm and have damaged the United States more than the intelligence agents of all other countries on earth combined… They are the gravest threat to our national security.”

Phi Beta Iota: A more nuanced understanding would label the POWER to be Zionist, and the LEVERAGE to be Jewish. Zionists — all traitors to the USA if US citizens, all agents of a foreign power, have brainwashed and lied to Jews that are otherwise loyal to the USA, and executed a mass psychosis campaign. The good news is that most Jews in the USA are waking up to the reality that Zionist and Deep State lies are the greatest threat to the USA, and the Jexodus from the Democratic Party is long overdue. What the President has FAILED to do is offer #WalkAway a level playing field that enables access to power without having to join the equally corrupt Republican Party. #UNRIG – Unity for Integrity (Electoral Reform Act Proposed) is the answer. It can be passed before 2020 and some of its provisions can be imposed in 2020 — for example, paper ballots counted publicly on site and instant run-off.

BREAKING: Boeing 737 Deaths Could be Attributed to French Intelligence Malware Attack Intended to Push Boeing Down and Lift Airbus,www.therussophile.org,Editor,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/breaking-boeing-737-deaths-could-be-attributed-to-french-intelligence-malware-attack-intended-to-push-boeing-down-and-lift-airbus.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Robert David STEELE Vivas
I have had several conversations in the past hour, one of them with a top personality in France, and have concluded that despite the known problems with the Boeing 737, investigators should be looking into the possibility of French intelligence installed malware intended to disable pilot countermeasures (e.g. turn the equipment back on) and assure death.
Pilots around the world are saying:
01 The 737 is an old aircraft with new gadgets and was certified by a corrupt FAA official who used to work for Boeing — it was a known case of government malfeasance.
02 The old aircraft is a fly by wire, not a fully automated aircraft, the remote hijacking theory related to the UN and GESARA and all the la la stuff does not hold water. This was onboard embedded sabotage.
03 Airbus lost a major contract to Boeing and was in danger of losing more, despite is cost advantages associated with French government subsidies, and in part because Donald Trump has been one of Boeing’s best salesmen behind the scenes.
04 This is not only something that is right down the middle of French intelligence, which has always been about industrial espionage and sabotage to support “national” French companies, but because the Boeing 737 had a known problem, this is the full equivalent of all the heart attacks CIA and SOF are giving out here and there — the “cause” is a “pre-existing condition” rather than enemy action. This is French elegance at its best.
05 The two chosen targets, the airlines of Indonesia and Ethiopia, presented easy access to the aircraft and lax cyber-security — the malware could be installed and not noticed (sadly this would be true anywhere, but the targets were “third world”“expendibles by and large.
06 Not yet explained is how the US Department of State knew to act so aggressively to keep Americans off any airlines landing or taking off in Ethiopia.
I may have some of the above wrong — lost in translation stuff — but I believe that Boeing should be all over this, and the theory of French intelligence sabotage should be in the mainstream media.

REVEALED: U.S Satellites Repeatedly Spying on Russia and China’s Military Installations,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/revealed-u-s-satellites-repeatedly-spying-on-russia-and-chinas-military-installations.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
WASHINGTON DC – The US military spies satellites (GSSAP) have repeatedly secretly flown near the Russian and Chinese military and civilian space apparatuses to conduct inspection.
The information was released by a report on global space defense systems, launched by the US Secure World Foundation.
Between 2014 and 2016, the US launched four satellites under the GSSAP program to monitor and control outer space for the US Air Force.
According to official data, the satellites of this surveillance network are located near the geostationary orbit at an altitude of more than 35,000 kilometers and watch other satellites with the use of optical-electronic equipment.
“Although the US military does not provide public data on the locations or maneuvers of GSSAP satellites, other sources of tracking data indicate that they are very active in the geostationary region,” the report says. – Advertisement –
Meanwhile, US Undersecretary of Defense John Rood announced that the Pentagon is planning to start deploying “lower cost” sensors into Earth’s low-orbit, capable of detecting and launching hypersonic missile launches.
The announcement was made during a hearing on the US Senate Armed Services Committee, where Rood answered questions about how the US was fighting hypersonic weapons.
At the same time, the undersecretary gave no details on how the Pentagon plans to topple the missiles, noting that the military is working on developing ways to “affect them during flight.”
During a hearing devoted to military budget requests, Rood specifically pointed to the need to develop “hypersonic missile defenses”, justifying this because both Russia and China are developing sophisticated weapons, including hypersonic slip vehicles (HGV). The undersecretary noted that such missiles are capable of maneuvering into the atmosphere, making their trajectories unpredictable for traditional defenses.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has presented the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile (SS-N-33), revealing that the equipment can reach an impressive speed of 9Mach and attack targets both at sea and on ground at a distance of up to 1,000 kilometers .

All Major Candidates in Israel’s Presidential Election Are Far-Right.,www.therussophile.org,Eric Zuesse.,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/all-major-candidates-in-israels-presidential-election-are-far-right.html/,"This post was originally published on this site Eric Zuesse If “far-right” or “nazi” refers to proponents of racism, capitalism, and dictatorship, then all of Israel’s Presidential candidates are nazis — not German ones, of course, not members of Hitler’s German (the original) Nazi Party and a dictatorship of and by Aryans against Jews, but instead Jewish nazis and a dictatorship of and by Jews against Palestinians. On April 6th, Joel Greenberg, of BBC Monitoring, headlined “Israel election: Who are the key candidates?” and he described each of the seven, and the proposals from each. Here are highlights from his descriptions: Benjamin Netanyahu is the only one who needs no introduction to foreign audiences: He is well-known to be a racist against Palestinians, and he is a strong supporter of corporate Israel, and of apartheid in which Palestinians are legally discriminated-against and in which Jews have the right to take Palestinian land and used it for new settlements by Jews. “During the election campaign, he has warned that his challengers would allow the creation of a Palestinian state, calling it a mortal threat to Israel.” Benny Gantz : “Mr Gantz’s election ads have trumpeted his military record, featuring a body count of Palestinian militants and scenes of destruction from the war in Gaza that he oversaw in 2014. Seeking to draw right-leaning voters away from Mr Netanyahu, Mr Gantz has talked tough on Iran and echoed the prime minister’s positions on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.” Yair Lapid : “Mr Lapid has supported ‘separation’ from the Palestinians and in the past endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though he has not repeated that call in the current campaign. He has also been outspoken in his opposition to political alliances with Israeli Arab parties.” Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked : “The education and justice ministers are presenting themselves as genuine right-wing alternatives to Mr Netanyahu.” Avi Gabbay : “A former cabinet minister who was previously CEO of Israel’s largest telecoms company, Mr Gabbay appealed to right-wing voters after he was elected Labour’s leader in 2017. He dismissed the notion of evacuating Jewish settlements in the West Bank and declared that ‘the left has forgotten what it is to be Jewish’, echoing a phrase once used by Mr Netanyahu.” Moshe Feiglin : “A religious West Bank settler,” he is “a maverick politician with a mix of libertarian and ultra-nationalist views.” For more on each of the seven, see Greenberg’s article ."

We think that this is destructive to the ‘natural family’ and a madness that will bring humanity to destruction.”
Standing strong for traditional family values is not fascism, as the mainstream media often insinuates, but merely a concern for the future of humanity, Aleksey Komov, of the World Congress of Families (WCF), has told RT.
Liberal media, spurred on by hate-mongering “watchdogs” like the Southern Poverty Law Center, have lost their collective mind over the 13th WCF meeting that took place in Verona, Italy in late March, labeling the attendees “far-right” and “neo-Nazis” who attack women and roll back the rights of sexual minorities.
Komov, who represents the WCF at the UN and in Russia, dismissed these claims as “complete fake news,” arguing that the World Congress of Families was being held simply because “it’s important to support the family for any healthy society, so that people can have children and nations can flourish in the future.”
Family values are in danger because there are very powerful international lobby groups pushing for gender rights, introduction of same-sex marriage, abortions, euthanasia as well as legalization of drugs and prostitution.

As for the participants, they were “politicians, scientists, scholars and activists” from the US, Europe, Russia, Latin America and Australia . Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister, Matteo Salvini, “gave a fiery speech” and two other Italian ministers attended, as did representatives from 60 countries, including leaders of US conservative groups and members of the Russian parliament and the Orthodox Church, the activist said.

According to Komov, the media’s bashing of the WCF has been so harsh because “those people, who wanted to demonize Russia, are very angry at us because, despite all the sanctions and all the massive disinformation – despite all the efforts to make us enemies of each other – the conservative friendship stands.”
And the attacks weren’t restricted to the internet. More than 10,000 “LGBT and feminist” protesters descended on Verona during the event, with riot police even being forced to interfere and roadblocks being set up at various points around Verona’s Piazza Bra, where the conference took place.
Activists even tried to “shut down” the event “through calling the hotels where the participants were staying and using threats to make those hotels cancel their bookings. There were even physical threats of attacks against the attendees . Can you imagine this happening in Europe in the 21st century?” Komov wondered.
But it’s impossible to shut us down, because the vast majority of people, not only in Italy but in all of Europe, in Russia and all over the world are with us. Defending the traditional family is a winning concept.
Komov pointed out that there was also a rally in support of the conference in Verona, which attracted twice as many people as the anti-WCF protest and took place without incident – or media attention .

Despite their demonization in the media, the WCF and its activists never resorted to the means employed by their opponents , Komov said.
We’re very peaceful people. We are for freedom of expression and freedom of thought, religion and education. We’re not imposing our ideas on anybody, while the other side tries to impose their new, totalitarian, politically correct ideology and way of thinking on all of society.
Komov also addressed media speculation that he was “Putin’s agent” by saying that the level of connection between WCF and the Russian government has been “exaggerated.” However, he acknowledged that the congress fully backed Moscow’s stance of promoting family values and made no secret of the fact that WCF has received support from like-minded private Russian foundations, as well as from the Orthodox Church.

The next world reserve currency,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-next-world-reserve-currency.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

We’ve all seen some version of the following chart:
© Corbett Report
It purports to show the changeover in world reserve currencies from one era to the next, which not coincidentally tracks the rise (and fall) of the various colonial empires of the last several hundred years, from the Portuguese to the Spanish to the Dutch to the French to the British to the current era of Pax Americana. The implication is obvious: No empire lasts forever, and sooner or later that empire will fall, and with it the world reserve status of its currency.
As Mike Maloney points out in a recent video , this chart is wrong “because the world didn’t have a reserve bank that was doing international settlements or acting as a hub of any type of monetary system until the Bank of England.” Prior to the Bank of England’s establishment (discussed in my documentary Century of Enslavement: The History of the Federal Reserve ), there were predominant currencies, but nothing like a “reserve” currency.
That being said, the point stands: Empires do rise and fall, and in the era of world reserve currencies and international settlements, their currency’s status as a world reserve falls with them.
The other implication of this chart stands out like a sore thumb: The American Empire’s time is running out, and the dollar is going to go down with it.
It’s a theme I’ve discussed many times on the podcast, and something I’ve written about in detail over the years. The dollar is dying; everyone knows that. But the world reserve currency does not simply vanish ; it is replaced . So here’s the real question: If the dollar is going to go down, what will replace it?
The answer to that question is not so straightforward as it might seem. In order to get a handle on that answer, let’s take a look at a few of the latest stories to pop up in the unfolding “death of the dollar” narrative.
The first story, titled “ Russia Is Dumping U.S. Dollars to Hoard Gold ,” confirms what gold watchers have been noting for at least a year now : Russia is ditching the almighty greenback in favor of everyone’s favorite yellow metal. Why Putin and his Kremlin comrades are looking to reduce their reliance on the dollar is hardly a perplexing puzzler. The noose of US sanctions is increasingly tightening around Russia’s neck, so there’s very little incentive for the Russians to hang on to the economic dead weight that’s threatening to sink their fragile ship of state. As Putin himself puts it: “ We aren’t ditching the dollar, the dollar is ditching us .”
So why replace dollar reserves with gold holdings? This isn’t rocket science. Throughout much of the past several hundred years, the real reserve currency was gold . It is anyone’s guess what the next world reserve currency will look like, but one thing is for certain: it will either include gold as part of its backing or it will be tradable for gold at a rate that reflects gold’s current value. This is the reason that some of the biggest detractors of the dollar’s world reserve status-perhaps most notably Russia and China-have been hoarding gold like crazy in recent years.
Oh, did I mention China? Yes, they have been hoarding gold and selling off US debt , too. And they have created the Shanghai Gold Exchange, which, as I’ve explained before , dovetails with the Shanghai Energy Exchange’s yuan-denominated oil benchmark to create the possibility of a “petroyuan” to rival the petrodollar. In short, the rise of the petroyuan makes it feasible for China to buy oil from its trading partners (like, say, Russia) directly with yuan, which that trading partner (like, say, Russia) could then convert to gold to move back home.
Of course, it would be even easier if Russian banks and Chinese banks could facilitate direct exchanges between the two countries, settled in local currencies. And it would be ideal if all of this could bypass the SWIFT Network, which my readers will know has long been a tool of Uncle Sam’s foreign policy (and an increasingly unpopular one , at that).
Which brings us to our next story: “ Russian banks join Chinese alternative to SWIFT payment system .”
That’s right, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is announcing that an unspecified number of Russian banks are already connected to China’s alternative bank network, the China International Payments System (CIPS), which I first reported on in 2015 . Furthermore, the CBR is hyping Russia’s own SWIFT alternative, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), which already has over 500 members, including “major Russian financial institutions and companies.”
Now, as my long-term readers already know, these “alternatives” are a sham . Indeed, one of the first things CIPS did was sign a memorandum of understanding to use the SWIFT Network to transmit its information. That’s right, the SWIFT “alternative” actually relies on SWIFT to function! And as for SPFS . . . well, let’s just say it’s hardly ready for prime time yet , what with it’s 9 to 5 operating hours and prohibitively expensive wire transfer fees.
So (surprise, surprise!) the BRICS “alternatives” to the existing bankster system are no threat whatsoever to the bankster establishment. But they do tell us something important: The infrastructure for bypassing the dollar itself is almost in place.
Which leads us to yet another “death of the dollar” story from this week. This one, via Rothschild Reuters , tells us that unnamed “senior Saudi energy officials” have threatened “senior US energy officials” over a bill in the US Congress that would allow OPEC members to be sued in US court over price fixing. Since price fixing is basically OPEC’s raison d’être , and since OPEC is largely a Saudi operation, the Saudis are understandably upset by this. So what’s their threat? That they’ll stop pricing oil in dollars, of course. This is all part of a cat-and-mouse game between Uncle Sam and the Saudis that I’ve been documenting for years now , and this particular thrust and parry is no doubt just part of a larger story, but this story, too, tells us something important: The dollar is under threat from just about every angle now, and Washington’s frenemies (like Saudi Arabia) can smell the vulnerability.
But it’s important to note a distinction here. The current bankster system does revolve around King Dollar. But the banksters’ vision of our globalist future does not revolve around the dollar.
It’s a simple point, and it was made most effectively by Patrick Wood of Technocracy.news in our recent interview on technocracy and the new international economic order:
“Wouldn’t you suspect, though, back when the Federal Reserve was created in the early 1900s, that even the Rockefeller family knew that there would be some time in the future where that whole scheme would run out of juice? When you’ve milked it as much as you could possibly milk it and the currency itself serves no further purpose for them to amass wealth they’re going to abandon it for something else, right? Well, this seems to be what they’re abandoning it for right now.”
For those who haven’t listened to the full conversation yet, that “something else” that Wood is referring to is the idea of using blockchain and other “fintech” (financial technologies) to facilitate an entirely different type of world currency.
This fintech-enabled reserve currency revolves around the idea of “tokenization.” As Wood notes in his book, Technocracy: The Hard Road to World Order , tokenization is:
“a method that converts rights to an asset into a digital token. Suppose there is a $200,000 apartment. Tokenization can transform this apartment into 200,000 tokens (the number is totally arbitrary, we could have issued 2 million tokens). Thus, each token represents a 0.0005% share of the underlying asset. Finally, we issue the token on some sort of a platform supporting smart contracts, for example on Ethereum, so that the tokens can be freely bought and sold on different exchanges. When you buy one token, you actually buy 0.0005% of the ownership in the asset. Buy 100,000 tokens and you own 50% of the assets. Buy all 200,000 tokens and you are 100% owner of the asset. Obviously, you are not becoming a legal owner of the property. However, because Blockchain is a public ledger that is immutable, it ensures that once you buy tokens, nobody can ‘erase’ your ownership even if it is not registered in a government-run registry.”
This may sound like a flight of fancy, but as Wood notes, there are already groups seeking to tokenize the world’s resources to create a new blockchain-based currency called the “Earth Dollar.” The Earth Dollar Alliance describes the Earth Dollar as “the world’s first anti-inflationary asset-backed stablecoin and community currency, backed by 3.63 trillion CHF (Swiss Francs) (€3.22 trillion Euros) of Natural Capital Assets of the Earth, where our collective wealth can increase by protecting and restoring the Earth.”
Naturally, the Earth Dollar comes wrapped in a bunch of feel-good buzzword-laden rhetoric about sustainable development and protecting Mother Nature, but its core idea is, as Wood points out, ingenious. Evil, but ingenious. By basing the world monetary system on something like Earth Dollars, the banksters would be able to achieve all of their goals at once: to undermine the US dollar and any vestiges of national sovereignty; to create a new international currency out of whole cloth; and to claim ownership of the world’s most precious resources as backing for their currency (in the name of “ sustainable development ,” of course).
Now obviously we have a long way to go to get from point A (the current dollar reserve paradigm) to point Z (a global central bank-administered blockchain reserve system), and there are no doubt many twists and turns in the road from here to there. It’s doubtful that the Earth Dollar is the currency that the banksters have in mind and I’m not suggesting that this is the currency that will one day back the world monetary system. But there is no doubt that the banksters are considering a move to some sort of centrally-administered blockchain currency as the backbone for the world banking system.
After all, just consider:
As I’ve pointed out before, The Bitcoin Psyop is in full swing, and the central banksters are going to perform a bait-and-switch, confusing the public by seeming to embrace the decentralized, open access, distributed ledger promise of cryptocurrency but actually embracing the poison pill of centralized, closed access digital currency.
It is of course too early to say where all this will end up. There are too many variables at play to make informed predictions about the way the dollar will be replaced as a world reserve currency. It’s entirely possible, for example, that if the dollar was to die a sudden death, gold could be used as an international settlement currency, at least until a Bretton Woods-style agreement could be reached on a long-term replacement.
But two things are certain: The international bankster oligarchy loves their inflation too much to nail any future world system to a cross of gold .
and The international bankster oligarchy wants to replace the current nation state system with a global system of control (with them in the positions of power, of course).
So if the banksters get their way, it is very unlikely that a national currency will be the bedrock of the international order ever again.

#MeToo! Trudeau warns of evil Russian interference in upcoming parliamentary elections,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/metoo-trudeau-warns-of-evil-russian-interference-in-upcoming-parliamentary-elections.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned of the risk of interference by Russia and other foreign players in the country’s upcoming parliamentary elections.
“We’ve seen over the past number of years an increase in the interference or the implication of foreign actors in democratic processes,” Trudeau told a Toronto news conference on April 5.
“We saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns ; a lot of the divisive social media, you know, spreads [and has] turned our politics even more divisive and more anger-filled than they have been in the past,” he said.
He added that Karina Gould, Canada’s minister of democratic institutions, was creating “significant ways” to protect the elections and make sure the vote would be “decided by Canadians.”
U.S. intelligence agencies and European Union countries have accused Russia of interfering in their elections in recent years, including the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Moscow has denied the accusations.
Trudeau’s remarks echo those made earlier in the day by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, who said she was “very concerned” Russia would interfere in the election.
“ Our judgment is that interference is very likely , and we think there have probably already been efforts by malign foreign actors to disrupt our democracy,” she said on the sidelines of a Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers meeting in France.
Canada’s parliamentary elections are scheduled for October 21. Comment: It’s almost as if Trudeau is trying to be the lamest world leader. At least he’s good for a laugh, because that’s about all he’s good for. Crying “Russian interference” is just a political fad – an old and overused one, at that – and Trudeau wants to fit in. And notice Chrystia Freeland’s weasel words: “very likely”, “we think”, “probably”. SOTT’s judgment is that it is “very likely” Freeland is an android programmed to be a complete idiot, and “we think” there have “probably” been efforts by malign forces to corrupt Canadians’ precious bodily fluids.

War and soldiering were never far from the retired Polish army commander’s mind as he talked US nuclear strikes in response to Russia’s imaginary invasion and complained that NATO’s eastern European buildup was not enough.
Waldemar Skrzypczak, who led Poland’s Land Forces until 2009, seems to have joined the chorus of the West’s most belligerent military leaders who have seized on the “Russian threat” to make their case. Speaking to Wirtualna Polska, he claimed Poland has become a bulwark against the “aggression from the East.”
It is likely to become a scene of potential clashes between NATO and Russia, and this is why the alliance must realize that Poland “is an extremely important state from a strategic point of view,” the high-ranked retiree insisted.
Russia is now “the greatest concern of the free world,” and no army in Europe is a match for “the Russian war machine.” That said, there is only one thing left that could avert the imminent danger.
“It is true that the Americans vowed nuclear attacks to stop the Red Army in Poland,” Skrzypczak said, in an apparent reference to the days of the Cold War. “Now there are plans like this if Putin hits. Not only that, in a military sense, this is the most reasonable [response].”
Such an outcome is “unacceptable” for Poland but if an all-out war breaks out, “nobody will ask our opinion,” the former general said. Going back to reality, he acknowledged that the worst thing that could happen to Poland is its isolation “as a result of our own political mistakes.”
“To say that Poland alone will be able to resist the aggression of Russia is a cheap populism that none of our allies treat seriously,” Skrzypczak argued.
Over the past few years, Poland has seen no foreign military activity on its soil aside from a massive military buildup initiated by NATO. The 29-member bloc sent sizeable land and air force contingents from the US, the UK, Germany and others to Poland as well as Baltic states, in addition to building sophisticated military infrastructure there.
Poland, after Romania, will host the US-built Aegis Ashore land-based missile defense system, which covers all of western Russia. It also held an array of war games last year, with the two-week Saber Strike being the largest. The buildup did not go well, with some Poles who took part in numerous anti-war rallies in Warsaw and beyond.
According to the Russian military, NATO has tripled its assets on Russia’s western borders over the past five years. Moscow has repeatedly warned that an increased NATO presence on its doorstep undermines stability in Europe and heightens the risk of a military confrontation.

In a new book named Deadly Dust – Made in the USA: Uranium Weapons Contaminating the World German author Frieder Wagner gives a detailed account of how the US has contaminated vast territories using depleted uranium (DU) ammunition and the cover-up strategy of the military, industry and governments, as well as those in the media and politics.
Sputnik: Mr Wagner, in your book Deadly Dust – Made in the USA: Uranium Weapons Contaminating the World you talk about the use of uranium ammunition. What is especially dangerous about these weapons?
Frieder Wagner: Weapons containing uranium are produced from nuclear industry’s waste (byproducts of uranium enrichment). If, for example, you want to produce a ton of natural uranium fuel rods for nuclear power plants, you get about eight tons of depleted uranium. It is a source of alpha radiation – radioactive and, moreover, very poisonous. It needs to be stored somewhere, and it is not very cheap.
Sputnik: How can it be used in weapons?
Frieder Wagner: About 30-40 years ago, military scientists made a discovery: uranium is almost twice as dense as lead. If you turn depleted uranium into a projectile and give it proper acceleration, then within a fraction of a second it will pierce through tank armor, concrete or cement.
This, of course, was an important discovery. Furthermore, when a shell hits an armored tank the impact produces dust caused by the detonation and the subsequent release of heat energy causes it to ignite and it explodes at a temperature of 3000 to 5000 degrees – incinerating the tank’s interior and destroying it.
Sputnik: But what happens afterwards is also a problem – after the use of DU ammunition, isn’t it?
Frieder Wagner: Yes! After its use depleted uranium, which, as I have already said, is a source of alpha radiation (that is, a radioactive and very toxic substance), burns down to nano-particles that are a hundred times smaller than a red blood cell.
This way, I would say, a sort of metallic gas forms that people can inhale, and which is released in the atmosphere and can be carried anywhere by wind. People who inhale it are at risk for developing cancer.
These nano-particles can also penetrate the body of a pregnant woman, overcoming the barrier between a child and a mother, and affect the health of an unborn baby, can infiltrate the brain and by travelling through the bloodstream end up in any human or animal organ. Everything that goes around the planet, sooner or later settles and, of course, contaminates, in particular, drinking water and everything else.
Sputnik: In what wars have DU weapons been used so far?
Frieder Wagner: It was actively used during the first Gulf war in 1991 against Iraq. The military has admitted that about 320 tons were used. Then in the second war in Iraq in 2003 over 2,000 tons were used. In between, it was used during the war in Kosovo, in Yugoslavia (1999), and in Bosnia in 1995, and after 2001 in Afghanistan, where it still used today.
Sputnik: Your book title says Made in the USA, were these weapons only used by the United States?
Frieder Wagner: They were being developed in several countries at the same time. In Germany, they were also working on these weapons, as, of course, in Russia. However, it was used and on such a large scale, only by the US. They were reckless and they did not pay attention to any possible side effects – just as it was back when the first atomic bombs were used. That’s why I called the book: Deadly Dust – Made in the USA .
Sputnik: How did you manage to prove the use of these ammunitions in the course of your research?
Frieder Wagner: For example, the Serbs gave us maps where they showed the locations where depleted uranium was used. When we were in Iraq, we talked to the locals. We traveled to places where large tank battles took place and took soil samples there, as well as dust samples from tanks. Looking at the tank, you can see whether it was hit by an ordinary projectile or a uranium munition.
Uranium munition leaves dust that burns everything around the hole made by the projectile . So you can determine the use of uranium ammunition. In all soil samples, we found depleted uranium. Unfortunately, uranium-236 was also found in most of the soil and dust samples – it is even more intense and poisonous. Its radiation is even stronger and does not occur in nature. It can only be produced artificially during reprocessing of fuel rods. This means that we were able to prove that the military, the United States and its coalition allies used uranium munitions made from spent uranium fuel rods.
Sputnik: Y our book is based on the films The Doctor, the Depleted Uranium, and the Dying Children of Basra (Der Arzt und die verstrahlten Kinder von Basra, 2004) and Deadly Dust (Todesstaub, 2007). What did you see in Basra during your work on the documentary?
Frieder Wagner: It was horrific and still sometimes haunts me in my dreams. These were children with deformities, which we saw in orphanages in Basra and Baghdad. Some of them had such deformities that they had almost nothing human anymore.
There were children without a head or a nose, either with one eye or without eyes at all, with internal organs in a kind of “sack” outside their body. These ‘creatures’ can live only for a few hours, experiencing terrible pain, and then die.
Sputnik: The film Deadly Dust is l inked to the book, but it is no longer distributed. WDR channel after this film did not make any more orders? Why is that?
Frieder Wagner: My exposes which I sent to WDR, as well as to the ZDF channels were rejected. Then I contacted an editor at WDR, for which I always made good films and with which I always had good relations with, because these films had doubled or trippled their ratings, and asked him: “What’s going on here?”” And after some hesitation he said: “Yes, Frieder Wagner, someone must tell you this. WDR considers you a ‘difficult’ person. And most importantly, the topics you suggest are especially hard. Right now I’ve got nothing more to tell you.” And that when I understood everything. It was in 2005.
I can also tell you the story of how, for example, a female editor at ZDF offered the TV channel a story on the use of these weapons during the war in Yugoslavia and also in Croatia. She wanted to talk about it with me prior so I could share my experiences. But when her boss found out that she wanted to talk to Frieder Wagner, he refused to pay for her trip – without any further explanation.
Sputnik: The so-called “deadly dust” is, as you have already described it, is spread by the wind. So should the use of uranium ammunition, in fact, be considered a war crime and banned?
Frieder Wagner: This is definitely a war crime. The dust from southern Iraq is carried to the north by the constant storms, the so-called desert storms – for example, to Erbil, where it meets the mountains and can’t travel further as the mountains make it difficult for it to go past towards Turkey. So this huge mass of dust settles in Erbil.
We, for example, took samples of beef from around Erbil, and this is what we found out: depleted uranium used in ammunition has a characteristic atomic “fingerprint”. In northern Iraq we found the same “uranium fingerprint” as in the south. This means that the uranium dust that had originally settled in the south of Iraq is now also in the north, and children are now getting sick there and are born with deformities. It is now spreading all over the world.
Sputnik: Have the victims of uranium munition use in Kosovo or, for example, in Iraq, tried to go to court?
Frieder Wagner: So far no such attempts have been made in Kosovo or Iraq. Now in Kosovo, a whole group of lawyers are working on a lawsuit against NATO, because after the war they unleashed, people were injured, fell ill and died. The morbidity rate has increased by 20 to 30 percent, and there are more affected each year. So there will be an attempt to file a lawsuit.
Out of the approximately two thousand Italian soldiers stationed in Iraq and Kosovo, 109 have later developed cancer and died – this is proven information. 16 families, out of the 109 dead, filed lawsuits and won their cases. The courts ordered the Italian state or the country’s Ministry of Defence to pay them compensation. Since each cancer was of a different type, the payout amounts differed. But they ranged between 200,000 and 1,4 million euros.
Sputnik: How are things in Germany? Have there been lawsuits filed by the soldiers of the Bundeswehr?
Frieder Wagner: The German Ministry of Defense constantly denies any connection to this. Our soldiers are stationed in Afghanistan and Kosovo. About 100,000 soldiers served in Afghanistan, and we found out that about 30% of those who returned got sick, although at first, of course, they do not notice this. If they subsequently marry and have children, then there’s a great risk that their children will have disabilities.
These children will have the same toxic substances in their DNA as their parents. And this will be passed on for several generations – from children to grandchildren and to great-grandchildren.
Sputnik: But none of these people ever filed a lawsuit?
Frieder Wagner: In Germany there were no such precedents. About 600 servicemen went to court in the United States who could not appeal on their own behalf, but they filed lawsuits on behalf of their children who were born with developmental disabilities. And we’re not talking about a mere 90 or even 900 million pay out, but about billions of dollars now . The United States, of course, will try to delay the adoption of a ruling as much as it is possible and hope for a “biological” resolution of the situation – that is, that the plaintiffs will simply die.

“Russia is an inalienable and organic part of Greater Europe and European civilization. Our citizens think of themselves as European. That’s why Russia proposes moving towards the creation of a common economic space from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, a community referred to by Russian experts as ‘the Union of Europe’ which will strengthen Russia’s potential in its economic pivot toward the ‘New Asia.'” -Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation, February 2012
The allegations of ‘Russian meddling’ only make sense if they’re put into a broader geopolitical context. Once we realize that Washington is implementing an aggressive “containment” strategy to militarily encircle Russia and China in order to spread its tentacles across Central Asian, then we begin to understand that Russia is not the perpetrator of the hostilities and propaganda, but the victim. T he Russia hacking allegations are part of a larger asymmetrical-information war that has been joined by the entire Washington political establishment. The objective is to methodically weaken an emerging rival while reinforcing US global hegemony.
Try to imagine for a minute, that the hacking claims were not part of a sinister plan by Vladimir Putin “to sow discord and division” in the United States, but were conjured up to create an external threat that would justify an aggressive response from Washington. That’s what Russiagate is really all about.
US policymakers and their allies in the military and Intelligence agencies, know that relations with Russia are bound to get increasingly confrontational, mainly because Washington is determined to pursue its ambitious “pivot” to Asia plan. This new regional strategy focuses on “strengthening bilateral security alliances, expanding trade and investment, and forging a broad-based military presence.” In short, the US is determined to maintain its global supremacy by establishing military outposts across Eurasia, continuing to tighten the noose around Russia and China, and reinforcing its position as the dominant player in the most populous and prosperous region in the world. The plan was first presented in its skeletal form by the architect of Washington’s plan to rule the world, Zbigniew Brzezinski. Here’s how Jimmy Carter’s former national security advisor summed it up in his 1997 magnum opus, The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy And Its Geostrategic Imperatives:
“For America, the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia… (p.30)….. Eurasia is the globe’s largest continent and is geopolitically axial. A power that dominates Eurasia would control two of the world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. …. About 75 per cent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physical wealth is there as well, both in its enterprises and underneath its soil. Eurasia accounts for 60 per cent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourths of the world’s known energy resources.”1.
14 years after those words were written, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took up the banner of imperial expansion and demanded a dramatic shift in US foreign policy that would focus primarily on increasing America’s military footprint in Asia. It was Clinton who first coined the term “pivot” in a speech she delivered in 2010 titled “America’s Pacific Century”. Here’s an excerpt from the speech:
“As the war in Iraq winds down and America begins to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan, the United States stands at a pivot point. Over the last 10 years, we have allocated immense resources to those two theaters. In the next 10 years, we need to be smart and systematic about where we invest time and energy, so that we put ourselves in the best position to sustain our leadership, secure our interests, and advance our values. One of the most important tasks of American statecraft over the next decade will therefore be to lock in a substantially increased investment – diplomatic, economic, strategic, and otherwise – in the Asia-Pacific region…
“Open markets in Asia provide the United States with unprecedented opportunities for investment, trade, and access to cutting-edge technology… American firms (need) to tap into the vast and growing consumer base of Asia… The region already generates more than half of global output and nearly half of global trade. As we strive to meet President Obama’s goal of doubling exports by 2015, we are looking for opportunities to do even more business in Asia…and our investment opportunities in Asia’s dynamic markets.”2.
The pivot strategy is not some trifling rehash of the 19th century “Great Game” promoted by think-tank fantasists and conspiracy theorists. It is Washington’s premier foreign policy doctrine, a ‘rebalancing’ theory that focuses on increasing US military and diplomatic presence across the Asian landmass. Naturally, NATO’s ominous troop movements on Russia’s western flank and Washington’s provocative naval operations in the South China Sea have sent up red flags in Moscow and Beijing. Former Chinese President Hu Jintao summed it up like this:
“The United States has strengthened its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region, strengthened the US-Japan military alliance, strengthened strategic cooperation with India, improved relations with Vietnam, inveigled Pakistan, established a pro-American government in Afghanistan, increased arms sales to Taiwan, and so on. They have extended outposts and placed pressure points on us from the east, south, and west.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been equally critical of Washington’s erratic behavior. NATO’s eastward expansion has convinced Putin that the US will continue to be a disruptive force on the continent for the foreseeable future. Both leaders worry that Washington’s relentless provocations will lead to an unexpected clash that will end in war.
Even so, the political class has fully embraced the pivot strategy as a last-gasp attempt to roll back the clock to the post war era when the world’s industrial centers were in ruins and America was the only game in town. Now the center of gravity has shifted from west to east, leaving Washington with just two options: Allow the emerging giants in Asia to connect their high-speed rail and gas pipelines to Europe creating the world’s biggest free trade zone, or try to overturn the applecart by bullying allies and threatening rivals, by implementing sanctions that slow growth and send currencies plunging, and by arming jihadist proxies to fuel ethnic hatred and foment political unrest. Clearly, the choice has already been made. Uncle Sam has decided to fight til the bitter end.
Washington has many ways of dealing with its enemies, but none of these strategies have dampened the growth of its competitors in the east. China is poised to overtake the US as the world’s biggest economy sometime in the next 2 decades while Russia’s intervention in Syria has rolled back Washington’s plan to topple Bashar al Assad and consolidate its grip on the resource-rich Middle East. That plan has now collapsed forcing US policymakers to scrap the War on Terror altogether and switch to a “great power competition” which acknowledges that the US can no longer unilaterally impose its will wherever it goes. Challenges to America’s dominance are emerging everywhere particularly in the region where the US hopes to reign supreme, Asia.
This is why the entire national security state now stands foursquare behind the improbable pivot plan. It’s a desperate “Hail Mary” attempt to preserve the decaying unipolar world order.
What does that mean in practical terms?
It means that the White House (the National Security Strategy) the Pentagon (National Defense Strategy) and the Intelligence Community (The Worldwide Threat Assessment) have all drawn up their own respective analyses of the biggest threats the US currently faces. Naturally, Russia is at the very top of those lists. Russia has derailed Washington’s proxy war in Syria, frustrated US attempts to establish itself across Central Asia, and strengthened ties with the EU hoping to “create a harmonious community of economies from Lisbon to Vladivostok.” (Putin)
Keep in mind, the US does not feel threatened by the possibility of a Russian attack, but by Russia’s ability to thwart Washington’s grandiose imperial ambitions in Asia.
As we noted, the National Security Strategy (NSS) is a statutorily mandated document produced by the White House that explains how the President intends to implement his national security vision. Not surprisingly, the document’s main focus is Russia and China. Here’s an excerpt:
“China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity. They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence.”
Neither Russia nor China are “attempting to erode American security and prosperity.” They are merely growing their economies and expanding their markets. If US corporations reinvested their capital into factories, employee training and R and D instead of stock buybacks and executive compensation, then they would be better able to complete globally. Here’s more:
“Through modernized forms of subversive tactics, Russia interferes in the domestic political affairs of countries around the world.” (This is a case of the ‘pot calling the kettle black.’)
“Today, actors such as Russia are using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies. Adversaries target media, political processes, financial networks, and personal data.”
The western media behemoth is the biggest disinformation bullhorn the world has ever seen . RT and Sputnik don’t hold a candle to the ginormous MSM ‘Wurlitzer’ that controls the cable news stations, the newspapers and most of the print media. The Mueller Report proves beyond a doubt that the politically-motivated nonsense one reads in the media is neither reliably sourced nor trustworthy.
The Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community is even more explicit in its attacks on Russia. Check it out:
“Threats to US national security will expand and diversify in the coming year, driven in part by China and Russia as they respectively compete more intensely with the United States and its traditional allies and partners…. We assess that Moscow will continue pursuing a range of objectives to expand its reach, including undermining the US-led liberal international order, dividing Western political and security institutions, demonstrating Russia’s ability to shape global issues, and bolstering Putin’s domestic legitimacy.
We assess that Moscow has heightened confidence, based on its success in helping restore the Assad regime’s territorial control in Syria,… Russia seeks to boost its military presence and political influence in the Mediterranean and Red Seas… mediate conflicts, including engaging in the Middle East Peace Process and Afghanistan reconciliation….
Russia will continue pressing Central Asia’s leaders to support Russian-led economic and security initiatives and reduce engagement with Washington. …Russia and China are likely to intensify efforts to build influence in Europe at the expense of US interests…”3.
Notice how the Intelligence Community summary does not suggest that Russia poses an imminent military threat to the US, only that Russia has restored order in Syria, strengthened ties with China, emerged as an “honest broker” among countries in the Middle East, and used the free market system to improve relations with its trading partners and grow its economy. The IC appears to find fault with Russia because it is using the system the US created to better advantage than the US. This is entirely understandable given Putin’s determination to draw Europe and Asia closer together through a region-wide economic integration plan. Here’s Putin:
“We must consider more extensive cooperation in the energy sphere, up to and including the formation of a common European energy complex. The Nord Stream gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea and the South Stream pipeline under the Black Sea are important steps in that direction. These projects have the support of many governments and involve major European energy companies. Once the pipelines start operating at full capacity, Europe will have a reliable and flexible gas-supply system that does not depend on the political whims of any nation. This will strengthen the continent’s energy security not only in form but in substance. This is particularly relevant in the light of the decision of some European states to reduce or renounce nuclear energy.”
The gas pipelines and high-speed rail are the arteries that will bind the continents together and strengthen the new EU-Asia superstate. This is Washington’s greatest nightmare, a massive, thriving free trade zone beyond its reach and not subject to its rules. In 2012, Hillary Clinton acknowledged this new threat and promised to do everything in her power to destroy it. Check out this excerpt:
“U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described efforts to promote greater economic integration in Eurasia as ‘a move to re-Sovietize the region.'”…. “We know what the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down or prevent it,” she said at an international conference in Dublin on December 6, 2012, Radio Free Europe.”
“Slow down or prevent it”?
Why? Because E U-Asia growth and prosperity will put pressure on US debt markets, US corporate interests, US (ballooning) national debt, and the US Dollar? Is that why Hillary is so committed to sabotaging Putin’s economic integration plan?
Indeed, it is. Washington wants to block progress and prosperity in the east in order to extend the lifespan of a doddering and thoroughly-bankrupt state that is presently $22 trillion in the red but continues to write checks on an overdrawn account.
But Russia shouldn’t be blamed for Washington’s profligate behavior, that’s not Putin’s fault. Moscow is merely using the free market system more effectively that the US.
Now consider the Pentagon’s 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) which reiterates many of the same themes as the other two documents.
“Today, we are emerging from a period of strategic atrophy, aware that our competitive military advantage has been eroding. We are facing increased global disorder, characterized by decline in the long-standing rules-based international order – creating a security environment more complex and volatile than any we have experienced in recent memory. Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.”
Naturally, the “security environment” is going to be more challenging when ‘regime change’ is the cornerstone of one’s foreign policy. Of course, the NDS glosses over that sad fact. Here’s more:
“Russia has violated the borders of nearby nations and pursues veto power over the economic, diplomatic, and security decisions of its neighbors….”
Baloney. Russia has been a force for stability in Syria and Ukraine. If Obama had his way, Syria would have wound up like Iraq, a hellish wastelands occupied by foreign mercenaries. Is that how the Pentagon measures success? Here’s more:
“China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model…
“China and Russia are now undermining the international order from within the system…
“China and Russia are the principal priorities for the Department… because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security.”4.
Get the picture? China and Russia, China and Russia, China and Russia. Bad, bad, bad.
Why? Because they are successfully implementing their own development model which is NOT programed to favor US financial institutions and corporations. That’s the whole thing in a nutshell. The only reason Russia and China are a threat to the “rules-based system”, is because Washington insists on being the only one who makes the rules. That’s why foreign leaders are no longer falling in line, because it’s not a fair system.
These assessments represent the prevailing opinion of senior-level policymakers across the spectrum. (The White House, the Pentagon and the Intelligence Community) The USG is unanimous in its judgement that a harsher more combative approach is needed to deal with Russia and China. Foreign policy elites want to put the nation on the path to more confrontation, more conflict and more war. At the same time, none of these three documents suggest that Russia has any intention of launching an attack on the United States. The greatest concern is the effect that emerging competitors will have on Washington’s provocative plan for military and economic expansion, the threat that Russia and China pose to America’s tenuous grip on global power. It is that fear that drives US foreign policy .
And this is broader context into which we must fit the Russia investigation. The reason the Russia hacking furor has been allowed to flourish and spread despite the obvious lack of any supporting evidence, is because the vilifying of Russia segues perfectly with the geopolitical interests of elites in the government. The USG now works collaboratively with the media to influence public attitudes on issues that are important to the powerful foreign policy establishment. The ostensible goal of these psychological operations (PSYOP) is to selectively use information on “audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of… organizations, groups, and individuals.”
The USG now sees the minds of ordinary Americans as a legitimate target for their influence campaigns. They regard attitudes and perceptions as “the cognitive domain of the battlespace” which they must exploit in order to build public support for their vastly unpopular wars and interventions. The relentless Russiagate narrative (which was first referred to the FBI by the chief architect of the Syrian War, former-CIA Director John Brennan) represents the disinformation component of the broader campaign against Russia. Foreign policy elites are determined to persuade the American people that Russia constitutes a material threat to their security that must be countered by tighter sanctions, more sabre-rattling, and eventually war.

"GPS Goes “Haywire” When Putin Is Near, Study Finds",www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/gps-goes-haywire-when-putin-is-near-study-finds.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
A study published by the Center for Advanced Defense has determined that the Russia security services are using a cutting-edge new technique, presumably to protect President Putin – as well as several government buildings in Russia, and military facilities in Syria – from drone attacks.
Using publicly available data sets and reports on social media and in the press, the organization pinpointed incidences of “GPS spoofing” when an electronic weapon scrambles the data stream between nearby ships, vehicles and aircraft and the satellites that help power their navigation systems. In many cases, like one incident that occurred near the Kerch Strait, the site of a skirmish late last year between Ukrainian and Russian forces. As Putin and a convoy of construction vehicles crossed a new bridge over the Strait, the GPS of ships docked in a nearby harbor suddenly went “haywire.”
Here’s more on that from CBS News :
The ships’ GPS systems suddenly began to indicate they were actually 65 kilometers away, on land, in the middle of an airport.
The incident is one of many highlighted in a new report that found the Kremlin “spoofed” global positioning systems, or GPS, to effectively place a bubble around Putin or properties associated with him. The researchers, with a nonprofit called C4ADS and the University of Texas at Austin, used public marine GPS databases, as well as a GPS monitoring device on the International Space Station to track similar instances.
The report, which documented a pattern of spoofing surrounding the movements of the Russian head of state…
….surmised that the GPS scrambling technology was employed to protect him against drone attacks, or airborne robot spies.
The researchers theorize that one reason “spoofing” is deployed is to protect Putin and other Russian officials from attacks or surveillance by drones that rely on GPS.
“The purpose of this spoofing activity was likely to prevent unauthorized civilian drone activity as a VIP protection measure,” they wrote in the study.
The report also identified buildings used by Russian security services or the president that appeared to be hotspots for spoofing activity, and detailed several incidents of suspected mass-spoofing activity.
While the technology was presumably employed to protect Putin, there is an inadvertent drawback that could be used by exploited by malicious actors to stalk the president.
However, there’s a drawback to creating a GPS bubble around a world leader, said Todd Humphreys, an engineering professor at the University of Texas at Austin, who was involved with the study. It also makes it easier to keep track of Putin.
“What’s ironic is if you look at these patterns, and if you coordinate it with the movements of the leader of Russia, it appears you have a Putin detector,” Humphreys said. In other words, if you detect spoofing, there’s a good chance Putin may be nearby.
It also creates the possibility for collateral damage.
The technique could also prove dangerous. The 24 maritime vessels that reported the Kerch bridge incident were otherwise unaffected. But Humphreys said a similar tactic in Syria could affect airplanes, which require functioning GPS to stay out of harm’s way.
The researchers identified Russian equipment in Syria emitting what Humphreys described as “a whole different signal, one that was much much stronger, but not spoofing.” The signal appeared to be jamming airplane GPS units, effectively rendering their navigation systems inoperable.
When the same tactic was apparently deployed during large-scale Russian military exercises in eastern Europe, civilians saw the effects, according to the report.
“Norway and Finland reported severe GPS outages affecting commercial airliners and cell phone networks for several days,” according to the report.
Unfortunately, this drawback would probably exclude GPS spoofing from the list of possible anti-drone techniques employed by airports…we imagine the security staff at Heathrow and Gatwick will be very disappointed.

Fake News After Mueller: Orwell Would Be Delighted,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fake-news-after-mueller-orwell-would-be-delighted.html/,"Authored by Raul Ilargi Mueller via The Automatic Earth blog,
Allow me to start with a question: Has anyone seen any of the main newspapers and networks who went after Donald Trump for 3 years accusing him of colluding with “the Russians”, apologize to either Trump, or to their readers and viewers, for spreading all that fake news now that Robert Mueller said none of that stuff was real, that they all just made it up?
I’ve seen only one such apology, albeit a very good and thorough one, from Sharyl Attkisson for The Hill. But one is a very meager harvest of course. With over 500,000 articles on collusion published on the topic, as Axios said -leading to 245 million social media ‘interactions’, shouldn’t there be more apologies, if only so people can hold on to their faith in US media for a while longer?
Apologies to President Trump
With the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe now known to a significant degree, it seems apologies are in order. However, judging by the recent past, apologies are not likely forthcoming from the responsible parties. In this context, it matters not whether one is a supporter or a critic of President Trump. Whatever his supposed flaws, the rampant accusations and speculation that shrouded Trump’s presidency, even before it began, ultimately have proven unfounded. Just as Trump said all along. Yet, each time Trump said so, some of us in the media lampooned him.
We treated any words he spoke in his own defense as if they were automatically to be disbelieved because he had uttered them. Some even declared his words to be “lies,” although they had no evidence to back up their claims. We in the media allowed unproven charges and false accusations to dominate the news landscape for more than two years, in a way that was wildly unbalanced and disproportionate to the evidence. We did a poor job of tracking down leaks of false information. We failed to reasonably weigh the motives of anonymous sources and those claiming to have secret, special evidence of Trump’s “treason.”
As such, we reported a tremendous amount of false information, always to Trump’s detriment. And when we corrected our mistakes, we often doubled down more than we apologized. We may have been technically wrong on that tiny point, we would acknowledge. But, in the same breath, we would insist that Trump was so obviously guilty of being Russian President Vladimir Putin’s puppet that the technical details hardly mattered. So, a round of apologies seem in order.
It’s a shame Attkisson refrains from labeling the whole decrepit circus as “fake news”, even if she says it’s just that, in different words. It’s a shame because the term “fake news” can this way remain connected to Trump, something the mainstream media really like. Because it allows for the media to cast doubts on the Mueller report, and for the Democrats to cast doubt on AG Bill Barr.
But they, the MSM, CNN and the NYT, are the ones who, as Robert Mueller has proven, have been spreading fake news all that time, not Trump. And if you would suggest they apologize, they’ll tell you that you’re too early, wait for the report to be released, or that Bill Barr is holding tons of stuff back, or that Mueller didn’t have access to elementary info, or that Trump is a really bad person or or or.
Their reputations would be lost forever if they issue a mea culpa, and apologizing constitutes a mea culpa, so that’s not going to happen. And they all think their credibility remains sound and alive, because they live in echo chambers where they don’t have to listen to anyone prepared to cast any doubt on their credibility.
I first said it years ago: in the new -digital, social- media age, the mainstream media have only one chance of survival: report the naked truth, and be relentless about that. There are a billion voices who can write up rumors, slander, smear and other falsities, but none have the organizations to find out the truth.
Well, it looks like they gave up on that one chance. Russiagate has made it crystal clear that the MSM would rather make a quick buck than investigate, that money and political views trump veracity any day where they operate. So stick a fork in them and turn them over; they’re done.
April 1 was the perfect moment to add it all up, and the Babylon Bee did exactly that: CNN Publishes Real News Story For April Fools’ Day
Fooling thousands of readers in a prank that the cable news organization said was “just for fun,” CNN published a real news story for April Fools’ Day this year. The story simply contained a list of facts, with no embellishment, editorializing, or invented details. The story also didn’t cite shaky “anonymous sources” and only quoted firsthand witnesses to the event. It was completely factual without any errors whatsoever. Baffled CNN fans immediately knew something was up.
“I was reading this story, and I was like, ‘Wait, what is this?’” said one man in New York who relies on CNN for his fake news every morning. “They really got me good. Then I looked up at the calendar and I realized I’d been duped. A classic gag!”“Those little rascals!” he added, shaking his head and laughing goodnaturedly. “As long as they return to their regularly scheduled fake news tomorrow, we’re good. We’re good.”
We could stop right there. What’s to add? It sums up America to the core. Then again, perhaps not quite yet. How about we add this from the BBC?
Is Facebook Winning The Fake News War?
For the people contracted by Facebook to clamp down on fake news and misinformation, doubt hangs over them every day. Is it working? “Are we changing minds?” wondered one fact-checker, based in Latin America, speaking to the BBC. “Is it having an impact? Is our work being read? I don’t think it is hard to keep track of this. But it’s not a priority for Facebook. “We want to understand better what we are doing, but we aren’t able to.”
[..] While there are efforts from fact-checking organisations to debunk dangerous rumours within the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook has yet to provide a tool – though it is experimenting with some ideas to help users report concerns.
Right, Facebook Fights Fake News. Right. 533,074 web articles on Trump-Russia collusion pre-Mueller report according to Axios, and 245 million ‘interactions’ -including likes, comments and shares- on Twitter and Facebook. Let’s say 100 million on Facebook.
How much did they catch as fake news in their valiant efforts? Not “the Russians” spreading fake news, but the New York Times? How about none? How many times did Facebook shut down the New York Times? Rachel Maddow? None. But Robert Mueller says all those articles about collusion were fake news.
Those reputations are gone forever. Nobody serious will ever again believe anything these people say. Oh, their own subscribers will, but they don’t count as serious people. They swallowed all the nonsense for all of that time. Get real.
Talking about reputations: I decided to try and follow the trails of the Steele dossier earlier, because I think if you figure out the road that dossier has traveled, who has been pushing it etc., you can get a long way towards finding out how how Russiagate came about.
I turned to Wikipedia first, where “Steele dossier” automatically becomes “Trump-Russia dossier”. I read the intro, and it was already so clear where Wikipedia stands on this: not on Trump’s side. Impartiality does not count as a virtue there either. And I know that this stuff is written by third parties, but does Jimmy Wales really want to devalue his life’s work for party politics?
Right below the intro of the very long entry, a familiar name pops up: Luke Harding, and I’m thinking HAHAHAHA!
Luke Harding, after making a mint with his book Collusion, which Robert Mueller has singlehandedly moved into the Fiction section of the bookstore, and co-writing Manafort Held Secret Talks With Assange In Ecuadorian Embassy last November, which Mueller fully discredited, is presented as a source for an entry about collusion? Oh boy.
A few paragraphs down I come upon the name Victoria Nuland, and again of course I think HAHAHAHA, what kind of source is she? Nuland became notorious for colluding with John McCain on Maidan Square in Kiyv, and she has less credibility than Harding, if such a thing is possible. A Nuland quote from the Wikipedia article:
“In the middle of July [2016], when he [Steele] was doing this other work and became concerned, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding and our immediate reaction to that was, ‘This is not in our purview’.”“This needs to go to the FBI if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian Federation. That’s something for the FBI to investigate.”
The entry continues:
It has remained unclear as to who exactly at the FBI was aware of Steele’s report through July and August, and what was done with it, but they did not immediately request additional material until late August or early September, when the FBI asked Steele for “all information in his possession and for him to explain how the material had been gathered and to identify his sources. The former spy forwarded to the bureau several memos — some of which referred to members of Trump’s inner circle. After that point, he continued to share information with the FBI.”[57][56]
According to Nancy LeTourneau, political writer for the Washington Monthly, the report “was languishing in the FBI’s New York field office” for two months, and “was finally sent to the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.”, in September 2016.[65]
Meanwhile, in the July to September time frame, according to The Washington Post, CIA Director John Brennan had started an investigation with a secret task force “composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI”. At the same time, he was busy creating his own dossier of material documenting that “Russia was not only attempting to interfere in the 2016 election, they were doing so in order to elect Donald Trump … [T]he entire intelligence community was on alert about this situation at least two months before [the dossier] became part of the investigation.”
Ergo: the fully deranged Nuland, then Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, gets the dossier to the FBI, where nothing happens with it despite Nuland’s insistence that it shows terrible things going on, until someone (McCain?!) gets it to Brennan, and then the ball gets rolling.
There’s all these people in the Hillary sphere of influence who pick it up, in the media, the House, and the FBI and CIA. Because the campaign decides a story about prostitutes peeing on a bed where Obama once slept can a be a winner, and by July 2016 a few nerves had started twitching. The entire machinery shifted into gear right then and there.
The index to the entry contains some 350 links to articles, almost all by the usual suspects and with the usual angles. It all oozes collusion. An exception is Bob Woodward in January 2017: ‘Garbage Document’: Woodward Says US Intel Should Apologize Over Trump Dossier
Woodward said on “Fox News Sunday” the dossier was a “garbage document” and that Trump’s point of view on the matter is being “under-reported.”Woodward said the dossier should never have been presented at an intelligence briefing and it was a mistake for U.S. intelligence officials to do so. “Trump’s right to be upset about that … Those intelligence chiefs, who were the best we’ve had, who were terrific and have done great work, made a mistake here.
And when people make mistakes, they should apologize,” said Woodward. Meantime, Woodward’s former partner in reporting on the Watergate scandal, helped report the news about the dossier on CNN last week. Carl Bernstein defended the reporting on the dossier, dismissing Trump’s contention that it was “fake news.” Bernstein argued that U.S. intelligence saw fit to present the material to President Obama and President-elect Trump.
“Mistakes” by the intelligence chiefs? Hard to believe, if you’ve followed Brennan, Clapper, Comey in the past 2 years.
Not sure I’m going to finish reading that Wikipedia entry on the Steele dossier. What’s the point? It’s fantasy advertized as fact in order to make money. It’s misleading, it’s fake and it seeks to damage people. It would appear we’d be better off discussing what fake news is (and what is not), and to not stick the label to everything Trump says, or the $50 million spent on the Mueller probe will have been entirely wasted.
What we can learn from it is that we can no longer trust the media we once had confidence in. Those days are gone and they won’t be back. They’ve been lying for a long time for their 30 pieces of silver, and once your credibility is gone, it’s gone for good.
That, by the way, is why we need Julian Assange so much, because we know he doesn’t lie. But of course that little fact has also already been buried in a big pile of fake news.

Even Joe Biden's Wife Said His Constant Groping Made Her Feel “Strange And Uncomfortable”,www.therussophile.org,Tyler Durden,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/even-joe-bidens-wife-said-his-constant-groping-made-her-feel-strange-and-uncomfortable.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Even Joe Biden’s wife found her husband’s tendency to be overly physical to be strange and off-putting when they first met.
According to an excerpt from the former second lady’s upcoming autobiography published in the Daily Mail, when the couple first met, “He was always holding my hand, putting his arm around me, brushing the hair from my face.” She added that Joe and his “handsy” family made her feel “strange and uncomfortable” at first. As an admitted introvert, she “sometimes found all that affection draining,”
But she said she soon came to understand that it was the death of Biden’s first wife Neilia and their baby daughter Naomi that made Biden and his family realize “how precious every second could be,” which was displayed by “constantly touching” and “being connected to each other.”
But Jill said this “tactile” sensibility helped make Biden the politician that he is .
“He connects with people so easily and he never hesitates when a stranger wants to tell him something personal or give him a hug,” she said.
“When Joe loves, he loves hard; he’s all in.”
Case in point: She went on her first date with Biden after he cold called her. “How did you get this number?” were the first words she remembers speaking to him back in 1975, when he was a young Senator from the State of Delaware. Joe told her that he got her number from his brother, Frank.
When she told him she had a date already planned the night, Biden asked her to cancel it; she did, and they went out for the next three nights.
Of course, the eight women who have accused Biden of inappropriately groping them probably wouldn’t see this as an excuse. Not that Biden cares: He infamously refused to apologize for his behavior, though he did promise to be more mindful of other people’s feelings.
Since one of Biden’s accusers blasted him over his non-apology, maybe getting the “you just don’t understand” talk from his wife would be more effective.

PARIS, April 6. /TASS/. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations called on Moscow to set free the Ukrainian naval sailors who were detained by border guards in November 2018 in the Kerch Strait, says the final communique released after the ministers’ two-day meeting in France’s Dinard.
“We express our utmost concern about Russia’s actions against Ukraine in the Kerch Strait and surrounding waters, which have dangerously raised tensions,” it says. “We call on Russia to release the detained crew and vessels and refrain from impeding lawful passage through the Kerch Strait.”
The G7 foreign ministers expressed their “utmost concern at the challenging security and humanitarian situation that has prevailed in Eastern Ukraine for nearly five years, we fully support the efforts within the Normandy format and of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe for a solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the communique says.
“We are convinced that the only way to reach a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict is through the full implementation by the sides of their commitments under the Minsk agreements with the aim of restoring Ukraine’s territorial integrity,” the document says.
According to the G7 ministers, “the duration of economic sanctions is entirely linked to Russia’s complete implementation of its commitments under the Minsk agreements.”
“These sanctions can only be rolled back if Russia truly fulfills these commitments, but we also stand ready to take further restrictive measures should Russia’s actions so require,” they stressed. Kerch Strait incident
On November 25, 2018, three Ukrainian naval ships left the port of Odessa heading into the Sea of Azov. While passing through the Kerch Strait, they violated the rules of passage for warships via Russia’s territorial waters from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov. In defiance of Russian border guards’ lawful demands to halt, the Ukrainian ships went on moving, thus forcing the Russian border guards to open gunfire in order to compel them to stop. The ships were detained and towed to the city of Kerch. The 24 Ukrainian sailors were arrested on charges of the illegal crossing of the Russian border. A criminal case was opened.

TASS, April 6. Libya’s National Army (LNA) led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar hails Russia’s stance on the situation in their country, LNA Spokesperson Brigadier General Ahmed Al-Mesmari said on Al Arabiya television channel on Saturday.
“We hail the stance of Russia that realizes it is necessary to put an end to threats from militias and terrorist groups,” he said commenting on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s words at talks in Cairo with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
Earlier in the day, Lavrov said that Moscow “keeps an eye on the armed forces’ advance, including the Libyan National Army and other groups, including those, which are illegal armed groups and control a considerable part of the country’s capital and some other areas”.
The Russian foreign minister stressed, “We are opposed to attempts to apportion blame unilaterally.”
Currently, Libya has two supreme executive authorities, namely Tripoli’s world-recognized government of National Accord headed by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj and the interim government headed by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani, which operates in the country’s east along with the elected parliament and is supported by the Libyan National Army.
On April 4, Haftar announced the launch of an offensive on Tripoli. Meanwhile, Fayez al-Sarraj ordered all military units subordinate to him to be on alert and to use force if necessary “to defend the civilian population and critical facilities”.

PARIS, April 6. /TASS/. Foreign ministers of the Group of Seven nations called on Moscow to return to full compliance with its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), the final communique said, released after the ministers’ two-day meeting in France’s Dinard.
“We urge Russia to return to full and verifiable compliance with its obligations under the Treaty, prior to the US withdrawal taking effect, in order to preserve the Treaty. We recognize that Russia’s failure to do so will result in the end of the treaty,” the document says.
The G7 ministers pledged “to remain vigilant to the security implications of Russia’s development and deployment of INF-noncompliant missiles and respond accordingly.” INF treaty
The INF, or the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, Treaty was signed between the former Soviet Union and the United States on December 8, 1987 and entered into force on June 1, 1988. In 1992, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union, the treaty became multilateral with the former Soviet republics – Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine – as successors. The INF Treaty covered deployed and non-deployed ground-based short-range missiles (from 500 to 1,000 kilometers) and intermediate-range missiles (from 1,000 to 5,500 kilometers).
On February 1, US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said that Washington would suspend its liabilities under the INF Treaty starting February 2 and would quit it within six months if Russia did not come into compliance with the agreement. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded in kind, saying that Moscow would suspend the Cold War-era treaty. Moreover, he told the ministers not to initiate disarmament talks with Washington, underscoring that the United States should become “mature enough” for an equitable and meaningful dialogue.

A Syrian official has lashed out at Britain, France and the United States over warning Damascus against using chemical weapons, saying the three countries are fully responsible for pushing terrorist groups to use toxic chemical materials in the crisis-plagued Arab country.
The unnamed official at the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates told Syria’s official news agency (SANA) on Saturday that it was no longer a secret that the trio had encouraged foreign-sponsored Takfiri outfits to stage chemical attacks in the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun, the cities of Douma and Aleppo and more recently in the northern village of al-Rasif.
The official went on to say that a Friday joint statement by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was intended to prepare the global public opinion for potential chemical attacks in Syria.
He further noted that the three top diplomats were resorting to cheap propaganda and flawed policies in a bid to allay suspicions about their countries’ support for terrorist groups, which have killed many people and wreaked havoc in Syria.
The official highlighted that the US, France and Britain had funneled munitions and large sums of money to terrorists outfits and the so-called civil defense group White Helmets that has been repeatedly accused of cooperating with Takfiri terrorists and staging false-flag gas attacks, adding that such acts were indicative of their lies.
The official stressed that these countries, which had used chemical weapons in their former colonies and against nations who fought for their freedom, sovereignty and independence, were not entitled to accuse the incumbent Syrian government of using chemical weapons.
“The use of white phosphorous bombs by the US to kill civilians in Dayr al-Zawr province, and destroy Syrian towns and cities, including Raqqah, offer unequivocal evidence for the shameful behavior of these three countries,” the official pointed out.
The official stressed that Syria’s accession to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and its full commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention were convincing proof that the Damascus government would not use chemical weapons anywhere, anytime or under any circumstances.
Syria roundly condemns the US, France and Britain’s threats, which are aimed at undermining OPCW objectives and exploiting the organization to pursue their fiendish interests, endanger international peace and security and put the international order at risk, the official concluded.

On April 6, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is considering formally annexing certain Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
“You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage – the answer is yes, we will move to the next stage. I am going to extend [Israel’s] sovereignty,” Netanyahu said in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 News.
The prime Minister, who already gained a US recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in fact promised to annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if elected for another term next week. To all those who still talk about the Bar-Ilan speech, Netanyahu just expressed his support for West Bank annexation on live TV.
— Eli Kowaz אילייקואז (@elikowaz) April 6, 2019
In a previous statement made on April 3 Netanyahu claimed that he told US President Donald Trump that his country was not ready to evacuate “a single person” from the West Bank settlements.
“As far as I am concerned, [the evacuation] won’t be [in] there and, if it is, it won’t [happen],” the prime minister said.
He also emphasized that Israel insists on continued control over West Bank territories.
Taking into account a fierce support of Israeli actions from the Trump administration, Netanyahu claims may become reality in the near future. MORE ON THE TOPIC:"

Cuba has been “illegal” for sixty years. In other words, it has successfully if tragically resisted the imposition of the neoliberal order following the Cuban Revolution.
It’s safe to say the average American knows virtually nothing about Cuba and its history. They don’t know about Fulgencio Batista, the brutal military leader who enforced a neoliberal (and Mafia) status quo in Cuba. At the time, foreign corporations, primarily American, owned 70% of the arable land, and Batista served as a middleman for transnational business deals.
“By the late ’50s, U.S. financial interests included 90 percent of Cuban mines, 80 percent of its public utilities, 50 percent of its railways, 40 percent of its sugar production and 25 percent of its bank deposits—some $1 billion in total,” writes Natasha Geiling .
In 1952, unable to gain the support of the Cuban people in his bid for the presidency (his party was in last place), Batista staged a military coup. He was aligned with the Cuban elite, the owners of sugar plantations, and received logistical, military, and financial support from the US government.
“He aligned himself with the Italian and the Jewish mafia from the United States who controlled drugs, gambling and prostitution rings in the U.S. The Batista government was favored by American-based corporations that had invested in Cuba,” writes Timothy Alexander Guzman .
In order to crush dissent to his dictatorial regime, Batista imposed iron-clad media censorship. He ordered his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities to kidnap, torture, and murder political activists.
Batista created an anti-Communist secret police to silence the public with violence, torture and public executions. It is estimated that there were between 10,000 to 20,000 people murdered under the Batista regime with financial and military support from the Washington. During Batista’s reign of terror, the July 26 Movement organized by Fidel Castro and other anti-government groups throughout Cuba were forming a rebellion against the Batista government.
In 1959, Castro rejected the characterization that his movement was communist, preferring instead to call it humanismo. However, in order for the US to intervene (as did later with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion), it portrayed Castro as a communist and a threat to US national security (which, of course, means it was a threat to predatory banks and corporations).
It’s hardly surprising Cuba became a Marxist-Leninist police state. “The Soviet Union, the socialist camp, the People’s Republic of China, and North Korea helped us resist, with essential supplies and weapons, the implacable blockade of the United States, the most powerful empire ever to exist,” Castro said.
On October 19, 1960, in the waning months of the Eisenhower administration, the US place a crippling embargo on Cuba. This resulted in Castro nationalizing US and transnational business interests.
The Council on Foreign Relations explained how it and the government planned to tame Castro: “Since 1961, the official U.S. policy toward Cuba has been two-pronged: economic embargo and diplomatic isolation.”
At the same time, Eisenhower was working secretly with the CIA to assassinate Castro and re-install a neoliberal autocracy.
The CIA plan was dubbed Trinidad and it was based on successful CIA coups in Iran and Guatemala. Trinidad envisioned an amphibious invasion. The idea was to carve out a beachhead and establish a council that would gain international recognition and support by the US and the Organization of American States.
After Kennedy was elected, the CIA produced a revised plan, codenamed Zapata, later known as the Bay of Pigs plan, and it turned out to be a spectacular failure. This plan and other unsuccessful attempts to destabilize Cuba resulted in Castro’s move toward communism and the imposition of a police state and widespread political repression.
Relations between Cuba and the US thawed a little during the Obama administration, but after Trump was elected and the neocons began dictating foreign policy the old anti-Communist animosity returned with a vengeance.
“[The Obama administration] made a deal with a government that spread violence and instability in the region and nothing they got, think about it, nothing they got, they fought for everything and we just didn’t fight hard enough, but now, those days are over,” Trump said during a speech in Miami . “We now hold the cards. The previous administration’s easing of restrictions of travel and trade does not help the Cuban people. They only enrich the Cuban regime.”
The “violence and instability” Trump mentioned includes Cuba sending doctors to Venezuela.
According to the Gray Lady of Propaganda, The New York Times , this medical aid isn’t about helping needy Venezuelans, but a cynical political move.
“In interviews, 16 members of Cuba’s medical missions to Venezuela—a signature element of relations between the two countries—described a system of deliberate political manipulation in which their services were wielded to secure votes for the governing Socialist Party, often through coercion,” the Times reported last month.
Now that Washington has targeted oil shipments between Venezuela and Cuba, it is likely only a matter of time before a tanker is seized or sunk by the US military.
Rabid “exceptional nation” neocons are running US foreign policy again and the possibility of armed conflict between the US and Cuba is heightened to a level not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis. That one nearly resulted in a nuclear war.
I doubt this engineered crisis will terminate in a nuclear showdown. However, considering Trump’s belief nukes can and should be used, and the venomous pronouncements of his neocons toward not only Venezuela and Cuba, but also Russia and China, it’s not difficult to imagine the unimaginable.

“Joining me today is Vanessa Beeley, here to discuss a very important subject. With all that is happening in Syria today, and all that is going on the world, it is important to understand the inner working parts of the West’s regime change machine that’s being sold to the world as one of peace and liberation, when in reality, that couldn’t be further from the truth. One very integral part of this machine is the White Helmets. Their actions, specifically in Syria, give us an insight into the true nature of those behind the scenes actually in control. And some of what we will discuss today, about the West’s operatives, might shock you.” ~ Ryan Cristian

The photos brought to public attention in January 2014 by the anonymous witness codenamed ‘Caesar’ show corpses, thousands in number, deceased from violent causes, some bearing signs of torture and many having suffered starvation and neglect. [1] The dead are said to be victims of Syrian state detention facilities, but it is now known that many were not, and it is still not known for sure how many of them were. [2]
If the atrocity of the crimes to which the photos attest is in no doubt, the question of who perpetrated them is less clear-cut. Yet Western reports have unequivocally blamed the ‘Assad regime’. A counter-hypothesis, hardly considered in public discussions, is that many of the bodies were of civilians captured by Jaish al-Islam (JAI) after taking control of Douma in December 2012. JAI are known to have starved their captives while using them as slave labourers, which they did on a scale monumental enough to create the extraordinary network of deep and impressively engineered tunnels that we now see had been built across the area under their control. [3]
Nevertheless, a Qatari-sponsored prosecution team vouched for the Caesar evidence as being ‘capable of being believed’– in a court of law – to show ‘systematic torture and killing of detained persons by the agents of the Syrian government.’ [4] The Western media’s subsequent dissemination of the prosecutors’ interpretation of the images – unchallenged – caused it to be widely believed in the ‘court of public opinion’. Despite significant unsettled and unsettling questions, then, a particular account of what the images show has exercised considerable influence over people’s default assumptions about accountability for atrocities in Syria.
It is the influence of this specific interpretation of evidence that will be reflected on here, and without prejudice as to what may be established about occurrences in Syrian detention on other bases. [5] Questions about the Caesar evidence point up concerns about the extent to which the dissemination of inaccurate information might have distorted the written historical record of our times and how it may have practically influenced real decisions and events.
It matters to get at the truth about the photos for those reasons, as well as for the sake of families whose loved ones have disappeared, but there is also a further reason. This concerns a use made of Caesar’s testimony that may affect the future course of history too. It is the promotion by Western prosecutors of judicial innovation in the pursuit of accountability for atrocity crimes. The purpose of this article is to set out how and why that is a concern, and fundamentally one about justice .
To situate the discussion it will be worth briefly outlining the contrasting kinds of reception the Caesar testimony has received – affirmative versus sceptical – and then also pointing to a much less noticed reception, one of significant silence . For there is an identifiable group of usually vocal critics of the Syrian president and government that has refrained from mentioning the name Caesar. This in itself could be somewhat revealing about what intelligence that group accepts as authoritative. But it also throws into relief the distinctive commitments of another group who, by contrast, have made considerable use of the Caesar name.
It is they who have, for instance, provided the impetus behind successful lobbying for the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act in the United States. Less spectacular, but of potentially more enduring international significance, is dissemination of Caesar’s narrative in a wider campaign aimed at creating increasingly flexible mechanisms for international criminal prosecutions. [6]
Billed by some as a progressive and cosmopolitan approach to ‘global justice’ that sets human rights above the prerogative of despots, this movement might more cautiously be assessed as legitimising ‘regime change’ by means of judicial innovation. Such use of the Caesar testimony could serve not only to delegitimise the current president of Syria but also to enhance the possibility of delegitimising any head of state.
This would be at the initiative of prosecution teams who themselves are accountable to their clients and sponsors rather than to the victims of conflict or to principles of humanitarian justice. The argument thus to be developed in this article commends caution about both the evidentiary value of the Caesar testimony and the intentions of those who have most vocally asserted it.
Caesar, his story and the questions raised.
The basic outline of Caesar’s story can be sketched quite succinctly. According to the testimony attributed to Caesar, he had been working as a military photographer in Damascus, where his job was to photograph the dead for purposes of state record keeping. In 2011, concerned at the number of deceased, and the visible indications of torture and starvation, he started smuggling digital files of the images to a contact, now referred to as Sami, who passed them to the Syrian National Movement (SNM). In August 2013, the SNM facilitated Caesar’s extrication from Syria, to be followed shortly after by his immediate family members.
The SNM, although based in Turkey, was backed by Qatar, and the Qatari government hired a team of lawyers and forensic specialists to assess the credibility of the witness and his evidence as a basis for potential prosecutions. In a matter of days the team pronounced Caesar’s evidence ‘capable of being believed’ in a court. [7]
Caesar was then taken to Washington on a visit facilitated by Mouaz Moustafa, director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a US State Department sponsored organisation representing some of the anti-government forces in Syria. When giving testimony there, Caesar’s face was concealed and his words were whispered to Moustafa, who acted as translator. After appearing in several other high profile venues with similar arrangements for anonymity, Caesar withdrew from the limelight.

Meanwhile, an influential section of United States political opinion has pronounced itself confident enough in the witness Caesar to enact legislation in his name – the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act – aimed at enforcing ‘accountability’ measures on Syria. The lead author of the Caesar Report, David Crane, has spoken of the photographic evidence as a ‘smoking gun’, words echoed by Keith Harper, US Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Stephen Rapp, the former US Ambassador At Large for War Crimes, has stated that the photos help to provide ‘much better evidence than has been available to prosecutors anywhere since Nuremberg’. [8]
Prosecution teams in Europe have also attributed great value to the photos as evidence of atrocity crimes. [9] Among the lawyers prominent in promoting the prosecutorial value of the Caesar evidence are Toby Cadman, [10] Wolfgang Kaleck [11] and Patrick Kroker. [12] Meanwhile, the NGO Human Rights Watch produced its own report claiming to validate some of the Caesar evidence. [13] A number of journalists have also expressed themselves convinced, including Richard Engel, who has met ‘Caesar’, and Josh Rogin, Ben Taub, Susie Linfield, [14] Nick Robins-Early, [15] Adam Ciralsky, [16] Jim Muir for the BBC, [17] as well as many more contributors to news outlets including Spiegel, [18] Daily Mail, [19] CNN. [20]
Garance le Caisne wrote a book on Operation Caesar , and documentary films featuring it include Sara Afshar’s Syria’s Disappeared . Affirmation of the evidence has made its way into academic publications too. Some of this has come from people involved in organisations campaigning for an approach to justice and accountability for atrocity crimes that allows implementation of a ‘responsibility to prosecute’.
Those with this interest include prosecution lawyers and advisors like Stephen Rapp, David Crane, Wolfgang Kaleck, Patrick Kroker, and Beth Van Schaack. Other academics who have cited the Caesar evidence uncritically, treating it as part of an established factual record, include: Noha Aboueldahab; [21] Jamie Allinson; [22] Adam Bazco, Gilles Dorronsoro and Arthur Quesnay; [23] Nader Hashemi; [24] Bessma Momani and Tanzeel Hazak; [25] Chris Tenove; [26] and Thomas Weiss. [27]
Some academics have cited the HRW report rather than the original Caesar Report, even if, like Van Schaack, [28] they apparently did not notice how HRW had significantly modified some of the original report’s claims, such as the 11,000 victims figure that HRW corrected down. In all, it can certainly be said that Operation Caesar has made its way into publications that will be regarded as laying down the historical record.
Not everyone is convinced, however. Even the initial reception was cautious in some quarters. One reason was the revelation that Operation Caesar had been initiated by Qatar, a country that had been providing funds – now known to be in the billions of dollars – to opposition fighters aiming to bring down the government of Bashar al-Assad.
There were also the questions, flagged at the start of this article, that are simply begged by appeals – of Rapp and others – to the confirmation by the FBI that the photos showed real dead people. [29] Other serious concerns have been set out in detail by Rick Sterling [30] and Adam Larson [31] , but an elementary and conspicuous one is the unconvincing justification for Caesar’s anonymity, which serves to prevent any rigorous independent questioning of his story.
The rationale given for secrecy appears to depend on the implausible proposition that a photographer in the state’s employ could go missing and yet not be missed. A result of the anonymity is that the public ultimately has to place a lot of trust in the competence, integrity and good faith of the people translating and relaying the story. Given that these are people pressing a case for the prosecution, it would be only proper to allow a full examination of the methods they have deployed in presenting their case.
From a defence perspective, it would be hard to ignore facts like prime mover Rapp and the fixer and translator Moustafa having been among the most persistent lobbyists on Capitol Hill for regime change – previously in Libya and then in Syria. Rapp, furthermore, has been campaigning for changes in international criminal law that would lower the barriers to prosecution for atrocity crimes. Even their allies in the quest to prosecute Assad have expressed reservations.
Notably, the directors of the organisations gathering the documentary evidence that Rapp finds the necessary complement of Caesar’s evidence have been quite clear on the point. Thus Bill Wiley, director of the Europe-based Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA) has said ‘would it make a case against Assad? No, not at all, not at all.’ [32] Wiley’s counterpart in America, Mohammad al-Abdallah – director of the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre – is also deeply sceptical of the photos’ evidentiary value. [33]
Who dares to cite Caesar?
The central concern of this study can now be further delineated by reference to a group of social media commentators who, to my initial surprise, have appeared to accept that point. This is a group of people who are generally vocal in matters relating to the war in Syria and would not typically pass up an opportunity to highlight crimes alleged of the Syrian president and government.
This group would include Idrees Ahmad, Eliot Higgins, Oz Katerji, Scott Lucas, George Monbiot,[34] Thomas Pierret and Robin Yassin-Kassab. None of them – as far as I can discern – has ever referred to Caesar.[35] The most natural explanation would be that each has individually examined the Caesar Report and decided it did indeed give rise to the critical concerns that sceptics have identified.
However, the same people have been prepared to refer to the HRW report that validates the Caesar evidence, even though it does not address the critical questions. It is as if they are aware that particulars of the Caesar story may be vulnerable to being discredited but they are satisfied that the reputation of the NGO makes it safe to cite as an authority.
What makes this anomalous is that similar caution does not come into play for members of the group with regard to other operations that are no less controversial. A notable example would be the White Helmets. The idea that the White Helmets organisation consists of unarmed humanitarian volunteers devoted to altruistic and impartial service of their home communities is demonstrably misleading in that the funding, coordination and training comes from abroad, its recruits are paid, and they do not represent or serve all sections of Syrian society.
If some of the men may simply be carrying out the tasks they are ostensibly paid to, others have appeared to bear arms and to collaborate with militant extremists. Some have been accused of crimes, including serious ones, and there are even questions about whether some may have been involved in committing atrocities. In short, if one sees reason to be cautious about the credibility of Caesar it would be consistent and reasonable to be cautious about the White Helmets too.
In order to try and resolve the anomaly, it is worth considering another feature of the White Helmets operation that invites comparison with the Caesar narrative:
‘Like Caesar, the White Helmets—also known as the Syrian Civil Defense forces—have become inadvertent documentarians. … White Helmet volunteers have testified before the Security Council, in capitals, and elsewhere and provided photographs and videos of the aftermath of attacks that have helped to shed light on chemical weapon use.’ [36]
This documentary role –‘inadvertent’ or otherwise – has not been lost on promoters of the two operations. Of the Caesar exhibition, Van Schaack observes ‘Such displays respond to the behavioral psychology research on the “picture superiority effect,” which teaches that humans respond to photos more viscerally than to text.’
Of the White Helmets, James Le Mesurier has explained how, in 2012, the security firm he then co-directed, ARK FZC, consulted global market research showing that military and security actors were least likely to win public trust whereas first responders are the most trusted. [37] Thereupon ARK created the White Helmets, and Le Mesurier subsequently formed the Netherlands-registered non-profit Mayday Rescue to manage them (although he was funded from sources like the UK FCO through his company Mayday Rescue FZ-LLC based in a UAE tax haven). As documentarians, the White Helmets have had a much more widespread and sustained impact than Operation Caesar.
So there are some differences worth reflecting on. First, the publicity value of the Caesar images needs no narrative or naming, no due process or due diligence to underwrite, since it is immediate and visceral.
The name that needs to be tagged to those images, moreover, is not Caesar but Assad. [38] People don’t need to be kept in mind of the codename for an operation but they do need to have in mind a constant association of those terrible images with the name of Assad. Seen in this light, therefore, silence about Caesar is an entirely consistent element of an anti-Assadist strategy to influence public opinion.
By contrast, although the White Helmets also make considerable use of imagery, [39] their narrative and their projected identity are necessary for situating and making sense of the images. Moreover, they are protagonists of their own narrative and have remained in situ to cover continuing developments on the ground (even if they have had to move towns as battle lines have shifted).
Their trustworthiness being necessary for the effect of their message, it has been vigorously defended even in the face of serious criticisms. So it is not so surprising, after all, that activists and publicists who have avoided getting drawn into discussion of the Caesar narrative stand firm in defence of the White Helmets narrative.
But if the preference for the White Helmets over Caesar is explicable in those terms, what then needs to be understood is why some other people have nevertheless so actively promoted the Caesar narrative. If the initial purpose of promoting it was to press President Obama’s administration to take a more active interventionist approach to Syria, then it had already failed, and Caesar was not in a position to produce any new evidence. In seeking an explanation it is worth reflecting on who has been most active and consistent in promoting Operation Caesar – from its inception to this day.
The Caesar promoters
The lead author of the Qatari-commissioned Caesar report is David Crane, and he also leads the Syrian Accountability Project (SAP), which he founded some time prior to Caesar’s defection. [40] SAP is said to be student-run and its clients include the Syrian National Council and US State Department. [41] It also ‘works very closely with’ the Syria Justice and Accountability Centre, which in turn is a conduit of US funding to CIJA.
Incidentally, Rapp, Crane, and fellow Caesar Report author Desmond De Silva, were all previously successive holders of the same job, namely, chief prosecutor at the Special Court for Sierra Leone. [42] The man who brought Caesar from his Qatari handlers to the West, and accompanied him on tour, even providing his voice, is Mouaz Moustafa.
Moustafa’s constant companion on the tour – which has included visits to the UK Foreign Office – is Rapp. Rapp was also involved in founding the organisation supplying the documentary evidence that is a sine qua non for the legal effect of Caesar materials. Now known as CIJA, that organisation grew out of Wiley’s collaboration at ARK FZC with the UK FCO’s go-to contractor, the former diplomat Alistair Harris, who through his ARK business also founded the White Helmets and other Syria security and ‘stabilisation’ projects.
Harris, a man of ideas and advocacy as well as action, was co-author with Cadman and Moustafa of a 2013 paper for RUSI urging that it was not too soon to start implementing transitional justice in Syria; and Harris’s ARK has been a conduit of funding – received from US as well as UK – for Moustafa’s organization SETF. As for the European prosecutions, and related initiatives pressing for ‘universal jurisdiction,’ Rapp is there too a constant and inspirational presence.

Rapp’s core ambition is not focused exclusively on President Assad. He advocates in more general terms a principle of ‘no peace without justice’, which he interprets as implying a ‘responsibility to prosecute’ whose ultimate implications would be to enhance the legitimacy of externally imposed regime change operations on any nation – not just Syria – whose leadership is deemed to be oppressing its people and standing in the way of democracy and freedom.
It may be noted that Rapp has been part of on-going high level US deliberations about how to finesse that nation’s awkward situation of wanting to see other countries’ leaders prosecuted while not itself even signing up to the existing procedures that are provided by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
This conundrum has exercised the American elite for some years, and Rapp appears committed to a solution that lies in promoting innovative jurisprudence and hybrid courts. It would be facilitated by the emergence of a principle of ‘universal jurisdiction’, a principle that has gained particular traction in Germany, and some in other European countries too, like Spain, France and Sweden, [43] where the Caesar materials have apparently been deployed in courts.
In short, there is a discernible aim here of redefining the rules of the ‘rules-based international order’, with particular relevance to who shall be permitted to govern a country. [44] This is to press for global rules that override the powers of nation-states – a development whose effects are akin to what is already being accomplished through trade and investment agreements like TTP and TTIP by imposing rules of corporate globalism on nations with compliant governments.
Thus, from the standpoint of concern to serve US-based corporate interests, there is more at stake than the matter of who should be president of Syria.
The purpose of Caesar
Viewed from that perspective, Operation Caesar appears as a particular expedient in relation to a particular recalcitrant nation-state. The Caesar materials are likely to have little or no direct legal effect to that end, however, according to Wiley, and will not make a case against Assad in courts.
What the images do is harness powerful human emotion to the case. And it is entirely fitting that great human emotion should be stirred by images of human atrocities, as it may also be fitting that justice and accountability should be sought. If war crimes are committed, justice arguably requires accountability for them, [45] and so the value of evidence has to be assessed on its merits, and that means creating opportunities for such an assessment – even, conceivably, by deploying innovative judicial means.
I would just add that there are also other important considerations to keep in mind.
First, justice has to be assiduously sought by means that are rigorously directed to the pursuit of truth. This would be a sine qua non for just retribution. The pursuit of justice requires great scrupulousness of method and honesty of intent; it entails respecting the presumption of innocence, ensuring procedures are impartial and consistent, with due transparency and openness. These are qualities that need ensuring and cannot be assumed to follow from initiatives of ‘innovation’ that are pursued by special interest groups as is a concern about Operation Caesar.
Second is the need in due process to reserve judgement as to the honesty and intentions of witnesses to any alleged crime, pending their evidence being put to the test in a properly constituted hearing.
For the purposes of justice it is never to be assumed that all people at all times act honestly and in good faith, for it is precisely because they do not that institutions of justice are required to provide a remedy.
Thus a requisite degree of realism in retributive justice has always to attend to motivations, including thoughts about deterrents and incentives. As well as this general concern there is in the present context also a more specific kind of concern. It is a fact that deceptive events are sometimes staged, including by way of what are referred to as false flag operations.
Regarding many of the various accusations of atrocity crimes levelled against the Syrian government there are reasonable grounds for doubt , and justice certainly requires that no blanket presumption be made about the dependability of testimony from witnesses like the White Helmets or Caesar.
Third, although the Caesar evidence, like that of the White Helmets, has never been tested in a properly constituted court of law, it has sounded very loudly in the media and has thus exercised a determinate influence on the ‘court of public opinion’.
The media reports that shape public opinion, however, often appear to have scant regard for truth or accuracy, let alone justice. Insofar as promoters of prosecutions against state leaders are also seeking to use ‘innovative’ forms of justice effectively to lower the barrier to effective prosecutions, it could be perceived as extremely prejudicial that they are able to make their case so unrestrainedly to the wider public ahead of any properly constituted hearing.
Fourth, there is the distinct possibility that under circumstances where not only is public opinion manipulated but also political agendas are promoted, the communications can even provide incentives to stage harmful acts as false flag operations.
Specifically, the pronouncement of red lines can favour this effect. There are strong grounds for suspicion that in practice this effect has operated from time to time in Syria, as elsewhere, and a simple logic of incentives does nothing to assuage such suspicions.
It is therefore a matter of serious concern that the informal penumbra of ‘justice and accountability’ talk that goes to support the imposition of ‘red lines’ could be not only prejudicial to the trying of crimes that have occurred but potentially be used to support incentives for crimes to be committed.
The fifth point is the most important of all. Concerns about justice and accountability for war crimes are ultimately about acting on behalf of the moral conscience of humanity.
If any given war crime shocks the human conscience, then so much more ought the very occurrence of war itself do so, especially when it is not clearly just or necessary.
If war crimes have been committed in Syria it is because there has been a war in Syria – a war that need never have been but for the provocations and facilitations of external actors.
If we truly want to hold people responsible for war crimes, then should we not attribute great responsibility to those whose actions are among the root causes of them?
Let us bear in mind, for instance, that Qatar was the biggest supplier of funds and arms to the enemies of Syria’s government, and that the United States has been a major orchestrator of international collaboration to delegitimise that government. With such facts in mind, it can be argued that for agents of those states to be producing evidence to accuse Syria of war crimes is to add moral insult to injury.
Had these states not promoted an armed insurgency in the first place, there would have been no war and thus no war crimes in Syria. They certainly have earned no benefit of the doubt regarding the anonymous, secretive and unverifiable testimony their agents jointly presented in Operation Caesar.
On this last point, it is further interesting to note that we in the West do not receive much unfiltered communication from the side of the defence to these attempted prosecutions. We hear that Syria, Russia, China and various non-aligned countries have forceful reservations but this is always attributed to pure political calculation on their part. ‘They’, it seems, are always subject to conflicts of interest whereas ‘we’, in the West, are concerned only with the pure pursuit of humanitarian justice .
Just how far this might be from the truth is glimpsed in the reflections of former international criminal defence lawyer Christopher Black. His considerations of the modus operandi of prominent prosecutors like those pressing the ‘responsibility to prosecute’ as part of an ‘innovative justice’ agenda are sobering, to put it mildly. [46] For present purposes, however, it suffices to have indicated the much bigger game that the Caesar testimony has played a small part in. [47]
In conclusion, I would emphasise that it behoves us to try and be clear about the effects of Operation Caesar and learn lessons from the study of it. Having noted that even vocal critics of Assad and his government avoid appeals to Caesar, and given the serious criticisms made by others, we have good reason to reserve judgement as to its credibility.
This means that those who have committed to accrediting it as wholly true have quite possibly disseminated a falsehood. With NGOs, journalists and even academics embedding in it lessons of that possible falsehood, the historical record may already have been distorted in ways that may not be undone. But a still greater concern is that further harms may be generated in the future not only as a result of misinformation but also as a result specifically of what the West’s legal innovators are seeking, which is nothing less than a change in the rules of the ‘rules-based international order’.
We already find some scholars of international law viewing such changes as positive steps towards ‘global justice’. This is a matter about which more critical concern should be in evidence than has been to date.
To put bluntly this contextualised concern about Operation Caesar: not only may it already have altered the historical record, and not only may its effects have served to alter somewhat the course of history to date, but in serving to influence decision makers, it may contribute more indelibly to shifting the baseline of normative consensus in a direction favourable to ousting non-compliant leaders of sovereign states.
That is effectively to bestow legitimacy on imperialist regime change projects.
What justice meanwhile requires with regard to the ‘Caesar’ evidence is genuine and impartial investigation into the truth about who died and at whose hands. The instrumentalisation of those terrible deaths for the purposes of further destabilizing a country ripped apart by violent forces that are aided and abetted by foreign states – including so-called liberal democracies – is itself an affront to the conscience of humankind.

For a more detailed and critical study of the evidence see the website of Adam Larson: http://libyancivilwar.blogspot.com/search?q=caesar .
Drawing on Larson’s study, Paul McKeigue has summarised what is not in dispute and what other factors should be borne in mind (personal communication) and I follow his advice in the summary that follows.
Not disputed:- The photos show the bodies of at least 5000 adult men at the Damascus military hospital, many of whom have been starved, over a period of about 8 months up to August 2013. Their identities are unknown, and the bodies have been labelled with numbers.
Other factors:- Some of them may be battlefield casualties, although most have no obvious external injuries. Some of them appear to have been gassed while hung upside down. From this, and the signs of prolonged starvation it is clear that most of them were captives. What is not known for certain regarding most of them is whether they were captured and/or killed by the government or by rebel forces (since the fact of being gathered for delivery to the mortuary could apply in either event. Some victims have tattoos indicating they are Christian, Shia or Assad supporters. The picture is further complicated by the fact that there were prisoner swaps between the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) and JAI in 2013.
Adam Larson (personal communication) adds that there is no semblance of a prison uniform evident in the photos, the men being mainly naked or in underwear, in street clothes or, in a few cases, still in their camouflage military uniforms.
For my part, I do not have the knowledge or expertise to offer an opinion as to the relative likelihoods of the two hypotheses. Nor does my argument depend on the likelihood of the JAI hypothesis being much greater than the official Western hypothesis, as Larson and McKeigue suggest it is. (Nor can some combination of those or other possibilities be definitively ruled out.) My argument relies only on the consideration that a self-consistent and materially possible explanation has not been ruled out while the accepted Western narrative has not been sufficiently established.

The pointless referendum that led to a pointed betrayal of Brexit has been, for most voters, a painful exercise in anger and tedium. But the learning experience mustn’t be wasted. In particular, it’s time to start seeing it as nothing more than one symptom along one dimension of a massive global trend: the multivariate attempts of positively anti-State groups to evade the attentions of (and build alternatives to) increasingly remote institutions and services that have been bought by the 3%. In this essay, The Slog examines the prospects for genuine Citizen Power.
In the swirling and incessantly noisy maelstrom of what one might call 21st century ‘News peak’ (join the words up and you get the Orwellian term for spin, Newspeak) quality in terms of accuracy and astute analysis has been abandoned in favour of 24/7 quantity. Never in the long history of the United Kingdom has this been more evident than during the Brexit saga that began after the Referendum of June 2016.
One of my favourite Buddhist truisms is “Good will eventually come from Bad”. Eric Idle parodied this in his Monty Python anthem ‘Always look on the bright side of life’, and it does often feel as if the eternal British optimism is ill-considered. But in truth, the “we’ll muddle through” belief is really smug over-confidence, not optimism: it is a myopic belief that, quite obviously, should’ve gone to Specsavers.
Nevertheless, Good has already come from the political irresponsibility, calumny and arrogance that have typified The Brexit Years: if nothing else, millions of ordinary Britons have woken up to the fact that they no longer live in a free-speech democracy….and that reality has also infected thinkers in other EU member States, who have finally had confirmed what they had long suspected: while the European Union was an excellent economic solution to regional wars as an idea, as a wannabe federal superstate in practice it has become yet another facet of human existence annexed by a ruthless and unaccountable corporacratic élite.
The EU is no longer a force for good. It is merely a club driven by the belief in force.
-
I want to move beyond the parochial issue of Brexit in this piece. Instead, I propose here to try and set it in the context of what I’m calling the Personal Destiny Control (PDC) movement. But before we leave the British fiasco, let me share with you Brendan O’Neill’s latest email OpEd pointing out the very clear need for PDC on every practical level:
The need for PDC media
Mr O’Neill is the founder and editor of Spiked – an online but unaligned news analysis site which is itself an attempt at PDC, in that it offers a genuine alternative to the MSM agendas by putting forward evidence, wide-ranging views and consequence scenarios to warn people about the dangers of ideological Groupthink. Off-Guardian is another one, formed by emigrés from a Guardian newspaper which, under the tutelage of Alan Rusbridger, lost not just its way in terms of real liberalism, but also its mind and then any semblance of tolerance.
There are thousands of online news organisation alternatives, but very few with a one-word agenda called balance. As the age of influential one-man-band blogging draws slowly to a close, we need such New Media in a sense that goes way beyond New in terms of digital: rather, thoughtful humans need to gather together in such places, and at best destroy the censorious narratives of the old MSM organs and social media sites…or at the very least create viable, business-model solid acces to truth rather than Pravda.
The need for a PDC internet option
‘Media’ in the round is a crucially important form of PDC, but both within and without that definition is the varietally threatened Internet, already controlled by ISPs working hand in hand with the data gatherers of Mammon and the pernicious voyeurism of the Surveillance State.
Use the term ‘Web3’ to most people today and they will look blank. Until three months ago, so did I. But it is in fact a largely undiscovered PDC alternative to everything from Facebook and Instagram to Google, Microsoft and yes, even the CIA.
You see, not only can these monsters not control Web3, they can’t get into it at all without being detected and neutralised. Web3 is a giant blockchain in which the risk of spin and manipulation by the various malign Establishments and élites has been reduced as near as is humanly possible to zero.
The sluggish growth in awareness of Web3 hasn’t been helped by first of all, a descriptor that suggests nothing, and secondly, the tendency of the pointyhead community to write descriptions that mean even less.
This is the current geek-speak definition of Web3 that exists on most search engines – the js suffix stands for Java Script:
‘web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node, using an HTTP, WebSocket or IPC connection’
Yes, you know what it is – but you’re none the wiser, in that you don’t know what an ethereum node is, you can’t see why this is anything different to the main internet, you never knew what Web2 was anyway….and above all, there is not the scintilla of a glimmer as to what the point of it is for PDC.
Get down to the ‘plain English’ search results, and you meet a guy called Gregory from Dapp University (where?) who promises he’ll ‘show you what Web3 .js is, and how to use it to talk to the Ethereum that gets deployed to the blockchain with the Solidity programming language’. As good as his word, Gregory spills the beans: ‘Web3.js talks to The Ethereum Blockchain with JSON RPC, which stands for “Remote Procedure Call” protocol. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer network of nodes that stores a copy of all the data and code on the blockchain.’
No shit?
Many of you, I imagine, won’t know what a blockchain is, or even why it exists. Last September I made reference to it as ‘a digital ledger in which reality can be recorded chronologically and publicly without perversion or manipulation of the original data’.
That’s still how I see it: a chain of empirical and transparent information with which no ideologue, sleazy finance minister or bent statistical office can tamper for financial, political or other equally nefarious ends. Part of what Web3 is consists of universal application of the blockchain principle.
But it is far more than this. Our gregarious friend Gregory has at least salted the gobbledygeek with one nugget which is central to the real significance of Web3: Peer to Peer (P2P). A posh term for me, you, us – The People – informing each other without any involvement from the likes of Andrew ‘I made it all up’ Campbell.
In my humble conclusion, Web 3 is The People’s Internet. Designed for mutualist communitarian knowledge-sharing like a sort of big intranet, it has the potential to evict spies from Washington, Moscow, London or Berlin or wherever.
Imagine a Web with no corporates, no fronts for propaganda, no top-down ISP drivel, no unaccountable censors, real Net Neutrality (ie, equality) and the search for learning and facts as its focus, rather than selling. Imagine a giant level playing field for The People where all the referees are incorruptible.
That’s what Web3 is designed to be. Unwittingly perhaps, it is the biggest PDC development on the Planet, and the biggest threat to the multivariate élites that make up the 3%.
But boy, does it need a new name. Boy, does it need some Real spiel interpreters. And boy oh boy does it need to stop describing and start demonstrating: not just what it can do for non-techies, but how and why it really can stop infiltration. Because for me thus far, these are where the doubts lie.
The need for PDC tactical voting
One specific thing software (especially via the ground level sharing element on Web3) can do, however, is focus on the development of another area badly in need of PDC reform: elective democracy generally, and tactical voting in particular.
The development of software capable of defining the “best” tactical use of a vote at local level (and making that information easy to share) – a process often referred to as Ground Gaming – feels to me like an excellent way to break political Establishments legally and peacefully. Already credited with having helped elect Trump (and reduce the DNC attempt at backlash via Congressional election) the need for it was amply demonstrated by the result of the UK’s Newport West by-election last Thursday.
All four candidates with crosses there were pro-Brexit. The light blue circle shows the winner Ruth Jones’s majority, the red circle what percentage eligible to vote turned up, and thus how many votes (black circle) were at stake.
This would be my summary: Huge numbers of Labour and Tory voters abstained. Almost certainly, this was a Brexit protest, but the important observation is that had even half of them voted for UKIP along with those who voted for pro-Brexit minnows, the Kipper candidate would have won with a landslide 19,130 votes….and neither type of normally tribal duopoly voter would’ve let ‘the other lot’ in. Although still a poor turd, sorry, third, UKIP’s Neil Hamilton actually doubled the Kipper vote compared to 2017. Given his awful reputation, this shows what potential there was for a Brexiteer (aka “PDC”) candidate to take the seat. The three other pro-Brexit candidates’ votes were wasted. They didn’t amount to much – 546 – but put behind one potential winning candidate, even these would have reduced Jones’s majority by 30%.
Put another way, easily accessible and viral awareness of where to cast the PDC vote most effectively would’ve sent a People’s candidate back to Westminster. Of course, no software program or Web3 intranet can legislate for Parties selecting appalling candidates, or the egos of their leaders in rebuffing electoral pacts. But what it most certainly can do is point out that, in the Brexit anger context for example, abstaining ain’t enough: rather than waste your vote, you can use it in concert with others to rattle the élite’s cage.
PDC in the financial system
Various PDC concepts are already in play in the fight by real people to wrest control from the banker cartels.
Bitcoin is a means of doing P2P business that cuts out the bank, and could in time render underhand central banks’ manipulation of their currencies ineffective.
‘No Borders’ Plastic cards being developed by electronic money transfer companies like Transferwise not only save small fortunes in bank charges, they also enable consumers to eject retail banks from their lives– given that such banks offer almost zero customer benefit for the privilege of holding and then misusing our money.
Celebrated radical US financial campaigner Ellen Brown recently related how such banks not only offer us a risible 0.1% interest, but can themselves park their money at the US Fed and earn 2.4% clear on it by performing no useful lending purpose to society whatsoever. Her observation – that there is a role for US post offices to take up the slack – is a real rather than digital world example of how traditional People’s Retailers like POs and mutuals could take business away from the leeches and give it to those serving the 97% rather then the 3%.
Crowd-funding in its various guises has been used very effectively as a weapon by social protest groups like Waspi and 2020Comms to raise cash needed to fight the fiscal embezzlement practised by various UK governments after 1995 in relation to non-payment of female State Pensions. Used more broadly and formally, it could in turn produce a new P2P mutual loans sector to replace the old Building Societies destroyed by the demutualisation robberies of the 1980s and 1990s.

During the 1945 General Election, the father of the British National Health Service Aneurin Bevan was being heckled by a Conservative activist.
“What exactly do you see as the purpose of all this power youre going to amass for yourself?” the heckler asked. Bevan replied:
“The purpose of power sonny is to give it back to the People”.
I have never been a Socialist, but Nye Bevan has always been a hero for me because he thought not just about the causes and treatment of social deprivation, but also about the consequences of State Power. Towards the end of his life, Bevan regretted how Unions and bureaucrats had “turned the NHS into something of a monster”.
In the end, in fact, we British never got our power back. As a result, the development of ethics and personal responsibilities from the ground up first of all atrophied, and then died. Into the regrettable vacum thus created stepped Thatcher, the bankers, the security services, Whitehall, the media barons and then the internet’s insidious social media.
In the US, a grisly alliance of the military, texan oil, Wall Street, CIA and big business lobbyists also took away the average American’s independence. In Europe, the EU has done the same….following in the equally concrete footsteps of the Soviet Union.
My message today is much the same as the one I gave out a month ago: Brexit is dead, long live the Personal Destiny Control movement. I have a sense that, in the increasingly divided populaces of the US, the UK and the EU, citizen controlled and mandated coalitions dedicated to the greatest fulfilment of the greatest number are likely sooner or later to replace the top-down neo-fascist indirect democracies produced by Party, corporacratic, financial and geopolitical interests.
But we’re not talking spontaneous combustion here. Benign, visionary minorities below the 3% psycho tendency are already creating the conditions by which the power of PDC can be returned to us. The techies among them, however, need to extricate head from anus; while the silent majority they hope to help need to become more gobby, and get out more – take some exercise and so forth. Like a walk to the polling booth where, armed with data suggesting the best use of a positive anti-Establishment vote, they can cast the thing – rather than shouting at the telly.
Do not assume that our rulers will just sit there and let the PDC process happen. They have the armies, the cops, the water cannon, the surveillance capabilities and cashless card monitoring powers to make contrarian resistance potentially futile. History is changed by those who turn up. It is the responsibility of every adult in the West to do just that.
Thanks for persevering with this long read.

“Last week, President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, told senators that a gas tax hike was on the table when asked whether the White House would support such a move. And this week, Democrats are indicating that they too are ready to consider a tax increase — an effort that would fund publicly popular infrastructure improvements but has hit a hard wall of opposition for years from fiscal conservatives and advocates for low-income people alike. The last president to raise taxes on gas was Bill Clinton. He did so in 1993, just before the landslide election that created the modern Republican congressional majority. It’s difficult to express how stupid this gas tax would be, though Tucker Carlson tried in a notable segment on his prime time show. Carlson called the tax ‘so mindless and counterproductive there is literally no way you could get reelected after doing it’ in a riff that suggested Donald Trump was purposely sabotaging his reelection to escape from his imprisonment in the White House.”
In 2008, when gas prices were going through the roof, Republicans then in the minority in Congress dubbed increased fuel costs “the Pelosi Premium.” Why on earth would Trump want his fingers anywhere near raising gas prices on American drivers?

IN DEPTH: Poland’s Staged MiG Crashes – NATO Plan for Sales of Inferior U.S F-35,www.therussophile.org,Guest Author,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/in-depth-polands-staged-mig-crashes-nato-plan-for-sales-of-inferior-u-s-f-35.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
By Bill French – The F-35’s performance characteristics compare unfavorable to already deployed foreign 4th-generation fighters such as the Russian-designed MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker (also produced by China) in service with air forces around the world. These are the kinds of aircraft the F-35 would most likely face in air-to-air engagements against a high-end opponent. Compared to both the Su-27 and the MiG-29, the F-35 is grossly inferior in terms of wing loading (except for the F-35C), transonic acceleration, and thrust-to-weight. All F-35 variants also have significantly lower maximum speeds, Mach 1.6 for the F-35 compared to Mach 2.2 for the Su-27 and Mac 2.3 for the MiG-29.
Air-to-air simulations paint an even grimmer picture. In 2009, U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin analysts indicated that the F-35 could be expected to achieve only a 3-to-1 kill ratio against the decades-old MiG-29 and Su-27 despite its advantages in stealth and avionics. The results of other simulations have been far worse. In one simulation subcontracted by the RAND Corporation, the F-35 incurred a loss exchange ratio of 2.4-1 against Chinese Su-35s. That is, more than two F-35s were lost for each Su-35 shot down. While these simulations take into account a host of other factors and include assumptions about the context in which the engagements take place, they nevertheless underscore the need for skepticism regarding the F-35’s air-to-air capabilities.

MiG-29 airplanes, which are still in service with the Polish Air Force, have proven themselves brilliantly for decades. In addition to excellent combat performance, they also featured high reliability in operation: for almost 30 years of their service, not a single crash occurred. And suddenly the last months brought a whole series of tragedies: literally every six months, one MiG-29 was broken. What is the matter? What suddenly changed?
The first MiG-29 aircraft appeared in Poland in 1989 – at times quite unfavorable for the Soviet military, as, indeed, for every other technology originally from the USSR. When they arrived at the Mazovian Mazovian military airfield in Minsk (a city belonging to the Warsaw agglomeration, located 30 km east of the Polish capital), the era of the Polish People’s Republic ended in the country, the new authorities began a sharp turn to the West, towards “Western values” and to the western allies.
The NDP intended to buy more than a hundred of such MiGs, but the matter was limited to only twelve vehicles. In addition, the Warsaw Pact was dissolved in 1991, and then the Soviet Union collapsed. Polish pilots, who managed to fly on new MiGs, were fascinated by these machines. Behind the banal assertion that it was a world-class aircraft, concrete facts were hidden: excellent radar, combat missiles of considerable range, first-class navigation equipment, and excellent maneuverability.
Enthusiastic opinions about the aircraft by the Polish pilots led to a paradox: despite the fact that the “new” Poland was hard at work in NATO, in 1996 the authorities decided to expand the fleet of these machines, and by a very atypical method. With the Czech Republic, 11 new Sokol brand helicopters produced in Poland were exchanged for 10 MiGs that were in service with the Czech Air Force.
Before the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, Czechoslovakia managed to buy 20 such aircraft, and then after dividing the country, the Czech Republic and Slovakia divided them in half. The Czechs did not shout about the “Russian military threat” and never had militaristic inclinations, therefore they willingly got rid of their expensive and deadly toys.
Later, the Polish military aviation turned up even more profitable option to receive the next MiG-29. At the time of the unification of Germany in the GDR there were 24 cars of this type. They have become a valuable trophy for NATO, and with a very practical significance. The Germans sent these cars to all sorts of exercises, since every American, British or French ace wanted to test their strength in an air duel with the most formidable enemy that was then the MiG-29. And the Germans drove their cars almost to death. And then they decided to sell Poland at a symbolic price: 1 euro per plane (thus they avoided tax on the gift).
As a result, Poland received 22 such aircraft (out of 24 cars originally from the GDR, one crashed in Germany after unification, and one Germans left in their museum as a souvenir). From the received batch of aircraft, only 10 cars after serious repairs were able to put into service the Polish Air Force. The rest were used as a kind of spare parts stores during repairs, and two of them went to museums as exhibits. – Advertisement –
As a result of these exchange operations, the number of MiGs in the Polish military aviation increased significantly: up to 32 aircraft. Of these, it was possible to create two squadrons of 16 vehicles each: one with a location in the above-mentioned Minsk Mazovian, and the other in Malbork (in the north of the country, near Gdansk).
For many years, these planes flawlessly served in the Polish sky. However, their failure-free operation ended on December 18, 2017, when the first MiG-29 crashed while landing at the airfield in Minsk Mazowiecki, its pilot survived, although he did not manage to eject (the plane was from among those received directly from the USSR). On July 6 last year, another disaster occurred, this time with a deadly ending for the pilot: he managed to eject, but did not survive (the plane came to Poland from Germany). Finally, on March 4 of this year, the third accident took place: a few minutes after the start from the base in Minsk Mazowiecki, another MiG-29 crashed, the pilot managed to successfully eject (this time it was a car received from the Czech Republic).
The leadership of the Polish Ministry of National Defense as a whole reticently commented on the MiG catastrophes, noting that the outdated post-Soviet aircraft (MiG-29 and Su-22, which are in service with the Polish Air Force) are characterized by “little suitability in today’s battlefield.” In the political environment, comments were limited to condescending “no wonder: post-Soviet flying scrap metal is dangerous for flying.”
Undoubtedly, “Moscow’s hand” in these catastrophes would have been easily found by Anthony Macherevich , who headed the defense department from November 2015 to January 2018, and because of the pathological Russophobia many Poles called the “minister of war with Russia”.
He zealously sought “his own truth” about the Smolensk disaster on April 10, 2010, in which 96 people from the official delegation led by Polish President Lech Kaczynski died . And I found this “truth”, despite the absolutely unequivocal results of the investigations carried out by the Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) in Moscow and a special Polish commission.
The “Truth” found by Macherevich about the causes of the Smolensk disaster is as follows:
“The Russians, with the approval of the government of Prime Minister Tusk [the then Prime Minister of Poland, now the chairman of the European Council], created a pyramid of deception, deliberately destroyed and hid aircraft wreckage, forged“ black boxes ”, destroyed other evidence. How to call a situation when the entire elite is killed, when people are cut off their heads ?! This is a declaration of war by Russia, even if the next attack comes in a year, two, five years, you need to be aware that this is a declaration of war! ”
Meanwhile, the circumstances of at least one of the MiG catastrophes are very similar to the situation near Smolensk: difficult weather conditions, an inexperienced pilot and his bravado …
Official Warsaw used a series of MiG wrecks to justify another round of the arms race, in which Poland voluntarily participates in NATO. At the recent celebrations on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of Poland’s membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, representatives of the leadership announced their intention to increase military spending to 2.5% of GDP, although Poland is already in a small group of record holders among NATO member countries that are sent for military needs 2 % Of GDP.
With regard to the modernization of military aviation, it was announced the decision to purchase until 2026, 32 American fifth-generation combat aircraft F-35. Just a few days later, the appetite of the Polish leadership increased to 48 such aircraft – the same number of American F-16 aircraft are now in service with the Polish Air Force.
It is not a secret for anyone that such a deal will open up the possibility for multi-billion and long-term drainage of the Polish budget – not only the budget of the Ministry of Defense. Poland paid $ 3.5 billion for 48 F-16s in 2003, and Belgium recently ordered 34 F-35s for $ 4 billion.
Therefore, Polish President Andrzej Duda has already prudently come up with the idea of ​​financing this contract in the form of a nationwide program – a project that goes beyond the defense budget.

Guaidó Faces Likely Trial and Imprisonment in Aftermath of Losing Immunity,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/guaido-faces-likely-trial-and-imprisonment-in-aftermath-of-losing-immunity.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
CARACAS – The National Constituent Assembly, the legislative organ of Venezuela created by the supporters of the legitimate president Nicolás Maduro, approved the lifting of the parliamentary immunity of Juan Guaidó.
According to lawyer Enrique Tineo, this decision is not only legal, but also “the constitutional and necessary consequence of more than two months of harassment and flagrant crimes against the country.”
“As the National Assembly, which would be the entity in charge of approving the waiver of immunity, has been in disobedience since 2015,” he continues, “their actions have no legal effect. A preliminary merit judgment procedure established by the Constitution is being followed.”
Gross crimes are crimes that do not benefit from parliamentary immunity because they are crimes that are outside the civil service. Self-proclaimed president of a country in a public square is one of them.
According to media minister Jorge Rodríguez, he was part of a “terrorist” cell along with other names, such as Roberto Marreo [Chief of Staff of the self-proclaimed president] and Leonardo López, to carry out “acts of terrorism” as “selective killings” or “the taking of the Palace of Miraflores” [seat of the Presidency of Venezuela] are also part of the list.
“From the moment Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself president of Venezuela in a small square in the city of Caracas,” Tineo points out, he was already weaving the web of his personal and political tragedy.
“There was a lot of abuse of parliamentary immunity to justify a protection that should not exist for this type of crime,” jurist Olga Álvarez said. “Immunity is only to protect the public official and legislator, so that no one will bother him in the exercise of his duties by reckless denunciations,” he continues.
“Reports that are not based on any offense or act and that anyone could do only to disturb their activity,” explains the lawyer. – Advertisement –
The lawyer explains that in Chile, for example, MPs only enjoy immunity within Parliament, outside of it they are normal citizens. Expanding this protection to other activities of your life gives rise to impunity.
“Guaidó is nothing,” said Diosdado Cabello, president of the National Constituent Assembly, minutes before the verdict and unanimous vote against the opposition leader. He also asked for patience and said, “Let’s not despair. The law will come.”
According to Tineo, we are faced with what is known in the Criminal Code as a “non-justiciable political case”. It is the same if we say that “the authorities have to ponder before acting,” he says. Nevertheless, “there is a certainty that the individual is committing an offense because the performances and the discursive line of Mr. Juan Guaidó imply acts of preparation for a civil war. ”
The lawyer is convinced that [Guaidó] will end up in jail : “Your future is to be a sub judice subject to criminal prosecution, most likely deprived of liberty.”
However, both the lawyer and the expert Olga Álvarez consider that the arrest will not be immediate. “Judicial times and political times do not necessarily coincide,” said the lawyer. “In a situation of war you can not make hasty decisions, we have to do them in a timely manner.”
An opportune time could be Saturday, April 6. The opposition called new demonstrations, and on this occasion they have a special aspect. Guaidó wants another “D-Day”: a simulacrum of what has been termed “Operation Freedom” to increase pressure on the streets to take Miraflores Palace and expel Maduro.
The mock “Operation Freedom”, Alvarez said, “is characterized by violent and terrorist actions, but the government is giving time. The opposition has already burned many cartridges, the last one, the national electric blackout, if given the time they intended, would lead to a genocide with systematic deprivation of food and medicines. Genocide is a crime typified in the Rome Statute ,” he said.
On Guaidó, the lawyer thinks that he is a character “created in an analytical laboratory because it has no political trajectory. It was created for this purpose, but it is not in the memory, it is dissolving and now we have to demonstrate to the world that Venezuela is capable of doing justice.”

Pro-family Matteo Salvini may become Italy’s next Prime Minister [Video],www.therussophile.org,Seraphim Hanisch,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/pro-family-matteo-salvini-may-become-italys-next-prime-minister-video.html/,"Authored by Wayne Madsen via The Strategic Culture Foundation:
With more than a “wink and a nod” from their collegial “caudillo del Norte,” Donald Trump, seven right-wing South American leaders have launched the Forum for the Progress of South America (PROSUR), which aims to eradicate all vestiges of Venezuela’s late president, Hugo Chavez, and Brazil’s wrongfully-imprisoned past president, Inacio Lula da Silva. PROSUR seeks to replace the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which was created by Chavez and Lula in 208 to counteract traditional American hegemonism in Latin America enforced by the neo-colonial Organization of American States (OAS).
Leaders from seven right-wing South American governments – Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Guyana – recently gathered in Santiago, Chile, under the auspices of billionaire Chilean president Sebastian Pinera, to sign an accord creating PROSUR. One of the goals of the new bloc is to integrate the defense, security, and crime prevention infrastructures of the members. If that sounds like an embryonic recreation of the infamous Operation CONDOR of the 1960s and 70s, it very much has such potential. CONDOR was an alliance of the intelligence and security services of South American military dictatorships, nurtured by the CIA, that is believed to have been responsible for 60,000 murders, 30,000 “disappeared,” 400,000 wrongful imprisonments, and countless acts of torture.
Bolivia and Uruguay, members of UNASUR that support Chavez’s successor, Nicolas Maduro, against the Central Intelligence Agency-groomed and -installed presidential pretender, Juan Guaido, did not join PROSUR, and, instead, elected observer status in the group.
Pinera and Colombia’s right-wing and narco/paramilitary-backed president, Ivan Duque, were the architects behind PROSUR. Seeing a chance to bury the legacies of Chavez and Lula, the two presidents invited all but Maduro’s government to join the pact.
Ecuador, which joined PROSUR, served as the headquarters of UNASUR. In 2014, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa opened the $65 million headquarters in Quito. Today, with right-wing governments and, as with the cases of Brazil and Colombia, far-right wing governments, taking over most of South America, the UNASUR headquarters sits largely abandoned. Moreno ordered UNASUR to abandon the building and promised to turn it into a university. After UNASUR Secretary General Ernesto Samper left his post in 2017, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru suspended their membership in the bloc, dealing it a fatal blow.
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno quickly abandoned his commitment to the ideals of Correa, Lula, and Chavez and embraced the caudillo politics of the right-wing South America presidents. Moreno, whose first name is in honor of Vladimir Lenin, plunged a knife into UNASUR when he said it was the creation of “perverse politicking of the self-styled 21st-century socialists.” After Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru withdrew from UNASUR, with the obvious prodding of the Trump administration, the stage was set for creating a new right-wing and pro-US alliance of neo-fascists, grifters, and oligarchs.
Moreno, who served as Correa’s vice president, has abandoned the socialist policies of his predecessor. Moreno not only welcomed US Vice President Mike Pence to Ecuador with open arms but sought the re-opening of the former US intelligence airbase at Manta, which had been closed by Correa in 2009. Moreno’s defense minister announced that what would replace the Manta airbase would be a “Security Cooperation Office.” In 2018, Moreno withdrew Ecuador from one of Chavez’s most-prized creations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA).
Ironically, Moreno, who bears the first name of the founder of the world’s first Communist nation, reversed many of Correa’s policies aimed at reducing the influence of Ecuador’s oligarchs and banks. Correa, who now lives in exile in Belgium, faces imprisonment in Ecuador in a political jihad launched by Moreno that is not unlike that of the Brazilian right-wing that targeted Lula and his successor, Dilma Rousseff. Present at the inauguration of PROSUR in Santiago was Argentine president Mauricio Macri, the one-time business partner of Donald Trump, who has done everything possible to imprison his predecessor, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Now an Argentine senator, Kirchner and her husband, the late President Nestor Kirchner, were partners of Chavez, Lula, and Correa in creating UNASUR.
Uruguyan president Tabaré Vázquez, who sent an observer delegation to PROSUR’s inaugural summit in Chile without joining the group, criticized the new group at a United Nations conference in Buenos Aires. Vázquez said that South America already had regional organizations, including the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELADE), and the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). However, like Moreno of Ecuador, Vázquez criticized the creation of UNASUR, saying, it “had a certain political ideology.”
Presidents Mario Abdo Benitez of Paraguay Martin Vizcarra of Peru have also steered their countries firmly into the right-wing camp. Both presidents joined their colleagues in Santiago for the PROSUR summit.
One surprise leader who signed on to PROSUR in Santiago was David Granger, the president of Guyana. Granger, as a former Brigadier General in the Guyana Defense Force, likely felt at home with individuals like Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, a former Brazilian paratrooper whose spoken Brazilian Portuguese reflects that of an uncouth Army veteran combined with a street thug. Granger has made common cause with ExxonMobil to lay claim to oil reserves in Guyana’s Exclusive Economic Zone, which are also claimed by Venezuela. Granger has brandished his right-wing allegiances by ignoring Guyana’s Constitution and postponing a March 19, 2019 required election to 2020. It was the defection of Granger’s coalition government’s parliamentary backbencher, Charrandas Persaud, to the opposition in a no-confidence vote that originally triggered the election. Rather than comply with the Constitution, Granger’s government, accused Persaud of being a US citizen, not eligible to sit in parliament. Persaud also received death threats. Yet, according to the Western corporate media, Guyana is being threatened by an “undemocratic” Maduro government in Venezuela.
Just as PROSUR seeks to eliminate the vestiges of Chavez, Lula, Correa, and Kirchner in South America, there has been an attempt by Washington to also wipe out two other Chavez regional projects, ALBA and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Both organizations include Venezuela’s allies in the Caribbean region. Trump recently invited the leaders of five Caribbean nations – Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Saint Lucia – to his Mar-a-Lago billionaires’ club in Palm Beach to seek their commitment to isolate the Maduro government of Venezuela and support the Guaido puppet regime. In order to entice the leaders to sever all financial links with Venezuela, including their participation in the PetroCaribe program that provided them with subsidized Venezuelan gasoline and oil, Trump offered nebulous loan guarantees through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a Wall Street contrivance with major national debt pitfalls attached.
Trump has a major real estate project in the Dominican Republic. Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of Saint Lucia, is the incoming chairman of the Caribbean Community. He will be expected to wean away from Venezuela its last remaining allies in the organization.
Trump and his team of neocons, including national security adviser John Bolton and Venezuela regime change envoy Elliott Abrams, who was convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal and who benefited from a cover-up bolstered by Attorney General William Barr, will now concentrate their efforts on overthrowing Maduro and subjecting his last remaining allies, Mexico, Nicaragua, Cuba, Bolivia, Uruguay, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada to regime change operations.

Canonical Ukrainian Church issues an update on the crisis,www.therussophile.org,Seraphim Hanisch,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/canonical-ukrainian-church-issues-an-update-on-the-crisis.html/,"This post was originally published on this site More than five months after the decision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to grant legitimacy and then autocephaly to two schismatic groups in Ukraine, the situation is mostly unchanged. The new church structure, known now as the “Orthodox Church in / of Ukraine” is reportedly continuing its efforts to forcefully seize control of parish communities and churches all over Ukraine. Not one Local Orthodox Church has endorsed the creation of the “OCU”, so the upshot of the situation is that the supposedly independent Orthodox Church is in communion only with Constantinople. However even this may well be shaken if reported plans to concelebrate with Roman Catholics and Uniates goes forward. Already the group is reportedly serving funeral services for Roman Catholics , a move that is not sanctioned in the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church. Further, Ukraine’s beleaguered president, Petro Poroshenko, ordered the OCU to pray for his victory in the forthcoming April 21st runoff election against Volodomyr Zelensky. Mr. Poroshenko came in a distant second at 15.95% of the vote, with Mr. Zelensky coming away with 30.24% of the first round of voting. Since the OCU is largely his creation, they probably will do this. However the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church had its Holy Synod meeting on April 3rd, 2019, and released the following statement, which provides a pretty fair-minded and level evaluation of the experiences that the Orthodox Christian faithful are having to deal with in this country torn in pieces by Western (largely American) interference. We have already covered this matter extensively on The Duran, so we encourage any curious readers to search our archives for more information on that matter. Here, with minor emphases added, is presented the Holy Synod’s report, as reprinted from OrthoChristian.com: The following statement was released in English on the official website of the Synodal-Educational Department of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church : Photo: Pravlife.org The Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church at its April 3, 2019 session discussed the prevailing situation in Ukrainian Church life as well as in world Orthodoxy that has eventuated following the anti-canonical granting of the Tomos of Autocephaly for the newly-created “Orthodox Church of Ukraine” (“OCU”), and hereby declares the following: 1. We state that the idea of overcoming the church schism in Ukraine by the granting of a Tomos of autocephaly to the non-canonical church groups (“ UOC-KP ” and “ UAOC ”) has turned out to be a grave error. None of the Local Orthodox Churches has recognized this illegal act perpetrated by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and a large part of the Local Churches, notably, the: Antioch, Russian, Cypriot, Serbian, Polish, Albanian, and Orthodox Churches in the Czech lands and Slovakia, in various forms, have already expressed their disagreement with the decisions made by the Constantinople Patriarchate. Local Churches have also confirmed that they do not recognize the newly established “Orthodox Church of Ukraine” (“OCU”) and regard the clerical Cheirotonia [consecration.—OC] in this structure as illegitimate and prohibit its own clergy to have any prayerful contacts and liturgical concelebration with its representatives in any form whatsoever. Thus, there was no positive response nor indeed acceptance by world Orthodoxy of the actions perpetrated by the Patriarchate of Constantinople; which, in fact, has attempted to legalize the schism. Accordingly, the legalization of the schism—is not the way in which church unity can be achieved. We remind you that according to the historical-canonical tradition of the Church, autocephaly is provided only to a single Church within a certain state, and not to any part that has broken off from the Body of the Church. 2. It must be admitted that the historical and canonical arguments presented by the Patriarchate of Constantinople regarding its own right and the possibility of interfering in the affairs of other Local Churches is totally unfounded, artificial, false, and contrary to the Church’s canons. Accordingly, the Patriarchate of Constantinople does not have any right whatsoever to interfere in the church life of Ukraine. The actions and arguments of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, which illegally lifted the anathema from the chief culprit of the Ukrainian church schism, Philaret Denysenko and also recognized the hierarchy of the UAOC which does not have apostolic succession at all, testifies to the fact that the Phanar does not fully comprehend the true essence of what is happening in the Orthodox environment of Ukraine. In fact, Philaret Denysenko was not anathematized for seeking autocephaly, as stated by the Patriarchate of Constantinople, but for his immoral personal life, the unrepentant grave sin of creaitng a schism in the Church, the creation of a parallel schismatic hierarchy, and a quasi-church structure that, throughout its existence, has resisted and continues its struggle under another name against the canonical Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and even now threatens to destroy the unity between the Local Orthodox Churches. 3. It should be noted that the actions of the Patriarchate of Constantinople in Ukraine has caused great harm to Ukrainian Orthodoxy, and also became a threat to Pan-Orthodox unity. We believe that the Patriarchate of Constantinople and personally Patriarch Bartholomew must admit their mistake and start working on correcting it. A way of rectifying their mistake could be to rescind the granting of the Tomos, call for the schismatics to repent of their sin of schism and convene a Pan-Orthodox Assembly in order to facilitate a conciliar decision which may help resolve the Ukrainian ecclesiastical question. 4. [Ecclesiastical] reality in Ukraine illustrates that for Orthodox Christians, the Tomos did not bring with it any unity, peace or respite as was promised by the initiators of this idea from church and state circles a year ago. Instead, the fruits of the Tomos became violence , conflict, confrontation, tears and suffering for the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC). All these facts testify to the fact that the simple legalization of schism does not change the schismatics themselves who remain hostile and aggressive to the Church. Only repentance and true recognition of their mistakes by the schismatics to the Church and their return unto the bosom of the Church can bring true peace and unity in the church life of Ukraine. 5. Coercive force, discrimination and violation of the rights of the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church have already been noticed by international human rights organizations. In particular, this was reflected in the latest report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). These offenses, often supported by local authorities, compromise our country in the world. Violence, the forced seizure of our churches and other unlawful acts will not lead to church unity in Ukraine. This is a false path to take and one needs to have the courage to recognize this mistake. We respectfully request that representatives of the ruling authorities stop their artificial initiation of the change of jurisdiction of our parishes, since our clergy and parishioners do not have this internal desire. We believe that the campaign to discredit the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, the prohibition of the presence of the clergy of our Church in the army, attempts to forcibly change the name of our Church and other similar anti-church actions is a strategic mistake of the authorities in the field of internal politics and stability in our country. 6. Of particular concern is the fact of the criminal prosecution of the cleric, Archpriest Viktor Zemlyanoy, of the Rivne Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. For the first time in Ukraine’s independence, a priest who protects the rights of believers and freedom of religion is being unreasonably prosecuted and accused of incitement to religious hatred. 7. We ask the state authorities not to interfere in church affairs, and thereby not contribute to the incitement of religious hatred through their actions, and to also cancel the requirements of the Law of Ukraine No. 2673-VIII of 17.01.2019 on the compulsory renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as being unconstitutional and contrary to the norms of Ukrainian and international law and basic principles of human rights and freedoms. We also appeal to the government not to facilitate forcible seizures of our Church parishes by illegal re-registration. The Lord gives rulers power not for the creation of discord in society, but for the cultivation of peace, tranquility and harmony among all citizens of the country. 8. We appeal to the representatives of the newly formed structure—the “Orthodox Church of Ukraine” (“OCU”)—with a request to remember the words of Christ that love for our neighbor is the sign of a true Christian (see John 13:35). The more violence on your part towards our believers today, the more distant will be the prospect of restoring church unity in Ukraine. The fact that you seize our churches together with the involvement of political, state, and sometimes even paramilitary structures, expelling our church communities into the street, forcing them to pray in the open air or in non-adapted premises; we perceive with Christian patience. We are reviled, and yet we bless: we are persecuted, and suffer it. We are evil spoken of, and we pray (1 Cor. 4:12-13). In this patience we humbly pray and await the time when Christian love will overcome hatred, malice and hostility, and we will be able to meet you on the threshold of the Church and hug you as brothers and sisters who have returned home. 9. We express our gratitude to those Local Orthodox Churches, which have already supported the canonical ecclesiastical order and did not agree with the legalization of the schism. We also thank those priests and believers who lost their churches that were seized, and still retained their loyalty to the Church. We call upon the clergy and the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to help and support the priests and communities whose churches were forcibly seized, bearing in mind the words of St. Paul: Bear ye one another’s burden and so fulfill the Law of Christ (Gal. 6:2). 10. During these salvific days of holy Great Lent, where we have already passed the half way point to the Holy and Bright Feast of the Resurrection of Christ. We ask everyone to pray that the Lord preserve the unity of Holy Orthodoxy, strengthen us to remain steadfast for the Truth of God, and grant us peace, tranquility and mutual understanding in our Ukrainian state. May our Lord God bless us all!

THE SATURDAY ESSAY: why Personal Destiny Control (PDC) is now a global phenomenon from which liberty can benefit,www.therussophile.org,John Ward,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/the-saturday-essay-why-personal-destiny-control-pdc-is-now-a-global-phenomenon-from-which-liberty-can-benefit.html/,"This post was originally published on this site https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d008144fd500e9977860000b14f17760?s=96&d=&r=PG
The pointless referendum that led to a pointed betrayal of Brexit has been, for most voters, a painful exercise in anger and tedium. But the learning experience mustn’t be wasted. In particular, it’s time to start seeing it as nothing more than one symptom along one dimension of a massive global trend: the multivariate attempts of positively anti-State groups to evade the attentions of (and build alternatives to) increasingly remote institutions and services that have been bought by the 3%. In this essay, The Slog examines the prospects for genuine Citizen Power.
In the swirling and incessantly noisy maelstrom of what one might call 21st century ‘News peak’ (join the words up and you get the Orwellian term for spin, Newspeak) quality in terms of accuracy and astute analysis has been abandoned in favour of 24/7 quantity. Never in the long history of the United Kingdom has this been more evident than during the Brexit saga that began after the Referendum of June 2016.
One of my favourite Buddhist truisms is “Good will eventually come from Bad”. Eric Idle parodied this in his Monty Python anthem ‘Always look on the bright side of life’, and it does often feel as if the eternal British optimism is ill-considered. But in truth, the “we’ll muddle through” belief is really smug over-confidence, not optimism: it is a myopic belief that, quite obviously, should’ve gone to Specsavers.
Nevertheless, Good has already come from the political irresponsibility, calumny and arrogance that have typified The Brexit Years: if nothing else, millions of ordinary Britons have woken up to the fact that they no longer live in a free-speech democracy….and that reality has also infected thinkers in other EU member States, who have finally had confirmed what they had long suspected: while the European Union was an excellent economic solution to regional wars as an idea, as a wannabe federal superstate in practice it has become yet another facet of human existence annexed by a ruthless and unaccountable corporacratic élite.
The EU is no longer a force for good. It is merely a club driven by the belief in force.
-
I want to move beyond the parochial issue of Brexit in this piece. Instead, I propose here to try and set it in the context of what I’m calling the Personal Destiny Control (PDC) movement. But before we leave the British fiasco, let me share with you Brendan O’Neill’s latest email OpEd pointing out the very clear need for PDC on every practical level:
The need for PDC media
Mr O’Neill is the founder and editor of Spiked – an online but unaligned news analysis site which is itself an attempt at PDC, in that it offers a genuine alternative to the MSM agendas by putting forward evidence, wide-ranging views and consequence scenarios to warn people about the dangers of ideological Groupthink. Off-Guardian is another one, formed by emigrés from a Guardian newspaper which, under the tutelage of Alan Rusbridger, lost not just its way in terms of real liberalism, but also its mind and then any semblance of tolerance.
There are thousands of online news organisation alternatives, but very few with a one-word agenda called balance. As the age of influential one-man-band blogging draws slowly to a close, we need such New Media in a sense that goes way beyond New in terms of digital: rather, thoughtful humans need to gather together in such places, and at best destroy the censorious narratives of the old MSM organs and social media sites…or at the very least create viable, business-model solid acces to truth rather than Pravda.
The need for a PDC internet option
‘Media’ in the round is a crucially important form of PDC, but both within and without that definition is the varietally threatened Internet, already controlled by ISPs working hand in hand with the data gatherers of Mammon and the pernicious voyeurism of the Surveillance State.
Use the term ‘Web3’ to most people today and they will look blank. Until three months ago, so did I. But it is in fact a largely undiscovered PDC alternative to everything from Facebook and Instagram to Google, Microsoft and yes, even the CIA.
You see, not only can these monsters not control Web3, they can’t get into it at all without being detected and neutralised. Web3 is a giant blockchain in which the risk of spin and manipulation by the various malign Establishments and élites has been reduced as near as is humanly possible to zero.
The sluggish growth in awareness of Web3 hasn’t been helped by first of all, a descriptor that suggests nothing, and secondly, the tendency of the pointyhead community to write descriptions that mean even less.
This is the current geek-speak definition of Web3 that exists on most search engines – the js suffix stands for Java Script:
‘web3.js is a collection of libraries which allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node, using an HTTP, WebSocket or IPC connection’
Yes, you know what it is – but you’re none the wiser, in that you don’t know what an ethereum node is, you can’t see why this is anything different to the main internet, you never knew what Web2 was anyway….and above all, there is not the scintilla of a glimmer as to what the point of it is for PDC.
Get down to the ‘plain English’ search results, and you meet a guy called Gregory from Dapp University (where?) who promises he’ll ‘show you what Web3 .js is, and how to use it to talk to the Ethereum that gets deployed to the blockchain with the Solidity programming language’. As good as his word, Gregory spills the beans: ‘Web3.js talks to The Ethereum Blockchain with JSON RPC, which stands for “Remote Procedure Call” protocol. Ethereum is a peer-to-peer netwo rk of nodes that stores a copy of all the data and code on the blockchain.’
No shit?
Many of you, I imagine, won’t know what a blockchain is, or even why it exists. Last September I made reference to it as ‘a digital ledger in which reality can be recorded chronologically and publicly without perversion or manipulation of the original data’.
That’s still how I see it: a chain of empirical and transparent information with which no ideologue, sleazy finance minister or bent statistical office can tamper for financial, political or other equally nefarious ends. Part of what Web3 is consists of universal application of the blockchain principle.
But it is far more than this. Our gregarious friend Gregory has at least salted the gobbledygeek with one nugget which is central to the real significance of Web3: Peer to Peer (P2P). A posh term for me, you, us – The People – informing each other without any involvement from the likes of Andrew ‘I made it all up’ Campbell.
In my humble conclusion, Web 3 is The People’s Internet. Designed for mutualist communitarian knowledge-sharing like a sort of big intranet, it has the potential to evict spies from Washington, Moscow, London or Berlin or wherever.
Imagine a Web with no corporates, no fronts for propaganda, no top-down ISP drivel, no unaccountable censors, real Net Neutrality (ie, equality) and the search for learning and facts as its focus, rather than selling. Imagine a giant level playing field for The People where all the referees are incorruptible.
That’s what Web3 is designed to be. Unwittingly perhaps, it is the biggest PDC development on the Planet, and the biggest threat to the multivariate élites that make up the 3%.
But boy, does it need a new name. Boy, does it need some Real spiel interpreters. And boy oh boy does it need to stop describing and start demonstrating: not just what it can do for non-techies, but how and why it really can stop infiltration. Because for me thus far, these are where the doubts lie.
The need for PDC tactical voting
One specific thing software (especially via the ground level sharing element on Web3) can do, however, is focus on the development of another area badly in need of PDC reform: elective democracy generally, and tactical voting in particular.
The development of software capable of defining the “best” tactical use of a vote at local level (and making that information easy to share) – a process often referred to as Ground Gaming – feels to me like an excellent way to break political Establishments legally and peacefully. Already credited with having helped elect Trump (and reduce the DNC attempt at backlash via Congressional election) the need for it was amply demonstrated by the result of the UK’s Newport West by-election last Thursday.
All four candidates with crosses there were pro-Brexit. The light blue circle shows the winner Ruth Jones’s majority, the red circle what percentage eligible to vote turned up, and thus how many votes (black circle) were at stake.
This would be my summary: Huge numbers of Labour and Tory voters abstained. Almost certainly, this was a Brexit protest, but the important observation is that had even half of them voted for UKIP along with those who voted for pro-Brexit minnows, the Kipper candidate would have won with a landslide 19,130 votes….and neither type of normally tribal duopoly voter would’ve let ‘the other lot’ in. Although still a poor turd, sorry, third, UKIP’s Neil Hamilton actually doubled the Kipper vote compared to 2017. Given his awful reputation, this shows what potential there was for a Brexiteer (aka “PDC”) candidate to take the seat. The three other pro-Brexit candidates’ votes were wasted. They didn’t amount to much – 546 – but put behind one potential winning candidate, even these would have reduced Jones’s majority by 30%.
Put another way, easily accessible and viral awareness of where to cast the PDC vote most effectively would’ve sent a People’s candidate back to Westminster. Of course, no software program or Web3 intranet can legislate for Parties selecting appalling candidates, or the egos of their leaders in rebuffing electoral pacts. But what it most certainly can do is point out that, in the Brexit anger context for example, abstaining ain’t enough: rather than waste your vote, you can use it in concert with others to rattle the élite’s cage.
PDC in the financial system
Various PDC concepts are already in play in the fight by real people to wrest control from the banker cartels.
Bitcoin is a means of doing P2P business that cuts out the bank, and could in time render underhand central banks’ manipulation of their currencies ineffective.
‘No Borders’ Plastic cards being developed by electronic money transfer companies like Transferwise not only save small fortunes in bank charges, they also enable consumers to eject retail banks from their lives – given that such banks offer almost zero customer benefit for the privilege of holding and then misusing our money.
Celebrated radical US financial campaigner Ellen Brown recently related how such banks not only offer us a risible 0.1% interest, but can themselves park their money at the US Fed and earn 2.4% clear on it by performing no useful lending purpose to society whatsoever. Her observation – that there is a role for US post offices to take up the slack – is a real rather than digital world example of how traditional People’s Retailers like POs and mutuals could take business away from the leeches and give it to those serving the 97% rather then the 3%.
Crowd-funding in its various guises has been used very effectively as a weapon by social protest groups like Waspi and 2020Comms to raise cash needed to fight the fiscal embezzlement practised by various UK governments after 1995 in relation to non-payment of female State Pensions. Used more broadly and formally, it could in turn produce a new P2P mutual loans sector to replace the old Building Societies destroyed by the demutualisation robberies of the 1980s and 1990s.

During the 1945 General Election, the father of the British National Health Service Aneurin Bevan was being heckled by a Conservative activist.
“What exactly do you see as the purpose of all this power youre going to amass for yourself?” the heckler asked. Bevan replied:
“The purpose of power sonny is to give it back to the People”.
I have never been a Socialist, but Nye Bevan has always been a hero for me because he thought not just about the causes and treatment of social deprivation, but also about the consequences of State Power. Towards the end of his life, Bevan regretted how Unions and bureaucrats had “turned the NHS into something of a monster”.
In the end, in fact, we British never got our power back. As a result, the development of ethics and personal responsibilities from the ground up first of all atrophied, and then died. Into the regrettable vacum thus created stepped Thatcher, the bankers, the security services, Whitehall, the media barons and then the internet’s insidious social media.
In the US, a grisly alliance of the military, texan oil, Wall Street, CIA and big business lobbyists also took away the average American’s independence. In Europe, the EU has done the same….following in the equally concrete footsteps of the Soviet Union.
My message today is much the same as the one I gave out a month ago: Brexit is dead, long live the Personal Destiny Control movement. I have a sense that, in the increasingly divided populaces of the US, the UK and the EU, citizen controlled and mandated coalitions dedicated to the greatest fulfilment of the greatest number are likely sooner or later to replace the top-down neo-fascist indirect democracies produced by Party, corporacratic, financial and geopolitical interests.
But we’re not talking spontaneous combustion here. Benign, visionary minorities below the 3% psycho tendency are already creating the conditions by which the power of PDC can be returned to us. The techies among them, however, need to extricate head from anus; while the silent majority they hope to help need to become more gobby, and get out more – take some exercise and so forth. Like a walk to the polling booth where, armed with data suggesting the best use of a positive anti-Establishment vote, they can cast the thing – rather than shouting at the telly.
Do not assume that our rulers will just sit there and let the PDC process happen. They have the armies, the cops, the water cannon, the surveillance capabilities and cashless card monitoring powers to make contrarian resistance potentially futile. History is changed by those who turn up. It is the responsibility of every adult in the West to do just that.

Italian businessman who was kidnapped in Syria for three years has been freed,www.therussophile.org,Murasel-En,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/italian-businessman-who-was-kidnapped-in-syria-for-three-years-has-been-freed.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Italian businessman Sergio Zanotti who was held hostage in Syria for three years has been freed and is expected back home soon, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Friday.
“At the end of complex, delicate operations of information, investigation and diplomacy that took place simultaneously, we succeeded today in obtaining the release of Sergio Zanotti, kidnapped in Syria in April 2016,” Conte said in a statement.
“Our compatriot’s general condition appears to be good and he will return to Italy, to Rome, in a few hours,” the Italian premier added.
Italian media say Zanotti, 57, is a businessman who disappeared after leaving for Turkey, and that his ex-wife had received several messages in which he pleaded for help, or was threatened with execution.
In August 2018, Italian media also raised the case of another Italian hostage from the same region of Brescia, Alessandro Sandrini, 33, who disappeared in October 2016 after going on holiday in Turkey while he was on partial unemployment.
Sandrini’s mother disregarded foreign ministry advice to remain silent about her son’s disappearance after several brief phone calls with him and the reception of at least one video in which he appears kneeling, in an orange jumpsuit and threatened by armed men.

MAJOR: Duterte threatens China with WAR,www.therussophile.org,Paul Antonopoulos,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/major-duterte-threatens-china-with-war.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
MANILA, Philippines – Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has warned Beijing to retreat from a disputed island in the South China Sea, warning of possible military action if China “touched” it.
Duterte, aiming to attract trade and investment from the Asian superpower, retained his first criticism of Beijing’s expansive demands at sea – a sensitive spot for the region as trillions of dollars of goods pass through local waters.
But as the Philippine military warned this week that hundreds of Chinese coastguard and fishing vessels “invaded” the island of Pag-asa, also known as Thitu in Manila, the Philippine president spoke on Thursday.
“I will not ask or beg, but I’m just saying leave Pag-asa because I have soldiers there,” Duterte said in a speech. “If you touch her, that’s another story. Then I’ll tell my soldiers to prepare for suicide missions.”
Duterte has repeatedly said that the war with China would be futile and that the Philippines would lose and suffer much in the process.
His words came after his Foreign Office issued a statement calling the Chinese ships’ presence an “illegal” violation of Philippine sovereignty. – Advertisement –
China, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam claimed several islands and reefs, as well as sea water courses with oil reserves rich in deep water.
In a major victory for Manila, an international maritime court ruled early in the presidency of Duterte in 2016 that China’s claims to the area have no legal basis.
China’s “militarization” of the South China Sea prompted the US to discuss the possibility of relocating US forces and opening bases in the region, US Fleet Commander Admiral Philip Davidson said back in February.
He noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not fulfill a 2015 promise not to militarize the South China Sea, taken during a White House ceremony with former US President Barack Obama.
Since then, Beijing has installed anti-gravity cruise missiles, ground-to-air missiles and electronic chokes on a series of islands, some artificially created, in the South China Sea, Davidson said.
The US often sends warships through this sea route, sometimes together with allied nations, something that Washington calls “freedom of navigation” exercises.

NEW YORK – The UN Security Council has called on the parties to the conflict in Libya to halt military activities in the context of a further escalation of tension in the African country.
“The members of the Security Council expressed deep concern at the military activity in Tripoli which risks Libyan stability and prospects for the UN mediation and the comprehensive political solution to the crisis. They called on LNA forces to halt all military movements. They also called on all forces to de-escalate and halt military activity. There can be no military solution to the conflict,” Heusgen read out the statement on the results of the UNSC consultations on Libya, as part of Germany’s presidency of the UNSC.
“They expressed their intention to hold those responsible for further conflict accountable. They reiterated their full support for the secretary general and his special representative and called on all parties to resume dialogue and deliver on their commitments to engage constructively with the UN political process,” Heusgen pointed out.
The Libyan National Army, led by Marshal Khalifa Haftar, has taken control of several areas in the south-west of the country’s capital.
Haftar’s offensive refers to the Government of the National Accord, led by Fayez al-Sarraj and trained with the support of the UN and the European Union. – Advertisement –
Russia, which has provided Haftar with backing in the past, claimed it was not helping the commander’s forces in the offensive and that it supported a negotiated political settlement that ruled out any new bloodshed.
Haftar traveled to Moscow twice in 2016 seeking political support. The Financial Times has reported that Russia has helped the administration Haftar has set up in eastern Libya issue a parallel currency, a pointed challenge to the Tripoli-based central government.
Russian officials sharply criticized U.S. and European actions that preceded Qaddafi’s ouster and blamed the West for the chaos that engulfed Libya.
With Dmitry Medvedev as president, Russia abstained from the vote on the UN Security Council resolution that allowed air strikes by NATO forces in 2011, but Vladimir Putin — then prime minister — likened it to “medieval calls for crusades.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told news agencies on April 5 that Moscow was monitoring the situation.
Kibya has been torn apart by internal conflicts since the death of leader Muammar Khaddafi in 2011. The eastern part of the country is governed by parliament, supported by the Libyan National Army and located in Tobruk. The Government of the National Agreement, supported by the UN and led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj, operates in the west of the country and is based in Tripoli.

Note to Team Mueller: Prosecution isn't a game of 'horseshoes or hand grenades',www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/note-to-team-mueller-prosecution-isnt-a-game-of-horseshoes-or-hand-grenades.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

© Christopher Morris/VII/Redux SC Robert Mueller
I’ve covered the Justice Department for three decades, and seldom have I seen a story like the one published in The New York Times this week under the headline, “ Some on Mueller’s Team Say Report Was More Damaging Than Barr Revealed .”
What concerned me most is that the story’s anonymous allegations reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the role prosecutors play, including special counsels such as Robert Mueller .
The job of prosecutors is not, as the Times headline suggested, to pen “damaging” narratives about people they couldn’t indict. And it’s not their job to air those people’s dirty laundry, or that of suspects outside of a grand jury room or a courtroom.
Mueller concluded there wasn’t evidence President Trump colluded with Russia to hijack the 2016 election, and therefore no indictment was warranted. And he punted on the question of obstruction, leaving his bosses – Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein – to determine that there wasn’t enough evidence to indict the president on that charge.
And, most significantly, there were no other people charged. That means Trump legally could not be named as an unindicted co-conspirator in an obstruction plot.
At that point, no federal prosecutor has the right to impugn an uncharged investigative target’s reputation through anonymous leaks or literary reports. They are not allowed to anonymously inject into the court of public opinion any “damaging” information about what they couldn’t succeed at offering in a court of law as proof of criminality.
Prosecution isn’t a game of horseshoes or hand grenades where prosecutors get to score points or inflict damage without indicting the target. In fact, the Founding Fathers built a legal system specifically to avoid the tarring of citizens when there wasn’t enough proof to meet a criminal charge.
And nowhere is that intention to protect the citizenry more clear than in the rules governing grand juries . The federal justice system created grand juries so that evidence that was embarrassing or damaging to defendants could be weighed behind closed doors but never released if it did not rise to the level of provable criminality.
The Justice Department rules threaten any law enforcement officer or prosecutor with prosecution if they leak any proceeding that occurred before a grand jury. And the Justice Department rules governing grand juries unequivocally talk about the sanctity of protecting citizens who end up not being charged.
“The prosecutor must recognize that the grand jury is an independent body, whose functions include not only the investigation of crime and the initiation of criminal prosecution but also the protection of the citizenry from unfounded criminal charges,” the Justice Department rules say.
We know from statements the Justice Department made Thursday that grand jury subpoenas and testimony were so essential to the Mueller probe that nearly every one of the 400 pages of his final report contained some form of grand jury or classified information that needs to be redacted – i.e., protected from being used to level “unfounded criminal charges” against those not indicted.
When you see the rules by which prosecutors must abide, and compare it to the anonymous narrative in the Times article, one can see a real reason for concern.
Going to the court of public opinion to state there was “damaging” information in a probe that failed to prove criminal charges violates the letter and the spirit of the Justice Department manual. It also offends the essence of American justice that one remains innocent until proven guilty.
What’s most ironic about this Mueller probe leak is that it comes less than a year after former FBI Director James Comey was admonished publicly for holding a news conference to criticize Hillary Clinton for how she handled classified emails based on the results of an investigation that resulted in no criminal charges.
“We concluded that Comey’s unilateral announcement was inconsistent with Department policy and violated long-standing Department practice and protocol by, among other things, criticizing Clinton’s uncharged conduct,” the Justice Department inspector general wrote.
You’d think the Mueller prosecutors might have taken note of the admonishment.
So the first fault in the Times story rests clearly on the federal prosecutors who leaked to associates or directly to reporters.
I also believe the Times shares some fault. As a lifelong journalist I won’t criticize a news organization for reporting on a story such as this and quoting sources, especially if they were in a first-person position to really know. Journalists should strive to find out what their elected leaders such as Trump have done, whether criminal or not.
But I strongly believe – as did the news organization for which I worked for the longest in my professional career, The Associated Press – that we have an obligation as reporters to quote information anonymously only from first-hand sources.
There is compelling evidence – starting with the lead of the story – that the Times information comes anonymously from “associates” of the actual prosecutors. In other words, it is second-hand hearsay.
I’m not sure that rises to a strong journalistic standard.
Nonetheless, the bigger lesson here should be clear, both to the Mueller team members and the reporters who facilitated their anonymous griping.
In the American justice system, if you don’t indict, you cannot incite.

The three weeks leading up to Ukraine’s presidential run-off are set to become an all-out spectacle , as the two contenders – incumbent Petro Poroshenko and comedian Volodymyr Zelensky – stop at nothing in their absurd duel.
The comedian not only managed to win almost twice as many votes as the president in the first round , but has cranked up his trolling campaign to the max. A video of Zelensky accepting Poroshenko’s challenge, and in turn setting his conditions for a duel, shows him fully tapping into his showman vibe. Walking in epic slow motion into the center of Ukraine’s Olimpiyskiy stadium, with blues guitar music playing in the background, he speaks in his signature gravelly voice.
“You challenge me to a debate. Did you hope I would run, tune out, hide? No. I’m not you in 2014.”
‘2014’ is a reference to Poroshenko’s refusal to hold a similar debate that year with Yulia Tymoshenko, when he said war is no time for political shows. This time, however, he appears to be getting pulled into just that. Zelensky, who excels putting on a show , seems to be deliberately maneuvering his opponent into familiar ground. He is demanding that the debate takes place in that same Olimpiyskiy stadium, that every channel has the right to stream it, and no media is denied access.

But the requirements do not stop at there, with the comedian demanding to exclude “alcoholics or drug addicts” from the debates… with a publicized medical test of each candidate. This is an apparent dig at Poroshenko over persistent rumors of a booze dependency problem. At the same time, Zelensky demands respect fit for a candidate, banning disparaging references to him – such as a Kremlin stooge, a redneck or a clown.
Poroshenko has previously derided the comedian as a “Kolomoysky puppet” – referring to the powerful rival oligarch Igor Kolomoysky who owns the TV channel where Zelensky runs his studio’s shows.
Given 24 hours do decide, Poroshenko appears to have taken the bait, agreeing to both the stadium debate and the drug test. But his tactics are the opposite to that of the comedian, as he responds that presidency is serious business. He has declared that his debates “are not a show,” that he has accepted tougher challenges “from powerful enemies” before (a reference to what Kiev calls a “war with Russia”) – and, he adds, he wants a European Ukraine.
It would seem that the guns are loaded and both are now set for an epic stand-off, but there is still a catch. No one really knows if and when the debate is going to take place. It’s speculated that it could be held April 19, before the “day of silence” ahead of the decisive vote. But for now the show must go on – and the blood tests are on.

Drug test: Fear and loathing in Kiev
While there’s still plenty of room for absurd stunts and sick burns ahead of the vote, the most absurd event so far must have been the Friday drug and alcohol test both candidates underwent. First, the two bickered over where and when exactly to take the tests, and in the end Poroshenko took his at the Olimpiysky medical office, while Zelensky did it at a private clinic.
Both candidates posted pictures of themselves submitting blood samples – to the amusement of everyone watching. Poroshenko was declared clean within minutes of his test, with the doctor saying he used express testing methods. Zelensky’s result was not available as quickly, and Poroshenko’s campaign HQ swiftly accused him of cheating.
[embedded content]
It remains to be seen whether the two will repeat the test right before the debate, when its results will actually mean something other than an exchange of showmanship.
Losing gas princess invited as referee
For his next move, Zelensky invited the notorious political figure Yulia Tymoshenko, who came in at about three percent behind Poroshenko in the first round of the election, to moderate the debate. Tymoshenko has refused to support any other candidates, and Zelensky argues her presence thus would help “avoid bribery, provocation and administrative pressure.” Of course, she was also given 24 hours to consider the invitation – and has even responded that she would think about it.
[embedded content]
Despite all the jokes Zelensky and his comedians have made at her expense over the years, Tymoshenko has a bigger bone to pick with the president. She claims Poroshenko has stolen votes from her during the first round, and says she sees no point in taking it to the courts, because she doesn’t believe in their honesty.
‘Puppet’ v Pinochet?
Zelensky’s long-winded demand for Poroshenko to publicly acknowledge him as his own man and not an instrument of Kolomoysky’s influence is one concession the incumbent has refused to make. In fact, one of his responses was reportedly supposed to include a reference to the “millions of dollars” the billionaire has paid Zelensky and the comedian’s promotion on Kolomoysky’s channel , but was not included in the final version.
Meanwhile, a Poroshenko aide has managed to add some ominous notes to the debate expectations as he accompanied Poroshenko’s “challenge accepted” quote with a photoshopped picture of him dressed as Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Incidentally, Pinochet used Chile’s national stadium as a venue for political executions.
And that’s just the first round
With two weeks still to go to the debate, some observers have already claimed Zelensky is only bluffing, and will keep upping the stakes and making outrageous demands so as to find a way to call it off at the last moment. What this does show, however, is that the comedian has the initiative firmly in his hands – at least for now.
[embedded content]
Despite his political experience being limited to playing a president in a comedy TV series, Zelensky has shot up in the ratings over the past year, as Poroshenko’s ratings tanked amid his failure to address rampant corruption and bring about his election promises. By handing ‘Ze’ a third of their votes, the weary Ukrainian population may have shown that he is a breath of fresh air, or perhaps they have lost all trust in the post-coup authorities, and are enjoying black humor as a better alternative to keeping calm and carrying on.

Pentagon to deploy satellite capable of detecting Russian hypersonic missiles,www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/pentagon-to-deploy-satellite-capable-of-detecting-russian-hypersonic-missiles.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

U.S Undersecretary of Defense John Rood announced that the Pentagon is planning to start deploying “low cost” sensors into Earth’s low-orbit, capable of detecting and launching hypersonic missile launches.
The announcement was made during a hearing on the US Senate Armed Services Committee, where Rood answered questions about how the US was fighting hypersonic weapons.
At the same time, the undersecretary gave no details on how the Pentagon plans to topple the missiles, noting that the military is working on developing ways to affect them during flight.
During a hearing devoted to military budget requests, Rood specifically pointed to the need to develop “hypersonic missile defenses”, justifying this because both Russia and China are developing sophisticated weapons, including hypersonic slip vehicles (HGV). The undersecretary noted that such missiles are capable of maneuvering into the atmosphere, making their trajectories unpredictable for traditional defenses.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has presented the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile (SS-N-33), revealing that the equipment can reach an impressive speed of 9Mach and attack targets both at sea and on ground at a distance of up to 1,000 kilometers.
Meanwhile, the Russian submarine fleet, equipped with hypersonic missiles, will be in full combat readiness in 2024, data from US intelligence say.
According to the CNBS channel, citing military reports, in order to strengthen its submarine fleet within six years, Russia has reduced spending on the modernization of the surface fleet.
In addition, the media highlights that by 2024, the number of brand new Russian submarines will be increased to eight.
According to the channel, these are ships of class Borei 2 or Borei-A, fourth generation. Each of them is capable of carrying 20 Bulava missiles with nuclear and hypersonic warheads. Thus, according to CNBS, only one Borei 2 submarine could launch 200 missiles – a threat that the US can not now avoid.
Previously, the same media reported that Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and Avangard systems will enter service in the Russian Armed Forces by 2020. Comment: 200 missiles? More like a maximum of 200 warheads from 20 Bulava missiles, and all of them would not be nuclear warheads. Apparently, there are multiple types of warheads – including decoys – that would accompany actual nuclear warheads in each Bulava missile. As for US defenses, we’ll see. Russia already has operational hypersonic missiles, new missile defense systems, and shiny new nukes. The USA is just starting to talk about it, and will no doubt spend $10 trillion per missile before anything actually lifts off the launchpad. This ‘New Cold War’ is great for business though, eh?

BBC & friends conjure up baseless claim German MP against Russian sanctions is 'Kremlin agent',www.therussophile.org,Ashley Bailey,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/bbc-kremlin-agent.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

US Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s search for a Russian hand may be fruitlessly over, but the greater hunt for the Kremlin bogeyman is not. Mainstream media are finding new targets, the latest being an opposition MP in Germany.
On Friday, the BBC dropped a fresh (-ish) bombshell : a German politician, it claims, could be “absolutely controlled” by Russia. Its sources are alleged emails, sent between Russian officials, provided in 2017 by an anti-Putin tycoon’s “investigative” organization.
The MP in question is Markus Frohnmaier, from the right-wing opposition AfD party. He is not a surprising target, having spoken up against anti-Russian EU sanctions and taken trips to post-2014 Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
Now, the BBC says it has conducted a joint investigation with German and Italian media outlets into the 2017 emails – and released a report at a time when the “Russian active measures” narrative seems to need a boost to keep going after Mueller’s fizzle.
The aspirant bombshell is hidden at the end of a text document allegedly mailed by former Russian MP Petr Premyak to senior Putin official Sergey Sokolov. There, someone spells out how Frohnmaier’s chances of getting into the Bundestag are high, how he needs support for the election campaign, and – here it comes – how if he is elected, Russia would have its “own absolutely controlled MP in the Bundestag.”
Frohnmaier himself, when shown the paper, said that it’s a fake , and he had never seen it before. The Kremlin has made no comment so far. The BBC admits it’s unknown if Moscow followed through with its supposed plan to “control” the MP.
Incidentally, the papers, which the BBC says it has seen – but never showed anyone other than in translated snippets or stylized graphics in its program Newsnight – come from the Dossier Center – an outfit of self-exiled Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Kremlin critic seen in the West as a victim of political persecution.
With all the subjunctives and questionable sources involved, it’s too early to say if the alleged papers have any merit, or will prove to be just as fraught as the Steele dossier, one of the shaky pillars on which the Trump-Russia collusion theory was built.
Meanwhile in the US, the media got quickly back on their ‘Russian influence’ feet. Examples include, but are by far not limited to, top Russiagate peddler Rachel Maddow – who falsely accused Trump-appointed AG William Barr of having his way with Mueller’s report, and Time magazine – which has moved on to “Russia’s other plot” in its tellingly red-and-black cover depicting Putin as an evil overlord.

Since 2013 onwards, starting under the Obama administration and continued the trend under the Trump administration, for the US State Department spokesperson to make some very questionable (and sometimes plain absurd) statements. Jen Psaki
The list starts off with Jen Psaki , she served as Department of State spokesperson between February 11 th , 2013 and March 31 st , 2015. She served under the Obama administration, while US Secretary of State was John Kerry.
Some of her more famous claims are as follows:
Most notably, Psaki warned that “in the event of a Belarusian invasion of Ukraine, the 6th US Fleet will immediately be deployed to the shores of Belarus,” in 2014. The only issue is that Belarus was (and still is) landlocked. Memes followed
There is also a handy supercut of some of her more interesting claims:
[embedded content]
According to her, Russian media “targeted” her, because of her outfits and nothing else. Marie Harf
Following her departure from the seat, she was replaced by Marie Harf , who from June 2013 was Deputy Spokesperson of the State Department. She served under the Obama administration and US Secretary of State John Kerry. She served between March 31 st , 2015 and May 13 th , 2015.
One of her most famous and ridiculed statements happened in an interview she gave on Hardball with Chris Matthews on February 16 th , 2015 shortly before becoming acting spokesperson.
In response to questions related to US strategy against ISIS, Harf said , “We cannot kill our way out of this war. We need in the medium to longer term to go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups, whether it’s a lack of opportunity for jobs, whether …” This led to her being ridiculed on social media, with the #JobsForISIS hashtag.
There is also a useful supercut with more of her claims and statements:
[embedded content] John Kirby
Following Harf, retired Rear Admiral John Kirby assumed the role of Department Spokesperson, also under the Obama Administration US Secretary of State John Kerry. He served between May 12 th , 2015 – January 20 th , 2017
Famously in September 2016, John Kirby told the Syrian army to stop its offensive to liberate Aleppo, Kirby warned Russia that a continuation of the offensive would mean “attacks against Russian interests, perhaps even Russian cities.” He added that if the war doesn’t stop, Russia would “continue to send troops home in body bags,” and “perhaps even lose aircraft.”
In November 2016, he sharply responded to an RT reporter who asked him to provide basic evidence to back up allegations that Russian forces in Syria deliberately engaged in bombing hospitals. Kirby said that he wasn’t “going to put Russia Today on the same level with the rest of you who are representing independent media outlets,” and incoherently suggested that the RT journalist direct her questions to the Russian Defense Ministry.
[embedded content]
In October 2016 he also defended the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen , alleging that Saudi Arabia was simply protecting its borders from a possible Houthi attack. Mark Toner
Following Donald Trump’s assumption of the presidential seat, Kirby was let go and he was replaced by Mark Toner , who served as acting Secretary of State Spokesperson between January 20 th , 2017 – April 24 th , 2017, while Rex Tillerson was US Secretary of State.
Probably the reason why he was simply “acting spokesperson” and the Department of State rushed to appoint a new spokesperson was one situation.
Mexico’s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, was in Washington. The Los Angeles Times’s Tracy Wilkinson asked State spokesperson Mark Toner what the plans were for his visit. Toner, a highly regarded career foreign service officer, apparently had no idea that a key foreign dignitary was even in the city: Wowwowwow. State Dep’t Acting Spox Mark Toner had zero idea the Mexican foreign minister was in Washington. DoS totally cut out. (!!!) pic.twitter.com/zYclfJIq6q
— Ankit Panda (@nktpnd) March 10, 2017 Heather Nauert
Following Toner’s short term as acting spokesperson, the post was taken by Heather Nauert, who served between April 24 th , 2017 and April 3 rd , 2017. Under both Rex Tillerson, and after Trump saw him out – under Mike Pompeo.
One of her most famous embarrassing statements was claiming that D-Day was an example of the US”“strong relationship with the German government.”
“We have a very strong relationship with the government of Germany,” Heather Nauert said.
“Looking back in the history books, today is the 71st anniversary of the speech that announced the Marshall Plan. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the D-Day invasion. We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government of Germany.”
It should be reminded, to abolish any confusion, that during the D-Day invasion on June 6 th , 1944, around 156,000 British, American, Canadian and other Allied troops stormed the beaches of Normandy to establish a foothold in Nazi-occupied France. Dear @StateDept : You have six months to educate Heather Nauert on the history and significance of Pearl Harbor before she cites it as an example of strong US-Japan relations. Get to it – you may need some time to catch her up. #maddow
— Alicia Fox (@aliciafoxrocks) June 7, 2018
She also openly supported the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen in April 2018, while she condemned “Iran’s malign influence” in Yemen.
She was mocked for posting a “touristy” picture outside of a government building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
In May 2018, Nauert said in response to the Gaza border protests: “We oppose actions against Israel at the International Criminal Court (…) because it does not help the cause for peace.”
She also repeatedly accused Russia and Syria regarding alleged misconduct, without providing any evidence.
Finally, on April 3 rd , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the appointment of Morgan Ortagus as Department of State Spokesperson. Pleased to welcome Morgan Ortagus as our new @statedeptspox . Her experience as an intelligence analyst & public affairs officer in foreign policy & national security will benefit America. She’ll lead our fight to communicate & defend US foreign policy. Welcome to our team Morgan. pic.twitter.com/kSqTdPFNzv
— Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) April 3, 2019
She appears to not be a supporter of Donald Trump, as in 2016 she criticized him over what she called his “isolationist foreign policy approach,” and said Trump is “disgusting” and “not serious.”
Despite that, she typically propagates the idea that the world will “fall apart” if not for the US and its global dominance agenda. At least she claimed that the US shouldn’t be “the policemen of the world.”
“In his gut, he does not think that Americans should be, quote unquote, the policemen of the world,” she said during a panel discussion dissecting Trump’s foreign policy speech.
“I don’t see it that way. I think that America is the glue that holds the world together. … So there were points that I agreed with him today, but overall, I fundamentally disagree with his isolationist approach to foreign policy,” she added.
It is likely that with recent US policy newly appointed spokesperson Morgan Ortagus will get her chance at providing some noteworthy remarks. Time will tell.

"For millennials, now come the robots - Axios",www.axios.com,Steve Levine,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.axios.com/millennials-jobs-robots-gig-economy-1b0a67e3-7ac9-4bfd-9ec2-bef7fb40ffaf.html,"For millennials, now come the robots Illustration: Rebecca Zisser/Axios Millennials face one of the toughest economic landscapes of any generation since World War II: they are working for relatively low pay and, for college graduates, they're saddled with an average of some $30,000 in student debt. But now, they are about to confront yet another challenge — robots. Millennials will be the first generation to absorb the full impact of the new age of automation, which, if history is a teacher, will wipe out jobs faster than the economy can create new ones. Go deeper 607 Words What's happening : Millennials came of age during the Great Recession. Since then, three-quarters of all new U.S. jobs have paid less than a middle-class income, according to Labor Department data . These minimum- or lower-wage jobs are the ones that millennials — ages 23-38, born between 1981 and 1996, and the largest generation in the country — are often taking. Unlike prior generations, there may not be much of a ladder up from there. Part of that is economics — tech and globalization have hollowed out middle-skill, middle-wage jobs. And part of it is the continued aftermath of the financial crash. There has been political fallout: On top of all this, millennials are on the hook for the public spending excesses of the baby boomers. In an Axios/SurveyMonkey poll last year, 51% of millennials said they resent boomers for their financial circumstances, tension likely to play out in the politics of the coming decades. The bottom line : Prior technological revolutions have led to decades-long interregnums before real wages returned to prior levels. And those thrown out of work often had trouble finding new jobs. The new automation is tech on steroids. As time goes on, it will strikehard at blue-collar millennials in cities and more rural parts of the country alike. Look for even greater disaffection and raw unhappiness from left-behind Americans. Take John Russell, a 27-year-old farmer from Galena, Ohio, who tells Axios that, until now, millennials in his area had three relatively secure jobs — at Walmart, a Walmart warehouse or driving a semi-truck. But, Russell says, ""warehouses and semi-truck jobs — the most security you can have in the Ohio Valley — are at risk of automation. What's going to happen when they go away? The companies will get a big boost in profit, but the people will have to figure out what to do."" Russell himself, who has a degree in agricultural science from Cornell,works a 21-acre farm bought by his parents. So does a brother who is an arborist. In a chat in Storm Lake, Iowa, where he was attending a political event, Russell told me he earns most of his money contracting out to grind up tree stumps. This was a recurring theme in conversations in rural Iowa: finding work is a matter of providence, often involving your family. David Rosmann, a 37-year-old farmer from Harlan, said that between college and returning to his parents' 700-acre organic farm in 2014, he has been a line cook, a rural organizer, a lumberyard worker, and a graduate student. As time goes on, ""guys my age aren't going to be able to farm unless they are an heir or someone will take them under their wing,"" Rosmann said. ""My brother and I realize how fortunate we were we had jobs waiting for us."" The bottom line : The future of work for millennials looks no rosier than it has been the last decade — and may be worse. ""Innovation creates more jobs than it destroys, but not always in the same place or with the same people,"" former Congressman John Delaney, a Democratic candidate for president, told me in Storm Lake. The government needs to step in and bridge the gap, he said. Rosmann said the bias should be against the robots. ""Is your bottom line more important than the people around you who need work?"" "
Judge Carlton Reeves deals major blow to Jim Hood’s jihad vs. Entergy,yallpolitics.com,Alan Lange,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://yallpolitics.com/2019/04/06/judge-carlton-reeves-deals-major-blow-to-jim-hoods-jihad-vs-entergy/,"Judge Carlton Reeves deals major blow to Jim Hood’s jihad vs. Entergy By - April 6, 2019
Normally, for trial lawyers, state court is where you want to be. However, in the case of Attorney General Jim Hood vs. Entergy, Carlton Reeves dealt the contingency case a pretty serious blow on Thursday night when he remanded the case back to state Chancery Court in Hinds County. Hood was so bold in October of 2018 to say that the he “finally had Entergy cornered.”
The long running suit deals with allegations by Hood and deputized trial lawyers that Entergy “duped” the Legislature and Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) , which has the job of making sure that utilities appropriately price services. Entergy reports annually to both the MPSC and the Legislature.
The case, which has been in process for over 10 years , started in state court and was later removed to federal court. Entergy has consistently said that Hood’s allegations are issues for regulators (either the PSC or the federal regulator FERC) to decide.
Entergy Mississippi commented on the Reeves decision.
While we respect Judge Reeves’ decision, we believe that the Attorney General’s long-running, decade-old case against Entergy, if heard by any court, should be heard in federal court – and the Attorney General agreed with that on Thursday. We continue to believe that this subject matter is best handled by a regulatory body like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Mississippi Public Service Commission. As the past few days in Judge Reeves’ court have shown, issues concerning utility rates and multi-state power purchases are very complicated and require specialized expertise. Although the Federal Court ultimately determined it did not have authority to decide where this case should be heard, we are confident the Chancery Court will carefully consider where this case should be heard.
It is important to remember that our rates are among the lowest in the country and numerous audits of our fuel costs have affirmed that we treat our customers fairly. Entergy looks forward to the opportunity to defend its record and the record of our nearly 4,000 employees and retirees across Mississippi.
Complicating the legal landscape substantially is the 2018 law passed by the Mississippi legislature that essentially provides safe harbor for regulated entities sued by the Attorney General for regulated behavior without going through the regulator first, which in this case would be the PSC. That’s complicated, because the Public Service Commission has an audit trail of 10 years where they’ve been regulating Entergy. Plus, independent audits are conducted annually outside the PSC. Finding, as Hood would say, “fraudulent behavior” by Entergy, would essentially be an admission that the PSC has no idea what it’s doing. Entergy regularly touts reports that put it among the lowest cost providers nationally for publicly traded utilities .
Even further complicating the issue is the clock.
Time is running out for Jim Hood. Carlton Reeves is as likely a friendly a judge to Hood as Hood could have possibly hoped for. Now, essentially the case will start over again in state court to determine whether or not the new SB 2295 applies. And whatever happens in Chancery Court, either side would vigorously appeal whatever decision the Chancery Court finds. The appellate courts are increasingly conservative and pro-business in Mississippi.
Jim Hood’s term ends at the end of 2019, and it is hard to imagine that this case would find resolution before Hood is out of office. Given the political winds, it’s highly unlikely that the new AG will be cut from the same political cloth as Hood and will have any interest in pushing the case.
One of his prospective successors, State Rep. Mark Baker, championed the new law in a fiery floor speech last year .
https://www.facebook.com/yallpolitics/videos/1874332215971134/
Also, if and when the case does wind up in front of the PSC, depending on its political makeup at the time, it’s going to be difficult for them to have to admit publicly that they somehow didn’t do their primary job of regulating Entergy correctly. For over a decade.
Without a doubt, bringing the case back to state court will dial up the politics substantially. Some observers thought that a victory in federal court might substantially prop up Hood’s chances in his 2019 gubernatorial campaign. That prospect has now taken a pretty dire turn."
