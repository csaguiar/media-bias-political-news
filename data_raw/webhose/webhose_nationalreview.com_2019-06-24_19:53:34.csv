Ben Sasse Reminds Democratic Colleagues of their Religious Intolerance | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/ben-sasse-questions-judicial-nominee-over-knights-of-columbus/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter June 5, 2019 5:57 PM Senator Ben Sasse, R., Neb., speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing in Washington, D.C., September 4, 2018.

Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) used a little humor this morning in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to remind his Democratic colleagues of their religious intolerance from earlier this year.
The committee was considering the nomination of U.S. district judge Peter Phipps to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. “I want to ask you a hard question,” Sasse told Phipps at the start of their exchange. “Are you now or have you ever been involved in the organization of a fish fry?” Advertisement Advertisement
“As a consumer I have. . . . I’ve brought a few other consumers with me in fact,” Phipps replied. “Judge, did you get questions for the record about being a member of the Knights of Columbus?” Sasse said in a follow-up, and the judge acknowledged that he had received such questions. “This is a new tradition around here evidently, trying to figure out if people are members of religious organizations,” the senator said. After Phipps explained that the Knights of Columbus is a Catholic fraternal organization involved mostly in charity work, Sasse added rhetorically, “So it’s much more the stuff of community service, love of neighbor, fish fries, and pool parties than some sort of Da Vinci Code stuff? I just want to be clear that I understand this scary organization that you’re a member of.”
Sasse’s remarks in today’s hearing were meant to recall questions directed at judicial nominee Brian Buescher a few months ago by Democratic senators Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), who targeted Buescher over his involvement in the Knights of Columbus. The senators insinuated, and at times outright stated, that Buescher’s Catholic beliefs would lead him to rule against abortion rights and that his membership in the Knights could disqualify him from serving as a judge at all. Hirono went so far as to demand that he drop his membership and recuse himself from any case on which the organization has taken a position.
But that episode evidently has been quickly forgotten by Sasse’s Democratic colleagues. After the Nebraska senator closed his questioning with an admonition that he hopes “we’d reconsider this new tradition on this committee of asking people about their religious commitments,” Senator Pat Leahy (D., Vt.) interrupted the proceedings to chastise Sasse for bringing up the Knights of Columbus.

“Like my father, I’ve been a long-time member of the Knights of Columbus, and even though I’m half Italian, I don’t remember any discussion of da Vinci. What are you referring to?” Leahy said. More from Leahy’s remarks:
M y father was a youngster who went to work, and they had signs that said ‘no Catholics need apply’ or ‘no Irish need apply.’ He stood against that kind of prejudice for any kind of religion. I faced it the first time I ran for the Senate and overcame it. My state has become different. What is da Vinci? I don’t understand. And I’m a little bit annoyed as a member of the K of C.
Sasse noted that his question was meant sarcastically, and that perhaps Leahy ought to huddle with some of his colleagues who evidently don’t share his distaste for questioning whether nominee’s religious beliefs disqualify them from holding judicial office.
For her part, Hirono seems to be distancing herself from her own tactics. “To be clear, no senator on [the Democratic] side has ever suggested that a member of any organization is per se unfit for the bench, only those who cannot be fair and impartial,” she said after Sasse’s questioning of Phipps today. But in her questions to Buescher a few months ago, Hirono did exactly what she claimed no Democratic senator has done, writing in part,
7. You reported that you have been a member of the Knights of Columbus since 1993. The Knights of Columbus has taken a number of extreme positions. For example, it was reportedly one of the top contributors to California’s Proposition 8 campaign to ban same-sex marriage.
a. If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?
At the very least, perhaps it’s good to know that Democrats are willing to condemn inappropriate questioning about a nominee’s religious faith when the questions are coming from a Republican. Advertisement"
D-Day in Normandy: When War Was the Answer | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/d-day-history-normandy-france/,"June 6, 2019 6:30 AM Tombstones at the World War II Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville sur Mer, France. (Stephane Mahe/Reuters) Terrible yet inspiring traces of D-Day remain in the Normandy landscape. Omaha Beach, Normandy O n a bluff above the sand and a half-mile from the ocean’s edge at low tide, which was the condition when the first Allied soldiers left their landing craft, a round circle of concrete five feet in diameter provides a collar for a hole in the ground. On the morning of June 6, 1944, the hole was Widerstandsnest (nest of resistance) 62, a German machine-gun emplacement. Hein Severloh had been in it since shortly after midnight, by which time U.S. aircraft were droning overhead, having dropped young American paratroopers Severloh’s age behind the beaches to disrupt German attempts to rush in reinforcements. Severloh had been billeted near Bayeux, home of the eleventh-century tapestry depicting a cross-Channel invasion that went the other way, taking William, Duke of Normandy, to become William the Conqueror, England’s sovereign.
Severloh believed that he killed hundreds of GIs, so long and slow was their walk to the safety, such as it was, of the five-foot embankment where the beach meets the bluff. Severloh returned here in sorrow and was consoled by survivors of the forces that waded ashore. Advertisement Advertisement
Today, a frequently seen bumper sticker proclaims: “War is not the answer.” But here, especially, it is well to remember that whether war is the answer depends on the question. Advertisement
War was the answer to what ailed Europe in 1944. “In 1942,” writes Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford and Stanford’s Hoover Institution, “there were only four perilously free countries in Europe: Britain, Switzerland, Sweden and Ireland.” Twenty years — a historical blink — later, almost all of Western Europe was free. Twenty years after that, Spain, Portugal and Greece had joined the liberal democracies. Today, for the first time in 2,500 years, most Europeans live under such governments.
Ash argues that Europe cannot define itself negatively — as not America or not Islam. “Europe’s only defining ‘other’ is its own previous self”— its self-destructive, sometimes barbaric past. “This is,” Ash says, “still a very recent past.”
In 1951, just seven years after Severloh and some other Germans surrendered on June 7 to Americans at the village of St. Laurent, Europe began building the institutions that it hoped would keep such young men out of machine-gun emplacements. It created the European Coal and Steel Community, precursor of the Common Market (1958), which led to the single market in 1993 and the common currency in 2002. Advertisement
The implicit hope was that commerce could tame Europe’s turbulent nations. The perennial problem of politics — mankind’s susceptibility to storms of passions — could perhaps be solved, or at least substantially ameliorated, by getting Europe’s peoples to sublimate their energies in economic activities. The quest for improved material well-being would drain away energies hitherto tapped and channeled by demagogues. Advertisement
Reminders of Europe’s problematic past were recently found a few miles from St. Laurent. Workers preparing a foundation for a new house overlooking Omaha Beach came upon parts of the bodies of two German soldiers. There was scant media attention to this because such discoveries have not been rare.
Also near here, 21,160 German soldiers are buried at La Cambe Cemetery. Thirty percent — more than 6,000 — were never identified, so some German parents conducted “assumed burials.” They placed metal markers bearing the names of their missing sons near the graves of unknown soldiers who were known to have died near where the parents’ sons were last known to be fighting. Advertisement
Such heartbreaking stories are written into Normandy’s lovely landscape. At the American Cemetery overlooking this beach, amid the many rows of white marble gravestones, are two, side by side, marking the burial places of Ollie Reed and Ollie Reed Jr., a father and his son. The son, an Army first lieutenant, died in Italy on July 6. His father, an Army colonel, was killed on July 30 in Normandy. Two telegrams notified the father’s wife, the son’s mother. The telegrams arrived in Manhattan, Kan., 45 minutes apart. Advertisement
The 19th-century French scholar Ernest Renan, from a Brittany town on the English Channel, defined a nation as a community of shared memory — and shared forgetting. Europe’s emotional equipoise, and the transformation of “Europe” from a geographical to a political expression, has required both remembering and forgetting. Americans who make pilgrimages to this haunting place are reminded of their role, and their stake, in that transformation. "
"Speaking Out: An Oslo Journal, Part I - National Review",www.nationalreview.com,,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/oslo-freedom-forum-2019-norwegian-capital/,"Follow Jay Nordlinger on Twitter June 6, 2019 6:30 AM Nury A. Turkel, a Uyghur-American attorney and a spokesman for the Uyghur cause, at the Oslo Freedom Forum in May 2019 Notes on a freedom gathering and the Norwegian capital
R eaders of my Oslo journals over the years are accustomed to certain observations — yearly, quasi-ritualistic ones.
Man, are there a lot of blonds on the plane from New York to Oslo. Not dyed ones either (although they are present too).
Man, does the Oslo airport have wood — miles and miles of beautiful wood. That’s a nice touch in an airport, or anywhere. Advertisement Advertisement
Man, are the urinals high. No, really, they are. And the Norwegians are not particularly tall, in my observation. Still, they like the kind of urinals that might be appropriate in an NBA locker-room.
This year, I notice something else about the urinals (maybe I’m looking too hard?): They are made by Villeroy & Boch. “The same people who made my wedding china,” I think. Pretty classy, to whizz into V&B. But a little disturbing, or awkward, too. Advertisement
I mean, I eat off this stuff.
• Have you had enough of the light observations? Are you itching to get to the tyranny and torture? Don’t worry …
• They are an advanced people, the Norwegians. Technologically, not least. You don’t buy a train ticket, or at least I don’t. You swipe your credit card at a turnstile. And then — well, you just go. To whatever stop.
Huh. Advertisement
• Back to toilets (did you miss them?). In some places around Oslo, there are pay toilets. It would be good to have a coin on you — just the right coin. But say you are new in town, and have only foreign currency and credit cards. What then? Rob someone? Pick a pocket?
No, you can just swipe your credit card. No amount is too small.
• Out near the National Theater, in the center of town, music is playing. The performers are a pan flutist and a steel drummer. Their music is “Dancing Queen,” by ABBA (who are Swedish, but close enough).
Don’t you wish you had the royalties to “Dancing Queen”? Even if the pan flutist and the steel drummer aren’t paying? Advertisement
• When in Norway — or indeed, in Scandinavia — you are struck by the sheer orderliness of the place. There is something calming, or reassuring, about it. I’m tempted to use the word “centering.” An absence of chaos can be nice. There is enough inward trouble to deal with in life, without having to cope too much with the outward.
I could spell this out, but you probably get what I’m saying, and I am zipping through … Advertisement
• As always, I am grateful to have been born into the lingua franca of the world. We Americans, or other Anglophones, are Romans in the Roman Empire. This does not keep us from learning other languages if we want — even as the Romans did (especially when not in Rome?).
• I have my ritualistic meal at Rorbua , alongside Oslo Fjord. It is a Norwegian restaurant — I mean “Norwegian” as in whale, reindeer, and other such fare. Have a look at this platter. The smoked whale is at top left.
And this dessert? Classically Norwegian, or Scandinavian, almost comically so, especially at this time of year. Fresh and delicious.
• Enough food porn — back to bathrooms. At Rorbua, there is one bathroom, fairly large. Four stalls: two marked “Women” (in Norwegian), two marked “Men.” Common sinks, etc.
I don’t like it. This suggests I am a dinosaur, but who didn’t know that? Advertisement
• Bonil is a regular guest at the Oslo Freedom Forum. OFF, as you know, is the annual human-rights gathering here in the Norwegian capital. Bonil, as you may remember, is the nickname of Xavier Bonilla, the Ecuadorean cartoonist (and dissident, really). He is a very brave guy — but he covers his bravery with humor and modesty. Bonil has ample charm.
I tell him, “You disguise your bravery with jokes, but I can still see it, and so can others.” He tells me something interesting: “When a saint is in trouble, he says, ‘Oh, my God!’ When I am in trouble, I say, ‘Oh, my humor!’” That is how he handles it.
• You remember that the Burmese government is ravaging the Rohingyas, an ethnic and religious minority. I’ve written about this case many times. (For an overview, go here .) Others — real experts on the case — have written a lot more. Esther Htusan is one such expert. (You pronounce her last name TOO-sahn, like the city in Arizona.) A Burmese reporter, she was part of the Associated Press team that won the Pulitzer Prize in 2016. After threats, she had to leave her country.
I have done a Q&A podcast with her, here . A delightful, capable woman, who has gone through much, unsought by her. Advertisement Advertisement
• Nury Turkel is a headliner at the Forum — though “headliner” is too Vegas a word for such a person, and for the situation at hand. Nury is a Uyghur American, an attorney in Washington. I did a Q&A with him a year ago, here . I wrote about the Uyghurs — rounded up and terrorized by the Chinese government — here .
Onstage in Oslo, Nury delivers the following point: The world knows what is happening to the Uyghurs. No one can plead ignorance. The problem is not lack of awareness or lack of information. The problem is lack of action.
Well, what can outsiders do, given the immense power of the Chinese state?
For one thing, we can demand that the state release the Uyghurs — or forfeit the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, which are scheduled for Beijing.
We can decline to invest in China. We can sic Magnitsky acts on them. We can sound alarms. We, the outside world, are not helpless. Advertisement
You know that Niemöller statement that we’re all tired of, or mock? First they came for the dah-dah-dah, and I did not speak out, because I was not a dah-dah-dah? Nury Turkel quotes this statement — and it has new life, new freshness, to my ears.
The word “Rohingya” and the word “Uyghur” may be weird to many people around the world. But they should really be as familiar as our own names.
Nury tells the audience, “If my parents die,” back in Xinjiang Province, or East Turkestan, “will I even know it?”
• Readers, and listeners, will remember Felix Maradiaga — he is a Nicaraguan refugee and human-rights defender. I did a Q&A with him here , and a piece on the Nicaraguan situation here .
What’s the “situation”? A horrific crackdown, by Daniel Ortega, the jefe . (He was in power when I was in junior high, which was not yesterday. After a blessed hiatus, he came back.)
Here in Oslo, Felix is giving a talk, laying out the basics. He also has pictures, which are terrible to behold: people mauled by government forces. I look away, but at least my head isn’t in the sand, if you know what I mean.
• Masih Alinejad is an Iranian journalist, now out of the country. They don’t like her much. By “they,” I mean the Iranian dictatorship and its supporters. There are many such supporters, and not only in Iran.
Masih tells us that she was “attacked by a pro-regime guy in London,” who called her an “ugly woman” and said she was ruining the image of Iran. No, Masih replied. “I’m ruining the image of our oppressors.”
They have called her a “whore,” a “prostitute,” an “ugly duckling.” As Masih says, “They don’t know how the story of the ugly duckling turns out!” She does not think you should have to wear a hijab. She is all too much for the regime — the way she puts it is, “Too much hair, too much voice, too much of a woman.”
Bless her.
• In Hong Kong, and beyond, Denise Ho is a celebrity: a singer. I have not heard of her until now, but then, I have not heard of a lot of American celebrities. I was in my late twenties, I think, when I started not to recognize people on the cover of People magazine …
As a celebrity, Denise was counseled to stay neutral. To stay out of politics. But the Umbrella Movement pushed her into the fray, as I understand it. This is the democracy movement in Hong Kong that got its name when government forces responded to demonstrators with tear gas: Demonstrators used umbrellas to shield themselves from it.
Many participants in this movement have been imprisoned. I have been writing about them from time to time.
When the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to the Chinese Communist Party in 1997, the CCP promised “one country, two systems.” That was always a crock. Yet maybe the following is true: The more Hong Kongers protest, the looser the noose will remain, for longer.
Will the noose eventually choke Hong Kong and its people altogether? That seems sure, as long as the CCP remains in power. That’s what they do.
• Let’s end on something lightish. Back to food? Sure. If I opened up a vegan restaurant, it might well be called this:
• Isn’t this an attractive façade, here in Oslo?
That’s the national mapping agency, as I understand it.
• I have a little Slovenian intel for you. I ask a friend, “What do they think of Melania? Are they proud? Is she a big deal? The American First Lady from Slovenia?” My friend says, “The Slovenians aren’t too pleased with people who go away and make a success, of whatever kind.” That is terribly human, I think — and sucky."
Trump's Trade-War Casualties | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/24/trumps-trade-war-casualties/,"June 6, 2019 9:52 AM (Malcolm MacGregor/Getty Images) A visit to the battlefields of soy Valley Springs, S.D.
‘I ’m farming dirty!” says Kevin Scott, a father of six with one of those delightful Marge Gunderson Upper Midwestern tundra accents, who out here in his little house on the prairie right down the road from that little house on the prairie — the one Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about — is living the simple farmer’s life, which in the early 21st century includes such combat-derived technologies as surveillance drones and satellite overheads, along with giant tractors decked out with multiple touch-screen arrays into which are pumped vast quantities of real-time corn-and-soybean-related data of various kinds, and sensors and GPS tracking doohickeys and a vast pneumatic seeding apparatus that no longer scatters the seed upon the ground in onanistically incontinent fashion but places this individual piece of specially treated seed corn right there , just exactly 1.75 inches below the surface and topped with a little dollop of fertilizer, just so, cleanly and precisely, every nine inches, 16 rows at a time in a 40-foot sweep. There are five grains of untreated kernels in every hundred — just enough to keep from breeding pesticide-resistant pests. “I can monitor this from my cell phone in Washington,” Scott says, and that’s a part of this farmer’s life now, too: the meetings in Washington or Dallas or Paris and the trade shows in Orange County and San Antonio, the calls with the secretary of agriculture and his staff, monitoring the political chatter and commodity futures. His customers are Chinese pig farmers, his competitors are in Brazil and Argentina, he and his fellow soybean and corn producers have problems from Brussels to Beijing. Advertisement
But what’s really vexing Kevin Scott today is the million-dollar arsenal of high-tech farm implements sitting idle in his barn doing no farming at all, doing jack all, just sitting there depreciating. In this part of South Dakota, the farmers have planted only about 5 percent of their soybean crop and 25 percent of their corn. They like to plant corn by April 20 — this year, it was still snowing in May, and since then it’s been rain and rain and rain and rain, the Big Sioux River looking very big indeed, spilling over its banks. The highway medians look like Florida alligator swamps and there’s weeks of rain ponding all over the place, standing in the fields, halfway up trees in some places, making it too wet to plant. Advertisement
After a severe drought a few years back, years of soft farm prices, and a trade war in which Beijing has jammed its collective hand right up the hickory-striped overalls of American farmers and taken a firm icy grip on their scrota in retaliation for President Trump’s punitive tariffs on Chi-Comm imports, now this , this Coleridgean nightmare of water, water everywhere. Farmers used to pray for rain. Now, they are praying that it will stop long enough to let them put in their crops. Corn prices are high and rising . . . because nobody can plant corn. So farmers will either miss out on the bull market or be forced into speculation, selling crops they haven’t planted yet and may end up not being able to deliver, putting them at the risk of getting woefully and dangerously upside down on those contracts.
Decisions. Kevin Scott looks out the window. Rain. Advertisement
Things have been getting stuck in the mud so much that Scott has just left the tow rope tied to the front of his biggest tractor, the one with the tank-style rolling treads instead of the man-high tires, knowing that something else is going to have to be pulled out. Advertisement
Farming dirty, indeed.
What “farming dirty” actually means is leaving the old corn stalks mulching on the fields when the next crop is planted instead of cleaning them off. It is an ecologically sound practice, but Scott, who says “There is a place for things” like a man who really means it, does not like the messy look of farming dirty. He points to some evenly and uniformly bear-colored fields of artfully plowed Houdek loam. (Does your state have an official state soil? Because South Dakota has an official state soil, and it is Houdek loam.) “I’d prefer my fields to look like that,” he says, with a little bit of gentle lamentation. “But this is a good way to plant.”
Scott is on the board of the American Soybean Association and sits on its governing committee, its trade, policy, and international-affairs committee, and its biotech working group. He represents the ASA on a railroad business council, because those soybeans are not getting to China on magic carpets. He’s a national-policy adviser for his state soybean association, too, and was its president for a decade. (Term limits: The South Dakota Soybean Association has them.) And his policy agenda is free trade. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
This is Trump country, and the farmers here are the kind of conservative that usually gets described as staunch or rock-ribbed or something like that. Get them talking about trade, though, and they’re Manchester liberals. The farmers were on the opposite side of the free-trade debate during the controversy over the Corn Laws, but now they are frank and unapologetic and assertive owners of that most hated of all Trump-country epithets.
Globalists . Down on the farm. Advertisement
S o, here’s the thing about soybeans. Americans produce beaucoup soybeans. Brazil and Argentina, being in the Southern Hemisphere, produce gigantic crops in the U.S. off-season. China has a powerful hunger for soybeans, albeit a mostly indirect one. Two kinds of creatures walking this earth really like eating soybeans: pigs and hippies. Chinese people do eat soybeans, too, but what the nouveau riche Chinese palate has a real taste for just now is pork and, to a lesser extent, chicken. That’s a pretty predictable thing following a pretty familiar pattern: When poor countries become less poor — though with a per capita GDP of less than $9,000 a year, down there with Cuba and Kazakhstan, China is by no means a rich country — the first thing the people usually spend their newly disposable income on is more and better food, which in much of the world means more and better animal protein.
The world is hungry for protein, and the American Heartland is the Saudi Arabia, the de Beers, and the Fire Creek gold mine of protein, including soy protein. Kevin Scott’s soy protein comes out of the ground, goes into the hopper and then down to the silo, rides the rails from South Dakota to the Pacific Northwest or the Gulf of Mexico, is loaded into shipping containers or massive PANAMAX bulk carriers, some of which are specially outfitted for carrying grains or soybeans with their hulls sloped at 45 degrees to make stevedoring easier, and then continues on to ports around the world, Chinese ports such as those at Dalian and Nantong prominent among them. At some point along the way, the beans get ground into meal, and that meal goes into animal feed — down the gullets of Chinese chickens or, more likely, into the monogastric digestive tract of a Chinese pig. And thence into the butcher’s case at whatever the Chinese answer to Piggly-Wiggly or Whole Foods or Albertson’s is. That’s what used to happen. That’s what’s supposed to happen. Advertisement
And along came Trump.
Donald Trump is obsessed with the so-called trade deficit — a confusing term used to mislead the lightly informed about the phenomenon in question — and he has been obsessed with it since Ross Perot’s “giant sucking sound” was a thing. Trade, and not illegal immigration, is Trump’s longest-standing hobbyhorse. And when he got into Washington, he rode that hobbyhorse all over town, leaving a trail of the stuff horses leave trails of. The first thing he did was to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade alliance that would have made the United States an important member of a bloc intentionally constructed to counter Chinese dominance in the Pacific Rim. Soybean prices tanked. Trump went on to impose punitive tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, including those from the European Union and Canada. He ordered 25 percent duties on more than 800 categories of Chinese goods. After the failed trade negotiations with China, he ordered higher tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods. The Chinese retaliated with tariffs on, among other things, U.S. soybeans — which had long been the biggest U.S. export to China after aircraft.
One of the nice things about being a totalitarian police state is that you can do things like just order your soybean importers not to do business with American producers, and that is what China has quietly done. Beijing has in fact been following a clever strategy. Its tariffs on and soft boycott of U.S. soybeans drove down U.S. soybean prices in absolute terms but also relative to producers in Brazil and other nations. Beijing then authorized its buyers to pick up those cheap U.S. soybeans as part of a program to replenish long-term reserves — which means that they can be imported without payment of the 25 percent tariff. Which is to say, U.S. producers suffered the consequences of the tariff, but Chinese buyers did not have to pay higher prices. China canceled billions of dollars in planned soybean purchases. By early this year, soybean prices were near decade lows. From 2016 to 2018, the value of U.S. soybean exports to China dropped by nearly 75 percent, according to G. William Hoagland of the Bipartisan Policy Center.
The steel used to make farm equipment? That got more expensive. So did many other inputs, from fertilizer to chemicals. Advertisement
In 2013, U.S. farm income was $123 billion. This year, it is forecast to come in at less than $70 billion. President Trump is going to have a rough time of it going into rural America and asking farmers whether they are better off today than they were four years ago — the numbers do not bear that out.
And that is not a problem that stays on the farm. Sioux Falls, S.D., is a vibrant little city, one of those midwestern gems such as Kansas City and Grand Rapids that punch above their weight. It has a downtown that has the feel of being a couple of years past the apex of a pretty successful revitalization project — you know the scene: wine bars, ambitious little restaurants, those funny shops that always seem to stock three not obviously related categories of product — like scented candles, stationery, and petite little bottles of balsamic vinegar — that make you wonder how on earth they generate enough revenue to pay the rent. It is nice, and there’s a theater and people on the sidewalks and drunk young women on those sip-’n’-ride contraptions that are one part mobile cocktail party, one part tandem bicycle that look like a lawsuit just waiting to happen. But this urbane little core is built on soybeans and other farm products.
“It affects everything,” says Scott VanderWal, a fourth-generation South Dakota farmer and the vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. (The president of the American Farm Bureau Federation is a Georgia farmer who rejoices in the name “Zippy Duvall.”) VanderWal is a kind of farmer-wonk-diplomat whose office is so thoroughly out in the country that it doesn’t have an actual address. He just gives you the address to the nearest place that has one, which is a modest little house guarded by a dog that looks like it could have been an extra on Game of Thrones , and then stands outside and looks for whoever looks lost . A bad year for farmers is a bad year for a lot of people around here. “It affects ag services, obviously,” he says. “But it also affects Main Street businesses. It affects the flower shop and the furniture store. If farmers don’t have any money in our pockets, we aren’t out spending it.”
They appreciate that fact in town, too.
“We all live on farm dollars,” says a construction-supply salesman drinking an after-work Grain Belt–brand beer at a Sioux Falls bar with a sign that says there’s a two-drink minimum if you want to cash your payroll check at the bar . It’s not too far from a place with a sign straightforwardly offering “African Food and Cold Beer.” Out there in weird old red-Pontiac, leg-tattoo Middle America — which starts only a few blocks away from the cute little wine bars and the Orpheum Theater — the sense of prosperity is not what you would call evenly distributed . Sioux Falls is infested with these ghastly little hut casinos about the size and shape and smell of a not very well-run 7-Eleven, basically downscale adult daycare centers with adult video games. The farmers themselves seem to be a pretty thrifty, hustling, entrepreneurial bunch, but the edges of the local economies in communities such as this do not have a lot of room for error. Sioux Falls is nearly 90 percent white, and almost a third of the adults are college graduates. The median household income is just a little under the national average, but the cost of living is low. At the same time, Sioux Falls has a number of familiar problems, heroin and opioid use prominent among them. The number of drug-overdose deaths in the county doubled from 2017 to 2018, and it is expected to grow even more this year. The dead were overwhelmingly men, 43 years old on average.
The graybeards around here have seen what a bad farm economy really looks like. They saw it in the 1980s, when 20 percent interest rates crippled the financing-dependent agricultural sector. With farm income already taking a beating, the collateral damage from the trade war could very well have effects that will linger long after trade relations return to whatever is going to count as normal from here on out.
P eople are nice here. Not Minnesota nice — the real thing. Kevin Scott worries that the stress from his advocacy work and the frustration of being sidelined by the weather — with all the financial and professional complications that brings with it — might be making him a little bit cranky at home. His wife assures me this is not the case. “He does everything he can,” she says. “Eventually, that’s it. You do what you can, and trust God for the rest.” There’s a little sign in the kitchen, and it doesn’t say “Bless This House” or “Let Go and Let God” or anything like that. It says: “No Whining.” Scott’s son, who has recently joined him in the business, is the fifth generation of his family to work that land. His great-great-grandfather helped to found the Methodist church up the hill. It’s raining, and there are grasshoppers to worry about, and nematodes, and aphids. He’s proud to be a farmer. He says he likes producing something that’s real, that people need. No whining . Advertisement
They want to keep doing this. Kevin Scott talks about a meeting with some of his French counterparts a few years ago. They warned him not to let the United States go the way of France, in which government takes the leading role in agriculture, micromanaging farming and dictating to farmers. “What they have in France, he said, is a ‘farm museum.’ Not farming.”
The thing is, even if none of these nice people will exactly say it, that none of them really likes doing business with the Chinese. The Chinese make promises and break them. They negotiate agreements and then back out of them. And the shenanigans — you would not believe the shenanigans. Everybody knows about the Chinese penchant for stealing intellectual property, but it isn’t limited to smartphones and automotive technology. In 2013, seven Chinese agents were arrested digging up experimental seeds from Iowa cornfields, planning to ship them back to China for examination and replication. The cell targeted products from Monsanto, Dupont Pioneer, and LG Seeds. The leader of the group was employed by Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group, a private firm that received funding from the Chinese government for “science and technology” research. Crazy stuff.
Broken promises, agreements reneged on, playing fast and loose with the rules, shameless rapacity: China is a nation of Trumps, and even Trump doesn’t want to do business with them.
But it is a funny old world. The Chinese are a pain in the ass and worse, but there are a whole lot of them, and they are hungry hungry hungry, and the United States is the world’s superlative agricultural producer. We produce so much that we don’t know what to do with it all. The soybean guys have spent years traveling the world teaching hog farmers and chicken mechanics how to improve their businesses and incorporate modern agricultural practices, expanding their own market by helping producers abroad to build up their own local markets. The American Soybean Association had an office in Beijing for 25 years before a single shipload of beans went to China. This stuff takes work.
It is also an interdependent world. There’s a terrible outbreak of swine fever rampaging through Chinese pork country right now. According to official estimates, more hogs have died from the outbreak than the ginormous U.S. pork industry produces in a year, and the smart little piggies think Beijing is probably lowballing that number. As VanderWal says, that means that even if U.S.–Chinese soybean trade goes back to normal, there may not be much of a Chinese market left to sell into. Dead hogs eat no beans.
The silver lining is that with China temporarily turning up its nose at American soybeans, those soybeans are available to other markets — often at a nice introductory price that the farmers hope will go up. In some cases, ships bound for Chinese ports have been redirected while at sea. (One ship even sat outside a Chinese port for days and days as the authorities decided whether they were going to allow it to go ashore: stateless beans!) So the U.S. soybean guys have been knocking on doors and shaking hands and making friends in Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and in Europe, too. They don’t talk pork very much in the Muslim countries, but there’s chicken and beef to be fed, and the French love their rillettes de porc . Scott hopes that the U.S. soybean industry will come out of this with a more diversified market and a less China-dependent one. But getting there will be a long and difficult process — and one that’s going to be a hell of a lot harder if the soybean farmers don’t have any money to work with.
Farming is a business of relationships, VanderWal says, and it is critical that U.S. farmers be regarded as “reliable suppliers.” It took years for American farmers’ reputations to recover from the debacle of the Soviet grain embargo, a daft and botched attempt to starve the Russians into penance for invading Afghanistan cooked up by the great peacemaker Jimmy Carter and rescinded by the purported warmonger Ronald Reagan. The costs of the embargo were borne almost entirely by American farmers: The Russians just bought more grain from Argentina. VanderWal fears that the current situation may damage U.S. farmers’ reputation for being reliable suppliers. The Bernie Sanders Left is at least as hostile to trade as is the Trump administration, and if the nation as a whole is turning away from free trade, that cannot help but affect how farmers do business. VanderWal and his group were vocal supporters of the TPP and nervous about renegotiating NAFTA even though there were parts of it that they believed to be in need of reform. But the TPP is gone and it is not coming back. VanderWal believes that the best course of action is to press for bilateral agreements with the TPP countries, along with the European Union and the United Kingdom — “assuming they are ever able to actually break away from the EU.” That and the Golden Rule, he says: “Treat others how you’d want to be treated. Stick to the deal. Honor your agreements.” He thinks there’s room for reform at the World Trade Organization, and hopes that farmers can get Washington’s attention and put all those expensive diplomats to work on new trade deals.

And that includes, ultimately, a deal with China, too. There is not really any way around it. And, in the end, a way around that would not be desirable, anyway. The reality is that the world is interdependent, and our institutions should be in accord with that reality.
Farmers in large part are paying the price for somebody else’s crusade. This is really not their fight. They’re farmers. They don’t do drama and hysterics and Sturm und Drang : They do business . VanderWal said as much in congressional testimony not long ago: “Farmers are patriots. We were willing to step up and take one for the team. But, at some point . . .”
What’s really annoying to farmers is that none of this is really about them. This is about BMWs and Toyotas and steel and Boeing and the fact that Americans don’t like seeing “Made in China” on socks and flipflops they buy at Walmart because we are losing our position of worldwide sock and flipflop dominance, of front-runner status in the flipflop race, whatever. “For years, this was a nonpartisan issue,” VanderWal says. “I didn’t like Bill Clinton very much, but he did a fine job on trade. Obama worked on trade. The president is right about the theft of intellectual property, and we do broadly support what the president is trying to do.”
But is it getting done? VanderWal smiles. “The president doesn’t respond well to criticism.”
B ack at the Scott farm, there’s an Eisenhower-era Farmall 300 tractor waiting for a new coat of red paint and a restoration. Kevin Scott’s office is full of family pictures, including the old timers as little children, back in the 1920s and 1930s, posing in front of old-timey tractors — and pictures of the same men, grown old, posing in front of more modern farm machinery. We talk on a Wednesday. He’s expecting another grandchild on Monday. Six children of his own — reliable producers, indeed: independent, cheerful, useful.
No whining.
These guys aren’t a bunch of Elmers out in the wilderness scratching a living out of the soil. “The soil is our factory ,” Scott says, and his business is capital-intensive, high-tech, and demanding. And he very well could be managing a factory or a law firm or a hedge fund or another kind of business. These are smart guys, and more than a few of them are in fact managing other businesses, too: They’re on the boards of banks and insurance companies, they’re involved in real estate, this and that. But they love farming. They love the life and their communities, the way farming and family fit together. They are enthusiasts. One of them tells an old joke about the farmer who wins the lottery and says that he plans to just keep on farming until the money’s all gone."
Timothy Snyder on Democracy and Its Enemies | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/big-questions-with-a-big-prof/,"June 6, 2019 10:22 AM Timothy Snyder (Wikimedia)
Timothy Snyder is a historian, a professor at Yale. He works on Eastern Europe, Russia, the Holocaust, and still other areas of concern, or interest. He spends a lot of time thinking about democracy and its foes. I have done a Q&A podcast with him, here .
I used to talk with Bernard Lewis about his “moment.” (The late, great Lewis was a scholar of the Middle East.) After 9/11, everyone wanted to talk with him. Everyone wanted to know what he knew. To a degree, people today want to know what Snyder knows. “History has come back with a vengeance,” you hear. Advertisement Advertisement
Yes, and it never really leaves.
Among Tim Snyder’s books are Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin ; On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century ; and The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America . A reader may not like everything in these books (and a listener may not like everything in the podcast we’ve done). But all of us can learn from Snyder — a lot.
In the new Q&A , we talk about his growing up in Ohio. And his education at Brown and Oxford. And his choice of Eastern Europe as an object of study. Advertisement
He did not set out to be a historian of Eastern Europe. He thought he would learn Russian, get a law degree, and become an arms controller. But the Soviet empire crumbled and Eastern Europe had a chance to be reborn, it seemed. Young Snyder wanted to run around the region, learn the languages, and find out all he could. Advertisement
In our podcast, we talk about patriotism and nationalism, as everyone is. What is the difference between the two? What does the difference matter? Furthermore, some people say that there can be “illiberal democracy.” Can there be? Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Naturally, we get into Europe and Putin. Many nationalist-populist parties in Europe are allies of Putin. Some have formal friendship-and-cooperation agreements with him.
Among the many interesting points that Snyder makes is this: The enemies of liberal democracy in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s were awful people, of course: Nazis and Communists. But they had ideas. Visions and goals. They wanted to shape the world in particular ways. Advertisement
Today, enemies of liberal democracy tend not to have ideas, visions, or goals. They just want to “burn it down.” They are nihilists and destroyers. Advertisement
Later this month, the European Games are being held in Belarus, which I think is an outrage. Belarus is a dictatorship. For years, Alexander Lukashenko has been called “the last dictator in Europe.”
Snyder makes a wry remark: It might turn out that Lukashenko was merely ahead of the curve.
The professor is superb on the subject of Putin — absolutely superb. He explains him in historical terms and yet other ones. Putin is a product of the Soviet system, for sure, says Snyder. But he is a product of a particular time in Soviet history: the 1970s. People had stopped believing in anything, including Communism. They were just cynical. “Might makes right”; “money makes might”; etc.
Well, one thing they did believe: Everyone was out to get them.
The idea took hold that there was no truth. The very idea of truth was laughable. Snyder cites a recent book, by Peter Pomerantsev: Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia . I myself think of an article by Sir Roger Scruton, from June 2017, on the “post-truth age.” Let me quote a paragraph:
The concept of truth has been the victim of massive cyber-attacks in recent decades, and it has not yet recovered. The most recent attack has come from social media, which have turned the Internet into one great seething cauldron of opinions, most of them anonymous, in which every kind of malice and fantasy swamps the still small voice of humanity and truth.
Snyder says that, once you destroy belief in truth — even the simple idea that some things are true and some things are not — you destroy liberal democracy, whose institutions depend heavily on trust."
Loneliness in America is Caused by Our Broken Culture | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/loneliness-in-america-is-caused-by-our-broken-culture/,"June 6, 2019 9:18 AM (Photo: Agnieszkamarcinska/Dreamstime) It’s the 75th anniversary of D-Day. There are many ways to remember; one of my first lessons about it came from a Peanuts special, What Have We Learned, Charlie Brown? It features a haunting but age-appropriate sequence that is unlike any other in any other children’s programming. How Do We Fix a Lonely Culture? Earlier this week, a contributor to the NRPlus Facebook page — if you joined, I wouldn’t have to tell you about these things — lamented frustration that whatever conservatives had won in the courtroom and legal battles, “court wins haven’t translated to actual culture wins.” I responded by asking what would qualify as “actual culture wins.” The release of more movies the writer liked, or higher box-office revenues? Fewer movies or television shows he didn’t like? The former is possible, the latter is controlled by a wide variety of factors, from the decision-makers at studios, the career ambitions of stars, the impulses of screenwriters, the tastes of audiences, and even just what else is playing at the movie theater that weekend. I remember some Christian-right pastor declaring that Caitlyn Jenner being on the cover of Vanity Fair represented some awful cultural turning point, and I thought, the cover of Vanity Fair always featured some lefty celebrity doing something allegedly provocative . (Am I the only one who remembers naked and pregnant Demi Moore? That was back in 1991!) If that’s our measuring stick for “culture” then we’ve always lost. There’s never going to be a day when we wake up and see something conservative on the cover of Vanity Fair . So why have we decided that that is the measuring stick we’re going to use? And why would celebrities who want attention, doing something cynically provocative, outrank, say, the declining abortion rate in our assessment of cultural health? But just because the terms of the lament about cultural defeat were frustratingly vague, it doesn’t mean I don’t sometimes share the sentiment. The cultural power of celebrities — or more specifically, the average American’s misplaced trust in the judgment of people who they recognize from being on television or in the movies or hearing their music — is profoundly disturbing. I suspect that the process of becoming a celebrity is almost inherently psychologically damaging. They enjoy the cheers and adoration of large crowds but have difficulty developing and sustaining real behind-the-scenes relationships. Their fans love the characters they play, sometimes oblivious to the fact that the actor is not the character. Most of them are constantly evaluated based upon their appearance by strangers, developing all kinds of obsessions and disorders and frequently going under the knife to preserve their youthful looks. Their ideas for maintaining good health would give the American Medical Association nightmares. Addictions flourish and are almost endlessly enabled. Almost everyone they encounter wants something from them — an autograph, a picture, sex, to read a script, to play a role, or to offer help breaking into the business. And this is before we get to the point that their world lets the likes of Harvey Weinstein thrive and flourish. Most of the people who create our popular culture are constantly marinating in a culture of exploitation, greed, envy, objectification, abuse, hedonistic excess, and runaway lust of every kind. It’s amazing any of them come out of the process of becoming famous with their head on straight. And yet so many of our fellow countrymen are endlessly fascinated with the inmates of the asylum. A lot of our cultural problems are issues with no clear government or policy solution. But they represent huge problems nonetheless. The cultural choice to revere suicide, instead of discouraging it, in the Netherlands discussed yesterday, is one of them . Another, discussed at length by Kay Hymowitz in City Journal this morning is the cultural phenomenon of loneliness — and how it likely ties into a cultural choice to end the old prioritization of the family unit: The loneliness thesis taps into a widespread intuition of something true and real and grave. Foundering social trust, collapsing heartland communities, an opioid epidemic, and rising numbers of “deaths of despair” suggest a profound, collective discontent. It’s worth mapping out one major cause that is simultaneously so obvious and so uncomfortable that loneliness observers tend to mention it only in passing. I’m talking, of course, about family breakdown. At this point, the consequences of family volatility are an evergreen topic when it comes to children; this remains the subject of countless papers and conferences. Now, we should take account of how deeply the changes in family life of the past 50-odd years are intertwined with the flagging well-being of so many adults and communities… While the loosening of traditional rules gave women freedom to leave violent or cruel husbands, it also changed the cultural environment for couples trying to weather less dangerous stresses and disappointments, including a pink slip. Lower-income men and women are bound to have more financial anxieties, more work accidents, and more broken-down cars and evictions, and they lack the funds for Disneyland vacations, massages, and psychotherapists that might take some of the edge off a struggling marriage. And they see few, if any, long-term married couples who could offer a successful model. With single parenthood and cohabitation both on the lifestyle menu, what they see instead is an easy out. When so many marriages melt into thin air, lower-income kin networks, a source of job connections, child care, and family meals, attenuate as well. Your mother’s sister’s husband—your uncle by marriage—might give you a tip about a job opening at a local machine shop; an uncle separated from your aunt and living with a girlfriend with her own kids in the next town over, maybe not. Communities flush with fatherless households tend to be troubled. In his landmark study of county-level social mobility, economist Raj Chetty discovered that places thick with married-couple families created more opportunity for kids, regardless of whether they were living in a married or single-parent household; places with large numbers of single-parent homes, on the other hand, pulled kids down—including those living with married parents. It’s hard to imagine more concrete evidence of the truth of the old cliché that family is the building block of society. Are we likely to fix this by changing laws? It’s unlikely that many Americans would want to dramatically change divorce laws, although we may prefer to encourage counseling and trial separations attempted before finalizing the legal dissolution of a marriage. At heart, the question is how you get people to make better and more responsible choices — to not have children before they’re ready, to get married and try to make the marriage work when times get hard, and to embrace the responsibilities of parenthood instead of running from them. Perhaps we need to reemphasize the benefits of those right choices. ( Ahem . Only five left in stock, apparently.) Nancy Pelosi: Trump Should Be in Prison . . . But Please Don’t Impeach Him "
'Clarence Thomas & the Lost Constitution' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dan Mclaughlin,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/24/clarence-thomass-quest-to-recover-the-lost-constitution/,"June 6, 2019 10:16 AM Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas in Washington, D.C., June 1, 2017 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Clarence Thomas and the Lost Constitution , by Myron Magnet (Encounter, 184 pp., $23.99)
P icture Clarence Thomas as a legal Indiana Jones, dodging slings and arrows to rescue a valuable and powerful relic from the wrong hands after it fell into undeserved obscurity. That’s the thesis of Myron Magnet’s new book. Magnet, a longtime editor of City Journal , isn’t himself a lawyer, though he is at ease explaining legal arguments for non-lawyers. So this isn’t weighty legal scholarship or a thorough biography. It is, rather, a potboiler, briskly surveying how our founding charter went missing, what impelled Justice Thomas to go looking for it, and what he unearthed. At the end of the journey, the reader will be forgiven for suspecting that the original Constitution will nonetheless be consigned to a dusty corner of a government archive while the capital’s top men insist they can do better without it. Advertisement
Today’s federal government diverges so sharply from its original design that Magnet compares it to a parasite devouring its host. When he asks, “Who killed the Constitution?” he identifies not one culprit but three. The preference of Woodrow Wilson and his New Deal successors for bureaucratic experts over popular sovereignty was, in Thomas’s words, the “wrong turn” that broke the document’s original structure; racist southern resistance deformed the post–Civil War amendments; and the liberal Warren Court’s overreaching activism upset the federal–state balance and cut the courts adrift from written law. (Executive power gets relatively little attention.) Magnet ties each of these topics to themes in Justice Thomas’s speeches, writings, jurisprudence, and biography. Many of the freshest parts of the book come from Thomas’s words away from the bench.
Magnet surveys the causes of today’s dysfunctions. These include a runaway reading of the interstate-commerce power, which lets Congress regulate a plant that never leaves the property on which it is grown; administrative agencies that write their own laws and flagrantly rewrite the ones Congress sends them; and judges who insert the courts into areas such as regulation of abortion based on unwritten “constitutional” rules while cavalierly disregarding explicit, written limitations on the government’s power to seize private property, restrict political speech, and disarm citizens. The underlying culprit in each case is the same: “experts” who think they know better and are impatient with written limits. Advertisement
Magnet presents paternalism, condescension, and a spirit of victimization as Thomas’s nemeses. He pulls no punches about the sneering critics along Thomas’s path from Pinpoint, Ga., to the Court, such as a fellow federal judge who snarked that no senator who voted to confirm Thomas would have hired him as his lawyer. Magnet summarizes the story Thomas himself told in his 2007 memoir, My Grandfather’s Son , starting with the grandfather who instilled in Thomas his work ethic and sense of inherent dignity and self-reliance: “My grandfather was no victim and he didn’t send me to school to become one.” Magnet charts Thomas’s drift into and out of black radicalism in the tumult of the late 1960s and how influences such as Leo Strauss, Frederick Douglass, and Thomas Sowell led him to understand that “the maxims and example of his grandfather . . . were conservatism.”
The searing experience of the Anita Hill hearings is covered, not in dispassionate forensic detail but rather with a polemical recounting of the reasons Thomas’s partisans found Hill’s account so implausible. It won’t be a satisfying rebuttal for those inclined to believe Hill, but, like any good adventure movie, it sets the tone for the main plotline: This is a man whose stubborn devotion to the original, written Constitution frightened powerful interests who would stop at nothing to take him down. Joe Biden appears here as he did in Thomas’s memoir: the two-faced ringmaster of a plot to assassinate Thomas’s character. The public, as the hearings unfolded, agreed: Polls showed more voters believed Thomas than believed Hill, and voters favored his confirmation by a two-to-one margin. Yet Biden today is broiled by the left wing of his party for going too easy on Thomas and too hard on Hill. Biden, for his part, now seeks to minimize his role, saying that he only wishes he could have done something about the hearings he chaired. Advertisement Advertisement
Magnet overstates his case by identifying the Thomas–Hill hearings, rather than the 1987 fight over Robert Bork, as the first open battle over these stakes. But he illustrates the importance of Thomas’s character and upbringing in resisting the temptation to stray from his quest. Many past departures from the Constitution, from “separate but equal” to gun control and campaign-finance restrictions, were the handiwork of segregationists. One of them, Woodrow Wilson, coined the idea of a “living Constitution” as a “Darwinian” exercise in the survival of the strong, allowing for rule by the better class of people. Advertisement
Each betrayal of the written Constitution was enabled by Republican-appointed justices who abandoned the path Thomas retraced. Magnet dwells on Thomas’s argument in McDonald v. City of Chicago for restoring the 14th Amendment’s privileges-and-immunities clause as the charter of fundamental individual rights against the states. That bulwark was broken by Lincoln and Grant appointees by 5–4 votes in the Slaughter-House Cases and United States v. Cruikshank . Owen Roberts, a Hoover appointee, gave the New Deal the “switch in time” fifth vote to rewrite the commerce clause. Earl Warren and William Brennan were Eisenhower appointees, Harry Blackmun (author of Roe v. Wade ) a Nixon appointee, Anthony Kennedy a Reagan appointee. And so on. Advertisement
Thomas, for his part, says that living under Jim Crow taught him to “think about the use and misuse of government power.” Richard Brookhiser calls Lincoln “the Founders’ son”; Magnet ventures that “as Thomas works to fulfill Lincoln’s task of extending the inalienable rights of the Declaration of Independence to all Americans, . . . it’s not fanciful to think of the justice as the founders’ grandson.” A living Constitution could be the British, Burkean model of trial by experience. But it is not ours; our colonial experience is one reason our rights are written down, and our history on race is proof they should be. Advertisement Advertisement
Given Magnet’s career in urban-policy reform, he focuses on “how the Court sabotaged the order-keeping authority of two essential public institutions, the police and the public schools.” In 1994, Magnet’s first year helming City Journal and Rudy Giuliani’s first as New York’s revolutionary mayor, he published an essay by Justice Thomas on how the “rights revolution” had hamstrung both the cops and school discipline. The Giuliani years, however, suggest that cops can retake the streets even under those rules.
Magnet’s book goes astray when he parts company with his subject. For example, he argues that the Supreme Court’s landmark school-desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education , “floated utterly free from the Constitution, which gives the federal government no authority over education of any kind.” It is one thing to argue that Brown encouraged a spirit of expansive judicial activism that often went awry in the years that followed it. Magnet is also on solid ground critiquing Brown ’s reliance on social science instead of constitutional text and history. Justice Thomas argues that the Brown Court erred by not embracing the first Justice Harlan’s dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson . Harlan read the 14th Amendment to require that the law be color-blind and to outlaw distinctions on the basis of race. And there is some intellectually re-spectable support for questioning whether the amendment’s phrase “protection of the laws” was really intended, in 1866, to apply to all public benefits, including schooling. Advertisement
But the charge that constitutional originalists such as Justice Thomas would have upheld school segregation is perhaps the most common line of attack on the whole originalist project. As such, it should not lightly be raised without the proper context. In fact, unmentioned by Magnet, there is a significant body of originalist scholarship (including Michael McConnell’s influential law-review articles in the 1990s) arguing that a proper reading of the history would lead by a different path to the same result in Brown . That outcome flows logically from what Justice Harlan, within living memory of the amendment’s passage, argued in Plessy . More to the point, as Magnet notes, Justice Thomas has frequently followed Harlan’s line and called for the Court to use it to “validate the Brown decision.” "
Do We Still Want Free Speech? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/24/do-we-still-want-free-speech/,"June 6, 2019 10:41 AM An American flag flies at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., January 20, 2019. (Al Drago/Reuters) The culture is moving dangerously away from the First Amendment
W ithin the legal realm, freedom of speech has never been better protected in the United States. It was not better protected last year; it was not better protected a half century ago; it was not better protected in the Gilded Age or in the Era of Good Feelings or during the Cold War or at the Founding itself. Whatever else may be wrong with their constitutional order, today’s Americans are living through a Golden Age of free expression for which there is no historical counterpart at home or abroad. That pathetic whine you hear sometimes, that “America is the only country in which . . . ,” is particularly accurate when it comes to free speech. In 2019, America is an outlier. Advertisement Advertisement
Pick a period of American history at random and you will discover that things were worse for the dissenters. Only a handful of years passed between the First Amendment’s being ratified by the Founders and its being diluted by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In the antebellum period, many southern states attempted to perpetuate slavery by rendering it illegal for their residents to criticize the institution — as, for a while, did the House of Representatives — and, after the Civil War brought emancipation, those states passed similar laws in order to protect segregation. During the First World War, Woodrow Wilson took his open disdain for the Constitution to its logical conclusion, began imprisoning critics of his administration, and was backed repeatedly in his attempt by the Supreme Court. And so on, and so forth. Plenty of red ink has stained America’s history.
A century ago, it was illegal to protest too vigorously against American involvement in war. The origin of the phrase “You can’t shout fire in a crowded theater” — a slogan that is trotted out without comprehension or care by every mediocrity in the United States — is a 1919 Supreme Court case, Schenck v. United States , in which the majority upheld the conviction of a Jewish, socialist, Russian immigrant who had handed out leaflets written in Yiddish encouraging Americans to decline to enlist in the armed forces. Despite the obviously political nature of Schenck’s speech, the Supreme Court defended his imprisonment on the grounds that the survival of the United States was so acutely threatened by the existence of an incestuous land war three and a half thousand miles away (the “fire” in the analogy) that his actions amounted to an undermining of national security. As was the case for others who were imprisoned under the same law — including, most famously, the socialist Eugene Debs — the First Amendment provided no shelter against retribution, and wouldn’t until the 1960s, at which point the Supreme Court remembered why it had been included in the Constitution in the first instance and effected a restoration. Advertisement
The story of that restoration is a happily bipartisan one — especially today. Eight of the current Supreme Court justices are unfailingly on board with the broadest protections of free expression, and one, Samuel Alito, plays ball almost all of the time. Better still, the content of the speech under consideration tends to be wholly irrelevant to the outcome of the case. For once, the factional fights that have stained almost everything else in American life have been kept outside of our jurisprudence. Advertisement
There is a reason that our would-be arbiters of taste spend so much time stupidly insisting that “hate speech isn’t free speech,” and that is that they know that in America it is . They know that there is no such legal category as “hate speech” in the United States; they know that the Court reaffirmed this as recently as last year; and they know that it did so 9–0, with even their favorite justices enthusiastically joining the opinion. They know, that is, that the champions of free inquiry and individual rights are winning their fight against those who see our national debates superintended by powerful men with bayonets, and that they, as would-be censors, have lost more comprehensively than any would-be censors have lost in the entire history of the world. Advertisement
Which would be terrific if, on the cultural front, we weren’t facing a catastrophe. Advertisement
There is an ugly paradox at play here: that, at the very same time that we have been making enormous advances in the courts, a whole host of America’s private institutions have been rendering it more difficult — and more costly — to speak freely. This paradox should seriously temper our triumphalism, for in the long run, a society that has a bulletproof legal right to speak but that has no meaningful culture of free speech will end up, in practice, without either. Advertisement
There are two reasons for this. The first is that, for most people, the bigger threat to speech comes not from the government, which tends to censor capriciously, but from their employer, from their peers, or, increasingly, from the Internet. It won’t matter much that Ruth Bader Ginsburg is happy to defend the legal speech rights of literal neo-Nazis or that Clarence Thomas is comfortable protecting the right of Klansmen to say appalling things about African Americans if citizens who hold innocuous, and even mainstream, views are pilloried for departing even marginally from the present consensus. Conservatives focus a great deal on the indignity of professional speakers’ being harried off college campuses before they have been able to address the crowd — and, within reason, we should — but we focus much less on what this bad habit does to everyone else . As a rule, being shouted down is good for the career of a public figure because it makes him look like a martyr. For his audience, by contrast, it is disastrous, not only because it deprives them of the chance to hear other ideas, but because it makes them less likely to speak up themselves. If Ben Shapiro can’t talk about politics at a university, how can they ? Advertisement
The second reason is that culture eventually becomes politics, and the private eventually becomes the public. A certain portion of Americans believe to their core that “free speech” is a euphemism for “intolerance”; that one must filter all individual-liberty claims through the latest iteration of the hierarchy of grievances; and even that the First Amendment represents some sort of clever plot to keep marginalized people down. That this gets the history of speech entirely backward — ask the rebel colonists, the abolitionists, and the NAACP whether they benefited or suffered from free speech — is beside the point. What matters is that it has become fashionable as an idea, that it is spreading, and that it is being enforced voluntarily within the towering heights of American culture by people who believe that they are the rebels and that the free-speech crowd is the Man. Eventually, these views will have consequences. Like the rest of us, judges die, and besides, the courts are ultimately accountable to Congress and to the presidency. If we fail to correct course, the attitudes we associate with Berkeley will soon seep into Washington, and, after a while, they will become the law. Advertisement
I had hoped that, with the election of Donald Trump, we might see a reversal in attitudes. If Trump is indeed the fascist that the Resistance makes him out to be, then one would expect to see those who are scared of him backing off from the idea that the government should have more power to prosecute dissenters. Likewise, given the claims made by the Black Lives Matter movement and its allies, one might have imagined that the idea of empowering cops to make decisions as to who should be arrested for speaking and who should be left alone would be an unpopular one. But, alas, it’s not. After the disaster at Charlottesville, the ACLU admirably defended the speech and marching rights of a bunch of people whom it loathed, and it explained its willingness to do so on the grounds that to defend the rights of one is to defend the rights of all. The response? Outrage, anger, and the charge that the ALCU was “siding with fascism.” How myopic our politics can be. Advertisement
It may not always look like it, but it seems to me that the root problem with which we are dealing here is insecurity . Our would-be censors may look like authoritarians — and, indeed, their solutions may be authoritarian in nature — but what is ultimately driving them is a total lack of faith in themselves and in other people.
When I was at Oxford, the Oxford Union debating society invited the Holocaust-denying historian David Irving and the leader of the disgraceful British National Party, a rather silly little fascist named Nick Griffin. Within days, the invitations had become national news. Within a week, they had been rescinded — not least because people wearing balaclavas and unironically shouting “No free speech for fascists” were blocking the entrance to the building. Advertisement
It is true, of course, that the Union was under no obligation to give a platform to these people — although I’d personally have loved to watch the debate, given how badly they tend to perform under pressure. But it is also true that the case that was successfully marshaled against the invitation was incompatible with the presumptions that undergird the Oxford Union (an institution that Harold Macmillan described as “the last bastion of free speech in the Western world”). That case, in essence, was that Irving and Griffin should not be invited lest they poison the minds of the students — a suggestion that is so patronizing and so condescending as to be beyond parody. What, I wonder, did the committee think was going to happen to the 450 students in attendance if they were subjected to Irving and Griffin’s nonsense for a few minutes? Did they think they were all going to goosestep out of the chamber?"

I am looking at a postcard I once received from John Updike as I contemplate Peter Tonguette’s “Updike’s Steady Vision” (May 20). (By the way, will anyone ever again receive a missive signed on paper by an author?)
Mr. Tonguette capably examines the Library of America’s volume containing Updike’s first four novels and rightly questions some of the quirks of his early writing. But the review leaves the reader with an unbalanced and somewhat unfair impression of Mr. Updike, focusing on the growing pains of his early career (“written in a windy, pretentious style”) and including such statements as “He thought of himself as a man of the Left.”
I can’t answer for how John Updike thought of himself, but I can say, after reading and teaching his novels for several decades, that he was without question one of our country’s most conservative writers of fiction, and its best. He questions the views and the avatars of the Left and admires conservative ideas, in novel after novel, and it is likely that he was denied the Nobel Prize because of this (as he guessed), while lesser but more progressive talents received it.
As the reviewer observes, Updike took “the measure of the world as it really was.” Himself a painter, he once observed that the most important painter of the 20th century was Norman Rockwell, because he followed the tradition of the masters in representing life as it was lived in his own time. How unwoke is that? And it would seem that Updike meant to do the same thing in his writing.
Mr. Tonguette’s focus was constrained by the material he reviewed, but I hope that someday National Review will publish a thoughtful look at Updike’s worthy accomplishments and his contributions to the conservative habit of mind.
America has had relatively few conservative writers — T. S. Eliot comes to mind — and we should celebrate the great ones we have had, such as John Updike. Dean Bevan Baker University Baldwin City, Kan.
Peter Tonguette responds : I agree with Mr. Bevan’s characterization of John Updike as one of the great contemporary conservative writers. That is why I roamed beyond the books contained in the Library of America’s collection and referenced Updike’s defense of the nation’s leaders during the Vietnam War and his comments on the mortgage crisis, neither of which renders him a bleeding-heart liberal. And I focused on Updike’s representation of “the world as it really was” for the same reason: I agree that looking at the world realistically is a conservative impulse. "
Jim Sciutto’s Quiet Indictment of the Obama Administration - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/jim-sciuttos-quiet-indictment-of-the-obama-administration/,"By Jim Geraghty June 6, 2019 3:48 PM CNN’s Jake Tapper, Evan Perez, and Jim Sciutto accept the Merriman Smith Award from ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner in Washington, D.C., April 28, 2018. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) His new book methodically and scathingly dissects his former bosses’ policies toward Russia and China.
A t the end of 2011, Jim Sciutto moved to Beijing to become chief of staff and senior policy adviser to U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke, after spending a decade as ABC News senior foreign correspondent. After his two-year stint in China, Sciutto returned to the world of journalism and was named CNN’s chief national-security correspondent. This move from a position in the Obama administration to a major cable-news organization led to familiar complaints that Sciutto was biased, and that he would be unlikely to assess his former colleagues and bosses fairly.
But anyone who wanted Sciutto’s new book, The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America , to offer a flattering portrait of the Obama administration will be deeply disappointed. In fact, anecdote by anecdote, chapter by chapter, Sciutto assembles a stinging indictment. (He’s also not all that impressed with most of the Trump administration’s moves, although he credits it for “aggressively calling out Chinese theft of U.S. secrets.”)
It’s easy to forget just how stubbornly naïve the Obama administration could be in its dealings, particularly with Russia. It began with Hillary Clinton’s infamous “reset button” ceremony with Russian foreign minister Sergi Lavrov and continued with the president’s 2012 debate comment that “the 1980s are now calling to get their foreign policy back, because the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.” Obama declared at the G-7 summit in 2014 that Russia was a “regional power” and that its territorial ambitions “belonged in the 19th century.” But Obama’s 21st-century worldview had no effective response to those ambitions.
The Shadow War isn’t merely Sciutto’s personal assessment. Many of the most stinging passages quote Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2013 to 2016. Pyatt describes a meeting early in his time in that post with European Union official Stefan Rule during a conference in Yalta, Crimea: “It was the first time I had ever met him, and he came on very, very strongly and said basically, ‘Where the hell are the Americans? Don’t you realize that there is a great struggle that’s going on right now to define the future of the European periphery? We need an engaged America.’”
Sciutto writes, “U.S. and European diplomats and policymakers would persist in mirror-imaging their Russian counterparts, while Putin and his lieutenants were playing by very different rules.”
Pyatt also described the Obama administration as being excruciatingly slow-footed in its response to Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 being shot down by Russian forces in Ukraine:
The day after the MH17 crash, Pyatt recalls a contentious videoconference with Obama administration officials in Washington.
“That was one of the darkest days of my time in Ukraine,” said Ambassador Pyatt. “I remember one of my Washington colleagues saying something along the lines of, ‘we have to be very careful not to jump to conclusions.’
That answer was too much for Ambassador Pyatt to take.
“It was one of my more unguarded moments because I remember saying very clearly, ‘you say we don’t know what happened, but we do know. We do know that Russia is responsible, that there were no Ukrainian missiles of this class in the region, and one way or another, the Kremlin is responsible for the deaths of three hundred people.’”
Even after Russia invaded and occupied Crimea, the Obama administration dithered and completely underestimated Russia’s intention to keep Crimea:
“Kerry was still talking in terms of ‘Russia must not overstep,’” said Pyatt. “And it was while they were already running the place.
Inside the Obama administration, discussions focused on providing Moscow with a diplomatic ‘off-ramp’ to defuse the crisis and eventually exit Crimea in a face-saving way. . . “The Russian objective was not to win the argument,” Pyatt emphasized. “It was to win a war.”
It was a fight that the Obama administration wasn’t interested in having, or even acknowledging. Pyatt tells Sciutto in another passage, “When I arrived in Kiev, my instructions were, Europe is in the lead.” Confronted with the Crimean takeover, Obama lamely attempted to spin it as some sort of moral victory: “The fact that Russia felt it had to go in militarily and lay bare these violations of international law indicates less influence, not more.”
The Obama approach to China followed a familiar pattern. China violated international law by constructing artificial islands in disputed waters, but Obama accepted Chinese assurances of their good intentions:
Increasingly, however, China’s man-made islands were hosting full-fledged military operations. In May 2018, the United States detected the deployment of anti-ship and antiaircraft missiles on three of the islands during Chinese military exercises. The missiles form an integral part of China’s anti-access, area-denial strategy, which is itself designed with the United States in mind. Beijing’s blunt message to Washington appeared to be: We are prepared to make these waters unsafe for U.S. warships. President Xi’s promise to President Obama in 2015 not to militarize the islands had become meaningless.
A disturbing pattern keeps reappearing: “Obama would later accept Chinese assurances that Beijing would dial back its cyber-theft of U.S. corporate secrets, malicious activity that remains rampant and aggressive today.
Sciutto offers a tough assessment of his former colleagues in the State Department, using a dispute between China and its neighbors over the Scarborough Shoal as an example:
Inside the embassy, I remember concern but not urgency. U.S. officials believed that China could be coaxed into reversing course — allowing the Philippines’ fishing boats back into the lagoon and, more important, ending its attempt to take more formal possession of the shoal. This was a consistent pattern inside the State Department and the Obama administration at the time. Negotiation will work. China can be convinced. Let’s not overreact. This approach applied to a whole host of issues and disputes between Washington and Beijing, including China’s cyber activities against the U.S. government and private sector. And yet even as this approach often failed to change Chinese behavior, it persisted.
The dispute about the Scarborough Shoal went to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague, where the tribunal ruled in favor of the Philippines and thoroughly rebuked China. But with no real enforcement, nothing changed. Scarborough Shoal remains under Chinese control. The international institutions so frequently touted by the Obama administration proved useless in the face of aggression.
There’s another lesson that isn’t in the pages of Sciutto’s book but seems worth mentioning: If the Obama administration was so persistently naïve and so willfully blind to risks and threats emerging from Russia and China, why would we think the same foreign-policy minds, guided by the same philosophies and worldviews, would have a more correct assessment of Iran and its nuclear ambitions? Or the Syrian civil war? Or North Korea?
For eight years, President Obama’s foreign-policy approach was rarely out of step with the beliefs of the rest of his party. Internal disagreements with Hillary Clinton or Robert Gates or John Kerry occurred intermittently but rarely became disruptive or discussed too openly. Until Russia’s hacking and disinformation during the 2016 election became clear, most members of his party thought Obama and his team managed relations with Russia just fine – and they had a similar faith in his administration’s nonconfrontational and acquiescent approach to China.
Now that we know the results of that sort of approach to foreign policy, why would we ever go back? Jim Geraghty is the senior political correspondent of National Review . @jimgeraghty "
Researchers Say Dodgeball Teaches Kids ‘Oppression’ | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Katherine Timpf,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/researchers-claim-dodgeball-teaches-kids-oppression/,"Follow Katherine Timpf on Twitter June 6, 2019 5:24 PM Players at the Epic Pro Dodgeball event at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Kissimmee, Fla., January 23, 2019. (Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports) There’s a such thing as thinking about something so much that you lose track of how simple it really is.
R esearchers are arguing that dodgeball is not just a harmless children’s game, but actually a sinister activity that teaches them “oppression.”
According to an article in the National Post , three “education theorists” will give a presentation at the upcoming Canadian Society for the Study of Education meeting in Vancouver arguing that the game of dodgeball is “miseducative” — because it basically makes kids learn that they should be oppressing weaker people or something.
Joy Butler, professor of curriculum and pedagogy at the University of British Columbia, said in an abstract of the presentation:
As we consider the potential of physical education to empower students by engaging them in critical and democratic practices, we conclude that the hidden curriculum offered by dodgeball is antithetical to this project, even when it reflects the choices of the strongest and most agile students.
According to Butler, dodgeball “reinforces the five faces of oppression.” These were defined by the late University of Chicago social and political theorist Iris Marion Young. Butler’s abstract identifies three of those “faces” as “marginalization, powerlessness, and helplessness of those perceived as weaker individuals through the exercise of violence and dominance by those who are considered more powerful” — and, according to the Post , Young “also includes exploitation and cultural domination.”
My reaction to all of this? Honestly, it’s so stupid that I don’t even know where to start.
When I was a kid, I really enjoyed dodgeball — and not for the reason that you might think. I didn’t enjoy it because I was good at it, because I was never good at any sort of athletic activity. No . . . I enjoyed it because it was the only activity where I got to sit around and relax because I wasn’t good at it. Honestly, dodgeball days were like a dream. I used to get hit by the ball (often even on purpose) and then get to just chill on the sidelines for a while. It was awesome. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
What’s more, at no point during any of this did I start to feel like I was somehow inferior or “powerless” because other kids were better at hitting people with a ball than I was. I never saw any of the kids who were good at it become violent or domineering in any way. Yes: Believe it or not, these kids were actually able to be good at and enjoy dodgeball, without becoming people who felt like it was acceptable or cool to “oppress” others. Amazing!
I know that these researchers would probably say that I just don’t get it, that they’re just smarter than I am, that I just haven’t thought about it enough or learned enough. The truth is, though, there’s a such thing as thinking about something so much that you lose track of how simple it really is in reality. Too much thinking can often make things more complicated than they really are, and this is definitely an example of that. Advertisement"
This Day June 7 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/this-day-in-liberal-judicial-activism-june-7-2/,"June 7, 2019 8:00 AM Supreme Court Justice William Douglas
1965 — Griswold v. Connecticut arose when the executive director of Planned Parenthood of Connecticut prescribed a contraceptive device for a married woman and contrived to get himself arrested for violation of an 1879 state law against use of contraceptives— a law that had never been enforced .
In his majority opinion declaring a constitutional right for married persons to use contraceptives, Justice William O. Douglas infamously asserts that “specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance” and that “[v]arious [of these] guarantees create zones of privacy”—all of which, of course, it is the Court’s power and duty to discern. Advertisement Advertisement
Douglas then cites six cases that supposedly “bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.” In fact, those cases did no such thing. (One case, for example, held merely that a homeowner’s conviction for resisting an inspection of his rat-infested home did not violate due process.) Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Douglas purports to confine his ruling to the marital relationship: “We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights—older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.” That this celebration of marriage would come from Douglas, who, in the year he penned it, was divorcing his third wife (after two years of marriage) and marrying his fourth, might suggest that it shouldn’t be taken seriously. The Court’s ruling seven years later in Eisenstadt v. Baird (see This Day for March 22 , 1972) would confirm that sense.
1993 —New Jersey legal journals report that federal district judge H. Lee Sarokin personally accepts from the New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution the “C. Everett Koop Award for significant achievement toward creating a smokefree society.” Remarkably, Sarokin receives the award for his handling of a personal-injury action against cigarette manufacturers—the very matter (see This Day for February 6 , 1992) in which the Third Circuit had already taken the extraordinary action of removing him from the case for “judicial usurpation of power,” for violating “fundamental concepts of due process,” and for destroying any appearance of impartiality.

2006 —In a notorious speech at Radcliffe in which she recounts her 1960s-nostalgia-inspired “crying jag” at a Simon and Garfunkel concert in 2003, New York Times Supreme Court reporter Linda Greenhouse rants about “the sustained assault on women’s reproductive freedom” and “the hijacking of public policy by religious fundamentalism.” Greenhouse later defends these comments as “statements of fact,” but the Times ’s public editor criticizes her for violating her “overriding obligation to avoid publicly expressing these kinds of personal opinions”—and for “whining” about “the difficulties journalists face in being citizens.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "

Joe Biden's Hyde Amendment Shift Was Poorly Orchestrated | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/joe-bidens-poorly-orchestrated-shift-on-the-hyde-amendment/,"June 7, 2019 10:32 AM Former Vice President Joe Biden campaigns in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, October 30, 2018 (KC McGinnis/Reuters ) Next week will bring publication day — if you think I’ve been insufferable about touting the book now, just wait — so let’s end this week with a selection of news tapas — short items and takes. Stunning: Since 2006, 73 Percent of U.S. Service Casualties Are ‘Unrelated to War’ With Memorial Day not long ago and the 75th anniversary of D-Day this week, hopefully much of the country has been thinking about those who wore our country’s uniform. Thursday brought sad news that reminded us that everyone who puts on the uniform in the armed services ends up accepting some level of risk, even if they never see combat. A vehicle loaded with West Point cadets on summer training overturned on a dirt road Thursday, killing one cadet and injuring 22 other passengers, according to the U.S. Military Academy. Twenty cadets and two soldiers were injured when their light medium tactical vehicle overturned around 6:45 a.m. off Route 293, said Lt. Col. Christopher Ophardt. The vehicle, a military truck that can carry personnel, had two people in the front cab and the rest in the back. I find this fact absolutely stunning : “More American service members are dying during training exercises than in combat operations.” “Since 2006 … a total of 16,652 active-duty personnel and mobilized reservists have died while serving in the US armed forces. Seventy-three percent of these casualties occurred under circumstances unrelated to war,” the report states. It is a trend that has only seemed to pick up momentum of late, as noncombat deaths have exceeded the number of military members killed in action every year since 2015. Perhaps some of these deaths are unavoidable. But are we certain that the military has all the funding it needs for sufficient training, sufficient equipment, and a manageable pace of operations? Jim Scuitto’s Quiet Indictment of Obama’s Foreign Policy CNN national security correspondent Jim Sciutto wrote The Shadow War , an interesting and well-researched book looking at U.S. policy towards Russia and China over the past decades — and how successive administrations have underestimated the threats from these two countries. This is a little more interesting than usual because Sciutto spent two years as chief of staff and senior policy adviser to U.S. ambassador China Gary Locke, and he does not skimp on criticism of the Obama administration’s policies , quoting other quietly frustrated and disappointed Obama administration officials as well. (Of course, now that I’ve pointed out Sciutto’s criticism of the Obama policies, the usual nutty lefties on Twitter are now attacking him as a pro-Trump shill, which is ridiculous.) You can’t begrudge Sciutto for keeping his book focused on Russia and China, but to me the plethora of examples illustrated a systemic problem. If the Obama administration was so persistently naïve and so willfully blind to risks and threats emerging from Russia and China, why would we think the same foreign-policy minds, guided by the same philosophies and worldviews, would have a more correct assessment of Iran and its nuclear ambitions? Or the Syrian civil war? Or North Korea? Joe Biden: Hey, Forget All Those Years I Supported the Hyde Amendment Elsewhere at CNN, Rebecca Buck notices that Joe Biden and his campaign completely reversed position on the Hyde amendment so suddenly that the surrogates were left defending a position that the candidate himself wouldn’t defend. “Just how abrupt/poorly orchestrated was Joe Biden’s shift on [the] Hyde [amendment]? Wednesday night, Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond went on [Chris Cuomo’s program to] defend Biden’s support for the Hyde amendment. Less than 24 hours later, Biden reversed his position.” The Hyde amendment bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion except in the cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. For a guy who’s supposed to be enjoying a huge lead, flip-flopping on taxpayer-financed abortions is a panicked move. And Biden’s explanation doesn’t sound all that plausible — particularly considering how he’s spent years insisting he was “middle of the road” on abortion. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. “I have supported the Hyde Amendment like many, many others have,” Biden said Thursday, “because there were sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right — women of color, poor women, women who were not able to have access — and it was not under attack as it is now. But circumstances have changed . . . I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now represents.” As I’ve emphasized, Joe Biden isn’t really a centrist. He’s a guy who moves to wherever the center of the Democratic party is. As it moves further left, so will he. Joe Biden, Donald Trump, and the Draft for Vietnam War An interesting theory from a Democratic strategist talking to Michael Graham: When lesser-known Democratic presidential candidates start focusing on Trump as a draft-dodger, they’re trying to introduce the issue to the discussion, in order to take a shot at Joe Biden .

About 9 percent say abortion should never be permitted under any circumstance, another 9 percent say it should be allowed only to save the life of the mother, and 29 percent say the procedure should be permitted only in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at stake.
Only 18 percent said abortion should be legal throughout all nine months of pregnancy, available whenever the mother desires it. Stay Updated with NR Daily

'Frankie & Johnny in the Claire de Lune' Review: A Surprising Anti–Me Too Play | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/an-anti-me-too-play-from-a-surprising-perspective-and-from-the-1980s/,"June 7, 2019 3:51 PM Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon in Terrence McNally’s Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune (Deen van Meer) Terrence McNally’s Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune is sweet and lovely, and turns out to be durable.
T he two actors enter, look at each other, and then they’re off. The clothes, I mean. Michael Shannon and Audra McDonald open their play with a pretty graphic sex scene, each of them cloaked in shadows but nothing else. Live on stage, this gambit is certainly an excellent way to get the audience’s attention. Advertisement Advertisement
Naked people are vulnerable people, disarmed people, which is the point established by the director Arin Arbus at the start of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune , a sweet and lovely two-hander written in 1987 that has proven surprisingly durable. Terrence McNally’s play about middle-aged lovers just getting to know each other after a first date originally starred F. Murray Abraham and Kathy Bates, then was adapted into a 1991 film with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. The 1980s references remain intact: A mention of Prizzi’s Honor was the first time I’d heard that 1985 film mentioned in many years. The single setting is an unkempt apartment in Manhattan’s sketchy West 50s, which was then beginning to be dubbed “Clinton” by real-estate marketers but today, now that it’s no longer dangerous, has reverted to its more colorful historical name, Hell’s Kitchen.
Being laid bare perfectly suits Johnny (Shannon), a short-order cook who works in a diner where he worked up the nerve to ask out a waitress, Frankie (McDonald). The two barely know each other; he has to tell her never to call him John, which to him sounds like an occupation or a toilet. Both are in their forties and both lie about their age. Where to go from here, after a single date that resulted in a sexual encounter both enjoyed immensely? Frankie expects Johnny to have a bite to eat and then go home. Johnny has other ideas. He isn’t going anywhere. Maybe not ever. Advertisement
In 1987 this setup would have seemed considerably more whimsical and humorous than it does today; producing Frankie and Johnny in 2019 seems like a sharp slap to the face of #MeToo. Frankie really would like Johnny to go so she can think about things. Johnny really isn’t leaving. He points out that if she shouts help, it’ll just be so much background noise in the Manhattan cacophony. If she calls the police, they’ll file that under their lowest priority and show up tomorrow, if ever. Given a slight tweak, the play could be approached as a sinister tale of obnoxious men seizing advantage of their privilege, but it’s to the director’s credit that she will have none of this. She finds Johnny’s openness attractive, if a little goofy, and Frankie will just have to yield to his determination.
That element is part and parcel of the throwback spirit of the play, winningly performed by its two stars, especially the superb Shannon. Though that opening five minutes anchors the piece in the post-sexual-revolution era, when no-strings-attached sex between relative strangers is normal, Johnny yearns to think of it as something almost sanctified. This seems odd to Frankie because it is out of step with the times; even after sex, the accepted standard is that two people will go their separate ways and play it cool, maybe wait a few days before re-establishing contact. What is not normal — what may even come across as slightly threatening — is an earnest expression of a desire to stay together forever. Johnny stands unprotected by any carapace of mistrust or cynicism. He’s ready to commit right now. Who speaks like this anymore, in 1987? He seems like a man out of the 1940s. That the two of them have names suggesting a couple in an old folk song strikes him as a hint from fate that they should be together, just as the moonlight streaking over the fire escape bathes them with its approval. In one of his many crazily impulsive moments, Johnny calls up a classical radio station to ask its late-night deejay to “play the most beautiful music ever written and dedicate it to us.” This is Claude Debussy’s “Clair de Lune.” It may be impossible to listen to without feeling romantic, but Frankie still has secrets, reasons to be in doubt about Johnny’s intentions.

Labor Market & U.S. Economy -- A May Cooling | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/labor-market-cools-in-may/,"June 7, 2019 3:56 PM Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in N.Y., December 20, 2018. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
The labor market cooled in May as jobs growth failed to meet analysts’ expectations, sparking concern among investors that an economic slowdown may have begun.
The U.S. economy added only 75,000 jobs in May according to data released Friday by the Labor Department, its worst showing since February and well below analyst predictions of 175,000 new positions. Jobs gains for the previous two months were also revised downward by 75,000. All in all, monthly job gains have averaged 164,000 so far this year, a drop from last year’s clip of 223,000.
Unemployment remains at 3.6 percent, a 50-year low, while wages have grown 3.1 percent since this time last year. But there are currently about 1.6 million more open positions than workers available to fill them. Given the labor shortage, analysts have predicted that the jobs-market expansion would soon begin to taper off.
Economists have also predicted the slowing economy will result in the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates in the near future, a possibility that spurred stocks higher on Friday as the jobs report was released. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Stacey Abrams Stolen-Election Myth Endures | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/stacey-abrams-stolen-election-myth-endures-democratic-party/,"June 9, 2019 6:30 AM Stacey Abrams speaks to supporters on election night in Atlanta, Ga., November 7, 2018. (Lawrence Bryant/Reuters) Democratic presidential candidates continue to swear her race was stolen.
S tacey Abrams’s refusal to lose the Georgia gubernatorial election graciously was one of the low points of the 2018 midterms. But her insistence that Brian Kemp and the Republicans stole the election from her has now become an article of faith among Democrats.
Democratic presidential contenders who traveled to Atlanta this week to speak to the African-American Leadership Council repeated the claim, which Abrams has made more than a dozen times since she lost to Kemp by 54,723 votes last November. In rote fashion, they repeated Abrams’s charges that the outcome was determined by “voter suppression” conducted by Kemp, who during the race was Georgia’s secretary of state. Advertisement Advertisement
South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg termed the alleged suppression “racially motivated” in his remarks to the group. He said that Abrams “ought to be governor.” Throwing complaints about gerrymandering and a desire for more-restrictive campaign-finance laws (neither of which had anything to do with the outcome in Georgia) into the argument, he claimed that the conditions that led to her loss meant that “we cannot truly say we live in a democracy.”
Not be outdone by his supposed competition for moderate Democratic-primary voters, former vice president Joe Biden raised the ante when he addressed the same group on Friday. Biden claimed that voter-integrity laws — which Kemp was legally bound to enforce — were direct descendants of Jim Crow regulations aimed at preventing African Americans from voting. Describing the GOP’s policies as a “methodical assault” on voting rights, Biden said, “voter suppression is the reason why Stacey Abrams isn’t governor right now.”
The assertion that Abrams was cheated, like any legend, gains credibility the more it is told, and now that the presidential field is echoing the sore loser’s refrain, it is becoming harder and harder to contain. Indeed, in none of the accounts of Buttigieg and Biden’s speeches were their claims about cheating or suppression explained, let alone challenged. Advertisement Advertisement
As a way of currying favor with Abrams, whose coy refusal to declare her candidacy for a Georgia U.S. Senate seat or for the presidency (unlike Beto O’Rourke, another 2018 participation-trophy winner) has put her in a position to be courted by those who are running, repeating the story in this fashion makes sense. Abrams, who is frequently mentioned as a potential running mate should a white male become the Democratic standard-bearer next year, has assumed a pose something like that of a royal pretender whose rights to someday oust the usurper — Kemp — are honored.
But the problem with this goes beyond the fact that the story is false. Nothing Kemp did as secretary of state took victory away from Abrams. But by repeating a myth about a stolen election — and amplifying it by saying that it is a product of a national conspiracy by Republicans to prevent minorities from voting — they are doing something far worse. These claims do more to undermine confidence that American elections are free and fair than anything the Russians might have done in 2016 or are plotting to do in the future. By allowing a legend to become accepted as fact, they are chipping away at the rule of law in ways that are deluding their followers into believing that they’re living in a racist and corrupt tyranny in which the system is rigged against them. Advertisement
The irony is that this comes from the same party that spent much of the fall of 2016 warning that Donald Trump and his supporters would never accept defeat and worrying that democracy was under threat from loose talk that fraud was the only way he could lose. Democrats were not wrong to worry about the damage that kind of rhetoric does to the public’s faith in the system. Advertisement
But Democrats forgot about that as they reeled in shock and dismay when Trump won an upset Electoral College victory. They have spent the last two and a half years holding on to that grudge as they embraced claims that Russian intervention decided the election and that Trump colluded with those efforts. The fact that the Democratic base’s belief in these charges has survived largely intact, even though the Mueller probe failed to substantiate them, reveals the toxic polarization of our political culture. Advertisement
Repeating Abrams’s story does just as much harm, but, fortunately, it is far more easily debunked.
The claims of voter suppression rest primarily on the fact that as Georgia secretary of state, Kemp enforced a statute passed by a Democratic-majority legislature and signed by a Democratic governor in 1997. It required the voting rolls to be periodically purged to remove names of voters who were dead, or who had moved away or were incarcerated. Under this law, 600,000 names of people who hadn’t voted in the last three elections were removed from the rolls in 2017 by Kemp’s office.
Those who were removed got prior notification in the mail about the impending purge, and they were given a menu of options to retain their registration. Moreover, it took four years to complete the process by which a name was removed. The reason so many names were taken off in 2017 was that a lawsuit by the Georgia NAACP had delayed the routine enforcement of the law for years before the organization eventually lost in the U.S. Supreme Court. Advertisement Advertisement
If you assume that most of the 600,000 were Democrats who were denied the right to vote — rather than voters who were deceased or who had moved or been jailed — that gives credibility to Abrams’s story. But there aren’t many people stepping forward since November 2018 to say they were wrongfully removed from the rolls, let alone the tens or hundreds of thousands necessary to substantiate Abrams’s claim that the election was stolen.
The other argument that purportedly backs up the stolen-election claim is that lengthy lines caused by the closing of 212 precincts in the state since 2012 deterred Georgia voters from turning out. But Kemp had nothing to do with that, since all decisions on consolidating voting stations were made by county officials. Which means if there were fewer precincts and longer lines in Democratic-majority counties in Georgia, it was almost certainly due to the decisions made by local Democrats, not Kemp or a national GOP conspiracy. Advertisement
When examined soberly, Abrams’s claims evaporate. Kemp’s win was no landslide, but his 1.4 percent margin of victory didn’t even give her the right to demand a legal recount. Demographic changes may mean that Georgia is trending away from the red-state status it has had in the last decade, but Stacey Abrams lost because Republicans still can turn out majorities there even in years when the odds favor Democrats.
But by continuing to swear to the lie that the election was stolen, Biden, Buttigieg, and every other Democrat who repeats that claim while paying court to Abrams and hoping to win African-American votes are poisoning the well of American democracy.
Abrams has damaged her cause with repeated statements both before and after the midterms that can be interpreted as favoring voting rights for non-citizens. That reinforces Republican suspicions that Democratic opposition to voter-integrity laws is rooted in a desire to commit fraud."
O.J. Simpson Case at 25 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Telly Davidson,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/oj-simpson-case-trial-of-the-century-still-echoes-today/,"June 9, 2019 6:30 AM O.J. Simpson holds up his hands to the jury, June 15, 1995. (Sam Mircovich/Reuters) The Trial of the Century still echoes today.
O n June 12, amidst daily hyperventilation across the Internet and cable TV about our current cultural scene, America will mark the 25th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, killings for which Nicole’s ex-husband — the retired NFL superstar and movie/TV fixture O.J. Simpson — was soon arrested. By January of the following year, the “Trial of the Century” had begun, ending nearly a year later with an acquittal for “The Juice” despite overwhelming evidence. He was later found civilly liable for wrongful death, and he was imprisoned from 2008 to 2017 on armed-robbery and kidnapping charges that, in a convoluted way, ultimately stemmed from that civil verdict. Advertisement Advertisement
The O.J. case certainly didn’t invent “outrage culture” — which reached its pre-social-media peak during Vietnam and Watergate. Nor was it the first celebrity courtroom case about the “deathstyles” of the rich and famous, a fact to which Claus von Bulow, the Menendez Brothers, and Jean Harris can attest. But the trial was both the lowest moment for old-fashioned legacy media — “respectable” newspapers, magazines, book publishers, and nightly network news shows — and also their last gasp of untrammeled relevance before the “World Wide Web” (as it was then starting to be known) rewrote everybody’s story.
First the obvious parallels. Race relations were at a boiling point. Some of the top movies of the past few years had been Colors , Stand and Deliver , Do the Right Thing , Boyz in the Hood , Falling Down , and Hoop Dreams. The “Willie Horton ad,” with its famous “coded racial appeals,” was only a few years old, as was the Rodney King beating. California was still emerging from a brutal recession of collapsed property values, foreclosures, and downsized defense jobs. Advertisement
In other words, the go-go Reagan ’80s were definitely over — but the shoe-shopping “peace and prosperity” of the dot-com booming, deficit-erasing, low-unemployment late ’90s had yet to appear. As Ron and Nicole were being taken to their funerals, Joe Biden and Bill Clinton were inaugurating the infamous 1994 federal “crime bill,” while “three-strikes” ballot initiatives were all the rage — as was California’s most infamous ballot initiative of all, Proposition 187, which barred illegal immigrants from receiving state services. Drive-by shootings and crack-related crime had become an almost daily feature of newspapers and news broadcasts in the major cities, with a rape and murder rate roughly double that of today’s.
With police shootings and beatings, Black Lives Matter, the Charlottesville incident, and the media coverage of revived neo-Nazi and white-supremacist activity, one wonders what barely healed wounds would be brutally ripped open were an O.J.-like case and trial to hit today — or how a certain Twitter-addicted president might respond. In another sense, we’re already living our “O.J. trial” today, with the tawdry terrors of Trump and the Mueller investigation having replaced DNA swatches and bloody gloves as the hot topics around the water cooler. Advertisement Advertisement
Indeed, Donald Trump becoming president after being the billionaire superstar of ’80s and ’90s tabloids is in some ways the final flowering of the Hard Copy / Inside Edition and Jerry Springer/Ricki Lake culture that was then on the rise. As Ryan Murphy’s top-rated 2016 FX miniseries on the case cheekily foreshadowed, perhaps the biggest stars of all to emerge were the teenage daughters of O.J.’s great friend, the late Los Angeles businessman Robert Kardashian.
But the true significance of O.J. to today’s society — and in particular, to the evolving differences between liberals and conservatives — runs much deeper. Conservatives in the Clinton years usually claimed to deplore situational ethics, though perhaps they should have stopped a minute to notice that their most effective players in the modern halls of power (Newt Gingrich, Karl Rove) were ruthlessly realpolitik political actors. In the “ Flight 93 Election ” of 2016, by contrast, Republicans mostly united behind Trump. What changed? Advertisement
For all of talk radio’s fulminations against Loony Leftists, in the ’80s and ’90s, American conservatives’ adversaries were liberals — not the true hardcore Left. When Ron and Nicole died, the most acclaimed filmmaker in America was Martin Scorsese. The most prestigious small-screen auteur was Steven Bochco ( Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue ). Courtroom thrillers by John Grisham and Scott Turow about conflicted, formerly idealistic Boomer children of the ’60s trying to navigate today’s thorniest issues flew off the shelves. In other words, the intellectual, cultural, and academic zeitgeist tilted towards the liberal fetish for “fine lines” and “gray areas.” No wonder conservatives, particularly social and religious ones, felt free to take the hard line in response. Advertisement
Today is different, with the recent revival of uncompromising and doctrinaire leftism, “identity politics,” and socialism, and as a result many conservatives have learned to stop worrying about personal ethics so much. In the so-called “Flight 93 Election” of 2016, voters knew there was a strong chance that Trump would appoint judges and regulators who oppose abortion and infringements on the religious freedom of social cons, and that there was absolutely zero chance that President Hillary would do anything but the opposite. It wasn’t about the individual case anymore; it was about the big-picture. Advertisement Advertisement
In my book about the 1990s, Culture War , I made a grim joke treating O.J., Monica, and Bush v. Gore as a Scream- like “trilogy” of horror movies. The first one set the rules, the second one broke the rules — and by the third one, there were no rules left other than sheer survival.
In the O.J. case, the defense won when Johnnie Cochran asked the jury, “Who polices the police?” — after the police brutality and white supremacy of investigating LAPD officer Mark Furhman had been revealed for all the world to see. The “system’s” credibility was gone, and the purpose of the trial swung from getting justice for two murder victims to making a statement about the injustices that people of color had too often suffered at the hands of the Establishment.
A couple of years later, when Bill Clinton was accused of a series of what we’d today call #MeToo abuses, feminists rewrote the Left’s rules and defended him. In the culture-war hothouse of 1998, it was a choice between that, and giving the biggest political victory ever to the likes of hard-core anti-feminists such as Rush Limbaugh, Rick Santorum, and John Hagee.

This Day June 9 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/this-day-in-liberal-judicial-activism-june-9-2/,"June 9, 2019 8:00 AM (Shutterstock)
2008 —With opinions about to be issued concerning the en banc petition in Ricci v. DeStefano , Second Circuit judge Sonia Sotomayor and her panel colleagues—fellow Clinton appointees Rosemary Pooler and Robert Sack—evidently realize that they have failed in their bid to bury the claims by 19 white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter that New Haven city officials engaged in racially discriminatory practices by throwing out the results of two promotional exams. They therefore convert their nonprecedential summary order dismissing the firefighters’ claims into an otherwise virtually identical per curiam precedential ruling dismissing the claims.
Three days later, the Second Circuit issues an order denying en banc rehearing by a 7-6 vote. In a blistering dissent, Judge José Cabranes (also a Clinton appointee) condemns the panel’s mistreatment of the firefighters’ claims. As he sums it up:
This per curiam opinion adopted in toto the reasoning of the District Court, without further elaboration or substantive comment, and thereby converted a lengthy, unpublished district court opinion, grappling with significant constitutional and statutory claims of first impression, into the law of this Circuit. It did so, moreover, in an opinion that lacks a clear statement of either the claims raised by the plaintiffs or the issues on appeal. Indeed, the opinion contains no reference whatsoever to the constitutional claims at the core of this case, and a casual reader of the opinion could be excused for wondering whether a learning disability played at least as much a role in this case as the alleged racial discrimination.
And then this killer understatement:
This perfunctory disposition rests uneasily with the weighty issues presented by this appeal.
Cabranes expresses his “hope that the Supreme Court will resolve the issues of great significance raised by this case” and his judgment that plaintiffs’ claims are “worthy of [Supreme Court] review.”
The Supreme Court proceeds to grant review and, one year later—while Sotomayor’s Supreme Court nomination is pending—reverses the panel decision. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Joe Biden Abortion Flip-Flop Reveals His Weaknesses | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Fund,06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/joe-biden-flip-flop-hyde-amendment-abortion-debate/,"June 9, 2019 6:26 PM Joe Biden takes questions from the audience at a campaign stop in Concord, N.H., June 4, 2019. (Brian Snyder/Reuters) Democrats’ enthusiasm for their front-runner wanes as they worry about his gaffes and blunders.
W hen Joe Biden announced last month, he became the instant Democratic front-runner, based on his stature and huge name ID. But is he a front-runner like Walter Mondale, another former vice president, who overcame skepticism and won the Democratic nomination in 1984? Or is he an Edmund Muskie, who was the clear Democratic front-runner in 1972 but then was crushed by outsider George McGovern? Advertisement Advertisement
We’re more than six months away from the Iowa caucuses, and anything can happen. But there are already signs that Biden’s previous shortcomings as a candidate are returning. And the public is noticing.
Last December, almost a third of likely Iowa caucus voters wanted Biden to be the 2020 nominee. Now, a new Des Moines Register poll has him leading Vermont senator Bernie Sanders by only 24 percent to 16 percent. Less than three in ten of Biden’s supporters say they’re extremely enthusiastic about his candidacy, a significantly lower enthusiasm level than that expressed by supporters of Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg — his main rivals in Iowa.
And the Register poll was taken before Biden’s chaotic shift in position last week on the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortions. Biden, a staunch Catholic, had supported the Hyde amendment for more than three decades, but within 48 hours of being attacked for his stance by his opponents, he flip-flopped on the issue. Advertisement
In December, 82 percent of Iowa Democratic voters said they saw Biden favorably; this month, that number is down to 72 percent of Democratic voters, a ten-point drop. His unfavorable ratings are up nine points. Advertisement
Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, says that Biden will be faced with the need to evolve on other issues as he navigates a Democratic-party activist base that is far more progressive than when Biden served as Barack Obama’s vice president. “Things are changing, and things have changed, and he’s going to be hit with that reality in a new way now that he’s a candidate again,” she told The Atlantic .
Now that Biden has caved to the left of his party on such a clear principle as federal funding of abortion, the pressure on him to keep going will ratchet up. David Axelrod, the chief strategist behind Obama’s 2008 victory, told CNN that the furor over Biden’s flip-flop on the Hyde amendment “raises questions about his own performance and his own steadiness and his campaign’s performance.”
Then Axelrod articulated publicly what many Democrats are worrying about privately: that Biden may not be a candidate who can be counted on to avoid acting impulsively, to avoid gaffes such as excessive touching or blurting out distracting comments. As Axelrod puts it:
He would be 78 when he became president and that would be eight years older than the oldest president who has ever taken office, which is Donald Trump. . . .This is one reason I think they’ve kept a relatively leisurely pace on the campaign trail and away from some of the major events and away from reporters, frankly, because they are worried about things just such as the one we have just seen.
Other consultants worry that Biden’s staff is taking credit for steering their candidate in one direction or another. Mike Murphy, the campaign strategist for John McCain in 2008 and Jeb Bush in 2016, says it’s troublesome that Biden’s campaign apparently has “a culture where the staff are the heroes and have no qualms about boasting about it to media.”
Biden’s staff was also at the heart of an unforced error in his climate-change policy. Last month, an “informal adviser” to Biden’s campaign leaked to reporters that Biden would be taking a “middle ground” position on climate-change regulation. Environmentalists quickly uncovered that the leaker was Heather Zichal, a former board member of a Texas-based liquified-natural-gas company. She joined the company’s board in 2014 after leaving the Obama White House and earned nearly $1.1 million in compensation and stock before she left the board four years later. Advertisement
This embarrassment panicked Biden staffers into reversing gears, and last week they embraced a much more liberal climate policy than they’d been contemplating. In a Washington Post column, Henry Olsen called it “the best campaign gift President Trump could have hoped for.” The plan “promises to make the United States a net-zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050,” Olsen wrote. “I’m sure Republican analysts are already calculating how many jobs will be lost in key industries under Biden’s plan.” Advertisement
And that wasn’t the only problem with the rollout of the Biden climate policy. John King of CNN reported that the Biden campaign’s plan “copied language directly from multiple liberal activist groups and a news site” without any citation. King called the lapse “lazy” and “arrogant,” while noting that it was allegations of plagiarism that derailed Biden’s 1988 presidential bid and forced him to withdraw from that race. “This is a leadership and competence issue,” King told viewers. Advertisement
Democratic strategists also know that Biden has other vulnerabilities that, while they may not be brought up by his party rivals, will certainly be used by Republicans should he be the Democratic nominee. Advertisement
Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute, has published extensive documentation that Biden’s son, Hunter, forged lucrative financial relationships with the state-owned Bank of China and Ukrainian energy firm Burisma Holdings after his father visited both countries as vice president.
“Why were these foreign governments and these foreign corrupt oligarchs stuffing money into Hunter Biden’s pocket?” Schweizer asked in a recent Sirius radio interview. “That’s why I have called for Hunter Biden to testify before a Senate committee.” A leading Democrat I spoke with is convinced that Biden’s ability to confront Trump over his alleged ties to Russia would be blunted by attacks on Biden’s “friends and family” foreign policy."

Editor’s Note : In the last week of May, Jay Nordlinger was at the Oslo Freedom Forum, the annual human-rights gathering in Norway’s capital. For the first two parts of his journal, go here and here . It concludes today.
‘J e suis bien tombé,” Van Galbraith once said to me. He was a great friend of Bill Buckley’s, and Reagan’s first ambassador to France. He had sat down next to me at a dinner table. “Je suis bien tombé” means, literally, “I am well fallen.” Non-literally, it means you like your placement (as the French also say). You like where you are sitting. Advertisement Advertisement
Well, I am really bien tombé at a lunch here in Oslo. To my left is Fatemah Qaderyan; to my right is Omar Mohammed. They are two of my favorite people in life.
Fatemah is the Afghan girl who captains that renowned, unexpected robotics team (all-girl). A delightful person, she likes Einstein, Harry Potter, and French fries. I wrote about her last year, here .
She has had a lot to overcome. In 2017, her father was killed in a terrorist attack on a mosque. Advertisement
Omar Mohammed is the Iraqi who, at great risk to himself, chronicled the occupation of Mosul by ISIS. (I wrote about him here .)
This lunch is being held in honor of Jamal Khashoggi and Raed Fares. They are past participants in the Freedom Forum. Both of them were murdered in the past year — murdered for their journalism. Advertisement
Khashoggi was a Saudi who was once warm to the regime and then turned against it. (What a price he paid.) Fares was a Syrian, working in impossible conditions, and trying to build something. (I wrote about him here .)
One of the speakers at this lunch is Bobby Ghosh, the veteran Indian-American journalist who is now with Bloomberg Opinion. He speaks about Time magazine’s Person of the Year award for 2018. It was given to specific journalists, dead and alive. (Khashoggi was one.) Never before had the magazine honored a journalist in this way.
A lot of people snorted at the 2018 award: “Oh, journalists honoring journalists! How convenient! How self-congratulatory!” Bobby Ghosh says, “Five, ten years ago, I would have felt the same. But not today.” Advertisement
I could not agree more. My appreciation for freedom of the press has grown (and it was always strong, I hope). My appreciation for the risks that journalists take, all over the world, has grown too. Advertisement
• You will want to meet Laritza Diversent. I’m glad I have. She is a Cuban lawyer, who was forced to flee her country. She now lives in the United States. She founded a non-profit in Cuba, Cubalex, which helped poor people with their legal matters. The government did not like what Laritza and her colleagues were doing. She got out just in time.
I’ve done a little article about her, here .
• Where is Tajikistan? Amid many ’stans. Afghanistan, for example, is to its south. For many years now — since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than a quarter of a century ago — Tajikistan has been ruled by one dictator, Emomali Rahmon. Oh, is it a brutal state. On the stage of the Freedom Forum, Sharofiddin Gadoev speaks about it. He is an opposition leader, and he has faced the worst. In fact, it’s somewhat remarkable to see him standing before us.
What guts he has. Where does it come from? A hatred of tyranny, and a hunger for freedom, helps. Advertisement
• Bryan Fogel tells a riveting tale. Absolutely riveting. He is an American filmmaker and playwright. He is responsible for Jewtopia , which is both a play and a movie. As Fogel says onstage here, “A Gentile man wants to marry a Jewish woman so he never has to make another decision.” (I think I’ve heard him correctly.)
Fogel is also responsible for the documentary Icarus . It is about the Russian doping scandal. It won an Academy Award. Fogel gives us an abridged version of the story that Icarus tells. Everyone is on the edge of his seat, I sense. I certainly am.
There is a whistleblower, Grigory Rodchenkov. Putin tries like hell to kill him. Rodchenkov has a narrow escape (at least one). Others are not so lucky. Today, Rodchenkov is in an American witness-protection program. He lives in isolation, 24/7. He is a prisoner, because he has told the truth. Occasionally, he goes out briefly in a bulletproof vest to walk a dog. Putin has not stopped trying to kill him. It is a Kremlin priority.
Putin’s thuggishness and murderousness is one thing. But, as Fogel chronicles, the lies are another. Putin simply lies and lies, brazenly, with little or no penalty. Advertisement Advertisement
Anyway, I thought I knew something about the Russian doping scandal. It turns out there is so much more, and Bryan Fogel relates it carefully, humorously, and movingly. I have not seen Icarus , but, based on Fogel’s presentation here in Oslo, I bet it deserved its Oscar.
• William Browder is the father of the Magnitsky acts. They are named after his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who was tortured to death by Russian authorities. The acts impose sanctions on officials who violate human rights. They have been adopted by one country after another, beginning with the United States.
The European Union has not adopted a Magnitsky act. Here in Oslo, Browder explains why. You have to have unanimity within the Union — and Hungary’s Orbán, of course, has blocked a Magnitsky act.
There is nothing that Putin abhors more than Magnitsky acts — even Grigory Rodchenkov! Orbán has done him a great favor (another one). Advertisement
• You will want to meet Laila Haidari — oh, will you be amazed by her! She is an Afghan, born in a refugee camp (Pakistan). She grew up in Iran. Was a child bride. Escaped all that. Found her brother drug-addicted in Afghanistan. Dedicated herself to helping drug addicts in general. Runs a café, to support her program. Chases off those who would harm her — chases them off with guns. A tough, tough broad, yes, but also a tender, and tender-hearted, woman.
I will write about her soon …
• Memory Mbewe is from Malawi. Beautiful name, right? She is a children’s-rights advocate, doing what she can to end or discourage child marriage. She thinks children ought to have childhoods. A beautiful and right concept.
• Audrey Mbugua is from Kenya. She tells a story of transgenderism — her own. (I’m not sure that “transgenderism” is the right word. I find these sexual terms a minefield. People are always correcting you, or at least they are me.) Mbugua believes that she was born into the wrong sex — specifically, the male sex. It felt like a terrible, cosmic mistake to her.
I know some people don’t want me to say “her.” I have always resisted the language cops, whatever direction they were coming from.
Listening to Audrey Mbugua, I have a memory of George W. Bush. In 2003, he hosted his 35th college reunion at the White House. A woman came up to him and said, “You might remember me as Peter when we left Yale.” The president, grabbing her hand, said, “Now you’ve come back as yourself.”
Lots of “transgenders” — again, I dance in a minefield — commit suicide, says Mbugua. They cannot bear the confusion, stress, and hostility in their lives. Mbugua says, “I have been raped; deserted by family and friends; stripped of my clothes by people who wanted to determine my sex; thrown into filthy prison cells with the male population — you name it. But I am here in front of you, because, against all odds, and despite losing everything, I have managed.”
She continues, “I never would have done it without the support of my grandmother and a few others.” That grandmother, in Kenya, I presume, must be extraordinary.
Like all or most conservatives, I hate transgender politics in the West, and I find transgender politics surrounding children outrageous. Stomach-turning. But I defy you, no matter who you are, to listen to Audrey Mbugua and not be moved.

Reinstate Pell Grants for Prisoners: Step in Right Direction | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Emily Mooney,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/reinstate-pell-grants-prisoners-step-right-direction/,"June 10, 2019 6:30 AM (Stephen Lam/Reuters) It’s not the ideal solution, but it’s a step in the right direction.
T his session, Congress has an opportunity to dramatically expand access to post-secondary education behind bars by reinstating eligibility for Pell Grants (need-based federal tuition grants to undergraduate students) for people in prison. Though conservatives are often wary of federal involvement in higher education, they should consider the advantages that offering post-secondary education to prisoners can bring to both individuals and society. Advertisement Advertisement
When prisoners lack the means to acquire an education, everyone suffers. Those behind bars remain idle and, according to research , may be more likely to act out — sometimes violently — toward other incarcerated individuals and prison staff. Children of people in prison also suffer while their parents are imprisoned, having relied on them not only as a source of income but also as a positive role model in the home. And once these individuals are released, they often have trouble finding employment . This begets a reliance on public safety nets and sometimes even a return to criminal activity.
Offering correctional post-secondary-education programs can mitigate these problems. For men and women behind bars, enrolling in college courses makes the time they spend in prison more meaningful and productive. These programs provide incarcerated students with a positive goal to work toward. And by pursuing an education, people in prison can refine their critical-thinking skills and acquire new aptitudes sought by employers on the outside. Indeed, research suggests that obtaining a post-secondary education while in prison is associated with improved employment outcomes upon release. Advertisement
A post-secondary education can also produce myriad benefits for society. Children and families of prisoners benefit when parents receive a post-secondary education — it sets new expectations and opens up new possibilities for educational achievement. Communities also benefit when the formerly incarcerated secure jobs, contribute demanded skills to the economy, pay taxes, and depend less heavily on social-service agencies.
Moreover, individuals who receive post-secondary education while in prison are less likely to recidivate and return to prison than those who do not, which benefits us all. One study found that obtaining a post-secondary degree while incarcerated lowers a person’s odds of returning to prison due to a new offense by 24 percent . Reduced crime and imprisonment not only means avoiding harm to persons and property, it also means saved taxpayer dollars. State and federal taxpayers often spend tens of thousands of dollars per year incarcerating just one individual. When fewer people return to prison, these taxpayer dollars can be invested in other priorities. Advertisement
Given these benefits, increasing access to post-secondary education behind bars is a worthwhile investment. The question then becomes whether Pell Grants are the best way to achieve this. Advertisement
The truth is that there really are no better alternatives. When prisoners were stripped of their Pell Grant eligibility in 1994 , opportunities to pursue post-secondary education behind bars plummeted. During the early 1990s, over 700 correctional education programs existed. By 1997, the number of post-secondary programs in prisons dropped to just eight. In contrast, a recent report by the Vera Institute for Justice and Georgetown University Law Center estimates that 463,000 individuals would have new financial means to receive post-secondary education if Pell Grant eligibility for prisoners were reinstated.
In an ideal world, states would not need to depend on federal dollars to support these programs. And in fact, some states have been able to offer limited educational programming in prisons. But in reality, most state correctional agencies are strapped for cash. As the Department of Justice’s recent report on Alabama prisons shows, in some instances, simply keeping individuals safe and facilities fully staffed is a difficult task . If we wait for states to act, we might never see these programs funded, missing the opportunity to improve both the lives of incarcerated individuals and the fiscal health of society. Advertisement
The whole purpose of the Pell Grant program is to give those individuals facing the greatest financial adversity access to one of the most proven paths to prosperity: education. Even if those of us on the right disagree with various aspects of federal higher-education policy, we cannot ignore the fact that, for the most part, people behind bars are some of the most financially disadvantaged in society — and the most capable of transforming educational opportunities into individual and societal benefits. As long as we have Pell Grant funding, it should be available to those it can help the most. Advertisement"
Clinton Impeachment Case: Stronger than Trump’s | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/bill-clinton-impeachment-case-stronger-than-trump/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter June 10, 2019 6:30 AM President Bill Clinton speaks to the nation following his acquittal by the U.S. Senate on impeachment charges, February 12, 1999. (Blake Sell/Reuters) The anti-Clinton case then was stronger than the anti-Trump case is now.
T here’s been a cottage industry in accusing Republicans of impeachment hypocrisy.
They happily impeached Bill Clinton and now vociferously oppose the impeachment of Donald Trump, even though Clinton was accused of obstruction of justice — just as Trump is now.
Is this a legitimate point?
There are uncomfortable parallels. The Democrats most fervent about impeachment say that it is their duty to do it no matter what, politics be damned. They speculate that perhaps the polling on impeachment will improve once it’s under way. Republicans said the same thing in the 1990s, and the Clinton impeachment ended in a fizzle. Advertisement
And it’s certainly true that both Clinton and Trump behaved appallingly when under investigation. Advertisement
Given that the Clinton impeachment, as a practical matter, acted as a censure vote and Clinton’s misconduct didn’t involve his core presidential duties, there’s a good argument that a formal censure would have been the wiser course. In retrospect, Newt Gingrich doesn’t give himself high marks for how he handled it.
That said, the case for Clinton’s impeachment was still stronger than the case for Trump’s.
The independent counsel in the Clinton case, Ken Starr, acting under a law that compelled him to notify Congress of impeachable offenses, said there was “substantial and credible evidence” that Clinton was guilty of eleven possible impeachable offenses. Starr didn’t, like Mueller, exonerate Clinton on the underlying matter and “not exonerate” him on the process crimes.
Most important, Clinton flat-out perjured himself, which no one disputed. If Trump had done the same in the Russia probe, he’d have been impeached already. Advertisement
In the 1990s, there was bipartisan support for an impeachment inquiry and a strong consensus for punishing the president. Neither exists today.
While it’s easy to think that Clinton was always safe from removal in the Senate, and for the most part he was, there was a moment of legitimate peril for him. Under current conditions, it’s impossible to imagine Trump facing similar jeopardy. Advertisement
It’s worth recalling all of this, and in what follows, I draw on the book I wrote on the Clinton presidency in 2003 (the original quotes are from my research at the time).
Ken Starr Didn’t Have Much Choice Starr wasn’t, like Robert Mueller, a special counsel who is supposed to be tightly tethered to the Justice Department. He was an independent counsel who was envisioned under the law as a quasi-independent prosecutor who would serve up impeachment referrals to Congress.
Almost every aspect of the independent-counsel statute was a trespass on the executive branch: Congress required the attorney general to ask for the appointment of independent counsel in certain circumstances; gave to a panel of judges the power to make the appointment; and invested in the independent counsel, once selected, prosecutorial powers with almost no check from the rest of the executive branch. Advertisement
Foolishly, instead of letting the independent-counsel statute lapse, Bill Clinton signed a renewal in 1993. He thus ensured endless investigations of his administration and, once the Monica Lewinsky affair got caught up in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit against him, a huge step toward his own impeachment.
By the end of 1997, Ken Starr was about to move on to the report-writing phase of the Whitewater investigation, the original cause for his appointment, when his office got word of the Lewinsky matter.
A confidante of Lewinsky’s, Linda Tripp, called Starr’s office with information about Clinton’s efforts to keep the former intern quiet. Her allegations had a thematic connection to the rest of Starr’s work, since they involved attempts to ensure someone’s non-cooperation with a court proceeding by offering job help, a subplot of Whitewater.
When Starr’s deputy Jackie Bennett called deputy attorney general Eric Holder to apprise him of the situation, Holder’s reaction was, “Wha-wha-what?” There was really no option but expanding Starr’s authority to deal with the case. With Newsweek close to publishing an article on the affair, Holder told me, “It was pretty clear to us — there wouldn’t be time to get somebody else in there,” and if the opportunity had been missed to move quickly, “we would’ve been criticized, justifiably.” Advertisement
Once the essentials of the Lewinsky story became clear —sex with an intern, attempts to get her to lie and win her silence, false statements in sworn testimony — Starr’s path was obvious and nearly inevitable: an investigation leading to an impeachment referral to Congress.
The independent-counsel statute essentially demanded it as a matter of law: An independent counsel, said the statute, “shall advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible information . . . that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.” Creating this automatic pilot toward impeachment was one of the purposes of the misbegotten statute in the first place. It relieved Congress of the political risk of initiating impeachment proceedings itself.
Clinton’s Perjury Was Flagrant and Repeated There’s no escaping the fact that President Clinton committed crimes in the Lewinsky affair. First and foremost, he perjured himself repeatedly — though his defenders would perform legalistic dances to try to keep the “p-word” from applying to his false statements. Advertisement Advertisement
Their chief argument was that his lies about Lewinsky in his deposition in the Jones case were immaterial to the case and therefore not technically perjury. The judge in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case against Clinton, Susan Wright, did ultimately exclude evidence related to Lewinsky from the Jones case, but that was not because it was immaterial. She stipulated at the time that Clinton’s Lewinsky testimony “might be relevant.” Later, she elaborated: “Contrary to numerous assertions, this court did not rule that evidence of the Lewinsky matter was irrelevant or immaterial to the issues in plaintiff’s case.”
Besides materiality, there are two other elements to perjury: falsehood and the intent to deceive. Clinton’s defenders say his testimony was literally truthful by the definition Clinton assigned his words. But witnesses cannot create their own private languages. Their words must be understood by their common meaning, by which standard Clinton’s testimony was clearly false. As for intent, Clinton was open about his desire to deceive. “I misled people,” he said in his August 17, 1998, confession speech to the nation. “I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct.” Imagine every dubious or dishonest thing Trump said during the Mueller investigation being repeated under oath — that was what Clinton did.
When he testified in his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998, he lied, most fundamentally, when he denied having sex with Lewinsky. The Jones lawyers offered a definition of sex drawn from the Violence Against Women Act, and Wright pared it down to: “contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an attempt to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.” Even by Clinton’s solipsistic and implausible interpretation of this definition — i.e., that it was possible for Lewinsky to have sex with him while he wasn’t having sex with her — Clinton lied, since it is obvious that he touched Lewinsky in places that qualified as sex under the definition. Advertisement
He lied when he said he had no memory of being alone with Lewinsky. He lied when he said he didn’t recall giving any gifts to Lewinsky (three weeks earlier, he’d given her a Rockettes blanket, a New York City skyline pin, sunglasses, cherry chocolates, a stuffed animal, and other trinkets). He lied when he said that he talked to Lewinsky about the possibility of her being subpoenaed in the Jones case only once, and that in passing and jokingly. He lied when he said that he didn’t know about Lewinsky’s subpoena in the Jones case when he talked to her for the last time. He lied when he denied that Vernon Jordan kept him updated about Lewinsky’s status in the Jones case.
After the impeachment fight had burned out in April 1999, Wright — the same judge Hillary praises for allegedly totally vindicating Clinton in the Jones suit — sanctioned Clinton for contempt of court. She wrote that there is “simply no escaping the fact” that Clinton gave “intentionally false” answers to questions from the Jones lawyers in a way “designed to obstruct the judicial process.” Even Abbe Lowell, chief investigator for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, had told his fellow Democrats upon first evaluating the evidence, “Perjury in his deposition. No question that he lied.”
Clinton’s testimony before Ken Starr’s grand jury in August, after he had finally decided to admit his affair, was an encore performance of his civil-deposition lies. He lied when he denied having sex with Lewinsky, and he lied when he said their “inappropriate” relationship didn’t begin until 1996. He lied when he said his civil deposition in the Jones case had been truthful. He lied when he denied being alone with Lewinsky. He lied when he said that, when he coached Betty Currie, his personal secretary, with a series of rhetorical questions based on falsehoods, he was merely trying to jog his own memory. He lied when he said he hadn’t told Currie to get back the gifts he had lied about not remembering giving to Lewinsky. And he lied in denying that he had lied to his aides in the wake of the Lewinsky revelations.
In addition to his perjury, Clinton was guilty of obstruction of justice. By suggesting to Lewinsky that she give an affidavit to the Jones lawyers, Clinton couldn’t have been suggesting anything other than that she lie — and deny the relationship — in order to avoid being deposed. That is the only possible interpretation, unless we believe that Clinton was urging Lewinsky to expose the relationship preemptively and launch the near-destruction of his presidency. Advertisement
It seems almost certain that — although both he and Currie denied it — Clinton sent Betty Currie to pick up from Lewinsky the gifts he had given her, in order to keep this evidence safe from a subpoena.
There was little ambiguity about all of this. It was locked-down and obvious.
A Broad Consensus for Punishment It’s easy to forget the initial shock upon the revelation of Clinton’s conduct.
Later, by the time the controversy had neared its end, it seemed outlandish to think Clinton could have been forced from office. But that was only an illusion created after the fact. It could have been different — for instance, in August when Democratic senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut condemned Clinton from the Senate floor, along with fellow Democratic senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. “I’m pretty convinced that Clinton was within inches of losing the presidency then,” Lanny Davis, who had left the White House but was assisting in its defense, told me. “Because that could have sent a wave of Democratic senators away from him under the cover of Joe Lieberman and Bob Kerrey. And then he would have been very, very hard pressed to stay in office.”
Instead, Lieberman’s condemnation helped Clinton — it expressed disgust without calling for resignation or impeachment.
Nearly everyone agreed on the need for the House to undertake an impeachment inquiry, though. Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican inquiry plan, and the rest voted for an alternative Democratic plan.
There was a consensus in the country in favor of punishing Clinton. In December 1998, Clinton himself asked to be censured. As one of the Democratic censure resolutions said, Clinton had “egregiously failed” his constitutional oath, “violated the trust of the American people,” and “dishonored the office which they have entrusted to him.” This language echoed Lieberman’s August floor statement, when he said Clinton’s behavior was “disgraceful” and “immoral” and had “profound public consequences” — prompting Clinton to respond, “Basically, I agree with what he said.”
The Republican House in 1998 was not necessarily a lost cause for Clinton. He could perhaps have peeled Republican moderates away from impeachment by making a full confession. The problem was that he couldn’t fully admit to his wrongdoing without making a damning case against himself, i.e., “I’m a confessed perjurer.” So he had to stick with the word games.
Asked in one of 81 written questions by Henry Hyde if he had sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in his Jones deposition, Clinton responded, “I do not recall the precise wording of the oath.” His unresponsiveness and his repetition of his lies in response to the questions —he talked to Currie only “to get as much information as quickly as I could” — helped seal his fate in the House.
It impeached him by 228–206 on an article charging him with perjury before Starr’s grand jury and by 221–212 on an article charging him with obstruction of justice.
Clinton Wasn’t Getting Removed Of course, the public considered the issue and didn’t want Clinton removed from office. The argument over impeachment might best be framed by two concessions made by advocates on the different sides. On one hand, there was Clinton’s lawyer Charles Ruff. Before the House Judiciary Committee, Ruff explained how Clinton had tried to walk a narrow line. “Reasonable people — and you maybe have reached this conclusion — could determine that he crossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or non-responsive and misleading or evasive was, in fact, false.” Although Ruff would not interpret his concession this way, he was essentially saying that in the course of attempting to deceive the court, Clinton told lies — i.e., he committed perjury.
On the other hand, there was none other than House impeachment manager Congressmsn Lindsey Graham. When asked during the Senate trial if reasonable people could conclude that Clinton shouldn’t be removed from office even if he was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused, Graham said “absolutely.”"
Democrats Complaining but Threshold for DNC Debates Is Low | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/democrats-complaining-threshold-for-dnc-debates-already-low/,"June 10, 2019 10:06 AM Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand at the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, Calif., June 1, 2019. (Stephen Lam/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: A handful of long-shot Democratic presidential candidates reach the inevitable stage of whining about how difficult and unfair everything is, social-media companies are slowly strangling what made their platforms worthwhile, a bit of book news, and a remembrance of the complicated legacy of someone who chose to leave us far too soon. Reality Is Hitting the Democratic Presidential Candidates Like a Folding Chair to the Head Some Democratic presidential campaigns are like the protagonist in an M. Night Shyamalan movie: They’re dead already, they just don’t know it. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say they were never really alive. The first Democratic presidential primary debates will be held in two weeks. The threshold for participation is exceptionally low, particularly for any candidate who announced near the beginning of the year: Either reach just 1 percent in three surveys approved by the Democratic National Committee or have 65,000 or more donors that include 200 people from at least 20 states. If you think reaching that threshold is difficult, keep in mind, this limit has already been reached by Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, John Delaney, and Irving Schmidlap. (Okay, I threw Irving Schmidlap in there just to see if you were paying attention.) Already you’re hearing complaints that the threshold is too high and that the DNC rules just aren’t fair. Top Montana Democrats sent a scathing letter to Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez on Friday in response to the DNC’s decision to change its debate qualification rules in a way that would prevent Gov. Steve Bullock, a 2020 presidential candidate, from participating. “We know many consider us to be fly-over country or little more than an ideal vacation spot, but we know we’ve offered countless invaluable contributions to the Democratic Party and our nation as a whole,” the letter says. “The recent implementation of extra qualification rules for the June debates in Miami could deny the Democratic Party a voice representing rural America.” Of course. It can’t just be that Bullock is largely unknown outside of his home state, he jumped in too late, and Democratic primary voters are satisfied with all of the other 23 choices. No, no, it has to be a sinister effort of those urban elitists to dismiss the voices of rural American. You’re already hearing the “Those grapes were probably sour anyway” explanation from candidates who aren’t likely to a make it . [Seth] Moulton admitted he won’t make the cut for the first primary debates during an appearance on Hugh Hewitt’s nationally syndicated radio show Thursday. “No, I’m not going to make the first debate, but I knew that, getting in so late. But I think that’s OK,” Moulton said. “This first debate’s going to have 20 people. Folks are barely going to get a chance to speak.” That part is probably true, which is why the debate is unlikely to be a rousing success for the bottom 15 or so candidates. Ten candidates over a two-hour span would be 12 minutes each, and that’s before we take out time for questions, audience applause, etcetera. After you finish your answer, the audience is probably going to hear from nine candidates before they hear from you again. And then there’s a whole other night of candidates! But if you’re not on the debate stage, you’re missing out on even that limited opportunity to reach potential primary supporters. A lot of these presidential candidates are walking around with the delusion that they will make some appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire — states full of voters who run into three presidential candidates on the way to the grocery store — and somehow win over these voters through the sheer force of their personality. Guys, it’s not going to work. In 2007, Connecticut senator Chris Dodd moved with his family to Iowa and enrolled his children in Iowa schools . He finished with less than one percent in the 2008 caucus. What these candidates don’t want to hear (but must) is that if they didn’t qualify for the first debate, there’s no guarantee that they’ll qualify for the second debate, and the outlook really isn’t good for the third or fourth debates. The DNC recently announced that for the third and fourth debates — in September and October respectively — candidates must hit 2 percent in four polls from a slightly changed list of approved pollsters and have 130,000 unique donors from the date of their campaign’s creation. If that two percent polling threshold were in place now, Kirsten Gillibrand, Jay Inslee, Tulsi Gabbard, Bill de Blasio, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Julian Castro, Eric Swalwell, Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, and John Delaney would not be on the stage, as well as Moulton and Bullock. Amy Klobuchar would be just above the threshold. Gillibrand is now complaining that the DNC criteria amounts to a popularity contest. Er, indeed, senator. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. Gillibrand called the 65,000-donor threshold an “odd measurable” that is “random and inaccurate.” Although she added, “They’re the DNC, so I’ll follow the rules that are given and I’ll have to play by the rules,” the senator said the measure “is not determinative of any of the things that matter about whether I’d beat Trump.” “Because if Madonna was running, she’d have a million supporters. She’d have more than anybody,” Gillibrand concluded.“What having followers is a measurable of is whether you’re famous, it’s a measure of whether people know enough about you to send you a dollar.” If people wonder why complaints about fairness are so frequently ignored, it’s because of circumstances like this one. The DNC is being really generous, their thresholds are low, and if you can’t reach one percent — one percent! In either national or early primary state polls! — then no, you really don’t belong up there on that debate stage. You’re not supposed to run for president because you want a national reputation; you’re supposed to have a national reputation before you run for president. Presidential campaigns are not supposed to be publicity stunts or longer book tours. If you want to be the next commander in chief, I don’t want to year you whining about how hard all of this is. The job that you claim to be qualified for is going to have much tougher challenges than reaching one percent in a survey or attracting 130,000 donors.

Observers of showbiz awards ceremonies — I like the way the Brits refer to the awards themselves as “gongs,” by the way, which I suppose makes the Oscars, Emmys, Tonys, and Grammys gong shows — will have noted by now that the entertainment community has largely calmed itself down about President Trump, at least when they’re trying to appeal to America as a whole. A year after Robert De Niro embarrassed himself with an R-rated outburst about Trump at the Tonys, there were no mentions of Trump broadcast on CBS at this year’s ceremony, unless I missed something. Host James Corden did his usual fun, nonpolitical song-and-dance stuff. The tone of the evening was mostly frothy. Things seemed more or less normal, for a change. Advertisement Advertisement
There were a few veiled allusions to Trump, notably when a couple of awardees claimed that we’re living through dark times. This statement would seem utterly absurd if, say, the exact same socioeconomic conditions in the U.S. obtained and Barack Obama were president. We aren’t in a state of upheaval. The economy is doing well. Things are better than they usually are. These people would be more honest if they said, “We are living through times in which I don’t like who the president is.” If they said that, of course, even they would realize how dumb they sound. As for the culture, the darkness there again is essentially in the statements of the president, not in any shocking reversal of fortune for the kinds of people who work on Broadway. The gay-acceptance theme that is always a big part of the Tonys is these days an afterthought; a big musical number from The Prom concluded with a lesbian kiss. That would have been news not too long ago. These days it merits less than a shrug. No one cares."
Oberlin College Faces 11 Million Dollar Fine for Libeling Local Business | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Fowler,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/jury-hammers-oberlin-for-libeling-local-business/,"Follow Jack Fowler on Twitter June 10, 2019 9:37 AM
A Lorain County, Ohio, jury on Friday nuked Oberlin College with an $11 million verdict, finding that the school and its dean of students, Meredith Raimondo, had libeled and harmed local business Gibson’s Bakery over a 2016 incident in which the store had had three shoplifters arrested. The trio, who pled to the charges in 2017, were black Oberlin students who quickly instigated protests — abetted by very willing school officials, acting in their formal roles — claiming Gibson’s was a racist business.

An overboard campaign to harm Gibson’s was a given in this climate: one of America’s most progressive colleges, amped-up leftist administrators (surely stewing over Trump’s victory), a student body loaded with social-justice warriors, an ignored crime (the kids were indeed stealing booze, and indeed pummeling the owner for attempting to stop them), “harassed” minorities, contrived claims of “a history of racial profiling,” a white-run local business, a convenient spot to protest .
And now a jury has begun to hand Oberlin and Raimondo the bill. Tomorrow begins the punitive (as opposed to compensatory) phase of its considerations. The total price tag could reach over $30 million. Advertisement"

California governor Gavin Newsom has finalized a deal with the state’s Democrat-controlled legislature to provide full health benefits to low-income illegal immigrants under the age of 26.
Newsom’s office released an outline of the state’s 2020 budget Sunday night that calls for $98 million in new annual spending to make some 90,000 previously uninsured illegal immigrants eligible for the state’s Medicaid program, according to the Sacramento Bee .
The new spending will be offset by a fine on uninsured Californians similar to the “individual mandate” imposed at the federal level under Obamacare and subsequently reversed by the Trump administration.

Not least among them: What is the Eucharist? Is it a tool to be used to facilitate a “Christian unity” that the pope insists “already” exists? Or is it an expression of full communion with the Roman Catholic Church? If the Church reverses herself and contradicts her unbroken Magisterium on the admission of schismatics and dissenters to the sacraments, what happens to her dogmatic integrity on other settled questions of faith and morals? Is the entire canon perpetually subject to the modish preferences of the current and future occupants of the Petrine chair? Most astounding, why is she unwilling to “wait for the theologians to come to agreement” before making a change of such gravity?
Theology, in St. Anselm’s classic formula, is fides quaerens intellectum — faith seeking understanding. If the pope’s goal is to formulate a discipline wherein faith is joined to right reason, there is nothing to fear in allowing rightly disposed “theologians to come to agreement on the Eucharist.” If his goal is to unshackle the Church from her bimillennial moorings, that is another project altogether, one that might not be aided by waiting for a consensus of theological opinion.

As the liberal priest Father Thomas Reese suggests , dissolving the statutory boundaries that surround reception of the Eucharist is part of Pope Francis’s broader insistence that “facts are more important than ideas.” What this triumph of “facts” over “ideas” is supposed to mean for a Church that communes with an invisible God and a cautiously preserved deposit of faith is unclear.
What “facts” conceivably justify reversing the Magisterial opposition to unregulated intercommunion with schismatics? More to the point — are there any “facts” in the Catholic imaginary that can be wholly separated from the Church’s “ideas” about God? And which of these free-floating “facts” are more important than the “ideas” that make them intelligible? What, for instance, is more important — the “fact” that Jesus of Nazareth was executed by Roman authorities in the first century, or the “idea” that His crucifixion was an atoning sacrifice for the sins of mankind? If it’s the former, why do Catholics go to Mass? Advertisement
If Catholic life is a series of brute “facts” with no broader intellectual coherence (“ideas”), then the entire practice of faith is a futile exercise. That intellectual novelty can be used to justify almost any change in the Church’s Magisterium, while those who insist on the preservation of the “ideas” that buttress Catholic faith are presumed to be angry scholastics and reactionaries thwarting the springtime of Vatican II. If “facts” and the Catholic intellectual frame (“ideas”) are at odds, then the entire Catholic understanding of the natural law and the broader philosophical project of the Church are a laughable sham.

This type of suggestive imprecision is not unusual for Francis . He has made a habit of using airplane press events to make what often amount to freewheeling, controversial claims about matters of Catholic faith and morality. The press corps will latch on to one or more of the pope’s remarks that appear to suggest a papal willingness to change a particular Church teaching, even though the pope has never explicitly said so. These statements, inasmuch as they appear to challenge settled matters of Church teaching, have left the faithful to wrestle with a recurring series of questions about the integrity of dogma and the difference between discipline and doctrine, and existential questions about inerrancy.
The first and most fundamental such question is this: Why does the Church believe what she does about the Eucharist? For centuries the Church has held to the doctrine of transubstantiation, whereby the “accidents” of bread and wine are changed into the literal Body and Blood of Christ when they are consecrated at the altar. And, lex credendi, lex orandi , Catholic liturgical practices demonstrate the Church’s belief in the reality of Christ’s Eucharistic immanence. The gathered faithful kneel in unison, prostrating before what appear to be ordinary bread and wine, as the piercing toll of bells and the rising smoke of incense mark the presence of Christ at the consecration. In an even more explicit sign of this belief, before the controversial liturgical reforms that came in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, members of the Church received the Eucharist on their knees as an ordained minister placed the Host on their tongues.
Belief in transubstantiation has both scriptural and patristic bases. It was one of Christ’s most polarizing teachings while on earth. Consider His words in Saint John’s Gospel:
Then Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say unto you: Except you eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you.
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath everlasting life: and I will raise him up in the last day.
For my flesh is meat indeed: and my blood is drink indeed.
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.
As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, the same also shall live by me.
Christ’s followers were (understandably) shaken by these words, which seemed to insist upon cannibalizing Jesus’ own Flesh and Blood. They responded in disbelief: “This saying is hard, and who can hear it?” Who can hear it indeed? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The Church Fathers themselves attest to the mystery of the bread and wine becoming the Body and Blood. Saint Irenaeus of Lyons, writing in a.d. 180, insisted that Christ “has declared the cup, a part of creation, to be his own Blood, from which he causes our blood to flow; and the bread, a part of creation, he has established as his own Body, from which he gives increase to our bodies.” Saints Justin Martyr, Clement of Rome, and the Didache ( The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles ) all attest to this ancient belief of the Church well before the third century a.d.
Given the unique and divisive teaching about the substantive nature of the consecrated bread and wine, Saint Paul’s exhortation to the Corinthians provided what would become the scriptural grounds for selective admission to the sacrament. Paul told the Corinthian church that those who received the Eucharist “unworthily” would be counted as “guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord,” a bold and forceful instruction that established a scriptural basis for future Church guidelines on admission to the sacrament. Advertisement
The early Church took Saint Paul’s instruction and sought to outline criteria for admission to the Eucharist. Saint Justin Martyr (c. 100–165), for instance, insisted that the Eucharist be open only to those who believe “that the things we teach are true, and has received the washing for forgiveness of sins and for rebirth, and who lives as Christ handed down to us.” The Eucharist was always considered to be an expression of unity with the Church, not a tool to display ecumenical zeal or a means to “break down barriers” among the masses.
Popes throughout the centuries were undivided in their opinion on the subject. Particularly before the Second Vatican Council, popes were stark in their indiscriminate opposition to intercommunion, considering it a profanation and an abject evil to be avoided. Pope Pius IX put it rather precisely in his encyclical Amantissimus (1862), where he proclaimed that “whoever eats of the Lamb and is not a member of the Church has profaned.” Advertisement
Such precision is of little import to the “innovators” that Pope Pius XII warned the faithful about. Give the “innovators” of the post-conciliar Church enough time and they will wiggle their way out of even the Church’s most unambiguous statements of antiquity.
Allowing any and all schismatic or heretical Christians to receive the Eucharist in non-extraordinary circumstances (circumstantial exceptions which, as it happens, are the product of doctrinal changes wrought by Vatican II) forces the Church to answer difficult existential questions, not altogether unlike others raised during Francis’s pontificate. To what degree can any pope change quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est — that which has been believed always, everywhere, and by everyone?
What is a legitimate development of doctrine? Can dogma even “develop” at all?
Questions about the extent of papal authority and the ability of dogma to “develop” would seem to have been settled by the First Vatican Council, convoked in June 1868 by Pope Pius IX. It provided the following concise explanation (emphasis mine):
For the Holy Spirit was not promised to the Successors of Peter that by His revelation they might disclose new doctrine, but that by His help they might guard the revelation transmitted through the apostles and the deposit of faith, and might faithfully set it forth. . . . Hence, also, that understanding of [the Church’s] sacred dogmas must be perpetually maintained, which Holy Mother Church has once declared; there must never be a recession from that meaning under the pretext of a deeper understanding .
It isn’t, in other words, within the papal domain to change what is revealed in sacred scripture or in the unbroken Tradition that proceeds from the first apostles. The notion that individual pontiffs are given unchecked license to enact sweeping reforms of ancient dogmas and disciplines “under the pretext of deeper understanding” is an abuse that the prelates of Vatican Council I explicitly forbade."
Joe Biden & China -- 2020 Democrat Is Convinced a Pro-China-Trade Stance Is a Winner | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-is-convinced-a-pro-china-trade-stance-is-a-winner/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter June 10, 2019 4:06 PM Joe Biden speaks during the kickoff rally of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidental nomination in Philadelphia, Pa., May 18, 2019. (Mark Makela/Reuters)
“Trump’s erratic and impulsive approach to China is causing families economic pain,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, told Politico . “Joe Biden would rally our friends and allies to hold China accountable.”
Joe Biden’s position on China as described by his campaign sounds a little different than the way he’s expressed it in the past month. Biden’s full quote from his May 1 remarks in Iowa:
China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west. They can’t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not competition for us.”
It would be easier to dismiss that as a sloppy off-the-cuff comment if he hadn’t said again in New Hampshire, May 13:
“What are we doing? We’re walking around with our heads down, ‘Woe is me.’ No other nation can catch us, including China. I got criticized for saying that. I’ve spent as much time with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping as any world leader has.”
Politico writes, “His nuanced message also has made it easy for critics to take liberties with his words.” But Biden hasn’t said much about uniting the world, or what actions he wants to hold China accountable for. He’s just making off-the-cuff remarks that suggest that anyone having any worries about a rising China is laughably paranoid and pessimistic.
Meanwhile, the Intercept laid out an issue that is certain to be brought up in discussions of Biden’s stance on China:
Hunter Biden’s investment company in China, known as Bohai Harvest RST, has pooled money, largely from state-owned venture capital, to buy or invest in a range of industries in the U.S. and China. Bohai Harvest has put money into an automotive firm, mining companies, and technology ventures, such as Didi Chuxing Technology, one of the largest ride-hailing companies in the world after Uber. (Hunter Biden, Bohai Harvest, and Joe Biden’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.)
In 2017, Bohai Harvest bought into Face++, part of a $460 million haul in the company’s Series C investment round. Bohai Harvest’s website features Face++ in its portfolio of investments.
A phone application made and used by the Chinese government for surveillance of citizens is built heavily on facial recognition software supplied by Face++. In other words, Hunter Biden’s firm invested in the company that helped build surveillance technology used by the Chinese authorities, with their Orwellian methods and abominable record on human rights. Perhaps the firm knew how the technology would be used, perhaps not; apparently they’re not answering questions from the Intercept.
Some Trump fans will seize on this and argue that Hunter Biden’s business dealings are evidence that Joe Biden has been bought off by China, an allegation that goes well beyond what is proven. Biden may just be consistently expressing his decades-long belief that China is a trustworthy trading partner. Advertisement"

Triumph Magazine: Catholics vs. Libertarians in the 1960s | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Declan Leary,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/catholic-libertarian-debate-triumph-magazine-brent-bozell/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Half a century ago, Brent Bozell was already saying that conservatives should elevate values above liberty.
I n the February 22, 1966, edition of National Review , William F. Buckley Jr. decried a widespread political confusion among American Catholics that had led to the public ascendance of such bumbling radicals as the Jesuit Daniel Berrigan . His column, which bore the troubling title “Catholic Chaos,” still ended on a note of hope: “The whole thing certainly underlines the desirability of an American journal of conservative Catholic opinion, which Mr. Brent Bozell, formerly an Editor of National Review , is attempting to launch.” Advertisement Advertisement
This journal — which eventually adopted the tragically ironic title Triumph — is almost entirely forgotten today. Even its founder, once a superstar of the burgeoning conservative movement, is mostly remembered (if at all) as Buckley’s brother-in-law and sometime collaborator. By the time it shut down in 1976, Triumph had lost many of its original supporters and gained very few new ones. Even the glowing support that Triumph had received from Buckley and National Review quickly turned to bitter, public opposition. The self-inflicted causes of this rapid decline might offer some valuable insights into radicalism — especially the kind common among right-wing Catholics in America — and, importantly, into its limits.
At Yale, Brent Bozell was president of the prestigious Yale Political Union and a force to be reckoned with in debate, alongside his partner, Buckley. In 1954, soon after graduating, the two co-authored a book , McCarthy and His Enemies , that led directly to Bozell’s employment as a speechwriter and close adviser to the controversial senator. From there, he was hired by Barry Goldwater, for whom he ghost-wrote the monumental Conscience of a Conservative (1960). (It is, of course, rarely noted today that Bozell wrote one of the landmark texts of modern American conservatism — a thoroughly libertarian text, too.) Advertisement
Much of Bozell’s reputation, however, came from his time with National Review . A senior editor from the magazine’s inception in 1955, he wrote a popular column on domestic politics, focusing on the direction of the GOP and the conservative movement and regularly savaging President Eisenhower, whom he viewed as weak and ineffective. As his colleagues (Frank Meyer, in particular) outlined their philosophy of fusionism — an understanding of conservatism as the intersection of traditionalism and libertarianism — Bozell distinguished himself in staunch opposition to the fusionist mode. In September 1962 he published “Freedom or Virtue?” in National Review , a lengthy response to Meyer’s “The Twisted Tree of Liberty.” Here, he argued that the simple absolutism of libertarian thought — i.e., the belief that liberty is the highest good in the political order — makes its primacy in any fusion inevitable. Thus, tradition and virtue would inevitably suffer for the sake of liberty. As Bozell saw it, the creation of laws intended to form virtue in citizens is well within the proper rights of government. (An example he used was the absence, at the time, of a divorce law in Franco’s Spain, a place dear to his heart for obvious reasons. For the libertarian or fusionist, this might have been a gross infringement on the freedom of citizens to break bonds of their own will. For Bozell, it did a great service in preventing people from committing unvirtuous acts.)
Moving further along this line of philosophical development — from libertarian fusionism to a strong Catholic traditionalism — and disturbed by the leftward trends of popular Catholic media, Bozell soon left National Review to establish a publication of his own. He had first flirted with the rather loaded title La Inquisición before settling on the subtler and more positive Future . But a copyright dispute forced him to change the title again, and Triumph finally appeared in print in September 1966. (It had been delayed even further by a strike of lightning that hit in the precise time and place the magazine was being printed. Make of that what you will.) Advertisement Advertisement
Triumph came out to a strong start, with contributions from many National Review notables, and even the intellectual titan Christopher Dawson, appearing in the maiden issue. But, driven mostly by Bozell himself, the magazine rapidly radicalized. Brent Bozell, whose The Warren Revolution , published just two years earlier, had been a massive achievement of constitutional scholarship, effectively denounced the U.S. Constitution altogether in “The Death of the Constitution” (1968). In another two years, he would go so far as to declare that the Catholic Church “must break the Articles of Peace; she must renounce the pluralist system; she must forthrightly acknowledge that a state of war exists between herself and the American political order.” His resolve was only hardened by the Roe v. Wade decision of 1973, and Triumph became firmly, feverishly anti-American. Bozell justified his stance in part with an apocalyptic prediction: “The liberal Republic is coming down. It could be a matter of months, at most a few years, before the wreckage is visibly upon us.”"
FBI Tragedy: Elites above the Law | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/fbi-tragedy-elites-above-law/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) After decades in the FBI, the top brass came to believe they could flout the law and pursue their own political agendas.
O ne of the media and beltway orthodoxies we constantly hear is that just a few bad apples under James Comey at the FBI explain why so many FBI elites have been fired, resigned, reassigned, demoted, or retired — or just left for unexplained reasons. The list is long and includes director James Comey himself, deputy director Andrew McCabe, counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok, attorney Lisa Page, chief of staff James Rybicki, general counsel James Baker, assistant director for public affairs Mike Kortan, Comey’s special assistant Josh Campbell, executive assistant director James Turgal, assistant director for office of congressional affairs Greg Bower, executive assistant director Michael Steinbach, and executive assistant director John Giacalone. In short, in about every growing scandal of the past two years — FISA, illegal leaking, spying on a presidential candidate, lying under oath, obstructing justice — someone in the FBI is involved. Advertisement Advertisement
We are told, however, that the FBI’s culture and institutions are exempt from the widespread wrongdoing at the top. Such caution is a fine and fitting thing, given the FBI’s more than a century of public service. Nonetheless, many of those caught up in the controversies over the Russian-collusion hoax were not recent career appointees. Rather, many came up through the ranks of the FBI. And that raises the question, for example, of where exactly Peter Strzok (22 years in the FBI) learned that he had a right to interfere in a U.S. election to damage a candidate that he opposed.
And why would an Andrew McCabe (over 21 years in the FBI) think he had the duty to formulate an “insurance policy” to take out a presidential candidate? Or why would he even consider overseeing an FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton’s improper use of emails when his wife had been a recent recipient of Clinton-related PAC money? And why would McCabe contemplate leaking confidential FBI information to the press or even dream of setting up some sort of operation to remove a sitting president under the 25th Amendment? And how did someone like the old FBI vet Peter Strozk ever end up at the center of the entire mess — opening up the snooping on the Trump campaign while hiding that fact and while briefing the candidate on Russian interference in the election, interviewing Michael Flynn, preening as a top FBI investigator for Robert Mueller’s dream team, right-hand man of “Andy” McCabe, convincing Comey to change the wording of his writ in the Clinton-email-scandal investigation, softball coddling of Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, instrumental in the Papadopoulos investigation con — all the while conducting an affair with fellow FBI investigator and attorney Lisa Page and bragging about his assurance that the supposedly odious Trump would be prevented from being elected. If a group of Trump zealots were to call up the FBI tomorrow and allege that a member of Joe Biden’s family has had unethical ties with the Ukrainian or Chinese government, would that gambit “alarm” the FBI enough to prompt an investigation of Biden and his campaign? How many career-professional Peter Strozks are still at the agency? Advertisement
In sum, why did so many top FBI officials, some with long experience in the FBI, exhibit such bad judgment and display such unethical behavior, characterized by arrogance, a sense of entitlement, and a belief that they were above both the law and the Constitution itself? Were they really just rogue agents, lawyers, and administrators, or are they emblematic of an FBI culture sorely gone wrong? Advertisement
How and why would James Comey believe that as a private citizen he had the right to leak classified memos of presidential conversations that he had recorded on FBI time and on FBI machines? Advertisement
Does the FBI inculcate behavior that prompts its officials to repeatedly testify under oath that they either don’t know or can’t remember — in a fashion that would earn an indictment for most similarly interrogated private citizens? Was Strozk’s testimony to the Congress emblematic of a career FBI agent in his full? Was Comey’s? Was McCabe’s?
To answer those questions, perhaps we can turn to an analogous example of special counsel and former FBI director Robert Mueller. We are always advised something to the effect that the admirable Vietnam War veteran and career DOJ and FBI administrator Bob Mueller has a sterling reputation, and thus we were to assume that his special-counsel investigation would be free from political bias. To suggest otherwise was to be slapped down as a rank demagogue of the worse kind. Advertisement
But how true were those beltway narratives? Mueller himself had a long checkered prosecutorial and investigative career, involving questionable decisions about the use of FBI informants in Boston, and overseeing absolutely false FBI accusations against an innocent suspect in the sensationalized anthrax case that began shortly after 9/11. Advertisement Advertisement
The entire Mueller investigation did not reflect highly either on Mueller or the number of former and current DOJ and FBI personnel he brought on to his team. In a politically charged climate, Mueller foolishly hired an inordinate number of political partisans, some of whom had donated to the Clinton campaign, while others had legally defended the Clinton Foundation or various Clinton and Obama aides. Mueller’s point-man Andrew Weissman was a known Clinton zealot with his own past record of suspect prosecutorial overreach.
Mueller did not initially disclose why FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strozk were taken off his investigative team, and he staggered their departures to suggest that their reassignments were normal rather than a consequence of the couple’s unprofessional personal behavior and their textual record of rank Trump hatred. Mueller’s very appointment was finessed by former FBI director and Mueller friend James Comey and was largely due to the hysteria caused by Comey’s likely felonious leaks of confidential and classified FBI memos — a fact of no interest to Mueller’s soon-to-be-expanded investigation. Advertisement
During the investigation, Mueller was quite willing to examine peripheral issues such as the scoundrelly behavior of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and the inside lobbying of Paul Manafort for foreign governments. Fine. But Mueller was curiously more discriminating in his non-interest in crimes far closer to the allegations of Russian collusion. That is, he was certainly uninterested about how and when the basis for his entire investigation arose — the unverified and fallacious Steele dossier that had been deliberately seeded among the FBI, CIA, and DOJ to achieve official imprimaturs so it could then be leaked to the press to ruin the campaign, transition, and presidency of Donald Trump.
Mueller’s team also deliberately edited a phone message from Trump counsel John Dowd to Robert Kelner, General Michael Flynn’s lawyer, to make it appear incriminating and possibly unethical or illegal. Only after a federal judge ordered the full release of the transcript did the public learn the extent of Mueller’s selective and misleading cut-and-paste of Dowd’s message. Advertisement
Mueller’s own explanations about the extent to which he was guided by the precedent of presidential exemption from indictment are at odds with his own prior statements and in conflict with what Attorney General Barr has reported from a meeting with Mueller and others. In those meetings, Mueller assured that he was after the truth and did not regard prior legal opinions about the illegality of indicting a sitting president as relevant to his own investigations. But when he essentially discovered he had no finding of collusion, he then mysteriously retreated to the previously rejected notion that he was powerless to indict Trump on a possible obstruction charge.
Mueller displayed further contortions when he recited a number of alleged Trump wrongdoings but then backed off by concluding that, while such evidence for a variety of different reasons did not justify an indictment of Trump, nonetheless Trump should not be exonerated of obstruction of justice.
Mueller thereby established a new but lunatic precedent in American jurisprudence in which a prosecutor who fails to find sufficient cause to indict a suspect nonetheless releases supposedly incriminating evidence, with a wink that the now-besmirched suspect cannot be exonerated of the alleged crimes. Think what Mueller’s precedent of not-not-guilty would do to the American criminal-justice system, as zealous prosecutors might fish for just enough dirt on a suspect to ruin his reputation, but not find enough for an indictment, thereby exonerating their own prosecutorial failure by defaming a “guilty until proven innocent” suspect.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that Mueller’s team knew early on in their investigation that his lead investigators Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had been correct in their belief that there was “no there there” in the charges of collusion — again the raison d’être of their entire investigation.
Yet Mueller’s team continued the investigation, aggregating more than 200 pages of unverified or uncorroborated news accounts, online essays, and testimonies describing all sorts of alleged unethical behavior and infelicities by Trump and his associates, apparently in hopes of compiling their own version of something like the Steele dossier. Mueller sought to publish a compendium of Trump bad behavior that fell below the standard of criminal offense but that would nonetheless provide useful fodder for media sensationalism and congressional partisan efforts to impeach the now supposedly not-not guilty president.
Note again, at no time did Muller ever investigate the Steele dossier that had helped to create his existence as special counsel, much less whether members of the FBI and DOJ had misled a FISA court by hiding critical information about the dossier to obtain wiretaps of American citizens, texts that Mueller himself would then use in his effort to find criminal culpability. Advertisement
We were told throughout the 22-month investigation that “Bob Mueller does not leak.” But almost on a weekly schedule, left-wing cable news serially announced in formulaic fashion that “the walls were closing in on” and the “noose was tightening around” Trump as another “bombshell” disclosure was anticipated, according to “sources close to the Mueller investigation,” “unnamed sources,” and “sources who chose to remain unidentified.” On one occasion, CNN reporters mysteriously showed up in advance at the home of a Mueller target, to capture on camera the arrival of paramilitary-like arresting officers.
When it is established beyond a doubt that foreign surveillance of and contact with George Papadopoulos was used to entrap a minor Trump aide as a means of providing an ex post facto justification for the earlier illegal FBI and CIA surveillance of the Trump campaign, and when it is shown without doubt that Steele had little if any corroborating evidence for his dirty dossier, Mueller’s reputation unfortunately will be further eroded.
Yet the question is not merely whether a Comey, McCabe, or Mueller is atypical of the FBI. Rather, where in the world, if not from the culture of the FBI, did these elite legal investigators absorb the dangerous idea that FBI lawyers and investigators could flout the law and in such arrogant fashion use their vast powers of the government to pursue their own political agendas? And why was there no internal pushback at a supercilious leadership that demonstrably had gone rogue? Certainly, the vast corpus of the Strzok-Page correspondence does reflect a unprofessional, out-of-control culture at the FBI. "
Abortion Politics: Progressives Use Corporate Influence | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/abortion-debate-ceo-statement-planned-parenthood/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter June 11, 2019 6:30 AM Planned Parenthood president Dr. Leana Wen speaks at a protest against anti-abortion legislation at the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., May 21, 2019. (James Lawler Duggan/Reuters) As CEOs back abortion on demand, progressives are prepared to use corporate influence to enforce their twisted morality.
I n the wake of outrage over abortion restrictions, corporations can be people once again. Afraid of losing access to “reproductive rights,” progressives have rediscovered their fondness for using corporate influence to cow their moral inferiors into submission.
The latest culprit in need of chastisement is the pro-life movement, which after decades of persistent work has sustained several consecutive months of policy success, passing legislation in state after state to limit the killing of unborn human beings. Advertisement Advertisement
Accustomed to the country’s longstanding regime of abortion on demand, our cultural gatekeepers are incensed at their first taste of defeat — and only a moderate one at that. Thanks to Anthony Kennedy, none of these restrictions will take effect unless the Supreme Court hears a challenge to Planned Parenthood v. Casey and affirms states’ right to regulate abortion. Though momentum seems to be shifting in the pro-life direction, such a moment likely is still far off.
But that hasn’t prevented a left-wing outcry the intensity of which suggests it is abortion above all else that dominates the minds of the men and women leading our nation’s foremost companies. Spearheaded by Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Center for Reproductive Rights, nearly 200 CEOs have signed a statement titled “Don’t Ban Equality.”
Penned in Planned Parenthood’s signature font — though you have to read the website’s “About” page to uncover the prolific abortion provider’s predictable involvement — the letter insists that “it’s time for companies to stand up for reproductive healthcare.” Advertisement Advertisement
Signed by the CEOs of Bloomberg, Square, Slack, MAC Cosmetics, Warby Parker, Postmates, and Yelp, among others, the letter also appeared as a full-page ad in Monday’s New York Times . And it wasn’t the first act of corporate resistance to pro-life legislation; just a few weeks ago, several major film companies loudly mulled over whether to cease production in Georgia over the state’s effort to regulate abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected.
In their haste to assist women supposedly dependent on abortion to flourish in our economy, these CEOs seem to have forgotten the progressive edict that “ corporations aren’t people .” The most recent iteration of this argument was handed down during the debate over the HHS mandate, which required businesses to cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in employee health-insurance plans.
Hobby Lobby, we were told, could not refuse to comply on moral grounds because Hobby Lobby is a company , not a person . Its owners’ personal beliefs mattered not at all. Progressives objected to the Green family, which owns Hobby Lobby, asserting its beliefs, in the same way that they objected to Citizens United : vociferously. Advertisement
It is, of course, a total myth that corporations can’t act as people under U.S. law. The very first provision of the U.S. code denotes “person” as including corporations, and an 1819 Supreme Court case arguably initiated the concept of “corporate personhood” under the Constitution. The progressive framework on this point, then, is fundamentally wrong, and left-wing partisans go on to apply this misbegotten principle inconsistently. Advertisement
Corporations can’t be people and can’t espouse beliefs — until those corporations are run by people espousing beliefs that reinforce the spirit of the Left’s cause du jour. The same voices that tried to compel the owners of Hobby Lobby to contradict their conscience were overjoyed when CEOs, including Apple’s Tim Cook, threatened to boycott Indiana over the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.
Now that abortion access is on the chopping block, it has become imperative for corporations to have their say. A recent Washington Post analysis suggested that “corporations have been deafeningly silent” on abortion restrictions, “despite years of speaking out on social issues.” The author noted that “a confluence of forces could make it more challenging for companies to remain quiet on the sidelines, dragging them into a contentious national discussion at a time when more employees and consumers expect corporations to take a stand on social issues.” Advertisement
Aside from revealing the Left’s own contradictions on corporate personhood and social justice, the stand taken by this week’s corporate manifesto exposes one of the sinister principles animating progressive support for abortion. “Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, . . . is bad for business,” the CEOs assert. This isn’t the first time in our history that a significant faction of the country has justified perpetrating a grave moral evil against the human person for the sake of economic gains."
Desmond Napoles and Gender-Identity Ideology | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/desmond-napoles-gender-identity-ideology/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM Desmond Napoles in New York City, March 7, 2019. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) An eleven-year-old drag performer should inspire fierce protest.
I t so happens that the issue that launched the recent fracas on the American Right is in my own dispiriting beat: the effects of gender-identity policies on children. Disputes about “strategy” aside, conservatives can all agree that a culture that permits the sexualization and sterilization of children’s bodies is a rotten one. As I’ve written before, there are plenty of people on the left who think so too. Advertisement Advertisement
Take the case of “Desmond is Amazing,” the toxic brand created for eleven-year-old Desmond Napoles: a “drag kid,” a fashion model, and a global LGBT icon. A drag kid, much the same as a drag queen, presents himself as a sexualized caricature of a woman, dressing in bright wigs, flamboyant gowns, high heels, exaggerated makeup, etc. If I were a feminist, I might suspect latent misogyny and find the entire practice odious, but, at any rate, I draw the line at children.
Desmond’s parents draw no such line. Instead, his mother, Wendylou Napoles, justifies “Desmond is Amazing” by insisting, first, that his performances are age-appropriate ( we aren’t sexualizing him) and, second, that this is all his idea ( we are so supportive). Advertisement
The facts, however, do not support this account.
In December 2018, Desmond, imitating Gwen Stefani, performed at a Brooklyn gay bar in a wig and crop-top as hooting adult men threw dollar bills. When outraged critics descended, Wendylou accused them of “blatant homophobia.” Her story, well-rehearsed by this point, is that, at the age of two, Desmond was watching RuPaul’s Drag Race with her when he conceived a pre-verbal thought that “the drag queens were so beautiful and amazing” and “I want to do that!” Advertisement
Wendylou, a former human-resources manager, then began taking her son — who, according to his parents, is on the autism spectrum — to pride marches when he was four years old. This was because, in addition to her discovery of his interest in drag, she had “known for a long time” that he was gay.
For a long time. (Desmond says he “came out as gay” when he was born.) Advertisement
Here I recall the babble of Diane Ehrensaft, the developmental psychologist and founding member of the Child and Adolescent Gender Center clinic in San Francisco, who maintains that female toddlers can send a “gender message” by tearing bows out of their hair and saying things such as “I. Boy.” And I recall, more seriously, Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSBP): the mental-health disorder created when a caregiver invents a condition in the person he cares for and subsequently distorts, manipulates, or engineers the appearance of symptoms. MSBP is considered a form of child abuse.
Desmond’s new career obviously keeps his mom very busy. She calls herself his “dragager” and runs his Instagram account, which has more than 150,000 followers. She also oversees his busy schedule of media appearances. Sometimes Desmond appears in home videos along with famous figures in adult drag culture. Such figures include Bella Noche, whom Desmond conducted a Facebook livestream with, in which Desmond referenced ketamine and imitated snorting it. Desmond recently told HuffPost that the Club Kids of the early 1990s were his inspiration, making clear to emphasize that he was talking about “their fashion and makeup” and “not the bad things.” Advertisement
Presumably these “bad things” include the behavior of Michael Alig, a Club Kid and a friend of Desmond’s, who served 17 years in prison for beating his drug dealer to death, soaking his body in acidic liquids for over a week, dismembering the corpse, and dumping it in the Hudson. Advertisement
When Desmond appeared on Alig’s YouTube channel, along with Alig’s former roommate Ernie Glam, he sat in front of a painting of a girl with the word “Rophypnol” (the date-rape drug) scrawled across it. But judging from Alig’s recent artwork — I am thinking of one painting in particular that combines the artist’s semen with an image of Hitler’s face — he has had no such conversion. In any case: Where did a child born in 2007 get such a love for 1990s club culture?
It’s not just his mother’s influence. Desmond’s dad is on board. As is his progressive Brooklyn school. As are the hosts of Good Morning America , Today , and BBC Minute, as well as countless others who consider it important to celebrate Desmond’s “individuality.” Desmond, we are told, is “the future.” And what a brave new world it is!
Drag Queen Story Hours are now happening in schools and libraries across the United States. In the United Kingdom, Munroe Bergdorf, a male-to-female transgender activist who has modeled for Playboy and who pushes radical gender-identity policies for children at every opportunity, became the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children’s first LGBT+ campaigner. Advertisement Advertisement
Last year Bergdorf conducted a celebratory interview with “Desmond is Amazing.” Afterward, the lesbian activist Julia Long attended a meeting and asked Bergdorf a question about Desmond’s safety. Long mentioned his connection with Alig and his performances for adult men. She said: “I wondered what you thought about this normalization of child abuse?” Long was then booed and made to leave the event.
Janice Turner, a columnist for the Times of London who is also on the left, similarly wrote on Twitter: “Hey @NSPCC can you please explain why a children’s safeguarding charity has hired a porn model as a Childline ambassador? It’s an astonishing decision. Is it worth the cancelled direct debits?” Hey @NSPCC can you please explain why a children’s safeguarding charity has hired a porn model as a Childline ambassador? It’s an astonishing decision. Is it worth the cancelled direct debits?
— Janice Turner (@VictoriaPeckham) June 6, 2019
Thankfully, the charity has bowed to such pressure and since cut all ties with Bergdorf. Advertisement
I will conclude with two final points:
1. Gender-identity ideology should not be underestimated. It is not a fringe issue. It is a well-funded and mobilized attempt to sanitize the exploitation and sexualization of children vis-à-vis “gender.” Gender demagogues mask the ideology’s relationship to sex and sexuality, using the LGBT umbrella as a political and personal shield."
'1984' at 70: What Would George Orwell Think of Us? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/george-orwell-1984-anniversary/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM (Toby Melville/Reuters) Seventy years after 1984 ’s publication, the question is worth asking.
G eorge Orwell’s 1984 was published 70 years ago this month, and he died a few months after it was published. Suppose that he hadn’t, though. Suppose that he’d been cryogenically frozen in his last days, and reanimated in 2019. Whose side would he be on in our trying political moment? What would he think of us? Advertisement
His first reaction, I think, would be to pull a Moscow on the Hudson and, like Robin Williams’s Russian defector when confronted by the superabundance of coffee choices in the grocery store, collapse in a heap of confusion. “How did I get it so wrong?” he would ask. The world did not, as he foretold, divide itself into three totalitarian superstates. Nor did the stark gray privations of Soviet central planning or wartime rationing, which continued in Britain until four years after Orwell’s death, become permanent. It is not today the norm to live in something like a forced-labor camp powered by terror. Orwell would surely notice that Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, with its tranquil populations of pretty people living in a pleasing soma tupor, was closer to the mark than 1984 . Weighing the evidence on central planning, he would be forced to conclude that it had never produced the desired results and had instead sown lies and illiberalism.
Orwell had already turned away from the radical Left by the time he died; late in life, sensing the Soviet menace, he compiled a list of 35 public intellectuals he believed were “crypto-communists and fellow travelers,” and sent it to the British Foreign Office. Yet claiming he stood for the Right while he was alive would be a fool’s errand. Christopher Hitchens once put it well: “George Orwell was conservative about many things, but not about politics.” Advertisement
Like Thomas Jefferson, he had a tendency to consider a matter from different vantage points, and like Hitchens, a talent for provocation. Always there was a core of between-ness, a quality of being both one thing and the other, Eric Blair and George Orwell. He stood out as an Englishman in Burma, and within the English he stood out as peculiarly sympathetic toward “the natives.” He went to Eton, but as a scholarship boy, not a child of privilege. On the other hand, when he went undercover to lead a pauper’s existence for Down and Out in Paris and London , the real hobos knew he wasn’t one of them: His posh accent betrayed him.
Though Orwell defined himself as a democratic-socialist in “Why I Write,” he could write caustically about his supposed associates, as in, “‘Socialism’ and ‘Communism’ draw towards them with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, ‘Nature Cure’ quack, pacifist, and feminist in England.” That famous passage comes from The Road to Wigan Pier , in which he confesses to having once had an anti-statist bent: “I worked out an anarchistic theory that all government is evil, that the punishment always does more harm than the crime and the people can be trusted to behave decently if you will only let them alone.” The leave-me-alone plea popped up again in “Politics in the English Language” (1946), in which he wrote wearily, “In our age there is no such thing as ‘keeping out of politics.’” The Left’s present tendency to politicize everything would have horrified him. Advertisement Advertisement
Given the breadth of Orwell’s political thinking, it’s a matter of conjecture where he might find an ideological home today. But I find his socialism to be primarily a response to privation. Desperate impecuniousness runs through his writing; in his self-mocking novel Keep the Aspidistra Flying , about a lovelorn writer-cum-bookseller named Gordon Comstock, the protagonist lives for weeks on nothing but bread and margarine, so frazzled he can’t think of anything but money. He can’t write. He can’t get a girlfriend. He can’t socialize. He calls poverty a “filthy sub-world,” “a sort of spiritual sewer,” “spiritual halitosis.” (Filth is a recurring fascination for Orwell: recall those miners, in Wigan Pier , who spent six days a week completely black from the waist down because they didn’t have bathtubs, only basins.)
Knowing what Orwell knew about poverty, about how it rent your soul, flayed your nerves, ate away at your very skin and lungs, he could hardly fail to observe that the underclass of today’s Britain lives in relative splendor. Showers every day? Really ? Deaths from infectious disease down 95 percent since the time I was born? Compared even to middle-class people of his day, the average council-flats resident has comforts and leisure opportunities beyond measure. He needn’t spend twelve hours a day at harsh labor; he needn’t necessarily work at all. What Orwell hoped socialism would achieve has instead been delivered by a capitalist-funded welfare state. Orwell thought of the poor as decent people, but he’d be baffled to observe today that the welfare state has created a class of layabouts who, liberated from economic anguish, shackle themselves to screens, drugs, alcohol. Advertisement
Meanwhile, the class he thought of as the idle rich are also largely a relic of the past: Today’s elite is peopled by bustling, dynamic urban professionals — the new empire builders. Orwell castigates Kipling for being racist and imperialist but also notes that such men “were at any rate people who did things,” “changed the face of the earth,” and could not have maintained themselves in India “for a single week” if “the normal Anglo-Indian outlook had been that of, say, E.M. Forster.” He derided languid, effete intellectuals as “pansy-left circles.” Advertisement Advertisement
The British welfare state’s conquering of brutal poverty would, I think, fire up the Tory side of Orwell. Why, he would ask, does no one care about character anymore? Should the state subsidize endless self-indulgence? Why do all of the enlightened liberals think that there should be no strings attached to welfare payments? “‘Enlightened’ people,” Orwell wrote in his essay on Kipling, “seldom or never possess a sense of responsibility.” Advertisement"
CEO Pro-Abortion Statement: Absurdity and Euphemism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/ceo-pro-abortion-statement-new-york-times/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter June 11, 2019 6:30 AM Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Twitter’s algorithms and content monitoring on Capitol Hill, September 5, 2018. (Chris Wattie/Reuters) Has it not occurred to these business leaders that unborn children will grow up to buy their products or work for their companies?
C larity of thought and expression about moral issues is not a core competency of CEOs.
If anyone had any doubt, look no further than the “historic” pro-abortion statement by nearly 200 CEOs that ran in a full-page ad in the New York Times . It is a festival of absurdity and euphemism, an exercise in perverse virtue-signaling to a progressive audience that believes that maintaining one of the most permissive pro-abortion regimes in the developed world is a virtue. Advertisement Advertisement
The CEOs define abortion as “equality” (“Don’t Ban Equality”) and, of course, refer to it as “comprehensive reproductive care,” the ubiquitous phrase that has the advantage of sounding like the opposite of what it’s describing.
The CEOs contend that abortion is central to their businesses, which might be true if all of their companies had the same business model as Planned Parenthood, one of the organizers of the effort. But Bloomberg L.P., Amalgamated Bank, and H&M, to name three of the companies whose CEOs signed the ad, are hardly dependent on abortion to thrive.
The old saw was, “What’s good for General Motors is good for America.” Now, according to top CEOs, what’s good for abortion is good for American business. They seem to consider abortion a crucial component of GDP just like personal consumption, business investment, government spending, and net exports. Advertisement Advertisement
They argue that “equality in the workplace” is an important business issue, and it is impossible to achieve without unrestricted access to abortion. Any restriction “threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers.”
The idea that abortion is necessary for the health of women is one of the most misleading pro-abortion cliches. Comprehensive data from Florida last year shows that three-quarters of abortions were elective, and another one-fifth were for social and economic reasons. A small percentage involve a threat to the mother’s life or health, and pro-life laws account for such cases — even the sweeping Alabama law has a health exception.
The contention that restrictions put “the economy at risk” is nonsensical. Are we supposed to believe that the reduction of the abortion rate in the U.S. from its high in 1980 of 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women of childbearing age to its post-Roe v. Wade low of 14.6 as of 2014 has been a calamity for corporate America? On what grounds? Do these CEOs really lament that we don’t have the abortion rate of Bulgaria, Cuba, or Kazakhstan? Advertisement
By this standard, Utah must be a terrible place to do business since its abortion rate is so low, and the District of Columbia an enticing place to do business since its abortion rate is so high. (To the contrary, Forbes ranks Utah as the second-best state for business in the country.) Advertisement
The implication is that these CEOs prefer that their employees and customers not become mothers, or if they are mothers, not have more children. It apparently hasn’t occurred to them that unborn children will grow up to buy their products or perhaps work for their firms one day, and indeed all the employees they claim to be protecting were themselves, once, vulnerable in the womb.
At the end of the day, their argument isn’t really about restrictions being “bad for business.” What they care about most is that such policies, as they say, go “against our values.” Advertisement
The CEO ad is another sign that the debate over abortion has entered a new phase. It isn’t enough to say that abortion should be safe, legal and rare, the old Bill Clinton formulation, because that implies a moral disapproval. Now, abortion is a positive good. A stance that used to be limited to the fringes is mainstream enough that CEOs are willing to sign up for it. "
Paul Manafort in Solitary Confinement: Leftism Makes People Meaner | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/paul-manafort-treatment-leftism-makes-people-meaner/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort departs from U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., February 28, 2018. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) Reflections on the torture of Paul Manafort
T he sadistic treatment of Paul Manafort illustrates something I have believed since I attended graduate school in the 1970s and saw the behavior of left-wing students: Leftism makes people meaner.
There are kind and mean conservatives and kind and mean liberals. Neither liberalism nor conservatism makes people kinder or meaner. But this is not the case with leftism. With the handful of exceptions that accompany every generalization, leftism makes people meaner, even crueler. Advertisement Advertisement
Take the transfer of Manafort, the onetime Trump campaign manager, from a federal prison to New York’s Rikers Island jail. Rikers Island is universally regarded as a wretched place. As Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz wrote:
“The decision to move Paul Manafort . . . from the decent federal prison to which he was sentenced to solitary confinement to the dangerous hell hole that is New York City’s Rikers Island seems abusive and possibly illegal.
“I know Rikers well having spent time there visiting numerous defendants accused of murder and other violent crimes. It is a terrible place that no one should ever be sent to.” Advertisement
Mass murderers and torturers are among those incarcerated at Rikers Island.
Moreover, Manafort, found guilty solely of white-collar crimes, will be placed in solitary confinement — “for his own safety.” Advertisement
Virtually everyone who has written about solitary confinement, both on the right and on the left, deems it torture. Manafort will therefore be tortured after being sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment for fraud and, in the words of the Daily Wire , “a little-known law that requires lobbyists to report that they are working on behalf of a foreign government (in Manafort’s case, Ukraine).”
Angry over the possibility that Manafort may be pardoned by President Trump, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., charged Manafort with additional crimes based on state law. That way, if found guilty of state offenses, he cannot be pardoned by Trump, as the president’s power to pardon applies only to federal, not state, crimes.
Everyone knows this prosecution is politically motivated. Vance hates the president and wants to use solitary confinement in a hellhole with violent criminals to squeeze Manafort into testifying against the president. Advertisement
As Dershowitz said to me on my radio show, what Vance is doing reminds him of Stalin and Beria — the infamous state prosecutor, a man Stalin referred to as “my Himmler.” Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal Democrat and supporter of Hillary Clinton, does not use Stalin analogies loosely. Advertisement
To her credit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: “A prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That’s what solitary confinement is. Manafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary.”
I might add that my opposition to Manafort’s treatment is not partisan or new. On a number of occasions over the years, I have cited favorably New York Review of Books articles describing the horror of solitary confinement.
Despite its history of opposition to solitary confinement, the New York Times article reporting the plan to relocate Manafort said nothing against the unnecessary transfer but did comment on the expensive suits Manafort used to wear.
Solitary confinement is “basically a deathtrap,” former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik wrote when Manafort was placed in solitary at his federal prison. Manafort never should have been sentenced to solitary confinement. But Robert Mueller (and Judge Amy Berman Jackson) sought it for the same political reason Vance has: to break the man. Advertisement
As former federal prosecutor Sidney Powell wrote: “When a witness or defendant from whom prosecutors want ‘cooperation’ does not do as they demand, they put him in solitary confinement. And it works. It literally breaks people.
“Solitary does have a place in our prison system, but only for those people who are simply too dangerous to be placed around others at all. However, the torture of solitary confinement should never be used as it is now to break people to prosecutors’ will — to torture them until they will say or do anything to get out.
“Solitary is also called the ‘hole.’ It’s a small space, barely large enough to stand, with a slit for light, to which prisoners are confined/caged for 23 hours a day. . . . Advertisement
“Paul Manafort, seventy years old, has endured this torture for eight months. He’s now in a wheelchair, while Judge Amy Berman Jackson mocks his rapidly deteriorating health. Where is the outcry from the ACLU?”
So, then, what enables Vance, Mueller, and Jackson to engage in such evil? Advertisement
The only answer is their politics — the politics of the Trump-hating Left. Cyrus Vance, Robert Mueller, and Amy Berman Jackson may well be good parents, loving spouses, loyal friends, and charitable individuals. But leftism has given them permission to act vilely and mercilessly while thinking of themselves as fine people — just as evil doctrines have done throughout history.
As noted at the beginning of this column, when I was at Columbia, I witnessed this leftist mean-spiritedness firsthand in the personal cruelty of left-wing agitators against professors and others with whom they differed.
Here’s a question perhaps millions of parents will be able to answer: If your child returned home from college a leftist, was he or she a kinder or meaner person than before he or she left for college? Advertisement"
Catholic Church's Statement on Gender Ideology Isn't Bigotry | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/catholic-church-statement-gender-ideology-not-bigotry/,"June 11, 2019 6:30 AM Transgender rights activists protest at the White House, October 22, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Our contemporary gender ideology will eventually be judged by its consequences.
P eter died a criminal’s death sometime around Anno Domini 64; three short centuries later, Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in the midst of a controversy pitting bishop against bishop and bishop against emperor ; the papacy eventually grew into a princely power, one that subsequently was narrowly circumscribed by its secular rivals; in the modern era, the charismatic and sainted Pope John Paul II emerged as one of the world’s three most important political figures in the confrontation with Communism and made the Kremlin shake in spite of his having the command of not a single division of men at arms and operating with a budget roughly comparable to that of a mid-size state university. From these events and others the Catholic Church’s intellectual apparatus has concluded that ideas matter, and that for the Church in the world, political ideas matter. Advertisement Advertisement
For this reason, the Catholic Church’s education committee, the Congregation for Catholic Education, formally, has turned its attention to one of the peculiar and destructive ideas of our time, what it describes as “the theory of a radical separation between gender and sex, with the former having priority over the latter.” The Church has made a statement on this notion in “Male and Female He Created Them: Towards a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education.” The stakes here are high, as the Church sees it, employing language that will be entirely familiar to American conservatives: “Similar theories aim to annihilate the concept of nature,” the document reads, “that is, everything we have been given as a preexisting foundation of our being and action in the world.”
Naturally, the New York Times is outraged, uncritically quoting demonstrably untrue claims from activists that the statement “encourages hatred, bigotry, and violence” against transgender people, a very strange claim to make about a document that speaks of “the need to educate children and young people to respect every person in their particularity and difference, so that no one should suffer bullying, violence, insults or unjust discrimination based on their specific characteristics (such as special needs, race, religion, sexual tendencies, etc.). Essentially, this involves educating for active and responsible citizenship, which is marked by the ability to welcome all legitimate expressions of human personhood with respect.” If only this were how the world expressed its “bigotry and violence,” what a happy world it would be. Advertisement
There is a very interesting book to be written — a century from now, or two — about the strange and unlikely career of the word gender , a grammatical term and concept that somehow managed to displace, in much of the modern mind, the self-evident facts of sexual dimorphism in the species H. sap ., partly in the service of a set of political ideas and tendencies that we call, for lack of a better term, progressivism . One of the remarkable characteristics of progressivism is that its adherents claim to be partisans of “science,” rationally and empirically following the evidence where it leads — and then retreating into rank mysticism and half-baked metaphysics when the facts prove unappealing or discommoding. This is why in the matter of abortion progressives prefer to traffic in vague metaphysical claims regarding “personhood” rather than the facts of what happens in an abortion. And it is why we now speak more about “gender” than about “sex.”
(Because “gender” is an infinitely plastic concept, it can be put to almost any end. For example, there is a sub-entry discussing the issue of “gender” in the Wikipedia article about Nepalese sorghum .) Advertisement Advertisement
Because I am a conservative, I find it impossible to take seriously the notion, heard so frequently in 2016, that the state of this or that “couldn’t be any worse.” Things could always be worse, and so I am not very eager to fast-forward through the next 200 years of political and intellectual development (or decadence) to see where things end up. But the optimist in me suspects that the ridiculous mysticism of our contemporary gender ideology eventually will be understood as a foray into an especially contemptible kind of mysticism to be classed alongside phrenology, “ scientific racism ,” astrology, etc. That the Catholic Church should have acted as one of the brakes on that daft mysticism will perhaps perplex the Bill Mahers of the world, who understand so little about it.
I am optimistic on that front because I believe in the value of experimentation, and because I believe — to repeat — that ideas matter . Ideas have real-world consequences, some of which are immediate and dramatic enough that they can instruct even the citizens of democracies, who are so often so immune to learning. The choices we make about the kinds of lives we live, the kinds of families we have, the kinds of communities we have, the ways in which we raise children, the assumptions and concepts and limitations we associate with sex and child-bearing (which are, the Catholic Church would remind us, related), our intellectual models of childhood and parenthood — the intelligence and value of all these should, over time, show up in the data.

On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the historic first summit meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump, North Korean state news agency KCNA upped tensions between the two countries, demanding Tuesday that the U.S. “withdraw its hostile policy” toward the state or face the disintegration of an agreement reached at the summit.
In a press release, KCNA warned that the four-point agreement the two leaders signed last year “is in danger of being a blank sheet of paper because the U.S. is turning a blind eye to its implementation.”
“The arrogant and unilateral U.S. policy will never work on the DPRK [Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] which values sovereignty,” the release stated . “Now is the time for the U.S. to withdraw its hostile policy concerning the DPRK.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

It was not immediately clear what specific U.S. policy changes the North Korean government hoped to effect. The agreement reached at last year’s summit included pledges to foster a new relationship between North Korea and the U.S., establish peace on the Korean Peninsula, work toward denuclearizing North Korea, and repatriate the remains of deceased U.S. soldiers in North Korea.

1986 —In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Blackmun (in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ), declares unconstitutional the informed-consent (and various other) provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982.
The ruling triggers three noteworthy dissents: Chief Justice Burger, who was part of the majority in Roe v. Wade , says that if the result in Thornburgh is consistent with Roe , then “we should reexamine Roe .” Justice White, the JFK appointee who dissented in Roe , expressly calls for Roe to be overruled. And Justice O’Connor observes that Justice Blackmun’s majority opinion “makes it painfully clear that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion.” (Six years later, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey , O’Connor will practice the same ad hoc nullification of legal rules on abortion that she decries.) Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "

Sir William Gladstone, the famous 19th-century British politician, was, broadly speaking, a man of principle. Not all of his principles were noble — despite his personal opposition to slavery, Gladstone expressed sympathy for the Confederacy (he was something of a Tim Kaine progenitor in this respect) — but his deeply held beliefs about free trade and liberalism shaped British politics for decades after his death. “The People’s William,” as he came to be known, earned the praise of fellow Liberal parliamentarian John Bright, who noted in his typically English prose that he could not think of one man in the country “who equals” Gladstone “in earnestness.” Advertisement Advertisement
Gladstone famously insisted that if he were shown “the manner in which a nation cares for its dead” he would be able to “measure with mathematical exactness the tender mercies of its people, their respect for the laws of the land, and their loyalty to high ideals.”
The Trump administration displayed their “loyalty to high ideals” by refusing to continue National Institutes of Health research involving “fetal tissue”— a popular euphemism used to avoid saying the words “dismembered corpses of unborn children” out loud. Reports say that the president acted unilaterally on this matter, defying the expressed will of Health and Human Services head Alex Azar. Advertisement"

For years, the assisted suicide movement has been pressuring medical associations to assume positions of “ studied neutrality ” about the legalization of assisted suicide. Never mind that taking no position on one of the most important medical-ethical controversies of our era is a cowardly abdication of doctors’ crucial leadership role in society.

Immigration: Trump Is Vulnerable to Biden on the Issue | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/trump-vulnerable-biden-immigration-issue/,"Follow Michael Brendan Dougherty on Twitter June 11, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump participates in a roundtable discussion on immigration and border security at the U.S. Border Patrol Calexico Station in Calexico, Calif., April 5, 2019. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) And the president seems to know it.
I n recent days Trump has resorted to calling in to a cable news progra m to explain how his threat of tariffs against Mexico resulted in a substantial win on immigration or trade policy for the United States. It’s hard to see how he accomplished his goal of pressuring Mexico to do more to end movement through its country into the U.S. Trump declared victory before a shot was fired in this war. But in the meantime Mexican officials are correcting the record: Their country has not agreed to purchase more agricultural goods, and it has resisted American demands to accept the status of a “safe third country,” which would require Central American asylum seekers to apply in Mexico if they land there before reaching the United States. As with North Korea, the president created drama in the headlines, quickly accepted the bare minimum gesture from the other side, and declared victory. Advertisement Advertisement
And one can see that on this issue Trump might be especially vulnerable to the man leading in the Democratic polls, Joe Biden. At a superficial level, Biden will be able to attack Trump from the right and the left on immigration. In one breath he can hit Trump’s policies for being cruel and unusual. In the next, he can point out that we still have lawlessness, chaos, at the border. In fact, he could say that, besides the policy of child separation, Trump’s legacy on immigration is a dramatic increase in illegal crossings. Advertisement
And that may be enough.
Appropriately in a primary setting, Biden has been emphasizing his position on the left side of the debate, saying that undocumented immigrants are “already Americans” and calling out Trump’s policies on child separation at the border as being cruel and damaging to America’s reputation and foreign relations.
But he could easily pivot back to the center. He has been in politics long enough to be on a few sides of this issue. He could point out that he has voted for hundreds of miles of border barrier in the past. Like Trump, he connected the lack of a fenc e to “tons” of drugs coming over the border. In a previous run for president, in 2007 and 2008, he denounced sanctuary cities. Advertisement
Researchers have uncovered video showing Biden denouncing illegals and saying, “You can build a fence 40 stories high — unless you change the dynamic in Mexico and — and you will not like this, and — punish American employers who knowingly violate the law when, in fact, they hire illegals.” Nothing that Biden says now precludes him from striking a more law-and-order note. Advertisement
In fact, if he is the nominee, you can expect him to brag that the Obama administration, which he was a part of, not only pushed comprehensive reform bills but also hired more border guards and increased the number of deportations. Biden will say that Trump embarrassed the United States with Steve Bannon’s travel ban and then broke his promise on the wall.
Yes, Republicans and conservatives who are allied with the president can make a countercharge. They can show that in fact the Obama administration “juked the stats” on immigration; it changed the way deportations were counted in order to build up credibility as border hawks while trying to get an expansion of legal immigration passed. They can also point out that Obama’s policies led to the child-migration crisis. After changes in policy indicated that children may have an easier time, nearly 70,000 unaccompanied minors, and a roughly equal number of parents with young children, applied for asylum in the United States in 2014. They can point out that Congress refused to deal with him on the issue and that even his executive orders faced a wave of legal dissension, much of it spurious. Advertisement"

Representative Justin Amash (R., Mich.) announced Monday night that he was stepping down from the House Freedom Caucus to avoid becoming a “further distraction” to the group amid the ongoing flurry of national media attention prompted by his call for President Trump’s impeachment.
Amash, who co-founded the Freedom Caucus in 2015, told CNN that he has “the highest regard for them, and they’re my close friends,” but he “didn’t want to be a further distraction for the group.”
In keeping with his reputation as a gadfly willing to buck party leadership, Amash became the first Republican to publicly call for Trump’s impeachment following the release of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s final report. In a lengthy Twitter thread, Amash argued that Trump’s attempts to obstruct Mueller’s investigation were a betrayal of the public trust and, as such, constituted grounds for impeachment.

Maine’s newly elected Democratic governor, Janet Mills, signed a bill Monday granting medical professionals who are not licensed doctors the authority to perform abortion procedures.
In a statement released Monday, Mills argued that the bill, which will allow registered nurses and physician assistants to administer abortion-inducing drugs and perform in-clinic abortions. Comments
“Allowing qualified and licensed medical professionals to perform abortions will ensure that Maine women, especially those in rural areas, are able to access critical reproductive health care services when and where they need them from qualified providers they know and trust,” Mills said .
Maine joins California, Colorado, Vermont, and New Hampshire in allowing individuals who are not licensed physicians to administer abortions. “States across the country, including Vermont and New Hampshire, have already eliminated this outdated restriction on abortion care,” said Democratic state representative Sara Gideon, who sponsored the bill. “This law will allow women to receive the care they need from a provider they trust and eliminate the financial and logistical hurdles they face today.”
Carroll Conley, executive director of the Christian Civil League of Maine, told the New York Times that his group objects to the bill on purely philosophical grounds but also raised a number of pragmatic concerns, including whether nurses would receive adequate training in how to administer abortions by the time the law takes effect in September, and whether patients might be placed in danger if they have an emergency medical complication at one of the remote clinics where the bill is designed to facilitate abortion access."

Former vice president Joe Biden’s decision to abandon his support for a ban on taxpayer funding of abortion may have increased his support among Democratic primary voters, according to a new poll.
About 32 percent of those likely to vote in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries said they are more likely to vote for Biden after he announced his opposition to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for most abortions, according to a Politico / Morning Consult poll released Tuesday. Only 19 percent said Biden’s new stance makes him less likely to get their vote.
“I’ve been struggling with the problems that Hyde now presents,” Biden said Thursday at a Democratic fundraiser in Atlanta. “If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment.”"
Peter Wehner: It Is Possible to Heal Our Frayed Republic | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nr Interview,06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/peter-wehners-death-of-politics-political-renewal/,"June 11, 2019 11:50 AM Peter Wehner (C-SPAN) Peter Wehner on moving beyond ‘the death-match mindset’ that characterizes American politics
P eter Wehner, the former George W. Bush senior administration aide and current senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, has some hopeful things to say about politics, believe it or not, in his new book, The Death of Politics: How to Heal Our Frayed Republic After Trump . In an interview, he explains why he’s hopeful, talking a bit about conservatism, gratitude, and even friendship. Advertisement
Kathryn Jean Lopez: If politics is dead, does that mean we get to begin again? I confess to being tempted by the sound of that and suspect I’m not alone.
Peter Wehner: As a conservative, you can imagine I’m skeptical that we can or even should begin politics anew. What I would settle for is the renewal of politics. That is fundamentally what my book is attempting to do — to explain why our politics is imperiled, why politics matters, and what we can do to repair it.
When I refer to the death of politics, I have in mind the death-match mindset that characterizes American politics today, the attenuation and attack on democratic virtues, the spread of cynicism and fatalism — and my concern that if these attitudes aren’t confronted and reversed, they will do extraordinary, long-term damage to the American republic. Advertisement Advertisement
Lopez: Is it fair to blame Donald Trump? He didn’t necessarily start the fire.
Wehner: I agree; Donald Trump didn’t start the fire. The way I put it in the book is that he’s as much a symptom as a cause of our problems. There were certainly troublesome trends that predate Donald Trump’s entry into politics that he’s not responsible for. But what he is responsible for is making our politics cruder and crueler, more rancorous and more dishonest, more trivial and dehumanizing. This has radiating effects.
Just to stay with your metaphor: The fire started before Donald Trump entered the political arena, but he’s been pouring kerosene on that fire pretty much every day since he entered the political arena. Some Trump supporters aren’t troubled by that; I am. Some Trump supporters seem to delight in it; I don’t. That doesn’t mean, of course, that those on the left don’t have a lot to answer for. Over the years they have done a lot of harm to our civic and political culture as well. But Donald Trump is the president, and his influence on our political culture far exceeds anyone else’s.
Advertisement
Lopez: Why is understanding contempt as our problem so important?
Wehner: Contempt isn’t simply frustration or anger over what is happening politically. It is to cross over a threshold from frustration to despair, from unhappiness to rage, from deep skepticism to corrosive cynicism. My concern is that many Americans have lost hope that we can solve our problems using the traditional means of politics. This is a dangerous development; it opens us up to all sorts of anti-constitutional mischief.
Lopez: How great is the danger that civility projects and talk become a watering down?
Wehner: If they’re done poorly, there’s that danger. But the best civility projects don’t try to eliminate differences. They model how to navigate through our differences, how to disagree in a way that is done responsibly and without too much rancor. David Blankenhorn, the founder of Better Angels, says the group’s goal is “achieving disagreement.” It’s to talk across our differences as fellow citizens. That’s not watering things down or living under an illusion that we’ll jettison our differences. Setting up the expectation that politics, when it’s practiced correctly, will result in us all reaching common ground is utopian silliness.
Advertisement
Lopez: Why should a reader stop laughing at the idea that politics can be “noble”?
Wehner: Because it happens to be true. Just to be clear, my argument isn’t that politics is always noble, or that there isn’t a dark underside that exists. It’s an imperfect profession composed of imperfect people, which is true, by the way, of all professions and people. My point is rather that politics at its best can be noble because politics at its best is a means to advance justice and promote the moral good. If a person in politics champions policies that advance liberty and human dignity and protect innocent life and fights against policies that are an assault on human dignity, why wouldn’t that be a noble thing to do? Why would people laugh at that?
Advertisement
Lopez: “The political arena is actually full of people who love their country and want to serve it.” Anyone in particular who inspires you today?
Wehner: One person who comes to mind is Ben Sasse. I disagreed with him when he supported President Trump’s “emergency declaration” last March, which I believed was a clear violation of the constitutional order. But Ben’s a conservative, quite thoughtful, thoroughly comfortable in the realm of ideas — he’s a former college president, with a Ph.D. in history — and a very decent human being. He believes we need to respect facts rather than assault them. And temperamentally he is just what the country, and especially conservatism, needs just now. He’s not stuck in a perpetual state of anger and resentment. Quite the opposite, in fact. He’s reasonably winsome and cheerful. Advertisement
Lopez: “The task of citizenship in America today is not simply to curse the political darkness but to light candles. This can be done one person at time, in your neighborhood and city, at a homeless shelter and a school-board meeting, at neighborhood gatherings and city councils, and in countless other settings.” But surely that is not enough?
Wehner: Of course that’s not enough. But those are only two sentences in a 264-page book. I credit my editor with pushing me to offer a host of concrete things that citizenship requires of us. But I should add that the main purpose of The Death of Politics isn’t to offer a 10- or 100-point plan for how to be a good citizen. Such books and reports exist, and they can be helpful. But my aim is to deal with what I take to be more fundamental matters, which is to explain what politics rightly understood is. What is the role of faith in politics, and why does it go off the rails so easily? Why are moderation, compromise, and civility democratic virtues worth defending? Why does democracy require that we honor the culture of words? Those are the kinds of issues I explore in this book. I also argue that citizens who demand more will yield politicians who offer more. Advertisement
Lopez: For anyone who has had friendships rupture or strained over Donald Trump, how do you hope you and Joe Klein might be examples (even though your fraying predated Trump)?
Wehner: In The Death of Politics I begin the fourth chapter with an anecdote. During the 1990s I became good friends with Joe Klein, who was then a columnist for Newsweek . Joe was more liberal than I, but we had similar interests, and our relationship was characterized by respect, affection, and interest beyond politics.
For reasons I discuss in the book, the relationship went south after I joined the Bush White House. When I left, we aired our differences publicly, through the different outlets we wrote for — and in my case, NRO was one of them. The debates got intense and at times personal. I justified what I wrote — I was simply defending myself from attacks, I told myself — but part of me felt that what happened wasn’t quite right. So years later I reached out to Joe in an email, in hopes of reconnecting. We did; we met for breakfast at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington. Reconciliation was on track.
What’s the point of the story? It’s that difference in politics can break bonds of affection. Things can escalate quickly. In our case, political differences had splintered our relationship. I’m thankful that we put things back together, and we’re once again close. But it took time and effort and intentionality on our part to make that happen. So when I write about how politics can create mutual animosity, and how we might say things in the heat of the moment that we come to regret, I know of what I speak. I’ve been there.
Lopez: You talk about “After Trump,” but there may be a long road to that point yet — he may be president another four years. Can there be healing during the Trump presidency years?
Wehner: At the national level, it’ll be extremely difficult, especially during what will almost surely be a brutal election. The fact that the president thrives on inflaming our emotions means we’re still in the middle of a rough stretch. On the left, there’s a lot of deep contempt for people who don’t share their views, especially on cultural matters. So we’re caught in quite a bad cycle just now, but that’s precisely why we need to begin to carefully think through what needs to be done at every level to repair things.
I’d add that while our national politics is a wreck right now, progress can be made at the local and state level. In the book, I profile groups such as Better Angels and Speak Your Peace, whose aim is to achieve disagreement while continuing to remain respectful of one another. They’ve had impressive success. And David Brooks is doing some great work at the Aspen Institute in an effort to create a cultural movement to repair our country’s frayed social fabric . We should do what we can do, and we can all do something. Advertisement
Years ago a friend of mine told me that if you walk into your bedroom and are overwhelmed by how messy it is, the first thing you need to do is pick up the clothes at your feet. You can’t clean up everything all at once, but you can act right away to make things better. And if you stay at it, the room will eventually be cleaned up.
Lopez: You mention Bill Buckley and gratitude. Why must politics always be about gratitude?
Wehner: The reference to Bill Buckley is in a section of the book on how citizens can heal the breach. Buckley believed a year of voluntary national service would strengthen feelings and appreciation for the nation. On gratitude, I write in the book that people who are grateful are more able to dispense grace to others. Gratitude finds ways to express itself; the result is a more humane, decent, and merciful society and political culture.
Lopez: Is there something particularly conservative about gratitude?
Wehner: My close friend and former colleague Yuval Levin has said that conservatives often begin from gratitude because we start from modest expectations of human affairs — we know that people are imperfect, and fallen, and weak; that human knowledge and power are not all they’re cracked up to be; and we’re enormously impressed by the institutions that have managed to make something great of this imperfect raw material. He argues that conservatives tend to begin from gratitude for what is good and what works in our society and then strive to build on it. And that seems right to me."

I was deeply immersed in the failed attempt to save Terri Schiavo’s life. Perhaps that’s why I feel duty-bound to correct every attempt by the left to revise the case’s history in order to wield it as a cudgel to attack conservatives.
Here’s the myth constantly pushed: Social-conservative Republicans interfered with the intimate family decision making of devoted husband Michael Schiavo, who selflessly sought to obey the express wishes of his beloved Terri not to be kept alive if in a profoundly cognitively disabled state. That’s a profound distortion — to put it kindly — of what really happened.
We find the latest such myth-weaving in a New York Magazine article criticizing the religious right for leaping to oppose the starvation death of Dutch teenager Noa Pothoven ( which I did here , not because of religion but to defend the intrinsic value of life). I could deconstruct that nonsense too, but let’s stick with the Schiavo mendacity. From the piece by Sarah Jones :
Terri Schiavo had been in a persistent vegetative state for years by the time her husband, Michael, filed to remove her feeding tube. Her parents objected and instigated a legal battle. They found powerful allies: then-governor Jeb Bush, with an assist from brother George, tried to force Schiavo’s husband and her medical team to keep her on nutrition in a Florida facility.
Her husband insisted that Schiavo never wanted to be kept alive by artificial means. Doctors believed that she would never recover and was not aware of her surroundings."

(Caitlin Ochs/Reuters )
In an interview with the Des Moines Register , New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand suggested that opposition to abortion is akin to racism.
Gillibrand, who continues to linger near the very bottom of the pack of Democrats running for the 2020 presidential nomination, has stated that she plans to impose a litmus test on all of her judicial nominees, should she be elected. When asked whether that choice would threaten judicial independence, here’s how Gillibrand replied:
I think there’s some issues that have such moral clarity that we have as a society decided that the other side is not acceptable. Imagine saying that it’s okay to appoint a judge who’s racist or anti-Semitic or homophobic. Telling– asking someone to appoint someone who takes away basic human rights of any group of people in America, I don’t think that those are political issues anymore.
The senator next claimed that she respects “the rights of every American to hold their religious beliefs true to themselves,” but went on to suggest that the principle of “separation of church and state” demands that “ultra-radical conservative judges and justices” not “impose their faith on Americans.”
“There is no moral equivalency when you come to racism,” Gillibrand added, “and I do not believe there is a moral equivalency when it comes to changing laws that deny women reproductive freedom.”
Struggling to distinguish herself from her competitors during a contentious primary, Gillibrand has frequently fallen back on over-the-top progressive virtue signaling, trying to position herself as the most “woke” candidate in the field.

2008 —In Boumediene v. Bush , the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, rules that aliens detained as enemy combatants at Guantanamo have a constitutional habeas right to challenge the basis of their detention in the course of an ongoing war. In so doing, the majority invalidates the statutory scheme that Congress and the president developed. As Chief Justice Roberts states in his dissent (for all four dissenters):
Today the Court strikes down as inadequate the most generous set of procedural protections ever afforded aliens detained by this country as enemy combatants. The political branches crafted these procedures amidst an ongoing military conflict, after much careful investigation and thorough debate. The Court rejects them today out of hand, without bothering to say what due process rights the detainees possess, without explaining how the statute fails to vindicate those rights, and before a single petitioner has even attempted to avail himself of the law’s operation. And to what effect? The majority merely replaces a review system designed by the people’s representatives with a set of shapeless procedures to be defined by federal courts at some future date. One cannot help but think, after surveying the modest practical results of the majority’s ambitious opinion, that this decision is not really about the detainees at all, but about control of federal policy regarding enemy combatants.
Justice Scalia (also on behalf of all four dissenters) condemns the “game of bait-and-switch that today’s opinion plays upon the Nation’s Commander in Chief,” including the majority’s abandonment of the “settled precedent” of Johnson v. Eisentrager on which the president relied. Deploring the majority’s “inflated notion of judicial supremacy,” Scalia concludes:
Today the Court warps our Constitution in a way that goes beyond the narrow issue of the reach of the Suspension Clause, invoking judicially brainstormed separation-of-powers principles to establish a manipulable “functional” test for the extraterritorial reach of habeas corpus (and, no doubt, for the extraterritorial reach of other constitutional protections as well). It blatantly misdescribes important precedents, most conspicuously Justice Jackson’s opinion for the Court in Johnson v. Eisentrager . It breaks a chain of precedent as old as the common law that prohibits judicial inquiry into detentions of aliens abroad absent statutory authorization. And, most tragically, it sets our military commanders the impossible task of proving to a civilian court, under whatever standards this Court devises in the future, that evidence supports the confinement of each and every enemy prisoner. The Nation will live to regret what the Court has done today. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Joe Biden Promises He Will Cure Cancer if Elected | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-promises-that-if-elected-he-will-cure-cancer/,"June 12, 2019 10:24 AM Joe Biden speaks at an event at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds in Davenport, Iowa, June 11, 2019. (Jordan Gale/Reuters)
Yesterday in Iowa Joe Biden declared , “I’ve worked so hard in my career that, I promise you, if I’m elected president, you’re going to see the single most important thing that changes America: We’re going to cure cancer.”
No one can begrudge Biden for having an all-consuming desire to cure cancer, having lost his son Beau to brain cancer in 2015. The good news is we’ve made remarkable strides in treatment of cancer, from surgery to chemotherapy to immunotherapy to stem-cell transplants to photodynamic therapy. The bad news is there are more than 100 types of cancer, and different treatments have different levels of effectiveness on patients. A blanket cure for all types of cancer is not outside of our reach because we elected the wrong president or aren’t spending enough money on the problem. A blanket cure for all types of cancer is outside of our reach, for now, because this is a darned complicated disease with a lot of varieties and the target is always changing :
Cancer cells grow and divide with extreme rapidity and must endure a certain amount of stress and damage to their DNA. Fast-growing cancers depend on a fine balance between DNA damage and repair, but genetic changes add up over time, and the result is like evolution at warp speed, where growth-promoting mutations lead to even more rapid expansion. This contributes to the heterogeneity discussed above. It also means the cancer you find today may differ from the one you try to treat in the weeks and months to come. With modern sequencing and analysis, it’s now possible to track cancer cell evolution and begin to predict the changes before they occur. Nonetheless, it’s much harder to hit a moving target than a stationary one, and even a highly effective, precisely targeted combination of therapies may not succeed if enough cancer cells survive initial treatment and further evolve.
This is not a promise that a politician can reasonably make.
The demagoguery of Democratic presidential campaigns does not change. Back in October 2004, John Edwards declared at a campaign stop, “If we do the work that we can do in this country, the work that we will do when John Kerry is president, people like Christopher Reeve are going to walk, get up out of that wheelchair and walk again.”
The late Charles Krauthammer — a man who would have every incentive to pursue every potential treatment for paralysis — declared at the time, “In my 25 years in Washington, I have never seen a more loathsome display of demagoguery.” Advertisement Advertisement
Edwards’s justification was a false claim that Bush had “banned” stem-cell research, and thus had stood in the way for cures to everything from paralysis to Alzheimer’s to cancer. Advertisement
This was a brazen lie; Bush had left no restrictions on private research into embryonic stem cells and continued federal funding to support the study of existing stem-cell lines, but barred using federal money for research on stem-cell lines produced by newly destroyed embryos. In 2007 , James A. Thomson and Japan’s Shinya Yamanaka announced they an embryo-free way to produce genetically matched stem cells.
In 2009, Obama lifted the restrictions Bush had put in place. Cures for paralysis, cancer, and Alzheimer’s did not suddenly appear. The furious rhetoric of Kerry and Edwards was wrong; Bush policies were not what stood between suffering Americans and a cure for their diseases."
Free College Has Been Tried with Predictably Bad Results | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/one-state-has-already-tried-free-college-with-predictably-bad-results/,"About George Leef June 12, 2019 12:08 PM
Wouldn’t it be great if everyone went to college, got real smart, and made lots of money? That would give a state a tremendous boost, right?
Like all “ progressive ” schemes for reshaping the world, that fails. In today’s Martin Center article, Louisiana-based writer Kevin Boyd takes a look at a program in his state that gives students free college. Louisiana is still in its low economic orbit, but the costs to the state just keep escalating. Advertisement Advertisement
Boyd explains that the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS) started as a private initiative for a small number of poor students in 1988. Soon, however, the state took it over and, inevitably, it began to grow like mad. The program’s original income-cap was abolished in 1998 and academic eligibility standards were lowered. Supposedly, TOPS was needed to keep the state’s brightest students from going to college in other states, but no matter where a smart kid goes to college won’t tie him to his home state when better offers emerge elsewhere.
And whereas the program began as a means of helping the poor, it has turned into a huge subsidy for the middle class and wealthy.
As with any big subsidy program, TOPS has grown more and more costly to state taxpayers. Boyd writes, “ The TOPS budget has quintupled, growing from $54 million in 1998 to $293 million in 2019. About 24,000 students received an average award of $2,293 in 1998, but, by 2019, more than 53,000 students received an average award of $5,583. ” Advertisement"
Christians in Egypt Attacked by Civilians Twice in One Week | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/christians-in-egypt-attacked-by-civilians-twice-in-one-week/,"About Marlo Safi June 12, 2019 1:01 PM A relative of victims of an attack on a group of Coptic Christians attends a funeral, at the Prince Tadros Church in Minya, Egypt, November 3, 2018. (Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters)
While attacks on Christians in Egypt such as bombings of churches by Islamists break into our news cycles in the U.S., smaller attacks often go without making much of an impression in our media. Large-scale attacks, such as the Palm Sunday church bombings of 2017 where 44 people were killed, aren’t as frequent as the attacks on Egypt’s Coptic community by regular Egyptians. Copts — Christians in Egypt that trace their ancestry back to the ancient Egyptians and their faith to St. Mark the Apostle — have faced violent transgression by fellow civilians toward their homes in the last week alone. Advertisement Advertisement
Last week in a town called Samalot in the Egyptian province of Minya, a Coptic Christian woman who had converted to Islam returned to her parent’s village as part of a celebration of her conversion. The mob of Egyptians turned violent, throwing rocks at Coptic homes while yelling obscenities at them. Cars and other property were destroyed. Police arrested eight Copts in an effort to end the violence — less than one week later, similar discriminatory actions by police following violence from civilians toward Copts occurred again.
On Monday, in the village of Ishnien Al Nasara in Minya, three Coptic homes were destroyed following rumors that a Copt had “insulted religion” on Facebook, despite Copts refuting the accusation that the young Coptic man alleged to have broken blasphemy laws had written anything abusive. According to a partner of U.S.-based Coptic advocacy group Coptic Voice, police arrested the individual that wrote the post for being in violation of blasphemy laws. The perpetrators who burned the homes, however, were not arrested.
This is the reality for Copts in Egypt today — they face not only the threat from terror groups such as ISIS, but also daily harassment or assault from fellow Egyptians, who view Christians as unclean and heretic, and who often spread false rumors. Sara Salama, president of Coptic Voice, tells National Review that these recent incidents are nothing new, and that Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has improved the public rhetoric about Christians in the country by encouraging peaceful coexistence, must take more action on the ground to provoke positive change.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
For example, in early June President Sisi delivered a speech to Muslim Egyptians during Ramadan in which he encouraged them to be “understanding” of Christians in Egypt, and congratulate them on the opening of their churches.
When we wish our Christian brothers a happy feast or [congratulate them] on building new churches, we represent our religion,” he said, noting that such gestures are not meant to show off. “There is a big difference between practicing and understanding the religion,” he added.
Salama remarks on the improvement of rhetoric, but is skeptical of its effects. “While the upgrade in public rhetoric on religious tolerance coming out of Egypt’s presidential office is important in and of itself, it has not lead to a positive change in the situation on the ground,” Salama says. “The main issue here is that of accountability.” She notes that police often act more as bystanders than individuals tasked with protecting Egyptian citizens, especially Copts."

'Rolling Thunder Revue' Martin Scorsese’s Bob Dylan Movie Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/rolling-thunder-revue-worshipping-dylan-the-rock-star-shaman/,"June 12, 2019 1:51 PM Bob Dylan in Rolling Thunder Revue (Netflix) This lightweight mockumentary reduces Dylan to a leftist cliché.
R olling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese is a cumbersome title owing to Scorsese’s tortured attempt to distinguish this patchwork about Dylan’s 1976 ragamuffin touring show from his hagiographic 2005 documentary, No Direction Home .
Yet this Revue is still hagiography. Scorsese competes with the mythmaking of the already overworked Dylanolatry industry by constructing an elaborate mockumentary ruse around this 43-year-old pop-music footage, which doesn’t need it. Advertisement Advertisement
The musical performances of Dylan and entourage masked in white face paint, as in his 1976 fantasia Renaldo and Clara , are rousingly intense. Dylan frees himself from his own mystique. The masks hide nothing. Musicianship and fierce singing defy Nobel laureate Dylan’s sanctified-philosopher status. His gift for condensing complex feelings and social reflection into revelatory lyrics is turned back into entertainment — from before rock criticism “hallowed” it out. When Dylan coos “Oh, Sister” or bangs out a piano version of “Simple Twist of Fate,” he’s a showman, not a shaman.
Here’s the problem: Scorsese, whose moralistic ethnic thrillers or genre fantasies are politically evasive, picks up the usual leftist cant. Dylan’s slippery social pronouncements, mixing personal philosophical evolution with celebrity gamesmanship, ought to be seen in the Rolling Thunder concert as acts of individual sensibility. The voice-of-a-generation routine is not helpful to a new, politically disingenuous era.
Scorsese starts his Boomer-generation regard with silent-movie magic acts (recalling Hugo , possibly his worst film), puts in a fictitious documentary filmmaker named Stefan vanDorp, and then shifts to footage of the American bicentennial, establishing historical context by way of a liberal television cliché (this is a Netflix production). Thankfully, Dylan offers reminiscence of that period (when Scorsese’s Mean Streets and Taxi Driver dramatized national disillusionment) that Scorsese himself wouldn’t dare: “After America was shamefully run out of Vietnam, people lost their conviction about almost everything.” Advertisement Advertisement
But conviction is what makes the Rolling Thunder shows still count. “Isis” is performed as a glorious saga of self-discovery. “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” is given life, brought out of folk-music mothballs — just like Bryan Ferry’s radical, antic version suggested — by a thrilled performance from a blues band/jug band/rock band featuring Roger McGuinn and Mick Ronson, who add adventure to Dylan’s obvious joy.
Artistic conviction still rings in “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll” when Dylan spits the song so that the well-known words, describing epic injustice, bite. It has come to indict the sanctimony of Dylan fans who pride themselves on appreciating its message. That’s what makes the over-50-year-old song a reproof to today’s SJW self-righteousness. Advertisement
Scorsese fails to explore the irony that now surrounds Dylan’s legacy — not celebrity nonsense such as Dylan using “Just Like a Woman” to “seduce” Sharon Stone — but the irony that politicized folk music now conflicts with modern American complexity. The activist song “Hurricane,” about boxer Ruben Carter, unjustly jailed for a murder he didn’t commit, is sung with accusatory, mascaraed sidelong glances (Dylan is later seen urging CBS Records execs to promote it), but a live performance at the Clinton Correctional Facility doesn’t move the audience of inmates, despite all the song’s anger. Dylan’s ongoing, powerful fight against racism also seems ironic when he performs the Native American retort “The Ballad of Ira Hayes” before a similarly unresponsive Iroquois audience. The world of protest music now stands apart from daily stress. For that reason, Scorsese’s escape into mystifying folderol (including a clip from Children of Paradise ) is insultingly jejune, a gesture of movie-brat privilege.
The framing of Dylan’s music inside a multimedia carnival (like an Italian “musical comedy de arte,” Dylan says) reaches a low point when Scorsese borrows a character from Robert Altman’s Tanner 88 political satire. At a time when we desperately need more clarity, this obfuscation is what the media call tone-deaf. Advertisement Advertisement
Maybe Scorsese realizes that the great American movie of the past half-century was Robert Altman’s Nashville , released the same year as Dylan’s comeback album Blood on the Tracks . Altman’s bounty of music culture and class and race politics was Americana deluxe. Something of its bicentennial spirit animated Dylan’s tour, but not Revue . Scorsese’s own political reticence ruins his attempt to match Altman’s sociopolitical exuberance."

Sweden's Migration Problem: Reality Sets In | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Douglas Murray,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/reality-of-swedens-migration-problem/,"June 12, 2019 11:45 AM Rescue personnel are seen at the site of an explosion in Linkoping, Sweden, June 7, 2019. (Pontus Johannson/Reuters)
Readers may recall a kerfuffle in February 2017, which now seems like the long, distant past. It revolved around President Trump riffing on the question of migration in front of a rally of his supporters:
You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible.
As it happens, nothing had particularly happened the night before in Sweden itself. Rather, the president appeared to be referring to a segment he had seen on Fox News the previous evening, in which a journalist reported on the social and criminal problems that Sweden had been having as a result of the unchecked migration that peaked in 2015.
But such is the tenor of the times that the dominant response to the President’s statement was to ridicule it, especially by highlighting what a nirvana Sweden allegedly is. In other words, much of the political and media class in America and around the world decided to take part in covering up the problems which sudden non-European migration had brought to Sweden. In their desire to lampoon Trump they ended up colluding in a falsehood.
Just how false can once again be seen from the most recent work from Paulina Neuding, one of the most indispensable journalists not just in Europe but anywhere else. In recent years Neuding has, among other things, been keeping a tally of “explosions” in Sweden. Not metaphorical ones, but actual ones. So strangely self-censoring is the Swedish press that when explosives are used (including grenade attacks, among other hitherto un-Swedish activities) they are either ignored or reported merely as “explosions.” Some of these do turn out to be accidents, but a great many do not, and the unwillingness of most of the media (local and international) to look into these events is one of those things that I predict historians will look back at and just whistle. Advertisement Advertisement
As Neuding reports , in just 24 hours, there were three explosions in the city of Malmo, in southern Sweden. This included a bomb which ripped through two apartment buildings on Friday evening. The scale of this assault (which is mostly the result of violence between foreign-born gangs) is such that Neuding says that it is time for Swedes to admit that they have a national emergency on their hands."
President Trump & Franklin Graham -- Christians Should Pray for President Trump | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/of-course-christians-should-pray-for-president-trump/,"Follow David French on Twitter June 12, 2019 2:22 PM President Donald Trump stands on stage as Pastor David Platt prays for him at the McLean Bible Church in Vienna, Va., June 2, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) The counterintuitive Kingdom of God requires us to reject the world’s methods with confidence in God’s wisdom and sovereignty.
T he two virtues in perhaps the shortest supply in American political discourse are grace and faith. The lack of grace is on exhibit every day in social media and every moment when the outrage mobs come. Every transgression must be punished, and every punishment must far outweigh the gravity of the crime. Advertisement Advertisement
The lack of faith is in many ways more subtle. It underlies the decision of many Christians to abandon clear and unequivocal biblical commands — as if the Bible’s dictates are just not quite up to the urgency of the times. Let’s take, for example, the odd recent controversy surrounding prayers for President Trump. David Platt, pastor of Virginia’s McLean Bible Church, came under fire when he publicly prayed a thoroughly nonpartisan prayer for Trump when Trump stopped by, unannounced, on Memorial Day weekend.
Then, yesterday, the Washington Post ’s Jonathan Capehart published a scathing essay condemning entirely the very idea of praying for the president. His target was Franklin Graham’s recent call to set aside June 2 as “special day of prayer” for Trump. While it’s true there were risible elements to Graham’s call — for example, it contained a claim that “in the history of our country, no president has been attacked as [Trump] has” — Capehart went well beyond critiquing that statement and attacked the very idea of praying for a man like Donald Trump.
He said, “Prayers for the powerful at the expense of the powerless, especially when the powerful in question is Trump, strike me as immoral” and endorsed instead a strategy of Christian confrontation. After detailing many of Trump’s sins, Capehart writes that “the proper response by clergy isn’t to pray for the man responsible for this assault on our values. The proper response is to issue a call to conscience to faith leaders to march on the White House.” His concluding paragraph contains this unequivocal statement: “With our Constitution at risk and our values on the line, praying for Trump is the last thing we should be doing.” Advertisement
Capehart however, not only asks Christians to directly defy Scripture, he creates a false choice. The choice isn’t between praying or confrontation. One can pray and confront. Sycophancy is a sin. Christian leaders should confront earthly rulers who commit unjust acts. But lack of charity is a sin also. So is lack of faith. Advertisement
The Apostle Paul was unequivocal in his directions to Timothy, “I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people — for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.” Like it or not, Trump is a man in authority. This verse applies. Advertisement
And why pray? Looking beyond the simple matter of obedience, there is a deeper truth. The book of Proverbs declares that “the king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord, like the rivers of water.” To put it plainly, God is sovereign, and when we pray for our presidents, we are asking that God do His will through an always imperfect man — and His will can include repentance, wisdom, and justice.
Make no mistake, the command to pray for leaders was not contingent on the virtue of the leader. The Roman Empire of Paul’s day makes Trump’s presidency look like a dimly imagined utopia. We lack perspective. We lack a sense of proportion. As I noted when Christian intellectuals recently denigrated the role of decency and civility in public life, we do not and will not encounter any kind of earthly emergency that relieves of the obligations of eternal commands.

Actor Jussie Smollett Hoax: What We’ve Learned about His Case | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/what-weve-learned-about-jussie-smollett/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter June 12, 2019 3:00 PM Actor Jussie Smollett leaves court after charges against him were dropped by state prosecutors in Chicago, Ill. March 26, 2019. (Kamil Krzaczynski/Reuters) His refusal to own up to the hoax has probably maximized the damage to his career.
I t’s been a few weeks since March 26, when all charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and the actor declared that his version of events had been proven correct. How’s that going?
Smollett’s celebrity defenders have gone quiet. His publicists and lawyers are dodging reporters. The @StandwithJussie Twitter account has ten followers. Smollett’s boss on Empire , showrunner Lee Daniels, now says he is “beyond embarrassed” that he rushed to defend the actor when Smollett first started telling that badly scripted story about his staged attack by a pair of supposed Trump fanatics who at the time seemed to be the only people in America who even knew who he was. Advertisement Advertisement
A funny thing happened during Smollett’s victory lap: Chicago reporters obtained communications from police and prosecutors after a judge unsealed the case file. These records included texts Smollett sent that were obtained by police. The picture of Smollett that has emerged is considerably more detailed now: He had himself a rip-roaring good time while he was planning to make himself look like the victim of a nasty assault. He is brazen. He is smug. He is without doubt a liar, and a liar who preys on Americans’ natural sympathy for racial and sexual minorities. In the church of identity politics, what Smollett did is the equivalent of stealing from the widows-and-orphans box.
Smollett’s phone records show that for months he repeatedly bought cocaine, Ecstasy, and marijuana from the brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, which he paid for via Paypal and Venmo, and that he wanted to meet with the brothers “face to face” to discuss “planning,” presumably for the fake attack. “N***a you still got a molly connect,” Smollett texted one of the brothers last September. “Hahahaha… Imma need a good fo pills Haha.” Advertisement
Abimbola told police that just before staging the attack, for which he and his brother said they were paid $3,500, he hesitated because he saw a vehicle in the area and wondered whether police might notice the fake scuffle and shoot him. During the phony assault he shouted racist and anti-gay slurs as he had been hired to do, then lightly hit Smollet on the chin: “It was a pretend punch because he didn’t want to knock him out,” said an affidavit. He then backed off in order to give the actor “a chance to fight back as he was scripted,” the statement continued. Advertisement
Olabinjo Osundairo, who had appeared as an extra on Empire , told cops “that a plan was formulated and put into play by [redacted] to conduct a staged incident where [redacted] was beaten by Olabinjo Usundairo and Abimbola Osundairo posing as persons other than themselves,” a case report reads. Olabinjo Osundairo said the motive was that Smollett “was unhappy about the response he received over hate mail which was delivered to him.” Advertisement
Detectives had from the start ample reason to be skeptical of Smollett’s story about the great Subway Sandwich Ambush of January 29, even as the Chicago Police Department unwisely spent weeks issuing public statements suggesting it believed the tall tale. The CPD’s efforts to be sensitive led journalists to write headlines such as this beauty, which appeared in the Los Angeles Times on February 15 and was subsequently changed: “Chicago police arrest two men in Jussie Smollett case and say attack was not a hoax.” What a police spokesman actually said was, “There is no evidence to say that this is a hoax,” which was a bit misleading given that detectives were at that moment in the process of obtaining such evidence, namely the statements of the Osundairo brothers. It would have been better for the police, and better for the country, if they had simply said something like “Our investigation is continuing” throughout.
When police first interviewed Smollett, the newly released records show, they asked Smollett why his sweater wasn’t dirty, “to which he explained they were on snow and ice.” Smollett gave police only a redacted version of his phone records, frustrating their attempts to investigate. He declined to allow police to take a DNA swab, saying instead that he’d “think about it.” On February 6 a police document notes that Smollett refused to turn over medical records generated after he was examined in a hospital for the supposed injury. Advertisement Advertisement
Yet the decision by prosecutor Kim Foxx to let Smollett skate has probably maximized damage to his career. Because he didn’t have to plead guilty, Smollett mistakenly thinks the public sees him as innocent. Instead the public quite rightly thinks of him as a con artist, and of itself as the victim of a fraud. Had he pleaded guilty, he could now follow the well-established Hollywood formula for crafting a redemption arc. He could blame the drugs for messing up his mind, go into rehab, then perform a tearful, anguished mea culpa for Gayle King. He could apologize for stealing victim status from all the gay and black people who have actually suffered down the years. He could pour himself into doing charity for those same people. There are plenty of media co-conspirators who would eagerly assist Smollett in staging his own acts of humility and forget that Smollett’s hoax was a smear of Donald Trump supporters. Instead, his arrogance has landed him in limbo."

Michael Strain’s essay in the Guardian, mentioned below , starts with the thought that it’s an odd time for capitalism to be in such disrepute: Unemployment is low and wages at the low end of the labor market are rising.
I used a similar starting point in a recent NR article , and offered a theory for the seeming disjunction: Maybe people are happy about the economy’s recent performance but unhappy about it over the longer term. Advertisement Advertisement
There’s some relevant polling data that I didn’t have space to discuss in that article. From the summer of 2001 through today, Gallup has been asking this question: “ Thinking about the job situation in America today, would you say that it is now a good time or a bad time to find a quality job? ”
Since President Trump took office in 2017, more than 50 percent of respondents have consistently said it’s a good time to be looking for a job. Before that, the only time Gallup found a positive reading above 50 percent was . . . never. It hadn’t happened once from 2001 through 2016, let alone consistently happened."

Mayor Pete’s Foreign Policy: One Good Idea and Lots of Bad Ones - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/pete-buttigieg-foreign-policy-speech/,"June 13, 2019 6:30 AM Pete Buttigieg delivers remarks on foreign policy and national security in Bloomington, Ind., June 11, 2019. (John Sommers/Reuters) He points out Congress’s bipartisan cowardice in dodging responsibility for wars.
I t is now a commonplace of American politics that successful presidential candidates run as doves, then find a hawkish side in office. Ike ran as a peace candidate, then increased involvement in Korea. Nixon promised an end to the war, and expanded the one he inherited into Cambodia. George W. Bush promised a humble foreign policy in his first campaign, and then in his second inaugural preached liberating warfare and setting “a fire in the minds of men.” Obama ran while criticizing “dumb wars,” then stupidly involved the U.S. in a few more. Advertisement Advertisement
And so it’s hard not to feel like a sucker for praising the bleating of presidential candidates on foreign-policy issues. And yet, we have to praise the truth when it is spoken. So here goes: In Pete Buttigieg’s foreign-policy speech this Monday, he hammered home an important point. “If members of our military can find the courage to deploy to a war zone, then members of our Congress ought to be able to summon the courage to take tough votes on war and peace,” he said.
Buttigieg, a veteran of the conflict in Afghanistan, said that Congress had “abdicated” its responsibility in foreign policy. Buttigieg demanded an end to the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force that has been used by presidents of both parties to justify a variety of military actions and wars that have been launched since the 9/11 attacks. This conviction that the role of Congress must be restored, and that American foreign policy had been insulated not just from the American people but from our elected representatives, was in fact, the most developed portion of his speech. “We should never find ourselves in a situation that we did in 2017,” Buttigieg said, “when we had four troops killed on a counterterrorism mission only to have senators from both parties admit that they didn’t even realize we had 1,000 troops stationed in that country.” Advertisement
This is all true and all a shame.
But it is unclear if a president can actually make Congress responsible for foreign policy if they choose not to be. There is a refusal of responsibility from Washington from both branches. We saw this in the Obama administration, when the president seemed to be preparing the United States for a mission of regime change in Syria against Bashar al-Assad, and then punted the decision over to Congress. Popular opinion ran so hot against this that Congress refused to endorse such a mission. And yet, the CIA and the Department of Defense, and a limited number of ground troops, continued to run extensive missions aimed at undermining Assad. If the men who occupy offices of public trust can reread the 2001 AUMF authorizing war on al-Qaeda in Afghanistan as a legal mandate for war on behalf of groups allied to al-Qaeda in Syria during 2014, then revocation may mean nothing at all. Surely such men would find legal justification for further interventions without the AUMF, or a vote in Congress. Advertisement Advertisement
The rest of Buttigieg’s foreign-policy speech was forgettable. He said he would rejoin the United States to the Iran nuclear deal. Even from a liberal perspective, is that really the best approach? Because the deal wasn’t a treaty signed by Congress, Trump pulled the U.S. out of it with a stroke of a pen. One can agree or disagree with this. But by doing so, Trump inadvertently proved the argument of Iran’s hardliners correct, the argument that America would not honor its commitments in Iran. What did being welcomed back into the good graces of America under George W. Bush do for General Qaddafi under Obama? Not much. Advertisement
Buttigieg also included climate change as an “existential national-security” question. While it gets applause lines in the Democratic base, this habit of thinking warps both environmental thinking and defense. It’s not more clarifying than saying that Federal Reserve policy is a national-security question."

The result was a joint statement , released on Monday, titled “Don’t Ban Equality.” The entire statement is a gratuitous assault on the English language. Who exactly is trying to “ban equality”? And “equality” for whom? The unborn child? The mother? The CEO of Thinx?
This paragraph is indicative of the whole:
Equality in the workplace is one of the most important business issues of our time.
When everyone is empowered to succeed, our companies, our communities and our economy are better for it.
The word “everyone” is used rather, er, loosely here. Certainly, one of the two parties privy to an abortion is made worse off by the procedure. Often, both are. Do forceps and a curette ensure that unborn children are “empowered to succeed?” Unshaken, the letter continues: “Restricting access to comprehensive reproductive care, including abortion, threatens the health, independence and economic stability of our employees and customers.”
“Care” is a word that, to the literalist, refers to “the activity, skill, or profession of looking after someone who needs help or protection.” As employed by the cosigning companies, it takes on a different meaning, something closer to “violence.” Indeed, the piecemeal dismemberment of a nascent human life seems, to the more brutally precise reader, antonymic to “reproductive care.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
There is a one-line reprieve from the otherwise imprecise and sloganeering tone of the letter: “Simply put, [anti-abortion legislation] goes against our values and is bad for business.”
That they consider unborn children to be “bad for business” is a standalone indictment of all 180 companies, but none so much as the insufferably left-wing ice-cream giant Ben & Jerry’s. Ben & Jerry’s has no moral authority to lecture consumers about campaign finance so long as it feeds the unborn to Moloch in the name of “business.”
The letter goes on, in spite of itself, and admits that pro-life measures might hamper the “ability” of signatories “to build a diverse and inclusive workforce”: Anti-abortion legislation “impairs our ability to build diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines, recruit top talent across the states, and protect the well-being of all the people who keep our businesses thriving day in and out.”
What does this paragraph mean? The entire document is, of course, intentionally imprecise; as one becomes more literal about abortion, it grows increasingly likely that the quiet parts will be said out loud . There seem to be three divergent and similarly heinous interpretations that emerge from this paragraph; first, that abortion is the only means by which women can be adequately “included” in the workforce. That to me seems the most plausible, if only because it has been a staple of the pro-choice argument for a generation. The second interpretation, not altogether unrelated to the first, is that “women of color” procure abortions disproportionately and that therefore, given the logic of the first assertion, the implementation of abortion restrictions would unduly burden racial minorities. This is an impossible thing to say out loud, not least because to do so is to tacitly cheers along as racial minorities kill their unborn children, but it’s quite possible that this is an intentional part of the paragraph’s subtext. A third, much more remote possibility is that the signatories consider injections of intra-amniotic digoxin a means for the unborn to join “diverse and inclusive workforce pipelines.”"
On Painting Air Force One,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/on-painting-air-force-one/,"About Kevin D. Williamson June 13, 2019 3:43 PM President Donald Trump is reflected on the fuselage as he boards Air Force One upon his departure from Bellevue, Neb., June 11, 2019. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Congressional Democrats have been roused to action by changes to the paint of presidential aircraft.
A nd so it has come to this.
Two oil tankers were just attacked in the Gulf of Oman, presumably by Iran. The United States and China are facing off in a confrontation that is about far more than trade. The southern border remains anarchic and uncontrolled. Advertisement Advertisement
Here is the situation: The president of these United States gets from place to place in one of two Boeing jets designated “Air Force One” when the president is aboard. Jets wear out, and the U.S. government is commissioning a couple of new ones, which will not come into use until President Ocasio-Cortez takes over in 2025. The paint scheme is going to change from its 1960s two-tone blue to a more conservative and modern look that is — see if these colors sound familiar — red, white, and blue. The Washington Post is on the case, and reports that the new look will end up “featuring colors remarkably similar to his” — Trump’s — “private jet.” This is true. Trump’s jet, seen often during the 2016 campaign, is, going from top to bottom, blue, red, and white. The new Air Force One will be white, red, and blue. In each case, the red makes up a narrow stripe separating the two larger color fields.
Congressional Democrats are, of course, outraged: How dare this aspiring caudillo order a vehicle belonging to the government to be painted red, white, and blue! That’s . . . un-American! Advertisement Advertisement
Aesthetically, we dodged a national bullet, here. The new designs (there are a few slight variations under consideration) are perfectly ordinary. They are entirely respectable and unremarkable. Given President Trump’s own Nero-by-way-of-Liberace personal tastes — the gilding, the fake Louis XIV furnishings, the golden toilet — things could have been a lot worse.
Nonetheless, Congress has been roused to action. Yes, the same Congress that hasn’t been able to muster a declaration of war for any of the many American military conflicts since World War II, that has allowed debt and unfunded liabilities to rise to ruinous levels, that has sat on its hands as its constitutional prerogatives have been usurped year after year by the executive branch — that Congress has sprung into action, with the House Armed Services Committee voting 31–26 to insist that any changes to the paint or interior decoration (seriously!) of new presidential aircraft require congressional approval.
“Additional paint can add weight to the plane,” says Representative Joe Courtney, a Democrat from Connecticut. The government spends $2 million a minute on Social Security, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the gentleman from Connecticut is worried about the marginal fuel consumption necessitated — possibly! — by a little more paint on a jumbo jet. Representative Joe Courtney should resign in shame. Advertisement Advertisement
So should Representative John Garamendi of California, who says the airplane is “a representation of the power of the United States, the power of the president. If someone wants to change its appearance, its scheme, then we ought to have a say in that.” Representative Garamendi represents, among other places, Sacramento, where the violent-crime rate is about twice the national average . There are criminal-justice-reform proposals gathering dust in Congress, but Representative Garamendi has the energy to get his pants over his head about paint .
This is the wrong paint discussion to be having. If we are to be governed by clowns, let them at least look the part. Advertisement
VIEW SLIDESHOW: Air Force One
I have a proposal of my own regarding Air Force One: Get rid of it. Lots of world leaders fly commercial. Tony Blair did, from time to time. Queen Elizabeth flies British Airways. Presidents of Switzerland have been known to take public transit to work. I’m not saying they have to fly coach — I’m not saying the president needs to be back there in last class, seat 34B — but it is unseemly for the chief magistrate of a republic to stage a Roman triumph as reimagined by P. T. Barnum every time he goes to eat a chicken dinner in Iowa."

Anti-Vaccination Celebrities and Joe Biden's Promise to Cure Cancer | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/anti-vaccination-celebrities-and-joe-bidens-promise-to-cure-cancer/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter June 13, 2019 10:25 AM Father’s Day is this Sunday. You know what Dad wants. The first customer review is up (and it’s not one of my aliases)!* Making the click-through worthwhile: The anti-vaccination forces continue to gain strength, Joe Biden makes promises he knows he can’t keep, and Howard Schultz’s back turns out to be a key factor in the 2020 presidential cycle. Celebrities, Politicians, and Hucksters Are Willing to Kill You Earlier this week, actress Jessica Biel joined anti-vaccination advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as he lobbied California state lawmakers to oppose a law that would make it more difficult for parents to get exemptions from state rules requiring children to receive vaccines before being enrolled in public or private elementary and secondary schools. Biel has a child with Justin Timberlake. Forget his old lyric about “bringing sexy back”; the family is bringing measles back . Biel joins renounced scientific minds Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey, and Rosie O’Donnell in warning the American people to avoid vaccines that protect them from dead diseases at all costs.
(After this newsletter was sent, Biel posted a statement on Instagram declaring, “I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians. My concern with #SB276 is solely regarding medical exemptions.” For what it is worth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. characterized her views as “my body, my choice.” and if you support vaccinations, you probably don’t want to be photographed alongside one of the loudest anti-vaccination voices as you lobby legislators on this issue.) Meanwhile, in the wealthy New York suburb of Chestnut Ridge . . . The mother of an unvaccinated child here in the New York suburbs says eating papaya helps to combat measles. The father of another child who has not been immunized believes that big pharmaceutical companies are paying millions of dollars to doctors, government officials and even judges to bury the truth about vaccine complications. Another mother says the souls of her children are on a journey that vaccines would impede. “As a parent, for me, a lot of my job is to just not put extra obstacles in that soul’s way,” she said. All three parents represent an anti-vaccine fervor on the left that is increasingly worrying health authorities. They often cluster around progressive private schools that are part of the Waldorf educational movement, and at the Waldorf school here, 60 percent of the school’s 300 or so students were not vaccinated against measles and other highly contagious diseases as of late last year. Your child’s education is your business, but if your child is at a Waldorf school . . . you might have reason to be concerned: There are about 150 Waldorf schools in North America, including several in the New York region. Over the last two decades, Waldorf schools across the country have had a spate of disease outbreaks, which is why they are the focus of concern in the measles epidemic . A Waldorf school in North Carolina had an outbreak of chickenpox in November , the worst the state had seen since 1995. In 2016, a Waldorf school in Calgary, Canada, was affected by an outbreak of highly contagious whooping cough . Meanwhile on the other side of the country . . . New data from the California Department of Public Health shows that the rate of vaccinations for San Diego County kindergartners is declining and falling behind other kindergarten students statewide. According to information from the state, San Diego kindergarteners had a 92.5 percent vaccination rate in the 2018-2019 school year, which is below the 94.8 percent average for kindergarten students across the state. San Diego County is below the 95 percent vaccination threshold which public health experts say is necessary to prevent an outbreak of measles or another highly contagious virus. Recall that back in 2014, President Trump tweeted , “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn’t feel good and changes – AUTISM. Many such cases!” At least he got the message at some point. Back in April, Trump made his first comments about vaccinations as president, telling reporters, “They have to get the shots. The vaccinations are so important. This is really going around now. They have to get their shots.” These anti-vaccine celebrities — not really a bunch of rock-ribbed conservatives, I notice — are getting broad public condemnation. But while we’re denouncing famous people for telling people false information about their health . . . could we all muster a little more ire for Joe Biden telling people he can cure cancer, instead of most people averting their eyes and pretending they didn’t hear it? Some argue this is the equivalent of John F. Kennedy declaring in 1962 that the United States would put a man on the moon by the end of the decade. But that was not a campaign pledge; it was not a carrot dangled to the American people, conditional upon Kennedy being reelected. Secondly, if you read the text, Kennedy never promises it or guarantees it. The closest he comes is when he says, “I think we’re going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid.” Kennedy did not undersell the challenges, difficulties or the risk of failure.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. The tone of Biden’s statement is different: “I’ve worked so hard in my career that, I promise you, if I’m elected president, you’re going to see the single most important thing that changes America: We’re going to cure cancer.” Anyone who knows a thing or two about cancer research — which probably includes the vast majority of people who know someone fighting cancer — knows that this is not a matter of not enough willpower, not enough desire for a cure, and not having the right president (The National Cancer Institute ’s total annual budget has increased by $500 million over the last five years to $5.6 billion. Requests for grants are up dramatically over the last four years ; more researchers are exploring more options. Would researchers like more money, and to fund every request that comes through the door ? Sure. But if Biden wants to argue that cancer research is underfunded, he’ll have to defend the preceding administration’s spending decisions. If America could simply buy a cure for the more than 100 varieties of cancer, we would spend that money in a heartbeat. Finding a cure for cancer is hard because cancer cells are always changing, and the cancer cells in a patient’s body aren’t all the same. Research showed that “cells collected from four different regions of the same kidney cancer tumor were in fact quite different.” This means that even if you develop a treatment really effective against one type of cell, it may not be effective against others, and what worked at one time may not work at a later time: It also means the cancer you find today may differ from the one you try to treat in the weeks and months to come. With modern sequencing and analysis, it’s now possible to track cancer cell evolution and begin to predict the changes before they occur. Nonetheless, it’s much harder to hit a moving target than a stationary one, and even a highly effective, precisely targeted combination of therapies may not succeed if enough cancer cells survive initial treatment and further evolve. For any ninny preparing to play the “Why don’t you criticize Republicans?” card, giving grief to Republican presidential candidates who promise diabetes cures or cures for autism , non-Hodgkins lymphoma , and life-threatening heart conditions is more or less my specialty. The Flat White of Presidential Candidates Is off the Menu for a While Howard Schultz — remember him? — wants you to know that he isn’t suspending his interest in a presidential campaign because Joe Biden is the Democratic frontrunner. Instead, he’s being sidelined by back pain. In a letter to supporters, he announces: "

The Left's Secret Judges List | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/left-secret-judges-list-federal-courts/,"June 13, 2019 6:20 PM (Erin Schaff/Reuters)
Last weekend, the New York Times ran a story about “Building the Bench,” an initiative led by liberal dark-money groups preparing a secret list of judges in case a Democrat wins in 2020, and in turn the opportunity to pack the federal courts with progressive judges in a post-Trump Era.
Their goal is to copy the wild success of “The List,” President Trump’s novel initiative in 2016 to publicize the specific names of individuals he would nominate to Justice Scalia’s Supreme Court seat following the justice’s death. Advertisement Advertisement
The individuals on then-candidate Trump’s list were well-respected federal and state judges. The list demonstrated to voters that Trump was a presidential candidate who cared deeply about the courts and rule of law, and would in turn nominate justices and judges who were committed to the rule of law. When he supplemented the initial list in September 2016, Trump vowed to “appoint justices who, like Justice Scalia, will protect our liberty with the highest regard for the Constitution.”
The List proved instrumental to President Trump’s eventual victory in 2016. Exit polls showed that for one in five voters in the 2016 election, the Supreme Court was the top issue. Of that group, 57 percent voted for President Trump. And President Trump made good on his campaign promise, first nominating Justice Neil Gorsuch and later Justice Brett Kavanaugh to seats on the Supreme Court.
But there’s one big difference between President Trump’s List and this new liberal initiative: Trump’s list was public, but this new liberal list is being kept secret. Advertisement Advertisement
One of its principal organizers and sponsors is reportedly Alliance for Justice, a progressive group that has fought vigorously against President Trump’s judicial nominees at every turn, often smearing and misrepresenting their records. (Look back at my post about now-D.C. Circuit judge Neomi Rao if you need to refresh your recollection about the AFJ and their antics.) Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
According to the New York Times , “a number of other liberal advocacy groups and labor unions” are partnering with AFJ to put up Building the Bench. But no one knows who exactly these unnamed “liberal advocacy groups” are, what they want from our courts, or who is funding them. The AFJ has posted on its website a job posting for a counsel to help run Building the Bench. The posting notes that one of the necessary qualifications is “[e]xperience in civil rights, labor, consumer and/or constitutional law,” hinting that the list is probably dominated by lawyers who hold extreme views on everything from racial preferences and unions to the Second Amendment. Do any of these “liberal advocacy groups” have interests before the Supreme Court? Seems likely.
Recently we have heard quite a bit about the idea of expanding the Supreme Court, with a number of Democratic presidential candidates warmly embracing the idea. Kamala Harris has said that she is “ open to increasing the numbers on the Supreme Court ,” as have Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand . Pete Buttigieg has floated a proposal to expand the number of justices on the Court from nine to 15, with five Republican-appointed justices, five-Democrat-appointed justices, with those ten selecting the other five (a plan that is very clearly unconstitutional). Beto O’Rourke has suggested a similar plan to Buttigieg’s. Other lesser-known candidates, such as Governor Jay Inslee, Andrew Yang, and Wayne Messam have also said they would be open to adding justices on the Court . Advertisement Advertisement
When a Court-packing plan was last proposed in 1937 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it was correctly viewed as an illegitimate attempt by Roosevelt to do an end-run around the Supreme Court and its cool reception to FDR’s New Deal legislation. But history has a way of repeating itself, and now 82 years later, the majority of 2020 Democrat contenders are chiming in to support the very radical idea of packing the court with political agenda-driven justices. And now there is a new dark money group to aid in the process of identifying and vetting those potential justices.
So the question remains: Who is on the list? Why are the Democratic candidates, and these groups, so afraid to say exactly who they would want to nominate to the Supreme Court? What are they hiding? Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network. "

New York Rent-Reform Bill Will Make Housing Market Worse for Everyone | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,James Sutton,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/new-york-rent-reform-bill-will-make-housing-worse-everyone/,"June 14, 2019 6:30 AM (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The plan will vastly increase the cost of city housing and lead to the deterioration of thousands of units.
T he New York State Legislature will vote this week on a package of reforms to existing rent-control and tenant-protection laws. Governor Andrew Cuomo has promised to sign whatever the Legislature delivers to his desk. The proposal at issue is disastrous; in a misguided effort to solve New York City’s affordable-housing crisis, Democrats in Albany are threatening to seriously damage the city’s housing supply and the quality of existing buildings. Advertisement
Lawmakers have essentially decided to further intensify the city’s already dense tangle of regulations and restrictions on landlords. The reforms make it much harder to raise rents on rent-controlled (22,000 units in the city) and rent-stabilized (966,000 units) apartments. They make it harder for landlords to evict difficult tenants, and they disincentivize maintenance and upgrades. They force landlords who sold leases below the rent-regulated price to keep them that way. And they allow tenants making over $200,000 a year to pay below-market prices.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, a bit of background on what all these terms mean. Advertisement
Almost a million units in New York City currently fall under the aegis of “rent regulation.” This category includes both rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments. Rent-controlled apartments must have been built before 1947 and been occupied by their current tenants or passed down to said tenants through family members since 1971. Their owners can charge no more than the Maximum Base Rent (MBR), a figure derived from utility charges, real-estate taxes, maintenance fees, and return on investment. They may raise rents once every two years, by no more than 7.5 percent. This is, of course, often subject to lengthy legal challenges mounted by tenants.
Rent stabilization is a whole different kettle of fish. Applying to buildings of six units or more built between 1947 and 1974, or those that opt in for tax benefits, it mandates yearly rent increases set by New York’s Rent Guidelines Board, usually at between 1 and 3 percent. And at least until now, rent-stabilized units whose rent exceeded $2,700 a month or whose tenants made $200,000 a year for two years running were “deregulated,” or taken out of the rent-stabilization program. Advertisement
If it’s not already obvious, New York City’s housing market is not quite an example of unchecked laissez-faire capitalism. Advertisement
You wouldn’t know that from hearing “tenant’s rights” advocates talk, however. Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator of Housing Justice for All, a major advocacy group that has lobbied for the reform package, said in an official statement that the bill takes “back the protections we lost as a result of decades of Republican and real estate control in Albany.”
Of course it doesn’t occur to the Weavers of the world that the “protections” they seek grossly distort housing markets to everyone’s detriment. According to a study of San Francisco’s rent-control program, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, rent control decreases supply and increases rent in the long term. Professor Rebecca Diamond, one of the co-authors, summed it up as “something of a transfer from future tenants to incumbent tenants.” Heavy-handed rent regulation actually resulted in less rent-controlled housing. Landlords would rather convert standard units into condos or upgrade them to luxury units when rent regulations suppress prices. Advertisement
So rent regulation creates a market tilted toward the rich. Middle- and working-class people are left competing for fewer, more expensive, units. Progressive groups then call for even heavier regulation to deal with the “crisis.” And the cycle continues. Advertisement
The Legislature anticipated a few of these problems. Under the reform package, rent-stabilized apartments cannot be deregulated because of rent thresholds or tenant income. They’ll just stay below market rate in most of the city, permanently. And the rule stating that tenants earning over $200,000 a year will see their apartments deregulated was repealed. “Soak the rich” has been replaced with “give them cheaper housing.”
Of course, stopping deregulation will only choke off supply. And yet another change will endanger the quality of whatever is left. Up until now, landlords were able to raise rents up to 6 percent after investing in building improvements, such as a new boiler. The new reforms would cut that cap to 2 percent. According to the Real Estate Board of New York, landlords invest about $10 billion each year in improvements. It will now be harder to use rent increases to help offset those costs. Couple that with the fact that raising rents will now be much harder, and renovating and maintaining buildings will become significantly less lucrative. This process, in which housing stock deteriorates because rents are too low to cover the costs of maintenance and risks of capital improvements, is called “shabbification” by City Journal ’s Howard Husock. Those who escape it are the richest tenants, because improving luxury housing stock carries a much lower risk. Detecting a pattern yet?"
"Hyde Amendment Debate: If Taxpayers Will Fund Abortion, They Should Provide Guns, Too | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Deroy Murdock,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/hyde-amendment-debate-taxpayer-funding-abortion/,"June 14, 2019 6:30 AM Joe Biden speaks to the press at an event in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, June 11, 2019. (Jordan Gale/Reuters) Or, if you want an abortion or a gun, pay for it yourself.
T he mainstream Democratic position on abortion has devolved in just two decades from “Safe, legal, and rare” to “Yee-haw!”
Second Amendment advocates surely have noticed.
Former vice president Joe Biden’s recent gyrations on the Hyde amendment confirm how deeply even a shopworn politician like him must bow to today’s Democrat orthodoxy on abortion. As Biden learned, it’s not enough simply to favor abortion. This epic baby-killing now must be financed by federal taxpayers. Advertisement Advertisement
The late congressman Henry Hyde’s legislation has been a “settled amendment” in every federal budget since 1976. The Illinois Republican’s measure prohibited the use of federal taxpayer dollars to finance abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or life-threatening pregnancies.
Like an Olympic gymnast, Biden flip-flop-flipped on the Hyde amendment — from supporting it since its introduction; to telling an ACLU volunteer in South Carolina “ it can’t stay ” on May 8; to supporting Hyde on June 5 ; and back to opposing it June 6 . Wobbles aside, Biden eventually pegged the landing: “I can no longer support an amendment that makes that [abortion] right dependent on someone’s ZIP code.” Advertisement
Biden finally stands where all Democratic presidential contenders must, to avoid the Donkey party’s volcanic, socialist rage: Abortion is A-okay until the moment a baby exits the womb, and taxpayers must sponsor it, at least for the poor. Advertisement
Today’s Democrats believe that every individual right demands a corresponding taxpayer-funded freebie. That impulse triggers this modest proposal:
Guns for All!
Every American has a Second Amendment right to own a gun, but not everyone can afford one.
A Smith & Wesson .38 Special revolver runs $280. For workers making the $7.25 minimum wage, this equals nearly 39 hours of earnings. That’s almost a whole work week, just for a basic firearm. Unfair!
Those who seek the persuasiveness of a Glock pistol must pay $600 each. That costs a minimum-wage employee 83 hours of labor (more than two 40-hour weeks). Or she simply could sacrifice 150 McDonald’s Big Macs , 129 Starbucks chai lattes , or 46 plates of fettucine Alfredo at Olive Garden. Advertisement
And the reassurance of a Ruger AR-556 “assault rifle” costs $700. This approximates three weeks’ rent on the average one-bedroom U.S. apartment. Advertisement
Nobody should have to choose among firearms, food, or shelter. Likewise, the ability to buy a gun shouldn’t be dependent on someone’s ZIP code.
So, say it loud, say it proud: Guns for All!
Congress immediately should allocate $563.8 million as an initial act of basic solidarity with the non-arms-owning public. This amount parallels Planned Parenthood’s taxpayer subsidies and reimbursements for its fiscal year 2018.
This private organization has enjoyed federal dollars despite the 7.6 million abortions that it has perpetrated between 1973’s Roe v. Wade decision and 2017, Life News reports. Last year, it aborted another 332,757 unborn Americans — the most since 2012. Planned Parenthood Federation of America president Leana Wen, M.D., considers abortion part of “ our core mission. ”
While you spend five minutes reading this op-ed, Planned Parenthood will whack three more babies.
An equivalent $563.8 million federal grant to the National Rifle Association would help this private organization furnish weapons to low-income Americans who yearn to enjoy their constitutional right to keep and bear arms and invoice taxpayers to exercise that right. Advertisement
It’s only fair: If Democrats want to kill the Hyde amendment and stick pro-life taxpayers with the tab for the constitutionally protected abortions that the Left loves so much, then Republicans should enact Guns for All and force pro-gun-control taxpayers to underwrite the constitutionally protected firearms that the Right loves so much.

Congress Should Fix Itself Before Reclaiming Its Power | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Cost,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/congress-should-fix-itself-before-reclaiming-power/,"June 14, 2019 6:30 AM (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) The Constitution requires it to take the lead, but right now it’s too dysfunctional.
R egular readers of mine (and listeners to my podcast with Luke Thompson, Constitutionally Speaking ) will know that I am an “Article I” kind of guy. I like Congress, or at least I like the idea of Congress. I think “co-equal branches” is a myth. I think the true backbone of republican government is Congress, not the president and certainly not the courts.
So, it should come as no shock then that I found myself largely in agreement with Yuval Levin’s recent op-ed for the New York Times , on the need for Congress to reclaim some of its lost authority:
Our constitutional system cannot function this way. To repair it, Congress will have to reclaim its place. This certainly means taking oversight seriously, and the assorted misbehaviors of the Trump administration must surely be on the agenda. But it is crucial that the reassertion of congressional power be at its core a reassertion of legislative power, not just of oversight. Fighting the president is not what Congress is for. And the fact that Congress has forgotten what it is for is bad news for our constitutional system.
So here’s a bit of a shocker: I partially disagree with Yuval as well. The sad fact of the matter is that, organizationally speaking, Congress is a disgrace. Without substantial reforms of congressional practice, the headline of Yuval’s piece, “What if Congress, Not Trump, Were In Charge?” would probably be answered, “Things would be a lot worse .” Before Congress reclaims its power, it has to acquire the ability to behave responsibly, on behalf of the general welfare of the United States. Unless that happens, I will oppose expansions of legislative authority, much as I wish I did not have to.
I have a series of essays that I have been working on for the American Enterprise Institute that deal in more depth with this subject. For now, I’ll just offer a digest of my opinions.
It was not always like this. Congress used to be the dominant player in American public policy. Before the rise of the regulatory state, before the emergence of the “imperial presidency,” there was Congress. Study politics during the Gilded Age, and you will inevitably see the most important people in the country rarely lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They either were captains of industry or the titans of Congress. James G. Blaine, Tom Reed, Joseph Cannon, Nelson Aldrich. These were men to be reckoned with.
Why did Congress lose its power? Let’s be a little more precise with the question. It did not technically lose its power, of course. It’s still sitting right there in Article I, Section 8. Congress instead lost the will to exercise it. Why is that the case? I think we have to answer that question before we start calling for an increase in congressional authority, and Yuval’s response does not entirely satisfy:
Whether driven by partisanship, misguided by perverse media and political incentives, or simply put off by the burdens of responsibility, members of both houses are now reluctant to really legislate.
No doubt, he is onto something here. The problem with this explanation is that, while it may explain recent history, it does not account for the long-term trend of congressional abdication, an ongoing process of 100 years and counting. It transcends media, political, and partisan eras. So, to build a theory, we have to look at history with a little more granularity.
The answer, as with many things regarding Congress, can be found by looking first at the people. Congress, for better or worse, represents the people. It may be a perverted picture in some respects (or it may be an accurate picture that we wish were perverted!), but it is still representative. Elections guarantee that. Advertisement
Beginning around the time of the Progressive Era, more or less continuing up to this day, the people have demanded that Congress grant more and more deference to the executive branch. They have rarely equivocated in this demand. Maybe that is not what the people intended, but it has been the resounding effect of their votes. Advertisement Advertisement
Look at the big shifts in congressional–executive relationships. These mainly happen during the 60th and 61st Congress (1913–1917); the 73rd, 74th, and 75th Congresses (1933–1939); the 80th Congress (1947–49); and the 89th Congress (1965–67). There were smaller expansions and contractions here and there (e.g. the 111 th Congress, which passed Obamacare), but these seven Congresses really established the framework for modern executive–legislative relationships.
In five of these Congresses (61st, 73rd, 74th, 75th, and 89th), there was a shift toward greater executive power. In one of them (80th), there was a successful effort to scale back the administrative state. In the next election, the people always responded by voting for the party calling for greater executive power. Admittedly, the majority party’s margin was sometimes diminished, preventing it from enacting new reforms. But the opposition never acquired a strong enough majority to undo what its predecessor had done. Advertisement
Public opinion is not terribly well formed, and it is easy to overinterpret. But in general it is fair to say that the people have been more likely to support cuts to congressional power than to support expansions — and for good reasons. As a dyed-in-the-wool republican, I do not like the idea of being governed by an imperial president and his army of unelected bureaucrats. But by the middle of the 20th century, congressional governance had become such an intolerable blend of incompetence and corruption that the “imperial presidency” was arguably . . . better. Advertisement
This problem has its origins in the constitutional structure of the legislature. While Congress represents the country, it is wrong to say that it necessarily represents the national interest . There are, after all, no members who count as their constituency the entire country. Rather, Congress is the meeting place of representatives from 535 diverse constituencies, each of whom has an electoral incentive to place the good of his constituents before that of the whole country.
Now, to be fair, many members do not act in such a low manner. Some of them possess the civic virtue requisite to vote against the wishes of their constituents in pursuit of their interests, rightly understood. The problem is that the average member is unlikely to be possessed of such high motives, which means that Congress represents not the national interest but some weighted average of all the local constituencies within the chamber. These are two different things, and Congress as a chamber has been inclined to deal with national problems as the sum of local problems — which leads to all sorts of unintended consequences: corruption, inefficiency, overreaction, underreaction, etc. Advertisement
Consider the period between the Civil War and the Progressive movement. This is an important test case for the responsible use of legislative power, because here we see Congress directly engaging with a complex, industrialized economy and diverse citizenry — but largely before the administrative state matures. These were the salad days of congressional supremacy, and the results are extremely disappointing. There are some notable exceptions, but it is hard to look at any policy domain during this period and not see Congress seriously misbehave at some point or another. Railroad expansion. Industrial regulation. Civil War pensions. Maintenance of the currency. Civil rights. It’s a long list of failures.
Ironically, no policy domain better illustrates this problem than the one that now has people calling for greater congressional power — the tariff authority. Advertisement
From 1816 to 1933, the United States engaged in a basically uninterrupted project of industrial protection, largely directed by Congress. While there were some national benefits at various points to this regime, it was on balance a negative experience for the country. And this is not merely the judgment of historians, but that of contemporary political players all throughout the eras. Peruse the various party platforms, and you will see both sides regularly call for “tariff reform.” Why? Because Congress made a total hash of it.
The waterloo arrived in 1930, with the Smoot-Hawley tariff. As so many previous protective measures did, this one started as a misguided but benignly intentioned effort to prop up the economy in the face of the Great Depression. But (as so many previous protective measures did!), it devolved into a massive logroll that was malignant to the national interest. Against his better judgment, President Herbert Hoover signed the tariff of 1930 into law.
Smoot-Hawley worsened the Depression, led to the election of Franklin Roosevelt, and, more important, brought about an inadvertent shift in congressional–executive relations. Subsequent Congresses handed the tariff power to the president in large part because they knew that Congress could not exercise it responsibly, and that irresponsibility could lead to economic calamity and eventually electoral defeat. So the free-trade regime that has existed more or less since the 1930s is based on the idea that the president should keep Congress at bay. Advertisement Advertisement
I could offer many more examples. Instead, I’ll summarize by restating my main contentions: Congress is not currently equipped to handle national problems in a responsible manner; this is not a problem of ethics or civic virtue, but rather legislative organization; congressional incompetence tends to result in inefficiency, graft, and generally bad legislation; the public, at least dimly aware of this, has responded by empowering the president — who, by his very nature as the unitary agent of his branch, can theoretically act with a coherent national purpose that Congress so often lacks."

1985— In Jenkins v. Missouri , federal district judge Russell G. Clark launches his desegregation plan for the Kansas City, Missouri, School District—a plan that will become (according to the description embraced by Chief Justice Rehnquist) the “most ambitious and expensive remedial program in the history of school desegregation.” Over the next twelve years, Clark will (as this report summarizes it) order the state of Missouri and the school district to spend nearly two billion dollars for “higher teachers’ salaries, 15 new schools, and such amenities as an Olympic-sized swimming pool with an underwater viewing room, television and animation studios, a robotics lab, a 25-acre wildlife sanctuary, a zoo, a model United Nations with simultaneous translation capability, and field trips to Mexico and Senegal.” Advertisement Advertisement
The results will, however, prove dismal: “Test scores did not rise; the black-white gap did not diminish; and there was less, not greater, integration.”
1993 —President Clinton announces that he will nominate D.C. Circuit judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Byron White.
In addition to dissenting from Roe and favoring its overruling, White authored the Court’s opinion in 1986 (in Bowers v. Hardwick ) rejecting as “at best, facetious” the notion that the Constitution confers a right to homosexual sodomy. In stark contrast to White, the former ACLU activist Ginsburg maintained that the Constitution protected a right to abortion and even required taxpayer funding of abortion, and she had stated her sympathy for the proposition that there is a constitutional right to prostitution and a constitutional right to bigamy. Somehow legal academics fail to rise in alarm at the prospect that Ginsburg’s appointment will alter the “balance” of the Court.

Hillary Clinton & Elizabeth Warren: Democratic Candidates Are Very Similar | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-many-similarities-between-elizabeth-warren-and-hillary-clinton/,"June 14, 2019 9:21 AM Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton at a campaign rally in Manchester, N.H., October 24, 2016. (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
I’ll be out next week. Remember that if you’re in the Hilton Head area, you can hear me ramble about the book , answer some questions about politics and the presidential race, and get some free food Monday night. It’s free, just RSVP here .
Making the click-through worthwhile: contemplating whether the attacks Trump used against Hillary Clinton will work against Elizabeth Warren; the Democrats pick their top 20 candidates for the debates, leaving a governor, a former senator, a Congressman and a mayor out in the cold; and Trump proves, once again, that he will never change, no matter the consequence. Advertisement Advertisement
Which 2020 Democrat Reminds You the Most of Hillary Clinton?
The Boston Herald declares , “Elizabeth Warren is on the rise — the presidential hopeful’s aggressive policy push is translating into a surge in the polls just in time for the first set of debates.”
Anytime you compare a current candidate to a past presidential candidate, you’re going to get counter-arguments that “Candidate X is different from Candidate Y!” No two candidates are exactly alike. Matthew Continetti asked if Joe Biden would be the next Hillary Clinton; Jonah and David French pointed out the differences, I had wondered about the pair back in April . Advertisement
But if you’re trying to figure out which Democratic presidential candidate would have the worst shot of beating Trump, one way to look at it is to ask, out of the entire 2020 field, which candidate reminds you of Hillary Clinton the most? Advertisement
Elizabeth Warren is 69; Hillary Clinton turned 69 right before Election Day 2016. Both lawyers, both served in the Obama administration, both elected to the Senate in a big Northeastern state. Both women were trailblazers in high-powered legal circles; one attended an Ivy league law school, one taught in an Ivy league law school.
Clinton took a lot of grief about implausible claims of being “dead broke” when she left the White House or her Tuzla Dash ; Warren gets a lot of grief about her implausible claims of Native American heritage. Hillary Clinton faced accusations that her career’s rapid ascent involved insider deals and dishonesty; Warren faces accusations that her career’s rapid ascent involved dishonesty about minority status and institutions eager to tout that unsupported claim. For women who have risen to the top of national politics, they’ve faced criticism for being tone-deaf about how they’ve handled sensitive issues.
Both have friends and colleagues who insist they are warm and personable in private; both face accusations of being cold and stiff and inauthentic on the campaign trail. ( Recall Warren’s beer chat on Instagram .) Both face the criticism that they’re not “likeable,” and both have allies insisting that criticism is sexist. Warren may face the accusation that her speeches have a lecturing tone, but for most of her adult life, she’s been employed in a job that involves giving lectures. Advertisement Advertisement
Both think of themselves as technocrats — insightful policy wonks who are best-positioned to enact sweeping changes to the nation’s health-care system and economic policies because they’ve researched the topics deeply. While both have lived quite comfortably in adulthood, they both see themselves as defenders of the impoverished and downtrodden. Both discuss harder times in earlier chapters of their life and face accusations that they lost touch long ago and don’t really relate to problems of today’s poor. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Both women want a much larger role for the federal government in regulating the economy, but both reject the label “socialist.” Hillary’s campaign tangled with the “Bernie Bros,” and Warren’s is tangling with them now. Both found a portion of their traditional protectionist agenda in alignment with President Trump; Warren and Clinton pledged to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, although Clinton flip-flopped on that issue. Advertisement
Perhaps most significantly, Trump is likely to criticize Warren the way he criticized Clinton — as an elite who enjoyed the benefits of a rigged system. If Warren gets the nomination, we’ll hear a lot of “Pocahontas” jabs, but probably some version of the “Crooked Hillary,” “the queen of corruption,” “Lyin’ Hillary” attacks. Whether you think it’s sexist or not, Trump and his allies are likely to paint Warren as an insufferable know-it-all nag, an academic who thinks she knows how to best manage every detail of your life, condescending and badgering. For at least four years, that persona will be addressing you from the Oval Office, telling you how things are going to change and how it’s for your own good.
It’s an open question about whether these attacks will be as effective against Warren as they were against Hillary Clinton. There is no Warren Foundation with foreign donors, Warren’s husband didn’t generate a slew of embarrassing sex scandals, Warren has no Benghazi-like foreign-policy debacle in her past, she’s not seen as a continuation of a political dynasty, and Warren hasn’t been front and center in American politics since 1992. It is likely that a factor in the 2016 election results was Americans’ sheer exhaustion with the Clintons. Advertisement
Still, if you’re the Trump campaign, you probably see Elizabeth Warren as the candidate who is the closest to Hillary Clinton 2.0. And that’s the one kind of candidate that Trump has beaten in a general election. Advertisement
The Great Culling of the Democratic Field Has Begun
Guess who didn’t make the debate ? “Those who did not meet the threshold for the first debate include: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel; Miramar, Florida Mayor Wayne Messam; and Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts.”
Go home, guys. There is no great injustice in your exclusion. The voice of the people is not being denied. If the people wanted you, they would have noticed you by now. Bullock, you waited too long. He says it’s because he spent too much of this year on the job he was elected to do .
I certainly knew getting in at the time I did would give me fewer opportunities to be on shows with you and others, but I had a job to do and if it ultimately ever came down to choosing between getting Medicaid reauthorized, getting 100,000 Montanans health care, versus getting in earlier just to bump up on another poll, I would make that same choice time and time again.
Great. But you made a choice, and this is the consequence of that choice. Accept it.
Gravel, you had your shot. When you announced this year, people were shocked — mostly because they figured you had passed away a few years ago. You’re the only candidate that Bernie Sanders can call old.
Mayor Messam, you are so obscure, there are no good jokes to be told about you. Advertisement
Moulton . . . think about it, you couldn’t reach a threshold of polling and donor support that was met by Eric Swalwell, Tim Ryan, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney, and Bill de Blasio.
Guys, there is no great surge of support awaiting you just around the corner. It is not your year, and it never was.
Of Course, Trump Would Accept Foreign Help Again.
Meanwhile, as for the man they seek to replace, why is there surprise that Trump said he would accept opposition research or dirt from a foreign government if offered in the 2020 cycle? He never apologizes. He never admits mistakes. In his mind, something or someone who helps him is good, regardless of all other factors, and something or someone who criticizes him is bad, regardless of all other factors. This is why he keeps talking about how nice those letters from Kim Jong Un are. He cannot assess the quality of someone or something outside of the context of self-interest.
Trump will say whatever pops into his head in response to any question, and he’s demonstrated time and time again that he does not care where he is — whether it is in front of the wall of stars at CIA headquarters or whether he’s sitting in front of the graves at Normandy .
He is who he is, he will not change, he will not modify or adapt, and most of us figured that out a long time ago. This is why the “You won’t believe what Trump said” coverage gets tuned out after a while. Yes, we will believe it. "

Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of the top Democratic contenders for the White House, rolled out a $7 billion proposal Friday that would provide minority entrepreneurs with grants to start new businesses.
“Today, the playing field is tilted against entrepreneurs of color. On average, Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority households have a lot less wealth than white households,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote in a blog post . “Because the government helped create that wealth gap with decades of sanctioned discrimination, the government has an obligation to address it head on — with bold policies that go right at the heart of the problem.”
The plan, called the Small Business Equity Fund, would earmark $7 billion to help close the “startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color.” Grants would be available to minority entrepreneurs, including women, with a household wealth of under $100,000."

His big speech on democratic socialism shows that he is unable to reckon with either the successes of capitalism or the failures of socialism. From my new column:
If Sanders wins the Democratic nomination, he had better hope that the economy falls into recession – because his speech suggests that his only idea of how to campaign against an incumbent during an economic boom is to claim it isn’t happening. It’s “a so-called booming economy,” Sanders says, one reflected in “macroeconomic numbers” but not people’s lives. The people themselves don’t seem to agree . . ."
Gun Advice from the Worst Column Ever | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W.

Cooke on Twitter June 14, 2019 12:32 PM Instructor Andy Sweeney works with a member of The Well Armed Woman Shooting Chapters at GAT Guns in East Dundee, Illinois, in 2015. (Jim Young/Reuters) From Live Well Nebraska comes the most amusingly hysterical and extraordinarily ignorant advice column I have read in a long while. It consists of a question, posed by a man writing as “Dumbfounded Father,” and a response, offered by “syndicated columnist” Amy Dickinson. At no point in the exchange does either person range within a country mile of reality.
“ Dumbfounded Father ” begins his question as such:
Dear Amy: This week, I discovered that my intelligent, hard-working, responsible 24-year-old daughter (who lives with me) is a gun owner!
What, exactly, is the purpose of this description of his daughter? Is the implication that an “ intelligent, hardworking, and responsible ” person should not own a gun? Would the purchase be more understandable if it had been made by a stupid, lazy, and reckless person? Is it that women should not own guns (long live the patriarchy!)? Or should gun-owners be older , perhaps. He doesn’t say.
It gets worse from there:
And it’s not a normal gun, either — it is a 40-caliber semi-automatic, and she has hollow-point bullets to go with it.
It is difficult to think of a more “ normal gun ” than a 40-caliber semi-automatic pistol. If there is such a thing as a “ normal gun ” in American life, it is this one. Likewise, there is nothing especially scary about “ hollow-point bullets, ” more on which later.
He continues:
Amy, this is the kind of weapon a criminal would possess! She says it is for emergencies. There have only been two home invasions in our neighborhood in the last 11 years.
A 40-caliber semi-automatic is in no way “ the kind of weapon a criminal would possess. ” Hell, what does that even mean ? Millions of Americans possess 40-caliber semi-automatic pistols. Tens of millions possess near-identical handguns in 9mm, .357 SIG, and .45 ACP, among others. There’s nothing remotely “ criminal ” about those guns, or about the people who own them.
As for his “ she says it is for emergencies ” part. If that’s what she says, then why not believe her? She’s an adult, isn’t she?
Oh:
I’ve given her three choices: She can either give her weapon to me, sell it or move out in three weeks.
“ Give the weapon to me ” is an odd thing to write after “ this is the kind of weapon a criminal would possess ” — as, for that matter is, “ sell it ” (to whom: a criminal?). But the “ move out in three weeks part ” takes the cake, given that he follows it up with:
I love my daughter and would be so sad for her to move into a place that she would hardly be able to afford
The position thus far, then, is: “ My daughter has bought a gun for emergencies. This is irrational because we live in a safe area that has hosted only — only! — two home invasions in the past decade. In consequence, I will force her to live in a place that is more dangerous. ”
Brilliant.
Dumbfounded’s question then goes fully off the rails:
but now I have to lock my bedroom door at night because I don’t know what she’s going to do.
Has there ever been a better illustration of the weird belief that the mere act of owning a firearm turns even “ intelligent, hard-working, responsible ” people into murderous psychopaths? The questioner is is talking about his own daughter . He doesn’t know what she’s “ going to do ” ? He has to “ lock his bedroom door at night ” ? Good Lord, man. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
He concludes:
Now she says that I don’t trust her, and is barely speaking to me. How can I convince her to stop endangering us?
Well, yeah.
Amy’s response, which could have been calm and rational and tethered to reality, is arguably even worse. She writes:
Dear Dumbfounded: According to my research, possessing hollow-point bullets is illegal in 11 states; is it legal in your state to own this sort of exploding ammunition?
It is remarkable enough that a sentence that begins “ according to my research ” finishes with the characterization of hollow-point bullets as “ exploding ammunition. ” Hollow-point bullets are not “ exploding ammunition. ” They are normal bullets designed to expand on impact — which does more damage to the target and provides extra stopping power, but also makes them less likely to pass through walls or otherwise cause collateral damage.
As for the “ is it legal in your state to own this sort of exploding ammunition ” question . . . does Amy also believe that Dumbfounded’s daughter is exhibiting criminal tendencies? It’s hard to see any other implication. If it is not legal to own hollow-points in Dumbfounded’s state, his daughter must have (a) left her state; (b) bought the ammunition in another state, and (c) returned to her state in violation of the law. Does that sound likely? Or is it more likely that she was told by the guy in the gun store that hollow-points are recommended for home defense? Advertisement Advertisement
(Writing at Live Well Nebraska, Amy gets a lot of questions from out of state, does she?)
Amy then continues with some random statistics she Googled, a reiteration of Dumbfounded’s initial question, and some choice insinuation:
In a report published in 2015, researchers at the University of Chicago found that 31 percent of households reported having a firearm in 2014, down from about 48 percent in 1980.
According to this study, there are more guns, but concentrated in fewer households. Why must your household be one of them?
Where did your daughter get this weapon and ammunition? Has she received any safety training or certification? (Accidental gun death is a substantial risk of owning a gun.) Is she perhaps engaged in another activity outside of your household that exposes her to increased risks and makes her believe she needs to have a weapon?
And then, rather than asking, “D o you really think that your daughter intends to hurt you, you lunatic? ” she accepts Dumbfounded’s premise and tries to alarm him even further:
I have news for you: A locked bedroom door is no match for this weaponry; as I write this, just five days ago a father in South Carolina tragically shot and killed his own 23-year-old daughter through a closed door — when he mistook her for an intruder.
That is a sad story. But it remains the case that the likelihood of Dumbfounded’s daughter hunting him down through his locked bedroom door — intentionally, or otherwise — is close to nil. By contrast, there are between tens of thousands (on the extreme low end of the estimates) and millions (on the high end) of defensive gun uses each year. For some reason, that didn’t show up in Amy’s research."

"'Brainwashing': A Literary and Cinematic Device, Not a Real Thing | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/brainwashing-myth-literary-cinematic-device/,"June 16, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) Or cults, or repressed memories
‘ N xivm: How a Sex Cult Leader Seduced and Programmed His Followers,” reads the New York Times headline. “Former Nxivm members testified they were brainwashed into being branded and assigned to have sex with him.”
None of that is quite true.
Blame Richard Condon.
Contrary to the New York Times , there is no such thing as “brainwashing.” It is a concept without scientific basis that, so far as the scholars can tell, does not really exist in a way that is distinct from such quotidian concepts as persuasion , conformism , or bullying . During the Korean War, American intelligence operatives studied the possibility that American prisoners of war had been forcibly converted to the Communist cause by a combination of torture, coercive interrogation, and psychoactive drugs. As it turns out, the human brain does not really quite work that way — again, contrary to the New York Times , human beings cannot be “programmed” like a smart-home thermostat — but the idea had great dramatic potential. Advertisement Advertisement
That potential was comprehended and exploited by, among others, the satirical novelist Richard Condon, whose Manchurian Candidate was made into a very successful film starring Frank Sinatra and a very creepy Angela Lansbury. Like many of the greatest examples of the genre, The Manchurian Candidate is not always recognized as satire. Advertisement
Brainwashing, as it is currently understood in the popular culture, is a literary and cinematic device that has made its way into the global imagination as though it were a real thing. It fills the same mythological role once played by demonic possession — a way of explaining how it is that someone apparently has become utterly unlike himself for no obvious reason. Advertisement
In the same way, there is no such thing as a cult, either, as distinct from ordinary religious groups, authoritarian and highly conformist political factions (meaning all you peons on Twitter), or even diet and exercise fads that take on fanatical qualities. Many years ago, I was at Waco helping to cover the events for which Waco was famous before it was famous for a new kind of cult (the one focused on Chip and Joanna Gaines), and no one then or since has been able to explain to me why those Seventh-Day Adventists were a “cult” but these Seventh-Day Adventists are a Christian denomination. True, the Branch Davidians were a splinter from a splinter who venerated a charismatic teacher, but then so are the Methodists.
The Branch Davidians were the protagonists in what scholars Anson D. Shupe, J .C. Ventimiglia, and David G. Bromley call an “ atrocity tale .” The Branch Davidians were kooks with odd beliefs, and they were people of low social status. (Scientology is bonkers, but you don’t see the feds raiding Tom Cruise’s house, do you?) But they could not be merely odd, because oddness does not justify hatred — they had to be evil. And so there were wild tales of sexual abuse and horrifying abuse of babies, none of which was ever proven and some of which was specifically denied by the FBI. Everybody agreed that there needed to be a military-level assault on the “cult,” but nobody quite knew why. “Confusion Abounds in the Capital On Rationale for Assault on Cult,” the New York Times reported at the time. Advertisement Advertisement
There is no such thing as brainwashing. There is no such thing as a cult. At least not as those terms are commonly used. But there are many imaginary things that have played a large and important role in our culture and politics. There is no such thing as a “recovered memory,” but people have been put in prison on “recovered memory” evidence. There is no such thing as “multiple-personality disorder,” but many people believe there is, thanks to the popular film based on the 1973 book Sybil, written by the psychiatrist Cornelia B. Wilbur and journalist Flora Rheta Schreiber, much of which was fabricated. The term “multiple personality disorder” is no longer used, and there is no psychiatric consensus about whether the rebranded “disassociative identity disorder” exists. Some psychiatrists believe that it is therapeutically induced, and that some patients are especially susceptible to hypnotic suggestion. The problem with that theory is that hypnosis does not exist, either. There is no scientific evidence that a hypnotic state exists. To the extent that the word “hypnosis” refers to an actual phenomenon, it is simply role-playing .
Much of the cultural legacy of Sigmund Freud is pure mythology, based on pseudoscience and fraud . There were no Satanic sex-abuse cults infiltrating the nation’s daycares back in the Reagan era, but people went to prison over it, enabled in part by “recovered memories.” The typical emotional problem associated with trauma is not the suppression of memory or experience but the inability to cease thinking about the trauma and move on. Advertisement
The intelligent reader will detect a theme in the fictions above: They are all devices for relieving the individual of responsibility for his actions. Uncle Joe isn’t a kook, he’s the victim of a cult. He was programmed. He was brainwashed. He was suffering from repressed trauma, and now that he has recovered his memories, he has a very sympathetic version of events. Advertisement
Maybe he was possessed by Azazello.
We are surrounded by people who profess their love of science and we are surrounded by things that are mostly made up and deep-dipped in pseudoscience: chiropractic, homeopathy, yoga, aromatherapy, reiki, the terror of GMOs and vaccines, etc. In the Washington Post , you can read paeans to science as a guiding principle of politics and then turn the page to read your horoscope. You can choose your pronoun.
Of course, this influences our politics, too. There is some graffiti not far from my home in Texas that reads: “Fed = Jews.” But if it is not the Jews, it is the Koch brothers, the NRA, lobbyists, the “1 percent,” Mark Zuckerberg and other billionaires, Big Business . . . cults, brainwashing, nefarious strains of corn . . .

Machinations and Manipulations in the Census Case | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/census-citizenship-question-case-supreme-court/,"June 16, 2019 12:07 PM Naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles, Calif., in 2013. (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters)
Before the Supreme Court wraps up its term this month, it is expected to issue a ruling in Department of Commerce v. New York (otherwise known as the Census case). The case concerns Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross’s decision to reinstitute a question about citizenship in the 2020 census. Census authorities have been inquiring about citizenship status in one form or another for nearly all of the last 200 years, whether as a component of the decennial census or since 2005 as part of an annual survey that reaches a fraction of households. Nonetheless, this latest decision was met by a court challenge. The plaintiffs in the case (a collection of states, cities, counties, and civil rights groups) sued the Trump administration in federal district court, and Judge Jesse Furman, an Obama appointee, ruled in January that the citizenship question could not be used in the 2020 decennial census. The Supreme Court took the unusual step of agreeing to hear the case on direct appeal from the district court. Advertisement Advertisement
Late last month (after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments), the plaintiffs wrote both the Supreme Court and the district court to claim they have new evidence—specifically, a file from the hard drive of a deceased Republican strategist named Thomas Hofeller that was turned over to the plaintiffs by Hofeller’s estranged daughter. Advertisement
The plaintiffs claim that, contrary to the sworn testimony of government officials, Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore relied on an unpublished 2015 study conducted by Hofeller in drafting the Department of Justice’s formal request to the Department of Commerce to reinstitute the citizenship question. The plaintiffs allege that Hofeller “concluded in a 2015 study that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census ‘would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats’ and ‘advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites’ in redistricting,” and that Hofeller “helped ghostwrite a draft DOJ letter to Commerce requesting a citizenship question and providing the Voting Rights Act enforcement rationale for doing so.”
The “Voting Rights Act enforcement rationale” refers to the Commerce Department’s stated justification for adding the citizenship question to the census, which is that the Department of Justice requested citizenship data from the Commerce Department to support the DOJ’s enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—not because of any impermissible racial animus. Secretary Ross issued a policy letter explaining his rationale and also testified before Congress about it. Advertisement
Now plaintiffs say they have the equivalent of a smoking gun. Even though the case is currently pending before the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs have sought sanctions against the DOJ in the district court, arguing that the government “concealed” the study, which the plaintiffs claim “strongly underscores the pretextual basis for the [government’s] decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Decennial Census.” Last week Judge Furman postponed ruling on the plaintiffs’ request for sanctions until the Supreme Court issues its decision and set an August deadline for briefs on the sanctions question. Advertisement
And then on Thursday, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the Supreme Court requesting that the case be remanded to the district court for “inquiry and fact-finding into whether Dr. Hofeller’s partisan and racially discriminatory motives for adding a citizenship question were shared by, or should otherwise be imputed to, relevant Commerce officials, including the Secretary.” Advertisement
The government has vigorously refuted the plaintiffs’ claim that Acting Assistant Attorney General Gore relied on the Hofeller study. In its response to the plaintiffs’ motion to the district court, the government argued that the plaintiffs “provide[d] no evidence that Gore ever read, received, or was even aware of the existence of that unpublished study” and that “neither Hofeller nor his unpublished study played any role whatsoever in the drafting of the [] letter” that was the DOJ’s formal request to reinstate the citizenship question on the census. Rather, the government asserts that the plaintiffs’ effort to reopen the case is nothing more than an “eleventh-hour campaign to improperly derail the Supreme Court’s resolution of the government’s appeal.” The government also correctly notes that the Hofeller study is irrelevant to the Supreme Court’s decision in this case, “because the critical issue in this APA case is whether the Secretary provided an objectively rational basis for his decision to reinstate the citizenship question,” and nothing in Hofeller’s personal files can resolve that legal issue (emphasis added). The Secretary provided a rational explanation for the reinstitution of the citizenship question, and the APA provides no justification for looking outside the closed record.

More fundamentally, the plaintiffs’ sideshow is irrelevant to the key question in the case, which is whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue in the first place. The district court found that the plaintiffs had “associational standing” because some of their members receive funds from federal programs that are distributed based on census data. But the government argues that the plaintiffs’ “alleged injuries will materialize only if unidentified third parties react to the citizenship question by illegally refusing to fully answer and return the census questionnaire in violation of federal law,” so they wouldn’t have standing. At oral argument, the justices seemed to agree. This is the nub: if the plaintiffs do not have standing, the case must be dismissed, making who devised the citizenship question irrelevant. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The plaintiffs’ request for a remand for fact-finding about supposed new evidence is nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary effort to prevent the Court from ruling on the case before the end of the term. With the deadline for printing the Census form fast approaching at the end of the month, this is an apt example of the old phrase, “Justice delayed is justice denied.” The longer that the plaintiffs can keep litigating, the better, from their perspective. And the plaintiffs’ specious allegations of misconduct by government officials is just window dressing for their bald-faced delay tactics.
Not surprisingly, the editorial board of the New York Times has joined the plaintiffs in their campaign for a delayed decision with a headline blasting, “Looks Like the Trump Administration Lied About the Census.” As have myriad other left-wing columnists who are wringing their hands over the Supreme Court’s “legitimacy” were it to go ahead and rule in in the case.

There is no reason for the Supreme Court to remand this case. The facts and arguments that the Court needs to rule are squarely before it now, and it should do so this month. Carrie Severino is chief counsel and policy director to the Judicial Crisis Network. "
Robert Mugabe & Zimbabwes Trauma Review Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2017/12/18/zimbabwes-trauma/,"December 18, 2017 12:50 AM Robert Mugabe was a symptom
O ne of the more poignant moments in the story of African decolonization was the small riot staged in Havana by a group of Congolese teenagers who had been sent to Cuba to study medicine at the Castro government’s expense. They had been selected by the authorities in Brazzaville more for their political connections than their academic records, with the result that very few among the hundreds of prospective doctors and nurses who landed in Cuba in 1966 had any knowledge of basic science; some could barely read and write. Nevertheless, they expected to be turned into doctors with a minimum of delay, for there were fewer than ten civilian doctors in the whole of Congo-Brazzaville at the time and most of them were foreigners. Whatever it was that the Cubans told the Congolese to explain why their med-school studies could not possibly begin immediately, it did not go over well. Advertisement Advertisement
But what could the Cubans have said? How do you explain to a suspicious Congolese who thinks he is ready for medical school that he is not even ready for university? He thinks you are trying to cheat him or disrespect him, and he doesn’t much care that as a Communist anti-imperialist you are on his side. You might try catching him out with some basic questions such as “Can you tell me what blood does?” or “Read aloud from this textbook,” but he may well fail to see the relevance. The Congolese students had probably never seen a doctor perform anything more complicated than an injection or an amputation, and it is hardly self-evident that it should take much time or much reading to learn doctoring of that sort. To them it must have seemed that the Cubans were setting needless obstacles in their path, most likely for self-interested reasons. Advertisement
There is an analogy to be drawn between these Cubans and the country of Zimbabwe, previously Rhodesia, where for 15 years Prime Minister Ian Smith fought to prevent his country from electing someone like Robert Mugabe. Smith, too, had to explain to suspicious Africans why they were not prepared for something they believed to be no more than their due. But to make the analogy truly apt, the stakes in Cuba would need to have been higher. Never mind certifying their medical credentials. The question for the Cubans would need to have been: Would you let this Congolese doctor perform your appendectomy? Advertisement
N ow that Mugabe has lost power, there is a temptation to make the celebration a big-tent affair. As with Stalin, disillusionment with Mugabe set in piecemeal over several decades. Some turned against him with the genocide of the Matabele in the early 1980s, others not until the land invasions at the turn of the century. No doubt for some his homophobia was the deal-breaker. On this occasion, though, there is an understandable urge to set aside these differences, these expectations dashed or all too terribly fulfilled, and raise our glasses in a common toast: Thank God the bastard’s gone at last.
As appealing as such a moment would be, there is something dishonest about allowing mournful appraisals of Mugabe’s record to emit unchallenged from the very people, or types of people, who installed him in power in the first place. Partly it is the evasion of responsibility. Partly it is the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone, when anger would be so much more appropriate. But more than anything else, these obituaries are hard to stomach because the story of Rhodesia is full of so many turning points when the Mugabe disaster could have been averted that it seems deliberately evasive to moan about that disaster without nailing your colors to at least one of them. Advertisement Advertisement
Reflecting in the late 1970s on the prospect of a Mugabe election victory, the conservative historian Robert Blake commented placidly, “The right to misgovern oneself is as valid as any other political right, and it is exercised more often than most.” After 35 years of ethnic cleansing, political murder, intimidation by rape, economic suicide, and massive depopulation from famine, emigration, and AIDS, this fatalism has not worn well. Those who would join in moral condemnation of Mugabe now that he is gone should have to come up with a better answer to how things could have gone so wrong than to shrug with Lord Blake that democracy wants what it wants, tant pis . Even divine-right monarchies had their tactful regencies and pragmatic sanctions. Modern democrats should be able to display at least as much imaginative flexibility as people who believed their rulers were ordained by God — if not in time to do any good, then at least in retrospect.
The most inviting answer to the question of what should have been done differently, which beckons like an oasis in the desert, is to blame the colonial regime. If only Rhodesia had been governed better, its oppressed native population would not have presented such an easy foothold to Marxist guerrillas. Alas, this particular oasis is a mirage — not because conditions for Africans were so splendid under Ian Smith and his predecessors, but because no amount of peace, prosperity, and good government has ever been a prophylactic against violent nationalism when other factors have made it an advantageous ideology to embrace. If nationalism were a function of oppression, there would have been a Mau Mau revolt in Hungary under the Soviets and rather less of one there under the Hapsburgs. Nationalism, like a contagious disease, does not discriminate. Advertisement Advertisement
It was, for precisely this reason, a waste of breath for Rhodesians to defend their regime on the facts — and, to be fair to them, they had no shortage of facts on their side. Secondary-school attendance among black Africans was higher in Rhodesia than anywhere else on the continent in 1960. Spending on African education tripled in the seven years before Rhodesia’s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. A quarter of the students at the integrated national university were black. Apart from its anomalous neighbor to the south, Rhodesia was the only sub-Saharan country where manufacturing accounted for more than 10 percent of GDP — one reason that, in the 1950s, real wages for black Rhodesians rose 40 percent in just five years. A booming economy meant that fewer blacks were willing to resort to the poorly paid domestic work that had long been a social flashpoint (and, it must be said, a magnet for politically reactionary white immigrants eager to live the grand colonial lifestyle on the cheap). Prosperity also produced such fashionable black suburbs as Marimba Park and Pelandaba, which observers admitted “compar[ed] very favorably with the best that can be found in England anywhere.” Advertisement
Those who set material prosperity at naught compared with dignity and justice found Rhodesia equally ready with answers. The franchise was, and had always been, colorblind: Fifty Africans qualified for Rhodesia’s first election in 1923; 500 in 1953; and 65,000 under the two-tiered system in 1962, including 5,500 on the “A” roll (the more exclusive in Rhodesia’s two-tiered voting system based on property, income, and education). Racial discrimination in wage negotiations was abolished in 1959. Post offices and public swimming pools were integrated around the same time, and by the early 1960s white liberals in Salisbury were privately complaining that movie theaters and restaurants were abandoning the color bar faster than they could plan their sit-ins.

When Englishmen first arrived in Mashonaland in the 1880s, the civilization they encountered there had not developed currency, written language, irrigation, beasts of burden, the plough, or the wheel. Comparing that condition with what had been achieved by the time of independence, one is impressed not so much by how many modern improvements the Rhodesians had brought — anyone could have done that just by showing up — but by how successfully they had navigated some fairly momentous transitions. They had turned a subsistence economy into a market economy, where Africans were willing to work for wages, without passing through an intermediate stage of forced labor as most other civilizations had, Europe included. They had staged an industrial revolution without creating the overcrowded slums and Gin Lanes that had attended urbanization in their own country. They had replaced the caprice of a cruel Matabele despot, for whom the murder of entire families was a tool of policy, with the rule of law. All of this in 80 years — within the lifetime of one man.
Could it have been done better? Undoubtedly, but Western liberals always overestimate how easy it would have been to improve on the colonial standard of governance. The United Nations discovered this when it high-handedly expelled the Belgian teachers who had stayed on in the Congo after independence, for the teachers it found to replace them were both too few and far less adequate to the task than they expected — as in the case of the poor Haitian teacher who proudly told his hosts in Kasai that he was a full-blooded Luba by descent, at which point they, being Lulua, chased their hereditary enemy all the way back to the U.N. mission. The Africans of Rhodesia had shunned white doctors for years and then, almost overnight, began to swamp them. Obviously, more hospitals should have been built, but when? When they would have stood empty for God knows how many years at God knows what cost? Philip Mason, an old colonial hand, noted the same irony in the interwar years when demand was heard for more schools to be built in West Africa. It was odd, he wrote, to see “Nigerians from the North reproach the British with withholding the schools which their grandfathers had stipulated should not be introduced.”
W hen Terence Ranger, later the dean of southern-African historians, first arrived in Rhodesia to take up a position at the university in Salisbury, one of the first things he did was try to join up with the local African nationalists. “The problem was to find an African organization preparing to fight,” he wrote in his memoir. “In mid-1957, there was no militant or radical African organization.” There was a group in Harare calling itself the City Youth League, which in August 1956 staged a bus boycott to protest an increase in fares, and they were militant enough to punish a group of women who refused to participate, by assaulting and raping them. Less violently but not always less radically, the African press had undertaken various political and moral crusades since the founding of the Native Mirror in 1931, beginning with a campaign against Bulawayo merchants who marketed luxury goods to blacks. “How much did you spend last year on rubbish?” the editors scolded in 1934. “On things that were of no use? On concertinas? Gramophones? Cheap boots that were too small? Hats that didn’t fit?” This too-many-gramophones line was not pursued by later nationalists. Advertisement
But certainly no one was thinking in terms of violent revolution. A few years earlier, Thompson Samkange had assured the annual convention of the Bantu National Congress that “no sensible African would wish that the Africans take over the Government of this Colony from Europeans, even after a hundred years or even a thousand.” (Not in a thousand years — fateful choice of words. Ian Smith would later use the same phrase, and be tagged with it forever after as proof of his intransigence.) Yet within a decade of Ranger’s arrival, the bush war had begun, and a decade after that, white rule was practically at an end. What had made the difference?
Several factors, not least of which were Ranger and his friends. It is fashionable now to say that the nationalists were radicalized by the prolongation of white resistance, that if the minority regime had only surrendered earlier, power would have gone to the moderate instead of the violent. Peter Godwin said exactly this in his otherwise sympathetic Guardian obituary for Ian Smith. When we examine the words and deeds of white liberals at the time, however, it becomes clear that they were slavering to hoist barricades from the word “go.”
“All hope of a constitutionalist, gradualist career for [the Southern Rhodesia African National] Congress is over. It might be worth Congress’s while to start formulating policy on long-term and revolutionary lines” — so wrote John Reed, a university colleague of Ranger’s, in January 1958 . He had been in the country for less than a year. He later fled the country after authorities discovered he had been smuggling grenades in from Lusaka “so that effective protest against the declaration of UDI could be made,” as Ranger delicately puts it. The liberals of the Capricorn Africa Society were likewise hasty in declaring constitutional options exhausted in 1960 and — no doubt with the greatest personal reluctance — throwing their support behind glamorous violent radicals. When revolutionaries such as Joshua Nkomo flew to London, they were received by statesmen; when tribal chiefs of far greater local standing did the same, the British government barely acknowledged them. Events did not choose the terrorists; powerful white people did.
Among the external factors contributing to the rise of violent nationalism, there was first of all the death of Stalin, a boon in most respects but not to the Third World. It had been Stalin’s policy not to give money, arms, or training to anti-colonial rebellions, but Khrushchev shrewdly reversed this policy, with the Czech arms sale to Egypt in 1955 sounding the starting bell. Throughout the Sixties, AK-47s, RPG-2s, and East German uniforms found their way to revolutionaries all over Africa. This may be what made the difference between the interwar period, when Wilsonian talk of self-determination raised anti-colonial hopes in Asia and Africa, and the post-war period, when those hopes were finally satisfied: The earlier generation had fewer guns.
Second, there was the wave of African countries that gained their independence after 1957. However, one should not exaggerate the importance of the so-called Winds of Change. True, the new African states provided money for the guerrilla campaign. It was by threatening to cut off his funds that Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah forced Nkomo to boycott the pivotal 1962 elections, even after Nkomo had publicly endorsed the new constitution as a fair concession to African political aspirations. But it would be highly anachronistic to credit the flurry of new nations with creating a momentum behind decolonization that could not have been resisted. It is too easy to imagine a counterfactual where the dismal record of the newly independent nations sets the cause of anti-imperialism back a generation. The total implosion of the Ghanaian economy, Nkrumah’s cult of personality, villagization in Tanzania, the Biafra war, Idi Amin, not to mention Algeria and the Congo — we could not possibly grant independence to any similarly situated colony after such lessons as these, the British could have said, if they had wanted to.
The history books might well have taken just this line, had it not been for a third development: America’s endorsement of the anti-imperial crusade. Suez sent a strong enough signal, but in 1957 a certain Massachusetts senator gave a speech in favor of the Algerian rebels that had even Adlai Stevenson begging for a little less idealism. From the moment JFK was sworn in, every guerrilla group south of the Sahara figured it was in with a chance, as indeed they all were. Soviet arms may have helped prolong the bush war until the diplomats could finish the job, and government sinecures from the frontline states — e.g., Herbert Chitepo, Tanzanian director of public prosecutions — may have helped the nationalist leaders keep body and soul together, but in the post-Suez world, the decisions that ultimately determined Rhodesia’s fate were made in Washington, D.C. Advertisement
W hat should have been done differently, then? Many have fixated on Reverend Abel Muzorewa, the moderate nationalist who served as prime minister of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia in 1979 and who, it is generally agreed, was egregiously betrayed when Jimmy Carter refused to recognize his government or lift sanctions even though his election was entirely democratic. But the Muzorewa government was weak, and a weak government would have ended up falling to Mugabe, or a Mugabe equivalent, sooner or later. Lord Carrington, the British foreign secretary, believed that handing power to Mugabe was the only way to stop the fighting — strangely, he considered this a reason Mugabe should be elected — and the fact that he was probably right under the circumstances is the last word on the Muzorewa option.
Any moderate solution, to have worked, would have required an America not wedded to the claim that one-man-one-vote, instituted immediately, is the only legitimate form of democracy. To posit such an America is not quite as absurd as simply to posit a Mugabe who doesn’t deploy North Korean–trained death squads. In 1956, when the career diplomat George Allen was asked by a French counterpart about the likely American attitude toward the Algerian pieds-noirs , he speculated that his country’s frontier history “would evoke sympathy for a white community settled for many generations in a non-European country, exposed to the attacks of the natives, who organize themselves for the defense of their hearths and homes.” The frontier comparison certainly made more sense than fitting ZANU and ZAPU for powdered wigs.
Any idea that liberal reform on the part of the Rhodesian state could have saved it is a non-starter, because the anti-imperialists were implacable and — I do not know a gentle way to put this — they were quite happy to lie. I do not mean just the professional liars of the Soviet propaganda shop, or the pundits who lazily referred to the Rhodesian system as “apartheid,” or the guerrillas who told Shona villagers that ZANU had successfully dynamited the Kariba Dam, or the foreign journalist who scattered candy around a garbage bin and captioned the resulting photo “Starving children searching for food in Salisbury.” Ralph Bunche had a doctorate from Harvard, a Nobel Peace Prize, and a co-author credit on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and when it came to imperialism, he lied.
“Colonial authorities like the noted Englishman, Lord Lugard, doubt that the African race, whether in Africa or America, can develop capability for self-government.” When I first read that in Bunche’s 1936 pamphlet “A World View of Race,” I felt a lurking suspicion that I had read a sentence of Lord Lugard’s beginning with the very words “The method of their progress toward self-government lies . . .” I had. His next words are “along the same path as that of Europeans.” Even making allowances for CTRL-F’s not having been invented yet, Bunche’s remark is plain slander. With Harvard Ph.D.s pulling stunts like this, it is hard to summon much indignation at a garden-variety diplomatic lie like the U.N. claim, by which sanctions were justified, that Rhodesia had committed an act of aggression by maintaining its status quo.
I tis therefore difficult to say what steps might have prevented Mugabe from coming to power. The most promising juncture was probably Britain’s Pearce Commission inquiry of 1972, which might have asked the democratic equivalents of the basic medical questions that should have been directed to the Congolese students with whom we began. Americans assume that the answers to questions such as “May I sell my vote for cash?” are self-evident, but the colonizing powers never did succeed in convincing ordinary Africans that obtaining a bureaucrat’s services through gifts is a form of corruption. Is the case against vote-buying more obvious? Why is voter intimidation enough to invalidate an election and not just the continuation of democracy by other means? Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda used to run around claiming that Arthur Creech-Jones, the Labour colonial secretary, wanted to give Africans their freedom, but Churchill had locked Creech-Jones in prison. A country with an overwhelming electoral majority willing to believe such things about the way democratic leaders treat the opposition is a country that is not ready for democracy.
Next, they might have taken a page from U.S. Border Control’s refugee protocol and given Ian Smith a “credible-fear interview” — i.e., what exactly are you worried will happen to you, and on what grounds? Here we have a test that the Rhodesian leaders could have passed where George Wallace, say, could not. Smith’s fears were not based on century-old horror stories about Reconstruction. If he believed that white minorities would be run out by the new regime in spite of all prior reassurances to the contrary, it was because that’s exactly what had happened in Algeria. If he worried that the country’s economy would be knocked back to subsistence, with famine following, it was because post-colonial Africa (with the exception of oil-boom Nigeria) had seen negative per capita economic growth in the 1970s. By the time of UDI, the world already had before it the examples of Ghana (Afro-fascism), Tanzania (police state), and the Congo (civil war). Instead of asking why Smith thought Zimbabwe would go the same way, we should ask why anyone thought it would be the exception. Advertisement
Smith’s preferred course would have been for the country to continue along evolutionary lines. The Rhodesian constitution was designed so that black and white political power would converge as more and more Africans met the income and education qualifications, and eventually the desideratum of one-man-one-vote would be achieved. Britain itself had taken centuries to arrive at a universal franchise. The last property qualifications were abolished only in the 1920s. If the evolution had not been so gradual, Britain might well have had to endure dictatorship and revolution as the French did, and they might now be on constitution number 17 instead of the same one they’ve had since 1688.
Gradual evolution toward full democracy was the best that could have been hoped for under such difficult circumstances, and maybe the best that could have been hoped for, period. To find an alternative, one would have to follow the timeline all the way back to the beginning and imagine a world where the British never came to southern Africa at all — which is no alternative, really, since if the British had not ventured there another European power would have. From the moment the British and King Lobengula met, a colonial relationship was inevitable. Any relationship between two civilizations of such disparate attainments will be colonial, almost by definition. The best option, from that point, is for the relationship to be made as benign as possible, which is what Smith was asking permission to try to do.
Alas, none of his gambits could possibly have made the slightest difference, because the only players with any power in the crisis did not give a fig about Rhodesia, at least not compared with their own interests. The metropole will always sell out the colonies. This has been the rule since Rome. In the fifth century, the citizens of Clermont begged Rome to protect them from the barbarians or at least permit them to mount their own last-ditch defense, but the capital ordered them to surrender as part of a bargain with the Visigoths to protect the more important cities of Arles and Marseilles.
For Edward Heath, the more important city was Brussels. A strong line on Rhodesia was the price of Liberal support for his Common Market push in 1973; thus was the outcome of the Pearce Commission determined. Later PMs were driven by a need to make the UDI experiment fail in order to keep Belfast from getting any bright ideas. American politicians from LBJ onward used Rhodesia-bashing as an inexpensive way to win black votes. South Africa’s policy was decided according to whether Prime Minister John Vorster’s priority that month was wooing Henry Kissinger or fending off a third-party challenge from the right. There are two things no politician will give up before he has to: an issue and a bargaining chip. Rhodesia was both.
As for Arles and Marseilles: When the Visigoths got around to them, they were not saved.
I an Smith was only “a farm boy from Selukwe” (in the contemptuous phrase of his predecessor Garfield Todd) and thus not quite as saturated in Roman history as the Englishmen across the negotiating table. But he could hardly have been ignorant of the basic outline of the parallel, staple that it was of English and French imperial rhetoric. “Like you, our ancestors resisted courageously a foreign invasion,” Napoleon III told a crowd of Arabs in Algiers in 1865, “and yet the vanquished Gauls assimilated with the Roman victors and from this was born, in time, the French nationality.” Lord Lugard, the man who apparently did not believe in African progress toward self-government, wrote that “as Roman imperialism laid the foundations of modern civilization and led the wild barbarians of these islands along the path of progress, so in Africa today we are repaying the debt.” The mission civilisatrice was not a doctrine; it was a precedent. (And one that Africans grasped perfectly: “When the English were subject to the Romans, if the Romans had segregated them, they would not be what they are today” was the argument of one Joseph Hlubi at a hearing on Transvaal land policy in 1918.)"
Pope Francis & Eucharist: Pope's Phrasing Is Vague | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Hirschauer,06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/a-bit-of-fire-insurance-on-papal-remarks/,"Follow John Hirschauer on Twitter June 16, 2019 9:27 PM
If only for the protection of my eternal soul — God, will a Corner post suffice? — I wanted to highlight two alternative translations of the pope’s remarks on his flight back from Romania that have been brought to my attention. R ecently, I wrote a fairly long post on the pope’s comments, speculating about their potential ramifications for the Church. Advertisement Advertisement
The science-fiction writer Michael Crichton said . . . a lot of things , among them his observation that manifold “areas of intellectual life have discovered the virtues of speculation, and have embraced them wildly.” Embrace them I did.
The National Catholic Register released a translation of Francis’s remarks, which had formed the basis of my piece. It read: “There is already Christian unity. . . . Let’s not wait for the theologians to come to agreement on the Eucharist.”
Hence my assessment that if the pope is suggesting, as he clearly seemed to be, that the Eucharist ought to be open to non-Catholics, he is necessarily “forcing the Church to address a series of rather difficult and uncomfortable questions.” If this was the actual content of the pope’s remarks, I stand by my writing as a (rather understated!) critique of Francis’s flirtation with heresy.
Two alternative translations brought to my attention after the piece’s publication came from Crux and the Catholic News Agency : Advertisement Advertisement
Crux : “Walking together is already Christian unity, . . . but don’t think now that theologians are going to get together to work on the Eucharist!” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Catholic News Agency : “To walk together: this is already Christian unity, but do not wait for theologians to agree to arrive at communion. Communion happens every day with prayer, with the memory of our martyrs, with works of charity and even of loving one another.”
Crux ‘s rendition of Francis’s comments is far less egregious than NCR’ s, at least with respect to intercommunion (though it is typical of the de rigueur imprecision of the modern clergy — what exactly does it mean to “walk together,” and what does that have to do with the reunification of dissident Christians with the Church?)
CNA’s version seems to be much more literally translated, and is similarly vague — is the lowercase-c “communion” Francis refers to indicative of the Eucharist, or is it the perpetually ill-defined sense of “communion” among various Christian denominations to which he often refers?
The Vatican has the original Italian on its website , for those so inclined. Advertisement"
Britain & Abortion Funding Overseas: It Needs Its Own Mexico City Policy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Grazie Pozo Christie,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/britain-needs-its-own-mexico-city-policy-to-stop-funding-abortion-overseas/,"About Grazie Pozo Christie June 17, 2019 6:30 AM An anti-abortion demonstrator holds a placard during the March For Life, an anti-abortion protest in London, Britain, May 11, 2019. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls – RC14F771B3D0 Most Brits oppose the practice. They want to see women and children thrive, especially in places where poverty and unrest are rampant.
O ne of the first of the Trump administration’s many pro-life moves was to stop funding abortion overseas. Trump reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy that President Obama did away with in 2009. If President Trump has had any doubts about the fitness of his decision over the last two years, he has only to look to the United Kingdom, where the government is busy trying to explain to the public why it saw fit to give the scandal-plagued International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) over 130 million pounds in January. Along with Marie Stopes International, the IPPF was one of only four non-governmental organizations that refused to cease performing abortions as a condition for receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American foreign-aid money in 2017. Advertisement Advertisement
British taxpayers have a lot to be angry about. The polling firm ComRes found in 2017 that 65 percent of them would like to stop funding abortion overseas. There is, of course, the fact that, according to the IPPF’s own 2017 annual report, they funded the abortions of more than 1 million unborn babies that year — and that these were mainly babies in developing countries. Brits also ought to be furious about the huge salaries paid to the charity’s officials, even in the face of an ongoing investigation into allegations of corruption and intimidation by high-level employees. But all this pales in comparison with the latest revelation: According to Kenyan court documents, the IPPF “solicited the services of prostitutes for guests during official functions of the organization.”
Yes. Pimping. Advertisement
Americans, even pro-choice Americans, may want to stop reading now and write President Trump a thank-you note for reinstating and expanding the Mexico City policy. He has saved us from funding, with our hard-earned tax dollars, an organization that is accused of offering young volunteers as unpaid prostitutes to guests at African functions. The sheer hypocrisy of this is astonishing, from a charity that on its website proclaims : “Without access to basic human rights, . . . women lack the ability to have control over their own bodies” and “aren’t able to protect themselves from STI’s, unplanned pregnancies, or gender-based violence.” What control over her body could an impressionable young girl have when she is offered as a sexual favor by IPPF? How can she protect herself from a venereal disease, or from physical abuse in the process? The unplanned-pregnancy part is easy, I suppose, when you work at IPPF.
The question U.K. tax payers are asking their government is why the IPPF, an abortion NGO, is held to much lower standards than other charities are, such as Oxfam, which was cut off from aid after revelations of some of its own sordid practices. It may be that pro-abortion-rights lobbyists in their country have the same kind of hold on a segment of their politicians that U.S. lobbyists have on some of ours. Perhaps in the U.K., as in the U.S., left-leaning lawmakers are hopelessly in the thrall of richly funded organizations such as Planned Parenthood that have the money and organization to put a mortal dent in the career of any politician who doesn’t support them unconditionally. Advertisement
For the U.K., in response to the current scandal, to cut off the heads of the hydra that is the international abortion industry may require the national to have a transformational leader like our own President Reagan. It was he who instituted the Mexico City policy in 1984. Some say it resulted in a loss of more than 20 percent of IPPF’s budget. Or, someone like President Trump, who has come under severe fire for expanding the policy. Advertisement"
"Mississippi’s Mental-Illness Policies Are Working, DOJ Is Challenging Them | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,John Hirschauer,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/mississippi-mental-illness-policies-working-doj-challenging-them/,"June 17, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) The state is leading a quiet revolt.
D espite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services. Advertisement Advertisement
Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.
Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens. Advertisement
DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C. , which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.
The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.
First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:
“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”
Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”
This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that. Advertisement
Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead -based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis , 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead ’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services. Advertisement
The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):
A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity .
Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides? Advertisement
Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for."
Investigating the CIA & FBI: Democrats & Republicans Have Switched Places | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/liberals-against-investigating-cia-fbi/,"June 17, 2019 6:30 AM CIA Headquarters Building in McLean, Va. (Larry Downing/Reuters) Since Trump took office, of course.
W as there ever a time when Americans had unquestioning faith in federal law-enforcement agencies? Maybe in the days before Vietnam and Watergate, most citizens did believe that those in charge of the nation’s fate could be trusted. Before World War II, the FBI’s formidable public-relations machine actually produced a popular radio and television program lauding its efforts “in peace and war.” After the war, when the CIA became the country’s first full-time foreign-intelligence agency, few Americans understood much about what it was doing, and what little they did know was colored by the government’s propaganda efforts. Advertisement Advertisement
But ever since the upheaval of the late 1960s and early 1970s seemed to make cynicism about government our new national pastime, the notion that the intelligence community is above politics has been as outdated as the adulation once accorded to J. Edgar Hoover. It’s in that context that we should understand the recent debate about whether it’s appropriate to scrutinize the CIA and FBI’s role in the origins of the Russia probe. Though Democrats are now treating criticism of federal law enforcement as beyond the pale, their newfound faith is every bit as partisan as Republicans’ newfound skepticism. A sober look at the history of the past few decades reveals that, to paraphrase Clausewitz, in Washington, intelligence has always been a matter of politics by other means.
Attorney General William Barr’s decision to launch an investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation has caused some predicable anger among Democrats and other Trump-administration critics. This discomfort stems from what they regard as an attempt to flip the narrative from Trump’s alleged collusion with Russia to a dubious decision by the FBI to begin spying on the political opponents of Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. Advertisement
Given the failure of the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller to prove the collusion allegations, Barr’s attempt to determine whether the unprecedented probe of a presidential campaign was an abuse of power seems reasonable. But Barr’s decision is a huge problem for Democrats who are hoping to pursue the impeachment of Trump by picking up the case that Mueller failed to make after two years of effort.
So we saw CNN crime-and-justice reporter Shimon Prokupecz this week telling host Don Lemon that it is “troubling” that the Department of Justice is questioning the work of CIA agents. “You don’t do this,” Prokupecz said. “The CIA kind of operates in their own world.” Indeed the CIA does, but that never stopped Democrats or the press from going all out to probe its activities as long as said activities were perceived to further their opponents’ political agenda. Advertisement
Prokupecz and the House Democrats who are rushing to the barricades to defend the actions of former CIA director John Brennan at the beginning of the Mueller probe are acting as if the agency’s reputation has never before been called into question. Some of them may be too young to have experienced the political ferment of the 1970s and’80s, in which congressional committees led by Democrats such as Frank Church and Otis Pike conducted far-reaching investigations that embarrassed the intelligence establishment. But surely they have some memory of the debates about intelligence after the 9/11 attacks and the heated run-up to George W. Bush’s Iraq War. The only difference between those episodes and this one is that the political parties have switched sides. Advertisement
In the past, it was Republicans defending the FBI and the CIA against Democrats’ charges that these agencies were out of control. But since the summer of 2016, when the intelligence establishment seemed to join forces to raise alarms about Russian meddling in the presidential election and, more important, to raise concerns about untrue allegations of Trump-campaign collusion in that meddling, Democrats have acted as if Langley and Quantico are beyond reproach.
Once Trump started criticizing the intelligence agencies’ consensus about Russians’ election interference, and then after it became known that the FBI and CIA had begun probing his campaign in the summer of 2016, Democrats became unstinting in their defense of the agencies. By contrast, Republicans who had been stalwart CIA and FBI defenders suddenly became bitter critics, demanding transparency and sometimes floating the same sort of conspiracy theories about the intelligence community’s activities that used to be the province of the Left.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 'Hyde Amendment Is About Income Inequality' Not Abortion | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/aoc-hyde-amendment-is-about-income-inequality-not-abortion/,"June 17, 2019 8:43 AM Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill, February 27, 2019 (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on Sunday praised former vice president Joe Biden for his recently announced opposition to the Hyde amendment and said that her own opposition to the prohibition on the direct federal funding of abortion is rooted in her concern about income inequality.
“I’m encourage by the fact that he is now against the Hyde Amendment,” Ocasio-Cortez told ABC’s Jonathan Karl when asked about Biden’s recent reversal on the issue.
Ocasio-Cortez, who launched a petition over the weekend to build public support for the amendment’s repeal, went on to explain that the direct federal funding of abortion is necessary to protect the abortion rights of incarcerated pregnant women. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“Reproductive health care for incarcerated women should be guaranteed as it is with all women in the United States, so I think it really depends,” said the freshman New York lawmaker. More from her remarks:
And that’s really what the Hyde amendment is really about. The Hyde amendment isn’t about abortion per se. The Hyde amendment is truly about equality of healthcare and healthcare access for low income women and women of color and women that get caught in our mass incarceration system. And so the Hyde amendment is about income inequality and it’s about women’s healthcare in a system of income inequality. So I think that we need to repeal it.
After maintaining support for the Hyde amendment throughout his decades-long career in politics, Biden reversed himself last month in response to pressure from abortion-advocacy groups."

1974 —Jacob John Dougan and four other members of his Black Liberation Army begin implementing their plan “to indiscriminately kill white people and thus start a revolution and a race war.” Armed with a pistol and a knife, they pick up an 18-year-old white hitchhiker, Stephen Anthony Orlando, drive him to a trash dump, stab him repeatedly, and throw him to the ground. As Orlando writhes in pain and begs for his life, Dougan puts his foot on Orlando’s head and shoots him twice—once in the chest and once in the ear. Later, Dougan makes tape recordings bragging about the murder and mails them to Orlando’s mother and to the media. Sample content: “He [Orlando] was stabbed in the back, in the chest and the stomach, ah, it was beautiful. You should have seen it. Ah, I enjoyed every minute of it. I loved watching the blood gush from his eyes.” Advertisement Advertisement
In 1992, on Dougan’s sixth appeal to the Florida supreme court, three dissenting Florida justices opine that the death penalty was a disproportionate sentence under the circumstances. Justice Parker McDonald’s dissent, joined by chief justice Leander Shaw and This Day Hall of Infamy inductee Rosemary Barkett, includes these remarkable observations (emphasis added): Advertisement
“This case is not simply a homicide case, it is also a social awareness case . Wrongly, but rightly in the eyes of Dougan, this killing was effectuated to focus attention on a chronic and pervasive illness of racial discrimination and of hurt, sorrow, and rejection . Throughout Dougan’s life his resentment to bias and prejudice festered. His impatience for change, for understanding, for reconciliation matured to taking the illogical and drastic action of murder. His frustrations, his anger, and his obsession of injustice overcame reason. The victim was a symbolic representation of the class causing the perceived injustices .” Stay Updated with NR Daily

“ The events of this difficult case occurred in tumultuous times . During the time of the late sixties and early seventies, there was great unrest throughout this country in race relations.… I mention these facts not to minimize what transpired, but, rather, to explain the environment in which the events took place and to evaluate Dougan’s mind-set .”
“Understandably, in the eyes of the victim, or potential victims, the aggravating factors clearly outweigh the mitigating; in the eyes of the defendant, his friends, and most of those situated in the circumstances of Dougan, the death penalty is not warranted and is disproportionate to the majority of hate slayings, at least where the victim is black and the perpetrator is white.” Advertisement
“In comparing what kind of person Dougan is with other murderers in the scores of death cases that we have reviewed, I note that few of the killers approach having the socially redeeming values of Dougan .” (This apparently refers to the dissent’s earlier observations that Dougan was “intelligent,” “well educated,” “a leader in the black community,” “taught karate and counseled black youths,” and once “participated in a sit-down strike in defiance of a court order” at a lunch counter that refused service to blacks.)
