The story of the woman caught in adultery is exemplary of the way the scribes and the Pharisees attempted to try to catch Jesus out with regard to his relationship with the Law of Moses.
Either he respects it, and renounces his merciful approach towards sinners, or he remains loyal to his principle of mercy, in which case he refutes the Law of Moses on adultery.
Jesus' response is twofold. He begins by writing on the ground, perhaps in reference to Jeremiah 17:13: ""O Lord, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from you shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters.""
Then, he catches the Pharisees out by raising another precept of the law: in cases of stoning, it is the witness of a crime against the Torah who has the right to cast the first stone (Deuteronomy 13: 10-11).
Whatever Jesus wrote on the ground, the passage from Jeremiah demonstrates the nuances of different relationships with Scripture, including its legal dimension. Where the Scribes and the Pharisees use Scripture to try to snare Jesus and condemn the woman, Jesus refers to the Scripture as a source of living water, as a pathway to freedom.
The Pharisees relate to Scripture in ways that condemns humans, the woman and Jesus in this example, rather than in a way that serves their relationship with God. Jesus is indicted for his attitude of mercy and the woman is brought to face violent, mortal punishment based on the Law of Moses.
Confronted with the perversity of such an enslaving relationship with Scripture and the Law of Moses being used to manipulate and control, Jesus deftly avoids the trap set for him.
By rethinking the prescription from Chapter 13 of Deuteronomy, he obliges the Scribes and the Pharisees to reflect on their own sins: only those who are free from sin may cast a stone. In this way, Jesus liberates the woman. No one is in the position to judge another
Jesus rethinks the meaning of the Law, as it is indicated in Exodus 20: 2-4, in the way that the Scripture can act as legislator: ""I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.""
How could a liberator tolerate a use of the Law that subjugates people? Jesus is compelled to expose this warped usage of the Scripture. May those who demand a strict application of the Law first apply it to themselves!
The scene that follows shows the fairness of his logic.
That all of the accusers leave demonstrates their defeat. Each of them is obliged to admit the fact they are all, like the woman, sinners themselves. They have each transgressed the Law in the eyes of God and are therefore in no position to exact his Law as they see fit.
No one is in the position to judge another. The accusers join the accused and therefore can no longer manipulate God's will to subjugate and control.
Conversely, through the mercy of his words and deeds, Jesus reveals the mystery of Divine mercy that he performs and which lives through him. His actions restore to dignity those who have been victims of manipulations of the Law. He opens for them a pathway to liberty and towards peace.
By embodying a practice of mercy that returns people to their rightful place, he shows his deep understanding of Divine mercy that does not stand in conflict with justice. He shows that there can be ""no peace without justice and no justice without forgiveness."" "
The abuse crisis as prophecy and pascha,international.la-croix.com,Rita Ferrone,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/the-abuse-crisis-as-prophecy-and-pascha/9834,"The abuse crisis as prophecy and pascha Flavor of the Gospel Mail This Article
When Pope Francis wrote to the American bishops concerning the abuse crisis, he observed that ""many actions can be helpful, good and necessary, and may even seem correct, but not all of them have the 'flavor' of the Gospel.""
By recommending a return to the Gospel as an essential reference point, Francis is on to something.
The horror of the abuse cases, the sheer numbers of victims, the longevity of the crisis, its scope, and the fact that it has proved so hard to change the institutional patterns and habits that abet it—all this has been, for many of the faithful, a profoundly shocking and disorienting experience.
It has eroded the trust we used to give to our church leaders and structures. It has shamed us in the eyes of the world. We do not taste the Gospel here. Yet we long for it, even when that longing goes unnamed.
Metaphors of taste and smell have a long history in Christian discourse.
The psalmist enjoins the faithful to ""taste and see the goodness of the Lord."" The gift of God's law is perfect and refreshing, ""sweeter than syrup, or honey from the comb."" Evil, in contrast, is something that sets one's teeth on edge. Sour and bitter fruit come forth from wickedness.
In the New Testament, followers of Jesus are urged to be ""salt for the earth"" and not to lose their savor. Because the sense of taste is allied with smell, we also find olfactory images in the Scripture.
Paul refers to Christians as those who bear ""the aroma of Christ.""
In the ancient church, catechumens were given salt on the tongue as part of their admission to the catechumenate. Ritual expresses in the body what is believed in faith: Christian life is not bland or flavorless. It tastes like something.
What does the Gospel taste like? Francis doesn't say.
Perhaps this is because he thinks the bishops already know. Maybe, as in an old television commercial for a certain pasta sauce (""Now, that's Italian!""), the assumption is that anybody who has tasted the Gospel will be able to recognize it when they encounter it again.
Yet I wonder.
For all the emphasis that has been placed on Scripture in the postconciliar church, for all the readings we have access to in our lectionaries, for all the renewal in biblical studies that has taken place in the church during our lifetime, it nevertheless seems that the categories our church leaders are most sensitive to are legal and doctrinal, rather than scriptural.
The Second Vatican Council wanted the sacred page to be the very soul of theology, yet there is still a certain suspicion that if we rely too much on Scripture we'll neglect the precise formulations of doctrine, and forget the accumulated tradition of church teaching.
If Francis had recommended ""the taste of the catechism"" our bishops would be right there. The ""taste of the Gospel"" is more elusive.
Yet this Gospel flavor is actually quite a powerful thing. The Scriptures may not always be as precise as one might like (there are multiple sources, they don't always agree, and so on), but no one can deny that they are packed with flavor.
The narratives and imagery they contain, as well as their poetry and wisdom, have sustained the life of the church through hardship, trial, and crises throughout the centuries.
Their flavor can remind us of who we are, and help the church emerge from the present crisis both more deeply chastened and stronger.
The chastening is an important feature. Consider a New Testament example. Anyone in our society can say that the sexual abuse of minors is a crime. It is. But how much time have we spent reflecting on Jesus' words in Luke 17:1–2:
Occasions of stumbling are bound to come, but woe to anyone by whom they come! It would be better for you if a millstone were hung around your neck and you were thrown into the sea than for you to cause one of these little ones to stumble.
This saying appears in all three synoptic gospels. Matthew and Mark don't say just a millstone, but ""a great millstone."" It's astonishing that so many of our shepherds (those who treated accusations of child abuse lightly) seem to have failed to take this word in.
How can anyone who enabled abusers not tremble when they read this? If we take this seriously, the prospect of laicization or tangles with law enforcement seem mild penalties compared with the future that awaits those who destroyed someone's childhood and shattered her faith.
Frankly, it's a terrifying saying. Does the Gospel taste bitter, therefore? For malefactors, perhaps it does. Yet these words also testify to God's eternal justice and to his partiality to the poor and the vulnerable: the ""little ones.""
These are words that bear listening to. ""We know that, given the seriousness of the situation, no response or approach seems adequate,"" Francis wrote.
""Nonetheless, we as pastors must have the ability, and above all the wisdom, to speak a word born of heartfelt, prayerful and collective listening to the Word of God and to the pain of our people."" Amen to that.
What sort of actions might the bishops take that would convey the flavor of the Gospel?
Surely there must be actions of justice and compassion, and actions that breathe the humility of Christ. Yet above all there must be actions that kindle hope for the future to which the Holy Spirit is leading the church through this crisis. The Abuse Crisis as Prophecy
Jesus stands squarely in the tradition of the prophets of Israel; the people to whom he came received him as a prophet. He was not a member of the priestly class.
Jesus himself is the Word of God, but, lest we forget, he also spoke the Word of God—both in its comforting and liberating assurances to the poor and the simple and in its roaring condemnations of ""blind guides"" and those who prey upon the weak.
Perhaps we have forgotten this today, as so many of the implicit messages we receive about the church's ministry suggest that the voice of prophecy has been fully absorbed into our institutionalized charisms and offices.
But the prophetic edge of the Gospel remains a cutting edge—as any serious student of the New Testament can tell you. A ""flavor"" too irenic to admit to the sharp sword of the Gospel does not capture its character.
When we call something a crisis, we mean it causes a division in time. A crisis moment in interpersonal relationships occurs when a conflict no longer simmers in the background but has come to a head.
In an illness, a crisis is a moment of intensity after which the patient will either recover or go into decline. A political crisis occurs when a former way of governing does not work anymore and everyone knows that something new must take its place.
A social crisis arises when customary ways of being together in society are challenged by events or by changing conceptions of social roles and relationships. In a crisis, there is always a ""before"" and an ""after.""
We say that we are going through ""the abuse crisis."" But the interesting thing is that the crisis —the thing that causes the disjuncture between past and future—isn't the abuse.
It's the revelation of the abuse (and the revelation of the unjust and inadequate responses to such abuse by church authorities). The abuse itself was going on for decades, probably generations, yet was never called out for what it was.
It's the revelation of this heinous, global, hidden cancer that makes this a crisis, because it demands a response; it signals a moment of change.
A prophet is someone who speaks on behalf of God, and frequently in the Scriptures a prophetic oracle begins: ""Thus says the Lord."" Who is saying ""Thus says the Lord"" in the church today?
If we look at the witness of abuse survivors, we discover that in many instances they seek not only to come to terms with their wounds and painful history, nor simply to seek their own compensation.
They are working for justice to overcome corruption and they are longing for the return of hope for others who are hurting. Theirs is, at least implicitly, a prophetic mission.
The prophetic word condemns corruption and calls out sin, demanding change. Isn't this what is being asked of the church today?
When we are at our lowest ebb, the prophetic word also comes to offer comfort and consolation, as it did to Israel during the exile.
The prophetic word is heard not only in denunciations, but also in the promise of a return to the homeland that God alone can provide. We taste the Gospel in both the refusal to accept the situation as it is, and in demonstrations of genuine compassion and hope. The Abuse Crisis as Pascha
There is a fond imagining among some church people that once we ""get past"" the abuse crisis, things will go back to the way they were. The clerical system won't change.
The role of church authorities won't change. Our hearts won't change, either. Like an accident on the highway, the wreckage of the clergy sex-abuse crisis will someday be cleared away, the insurance companies will settle the debts, and we'll go on our way the same as before, as if nothing had ever happened.
Yes, there may be new guidelines to assure that such ""accidents"" don't happen with the frequency they once did: like putting up signs to better mark a dangerous section of road, or implementing seatbelt laws, we'll put safe environment regulations in place.
But roles and relationships within the church will not change, because what happened is seen as, essentially, an accident rather than the expression of a sickness in the body itself.
There is another way to look at this crisis, however, and some wise observers—Pope Francis among them—have realized that a deeper reckoning is required.
As Francis said to the bishops of Chile, ""It would be irresponsible on our part not to delve into a search for the roots and structures that allowed these concrete events to happen and to continue.""
By this he does not mean a search for scapegoats. Such an approach, which he calls ""the Jonah syndrome,"" seeks to blame the storm on one or another person and throw them out of the boat. This is a false solution and one that he condemns.
Instead, Francis' diagnosis cuts straight to the essential issue of whether the clergy are ""with,"" or removed from, their people. ""Messianism, elites, [and] clericalisms, are all synonymous with perversion in the ecclesial being,"" he says.
He describes the resulting malaise as ""the loss of a healthy consciousness [formed by] knowing we belong to the holy faithful people of God who precedes us and who—thanks be to God—will succeed us.""
He concludes this line of thought with a powerful statement: ""Do not let us ever lose the awareness of that exalted gift that is our baptism.""
A solid grasp of the dignity of the baptized is, in fact, essential to reform. It grounds both laity and clergy. But getting to the point where this is truly grasped involves more than a cosmetic change. It actually entails dying to one vision of church and rising to another.
We have heard many times in the press that Francis denounces clericalism. Fair enough. Yet this assertion is strangely incomplete without noting the corresponding and reciprocal attention he gives to the dignity of the baptized, their holiness and mission.
It is the sacred reality of the people of God that illuminates the real calling of pastors to adopt a model of humility and service so that the church as a whole may thrive.
The goal of meaningful reform is not merely to take the clergy down a peg. It's a call for a different model, leading to a new and more fruitful relationship.
The Pascha, or Passover, described in Exodus, is the passage of God's people from slavery to freedom. The Pascha in the New Testament is the passing over of Jesus from this life to the Father.
The paschal mystery for the church—death to sin and resurrection to new life in Christ—is the central mystery the liturgy celebrates. It is the preeminent taste of the Gospel.
What does this have to do with the abuse crisis?
I would go so far as to say that the only adequate response to the clergy sex-abuse crisis is a paschal response: death to one way of being and resurrection to a truly new way of life. The abuse crisis requires the death of an old model of insularity and arrogance in clerical culture.
It declares as a failure the model of accountability that defers only to one's hierarchical superiors while disregarding those below. It proposes instead an organic, sacramental relationship of sharing in the one mission of the church—for which we all must hold one another accountable.
You don't get to a state in the church where no one is exploited without a robust respect for the dignity of all. It takes a paschal journey to bring us to the new life and freedom the Gospel promises.
The good news is this: if the dignity of all the baptized is genuinely and deeply respected, this rules out every one of the predatory behaviors we have seen in the abuse crisis.
It calls forth transparency and accountability as the natural state of affairs in the church rather than as some holy grail that remains always just out of reach.
And, finally, true respect for baptism requires structures that support the mutual trust and respectful collaboration that ought always to exist between pastors and their people.
The Pascha has many flavors in the Scriptures.
It includes the unleavened bread of the journey, the bitter herbs of slavery, and the lamb—still eaten at the Passover Seder.
Yet the taste of the Pascha is also found in the milk and honey of the Promised Land. And in the Christian liturgy, the taste of the Pascha is ever present in the bread and wine of Eucharist.

I presented a five-minute video to a group of religious men and women during their Lenten recollection. The video showed the dilemma of a young girl facing the challenge of an enforced disappearance in a family.
The girl was only eight years old when the abduction happened. Now at 19, this girl recalls the day her uncle Jonas was abducted. Almost 12 years have passed but the impact has not diminished.
In fact today, this girl, a first year college student whose video is a school project, is confronted with a question. What will she do in the face of this continuing torture of enforced disappearance?
If you were this girl's mother, or grandmother, what advice would you give her? The dilemma is very real.
The video reveals truths in the heart of a young girl being called to be a prophet. Should she respond and be the voice of the voiceless and missing or should she succumb to fear and take refuge in false safety found in silence?
Should I be afraid? How can one ""not be afraid?"" The girl is my granddaughter. And the current situation in the Philippines is very dangerous, especially for critics of the government.
My son Jonas was abducted by the military more than 11 years ago. Even if we won our case in the courts, Jonas has not been returned and no one has been punished for not complying with the court's order. He has no voice. He is still missing.
The search presented conflicting situations filled with human rights violations committed in the guise of fighting insurgency, terrorism, drugs, corruption, plus the law enforcers and protectors are my suspects and respondents, while those who help me in the search and protect me are those labeled as leftists, activists and violators of the law.
It is like a cruel joke played on the families of victims of enforced disappearance.
This reality of contradictions is so present, and it heightens awareness of God's presence in my life today.
The single event of the abduction has catapulted me to a life I have never imagined. But more than the abduction, my response to it is the biggest miracle and blessing that has happened and is happening.
What is a prophet? I think in oversimplistic terms, you could say a prophet is a truth teller, one who responds to situations as this by proclaiming the truth.
My response is still evolving and is now in its 11th year. I was not aware that this was already a call to be a truth teller.
Reflecting on this piece, things are getting clearer. Fidelity to the search, not being cowed into silence nor provoked into violence, yet forgiving and praying, silent yet heard, is the only way I can describe my response.
Through the years, the response is being expanded to include all sons of tortured mothers, mothers of disappeared sons, mothers of peopled slain, displaced tribal people, inclusive of all without exceptions, whether in tattered clothes or uniforms.
Right after the abduction, I was terrified, terrified of the unknown. How could the unknown be truth? But should this fear alone shape my decisions?
Everyone always experiences a conflict situation. Social injustices are daily predicaments.
First in the call to be a truth teller is a sensitivity to situations and an acceptance that these situations confront us and put us in a predicament.
We do not ignore the conflict situation, we confront it and identify those that are contradictory to God.
That is only half the response. The other half is to announce this to the world. For example, cursing God is not acceptable, demeaning and shaming women is vulgar, no reason is good enough to take other people's lives or disappear them.
We can do this only if we have that conviction that we cannot, and will not, allow someone or something to try and prevent us being His presence in the world.
We ""do not allow"" by doing something, by saying something, by acting, by being God's presence. And the prophet says, ""As long as you proclaim it, you fulfilled your role. The person who refuses to hear it suffers the consequences.""
And this word, voice, act, no matter how small, brings hope to those around you. God's hopes can be performed only through us, human beings.
Yes, we are afraid, and it disrupts the normal way of life we live, but Jesus assures us, ""Do not be afraid, do not be discouraged, He will never leave you.""
When Jonas was taken, I thought I would die of a broken heart. But it was not in His plan to take me yet. And by His grace, because of modern-day prophets, there is hope my heart will be whole again.

'What is a crime is not being a gourmand!',international.la-croix.com,Claire Lesegretain,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/what-is-a-crime-is-not-being-a-gourmand/9833,"Religion 'What is a crime is not being a gourmand!' Just as one does not fight ugliness by denouncing it, one does not purify one's body by being violent to it, but by turning it towards offering and giving Claire Lesegretain Mail This Article
Throughout the season of Lent, La Croix is exploring the seven capital sins. Today we look at ""Gluttony."" Claire Lesegretain speaks with Brother Jean , an Orthodox monk who is the cook at the Monastery of Saint Foy, located in the Cevennes Mountains in Southern France
La Croix: Are you a gourmand?
Brother Jean: Yes, I am a gourmand! At the Monastery of Saint-Sabas in the desert of Judea, (Holy Land), where I lived for many years, we fasted every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
One day, as I confessed to my spiritual father, Father Seraphim, that I had dreamt of chocolate, he replied to me: ""What is a crime is not being a gourmand!""
Then he added, ""Chocolate is not a sin, it is dependency that is one; you need to free yourself from it."" Loving food is natural and does you good, unlike gluttony and voracity, which have to do with intemperance, or bulimia and stuffing oneself, which are pathological.
As a monk, can you be a gourmand and at the same time lead an ascetic life?
Monastic fasting is not simply moderation in drinking and eating through the observance of external rules.
It is not a slimming cure, or a medical diet, or a psychological technique to become calm, but a generous, spiritual movement of one's entire being in the freedom of the soul.
What motivates fasting for Orthodox people is the vision of God! Thus, before drinking a glass of water, I make the sign of the cross. I make that water sacrosanct because it is wondrous to have a stream spring out of the rock at the top of a craggy peak in the Cevennes!
And when I bite into a cherry tomato wrapped in a leaf of basil, both of them sown, then cultivated with care and sprinkled with spring water, I give thanks! It is such an explosion of flavours that I can only eat one, otherwise the dazzling taste vanishes.
One day a Dutch billionaire who became rich by cultivating vegetables out of the ground, without sun or earth, came here. When he tasted one of our tomatoes, he was overwhelmed.
""Mine are beautiful,"" he said. ""Yours are good."" Being a gourmand is thus good, since it's essential for understanding the goodness of Creation.""
But isn't gluttony presented as the first temptation to which Adam and Eve were exposed?
In Eden, the tempting serpent is not an enemy. It is a thought that can become good or evil, depending on what Adam or Eve does with it.
Because Eve (that is, the feminine part of the human being) is seduced by the lie, and because Adam (the male part) is seduced by Eve, they eat the fruit forbidden by God and then become opaque to God, who is no longer able to see them, a bit like when you can no longer see through a dirtied glass.
Eve and Adam allow themselves to be tempted because they forget to look into themselves and do not make each of their acts sacrosanct.
The Devil tempts Eve, who believes she is going to become like God. However, God does not ask us to become like Him, but to be ourselves. Like Eve and Adam, when you have a spiritual thought in an impure body, that thought cannot do its work.
Could you say that in another way?
Beauty is beautiful, whether it comes from God or the Devil. It's how you look at it that changes.
It's in that sense that Jesus insists so much on purity of vision - ""Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."" (Mt. 5.8) – and that is why he goes into the desert, the place where God speaks to the purified, accessible, open heart, while the Devil tempts the worried, troubled, disturbed heart.
What this story from Genesis teaches us is that ""You will not accede to the knowledge of Good and Evil without being worthy of receiving it"". He who desires divine power without having its dignity falls prey to pride, complacency, greed.
If Mary is capable of receiving an angel's message, that's because everything in her is ready to receive the spirit, as opposed to Eve, who is motivated by pride.
Because of the purity of her heart, Mary becomes the womb of her own Creator. People have limited the understanding of the Biblical story of the sin of Adam and Eve to the knowledge of Good and Evil, but it means, much more broadly, that real knowledge is given to those who are pure in body and spirit.
The aim of a monastic life is to agree to be purified in your body and in your spirit, including through life's humiliations. Through humiliation, one verifies that one is truly humble.
How do you 'purify your body'?
Through ascetism! You have to do it with firmness and tenderness; just as a pregnant mother makes sure she does not become angry and eats healthy for the good of the baby she carries, purifying yourself does not mean depriving or frustrating yourself, but paying attention to the spirit in you.
Just as one does not fight ugliness by denouncing it, but by showing beauty, one does not purify one's body by being violent to it, but by turning it towards offering and giving.
I love to compare that to weeds: the best way to uproot them is to do it when the ground is moist. Well, to uproot bad thoughts from your heart, it's good to have tears and sweat.
If you do not feel repentance, if there is no desire for conversion, those evil thoughts will return, and often much more strongly than before.
But, careful, some weeds can be useful! Thorn bushes in the centre of a vegetable garden sterilise the ground, but when growing on the edge of it, they serve as natural barbed wire and protect the garden against predators.
In fact, there are no good or bad weeds, only weeds that grow in the wrong places. And there are no good or bad thoughts, only thoughts that come at the wrong time. Purity is not perfection. It is being yourself to the very end of yourself, by agreeing to trim what you are.
The Gospel often employs this image of trimming in order to bear more fruit…
The tree does not produce fruit if it is not obliged to do so. For it to bear, it has to be either stimulated or pruned.
Trimming is cutting off excess branches that grow at the top and take away the tree's nutritious substances for their own use.
These high branches that suck out the sap and do not produce fruit are called, precisely, ""gluttons.""
In fact, trees that bear no fruit grow tall and proud, while those that bear fruit bend humbly towards the ground.
If I wish to go forward as a disciple of Christ, it's good for me to constrain myself, to fast, to exercise my freedom to deprive myself of a certain comfort, because what harms faith is comfort.
Just as I trim a tree of the greedy branches that exhaust it, I have to withdraw from my body everything that exhausts my soul: passions, distractions, sterile greed…
Paradoxically, you will be publishing a book of recipes in a few weeks' time …
I am a monk and I express my faith though cooking. I offer this book of recipes, which are simple to make, just as one shares a passion, by helping people to understand and respect various demanding rules.
Cooking should be a party, an art of living, a moment of grace, simple and human, that enables you to be one with nature and develop a friendly relationship with the other guests. Cooking, like art, is sharing, a giving of oneself.
My mother made me aware of cooking through a game, by making me guess the menu from its aroma. I was later initiated into the spirit of food by Father Theologos at Mount Athos.
Then, at Saint-Sabas, where I was also in charge of cooking, Father Seraphim taught me to develop meals. With him, I learned the beauty of the gesture, the simple, the sacred… He taught me the essential, namely: ""Christ is alive here and now, and he needs man to be visible."" "
China's relentless persecution of ethnic minorities abroad,international.la-croix.com,Anders Corr,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/chinas-relentless-persecution-of-ethnic-minorities-abroad/9840,"World China's relentless persecution of ethnic minorities abroad Failure to take serious action against Chinese imposition of its racist laws internationally is a dereliction of duty Anders Corr

The scale of China's extraterritorial persecution of people it considers to be Chinese nationals, including its Muslim and other ethnic minority citizens, is immense.
Stories abound of Uyghur university students being called back to China in the middle of their semesters abroad in Egypt and of Kazakhs being extradited or detained when they cross the border from Kazakhstan into China.
Chinese activists and those facing allegations of corruption have been reportedly abducted from Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar. But nowhere is safe, including the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia or New Zealand.
I interviewed a Uyghur academic who has lived for years abroad and is afraid to publish an academic article on the situation in Xinjiang that has already been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal. He fears that publishing the article could lead to persecution of his family in China.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has created a general feeling of fear in the Chinese diaspora that has impeded their freedom of speech and therefore their ability to defend loved ones at home and to advance their careers and lives abroad.
On March 30, new details of Chinese government attempts to obtain personal information from Uyghurs living in Australia were revealed.
ABC obtained text messages that appeared to originate from Chinese authorities that asked Uyghurs for their workplace addresses, passports, drivers' licenses and recent photos. Uyghurs that ABC interviewed provided the information to Chinese authorities for fear that their relatives in China would face consequences.
Family members in China, likely under duress from authorities, are also asking their relatives who are outside China to return and face police questioning.
In at least one case, an Australian citizen of Uyghur ethnicity, who claims not to be a citizen of China, was contacted by Chinese authorities and told that he must hand over all information on not only himself but also his wife and children in Australia.
One Uyghur woman who has not heard from her family in China since 2017 received a chilling call from a friend there who said two siblings and an in-law were placed in a detention camp that year because she is in Australia.
She is not the only Australian burdened with such circumstances and the unjust feelings of guilt that they create. There are about 3,000 Uyghurs in Australia.
Were such extraterritorial actions by the CCP limited to Australia, they might be seen as incredible or even unbelievable. But they are part of a pattern seen elsewhere, including in Pakistan and the United States.
At least 200 Chinese wives of Pakistani men have disappeared after they crossed the border to visit China. Their accompanying children have often disappeared as well. Some of the children are left to fend for themselves in China after their mother is detained, and without access to their father still in Pakistan.
The latest news on Pakistan comes from mountainous Gilgit-Baltistan in the northeast of the country on the border with China. On March 1, the legislative assembly there unanimously called on the federal government to take urgent steps to free 50 detained Chinese wives of men from the region.
The federal government, which is dependent on China for loans, infrastructure development and military hardware, has sought to deny news of lost wives in China.
The wives typically must travel across the border for their import-export businesses and so are forced to risk detention or forego income that could mean the difference between food for the family or hunger.
According to a lawmaker from the region, the women were arrested on suspicion of terrorism, but none had actually been found to have such involvement.
Arrests of these women started last year even though their marriages were in accordance with laws from both countries. In 2018, the Gilgit-Baltistan all-party conference passed a similar resolution, but with the additional call for a one-year trade ban against China.
The Deccan Chronicle in Pakistan reported on the resolution and claimed that the ""region is home to large China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) infrastructural work being mainly undertaken by the Chinese government, and as a result the Chinese Communist Party has seen itself fit to overtake functions of justice and rule of law in the territory.""
This follows a pattern of CCP attempts to extend its law into regions it militarily occupies, such as Tibet, Xinjiang and, most recently, the South China Sea. China's tentacles spread far and wide
A report in 2018 detailed how family members of Uyghur immigrants in the United States have also been called by their family members, who ask for ID scans, car license plate numbers, bank card numbers, employment contracts, letters from supervisors and phone numbers.
The goal of such data is supposedly to allow Chinese authorities to issue Uyghur expatriates with Chinese national ID cards. Such ID cards could then be used by Chinese authorities to impose even great extraterritorial legal obligations on their Uyghur ""citizens"" abroad.
The threat to obtain the data from resistant expatriate Uyghurs in the U.S. is that family members will be penalized if the demands are not followed. The new ID card is reportedly meant for all Chinese living abroad.
China also imposes its extraterritorial penalties on Chinese human rights, democracy and Falun Gong activists . Such penalties can be quite personal and ugly, often becoming coordinated character assassination.
The New York Times reported on April 1 that Chinese democracy and human rights activist Sheng Xue in Canada has suffered from numerous online attacks on her reputation by anonymous blogs and fake Twitter accounts.
Obviously fake photos of the married Sheng show her naked or kissing other activists who are not her husband. A human rights lawyer who sought to help Sheng had his computer hacked and his research deleted. The report he planned to write was never published.
Chinese security services have reportedly kidnapped numerous people they consider to be Chinese nationals but who are in some cases legally nationals of other countries. This includes persons in Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Fiji and Hong Kong.
Six Chinese nationals disappeared in the U.S. in 2013, according to a former intelligence official. Evidence suggested that Chinese intelligence officials were threatening American residents near their homes or schools. In three cases, including that of a Chinese graduate at UC Berkeley, evidence emerged that the victim was taken against his will.
Allegations used to justify abductions include corruption, selling of banned books, owing billions of dollars to state-owned banks in Beijing, and publicly voicing dissident thoughts against the CCP or in favor of democracy and human rights.
In the renditions, known as shuanggui in Chinese, victims are often drugged, transported by cargo ship, tortured and forced to make confessions. Some have been jailed for life, and at least one, Peng Ming, died in a Chinese prison under suspicious circumstances.
The abductions stretch back to 2000, and China claims to have repatriated over 3,000 Chinese since 2012. Victims and their families generally keep quiet for fear of causing themselves and their detained family members yet more persecution.
Australian authorities have told Uyghurs to call the police if they are concerned about their personal safety. But this is indicative of the woefully inadequate response in all the countries.
All have lucrative commercial relations that they want to maintain, and some deny that threats against family members back in China to force a rendition do not constitute a real kidnapping. These are all self-serving excuses to look the other way as human rights violations occur in one's own country.
In cases of CCP foreign abduction or extraterritorial law enforcement, the ambassador from China should be publicly summoned as a first step to explain each and every case.
If no good explanation is offered, government action against China should be taken. Chinese embassy personnel, who have diplomatic immunity and so are the most likely enforcers, should be sent home as a second step. If these measures are ignored, a third step of economic sanctions should be imposed.
A failure to take serious action against Chinese imposition of its racist and extraterritorial laws internationally is a dereliction of duty and a violation of any constitution that upholds the principle of equality before the law.

One of the biggest stories to come out of Rome these past days has been Pope Francis' decision to name Wilton Gregory as the new Archbishop of Washington.
The pope transferred him from Atlanta, where the 71-year-old African-American has overseen a rapidly growing local Church since 2004, to the smaller, but much more high-profile archdiocese in the U.S. capital.
It is understood that the archbishop had to think long and hard about accepting his new post – and for some very good reasons. Wedded to the diocese?
First of all, as someone well grounded in theology and Church history, Wilton (as he is commonly called) is aware that it is generally not healthy, from an ecclesiological point of view, for the pope to move bishops from one place to another.
This will be the archbishop's third diocese. Cardinal Sean O'Malley has now led four.
As the medieval historian Joseph O'Callaghan pointed out in an article a few years ago, Rome's appointment of bishops around the world runs contrary to the Church's centuries-long tradition of episcopal election by the clergy and people of the diocese.
He lamented that ""bishops are seldom chosen to govern a diocese where they served as priests and thus are strangers to the priests and people committed to their care."" He noted that ""smaller dioceses are often viewed as stepping-stones to more important prizes.""
In the case of Washington, the ""prize"" is likely to be a cardinal's red hat.
The professor reminded his readers that, ""in ancient times, the bishop was described as wedded to his diocese,"" (the language today's Church continues to employ, without blushing, to justify the wearing of episcopal rings).
O'Callaghan recalled that this is why Saint Callistus I, who was pope from 218-220, described bishops who transferred to other dioceses as ""spiritual adulterers."" The age factor
In the course of 1,800 years we've dropped the 3 rd century pope's harsh tone and have generally come to accept that, for certain important reasons, it may be wise for a seasoned and experienced bishop to be moved to another diocese in need of his particular skills.
Washington is an archdiocese where the priests and people have been deeply demoralized by the fallout of the sexual abuse crisis. It is in need of some serious healing. And that is probably partly why Archbishop Gregory had to think carefully about whether or not to accept the appointment.
He must have had to carefully consider whether he has the considerable energy and patience in order to provide that.
But it is not hard to imagine that he also had to ponder whether he would have sufficient time to complete such an onerous mission.
In less than four years he will be 75, the age at which every diocesan bishop is ""requested"" ( rogatur ) by canon law to ""submit his resignation from office to the Supreme Pontiff who will make provisions after he has examined all the circumstance"" (Can. 401 § 1).
No one knows if Francis will still be around on December 7, 2022 when the archbishop crosses that threshold. If he is, Wilton will probably stay on closer to reaching his 80 th birthday. If it's another pope, all bets are off. Tapping the Church's 'elder statesmen' with a view towards reform
Since the very beginning of his pontificate, Pope Francis has asked bishops who are near the end of their episcopal service to take on new and important duties.
He first did so a month after his election as Bishop of Rome in 2013 when he created the Council of Cardinals to assist him in governing the universal Church and reforming the Roman Curia.
Of the eight men of the world's various continents that he originally named to this body of chief advisors, five of them were 70 years of age or older. The most senior was already 79. Two others were 68, while the youngest was 60.
Three of them are no longer members – Chile's Francisco Arrazuriz (85), Democratic Republic of Congo's Laurent Monsengwo (79) and Australia's George Pell (77).
In September that same year, Francis appointed Archbishop Beniamino Stella, then 72, to head the Congregation for the Clergy and Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, who would turn 73 a few days later, as general secretary of the Synod of Bishops.
Both are longtime Vatican diplomats and papal nuncios who served in numerous places around the globe.
More recently the pope named his fellow Jesuit, Luis Ladaria, as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). Ladaria was already 73 years old and been serving since 2008 as CDF secretary after teaching theology for decades at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.
All of these are now cardinals. But in each and every case, Francis chose these older men for their wealth of experience and the assistance they could provide him, not in order to bestow upon them a red hat or give them any particular prize.
Most importantly he picked all of them – with the notable exception of George Pell – because they share his vision for Church reform and his interpretation of the Second Vatican Council (1962-65). Older bishops get new duties in the local Churches
The pope also has looked, at times, to older bishops to fill key and tricky posts in the local and national Churches.
In May 2017 he appointed Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, who had already turned 75 one month earlier, to a five-year term as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference.
The Florentine has been a bishop for nearly 25 years and the pope saw him to be a man of vast experience with the skills and stature needed to change the direction and priorities of the Catholic hierarchy in the Bel Paese.
Pope Francis has used the same criteria to fill a number of major archdioceses around the world with men already closing in on the suggested retirement age. A few examples will suffice.
In December 2014 he appointed Vicente Jiménez, then just a month shy of his 71 st birthday, as Archbishop of Zaragoza in Spain. And the following October, he named Fidel Herráez, already 71, as the head of the Spanish Archdiocese of Burgos. Experienced pastors for troubled dioceses
That same year the pope chose 69-year-old Carlos Osoro to replace the archconservative Cardinal Antonio Rauco Varela as head of Spain's most important archdiocese, Madrid.
And in late 2015 he tapped Juan José Omella, nearly 70, to guide the historically important Archdiocese of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia where separatists continue to foment an independence movement.
Francis also appointed a 70-year-old two years ago to lead the famous Archdiocese of Aparecida in Brazil. And his recent pick to succeed a conservative Opus Dei cardinal in Lima is a well-respected theologian who took up his post in Peru's capital at age 69.
In some instances the 82-year-old pope has not actually replaced retired bishops, but has chosen older and more senior prelates to serve as apostolic administrators. This is especially true in major archdioceses experiencing various types of difficulty.
For example, last summer he deputed Cardinal Enrique Porras, well into his 74 th year, to oversee the Archdiocese of Caracas in the heart of the turbulence now shaking Venezuela. That appointment came just two years after the pope gave Porras, a bishop since the age of 38, a red hat.
And in Chile, where the Church is being decimated by waves of sexual abuse cases and their mismanagement, Francis just a month ago chose a 74-year-old Capuchin bishop to be apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Santiago. A practice even before Pope Francis
Even before Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Bishop of Rome his predecessors also appointed elderly men to major posts. But they did so primarily as a reward, which was often a red hat.
In the United States this was the case with Cardinals Justin Rigali and Edward Egan. Both were 68-year-old archbishops when John Paul II appointed them respectively to Philadelphia and New York where they each served less than nine years.
The most notorious recent case, of course, is that of Theodore McCarrick. He was already 70 when John Paul named him Archbishop of Washington. McCarrick was installed in January 2001 and got his red hat just several weeks later. He lasted not even six years before retiring in May 2006.
And we cannot forget what happened in 2011 when Benedict XVI transferred Cardinal Angelo Scola to Milan. The Italian was just five months shy of his 70 th birthday and had served the last nine years as Patriarch of Venice in one of the Church's most venerable dioceses.
Although three of Scola's predecessors in the famous lagoon city were elected to the papacy in the 20 th century, many people did not think that enhanced his chances to become pope. Benedict thus sent Scola to Milan, the largest diocese in Europe, to burnish the ambitious prelate's credentials.
But six years later, and with Jorge Mario Bergoglio already Bishop of Rome, Scola retired. What about Wilton?
This brings us back to the appointment of 71-year-old Wilton Gregory to Washington.
Some people may wonder why Pope Francis could not have chosen someone from among the local priests or auxiliary bishops to lead the archdiocese, perhaps a younger man who would have a longer time at the helm.
Going for youth, energy and longevity certainly makes sense when looking for a leader of newly created diocese or parish. And it is also a preferable choice in places that are in good health – financially, spiritually and structurally.
But the Catholic community in Washington is particularly fragile and demoralized at this moment. There is weariness. And there is anger.
Watching the new archbishop speak at a press conference in Washington on the day Rome announced his appointment, it was hard not to be impressed by his poise, his transparency, his common touch. He looked to be very much the right man for the job.
But there is still the question of his age. Will he have enough time to do what really needs to be done in Washington?
Let's not forget that Angelo Roncalli was appointed Patriarch of Venice in 1953 when he was just two months younger than Wilton Gregory's current age. And we know how that ended up.

A post-modernist novelist has been arrested and charged with violating international human rights law in Sri Lanka for authoring a story about homosexuality and child abuse at a Buddhist temple.
Shakthika Sathkumara, 33, was arrested on April 1 after a group of monks complained to the police when he posted the short story called Ardha on his Facebook page and in local Sinhalese language publications.
Homosexuality is outlawed in the island nation, where about 70 percent of the population of 21 million identify as Theravada Buddhists and monks swear vows of celibacy.
The writer and poet was detained by Polgahawela police until April 9 after the monks refused to settle out of court.
He was charged by a local magistrate with inciting religious hatred and breaching the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a multilateral treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly.
The ICCPR prohibits advocacy of racial, national, religious hatred that helps incitement discrimination, hostility or violence.
The story makes only indirect references to homosexual behavior among Buddhist clergy, but this was enough to inflame local religious sensibilities.
The Free Media Movement (FMM), a rights watchdog, expressed its dissatisfaction over the incident and said police should not have such extensive powers to control or censor works of art.
It pointed to numerous occasions where the government, in deciding on works of art and literature by independent thinkers, has violated people's freedom of expression.
""When Sri Lanka signed the ICCPR, the promise given to the people of the country and the international community was that freedom of expression would be further strengthened and protected by the charter,"" C. Dodawatta, convener of the FMM, said on April 3.
""But it is clear this particular charter challenges freedom of expression. When there is an issue with the content of a piece of art, it cannot be judged by a single point of view.""
Sathkumara was named the best Sinhala short story writer in Sri Lanka's National Youth Literary Festivals of 2010 and 2014.
The FMM said the decision to immediately prosecute him shows how little respect Colombo has for basic human rights.
""Once again, the FMM appeals to all state officials not to proceed with this kind of arbitrary action,"" Dodawatta said.
In an opinion piece published in the Colombo Telegraph on April 3, Sarath de Alwis wrote: ""In medieval times creators of beauty, truth and human squalor were persecuted. In the new age of fake righteousness attempted by statute and proclamations we seem to be returning to our tribal roots.
""Our free press — print and electronic — did not report the incident. The incident has gone viral on the internet. The international news agency AFP has reported the Orwellian ordeal of Shakthika Sathkumara to the world.""
Vijeykumar Vidhusan, 18, is also being detained for 10 months under the ICCPR for posting New Year's wishes on his Facebook account on October 2018 showing pictures of the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) .
Jayathilaka Kammallaweera, one of the leading short story writers in the country, said the authorities have abused the international covenant to clamp down on free speech. ""Freedom of expression should be strengthened and protected. Sathkumara is not against the philosophy of Buddhism at all,"" he said.
Kammallaweera expressed concern about the extremist Buddhist group who filed a complaint against Sathkumara.
Tenison Perera, president of the Writers Organization of Lanka, said his network would rally behind the persecuted writer. ""If he has done anything wrong, the Buddhist group can work according to the rule of law, but not violate his rights by force,"" he said.
Gamini Viyangoda, co-convenor of Purawesi Balaya, a civil society movement, said the monks hope to intimidate and silence the award-winning writer.
Meanwhile, human rights defenders have signed a petition demanding he be released.
""The ICCPR is intended to ensure citizens' civic and political rights,"" they wrote. ""It is not to be misused to intimidate artists and censor works of art in the guise of preserving religious harmony. The publication does not amount to any disrespect towards Buddhism.
""[His] arrest and detention is not merely a threat to our freedom of expression but also paves the way to creating a culture of regulating and censoring artistic expression based on the whims of religious and extremist groups.""
Sarath de Alwis wrote in the Colombo Telegraph that in ancient India homosexuals were simply identified as the third nature, trithya prakthi . ""Whether it is a deviant practice or not is not the issue in Shakthika's story. It is the realism embedded in the yarn that has upset the holy hornet's nest."" "

In a small village in Shan state in central Myanmar , 13 nuns have been working for decades to show local adults and children that having a physical or mental handicap does not preclude them from living a functional life.
The nuns provide a range of services from physiotherapy to providing orphans and students from poor families with a formal education.
They care for 198 people from various religions — mostly Catholics, Baptists and Buddhists — drawn from numerous ethnic groups including Shan, Pa-O, Bamar, Lahu, Tamil, Akha, Chin and Karen.
Some are visually or hearing impaired while others suffer from polio or epilepsy. Several are orphans, and a few have to be physically restrained lest they hurt themselves.
The nuns belong to the Sisters of Charity of Saints Bartolomea Capitanio and Vincenza Gerosa congregation, which was founded in Italy in the 1830s and arrived in Myanmar almost a century ago.
The congregation now has 196 nuns serving in six dioceses. Their mission includes a home for the elderly, leper colonies, boarding schools and orphanages.
But at the Holy Infant Jesus Center for the Disabled and Orphans in Phaya Phyu village, just five kilometers from Taunggyi town in Shan state, the focus is on people with special needs.
The nuns survive on donations, whether in the form or cash, rice, oil or other necessities. They also receive financial support from the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement and from Myanmar's Vice President Henry Van Thio.
""Most of the donors in Myanmar are Buddhists and some are Chinese,"" said Sister Natalina Misa, who runs the center. ""We also have some sponsors from Thailand and a Buddhist monk from Japan.""
She said the monthly food bill alone costs around 6 million kyat (US$4,000). To make the center more self-sufficient and lighten the financial burden, the nuns grow corn, peanuts, beans, cucumbers, gourds and pumpkins. They also raise pigs and chickens.
In 2017, the sisters opened a clinic offering free medical services for all patients. Two medical volunteers visit twice a month to help out.
""We also teach children important life skills so that they can become model citizens,"" Sister Misa said.
One outstanding student was even sent abroad for further studies with the help of the congregation.
To help those with physical disabilities, the nuns built an ""exercise house"" with the aid of New Humanity, an Italian non-governmental organization.
The center was completed in 1963, three years after Bishop J.B. Gobatto from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions arranged for it to be built. "

The Catholic bishops of France have elected Archbishop Eric deMoulins-Beaufort of Reims as the president of their national episcopal conference (CEF). They selected the 57-year-old protégé of retired Cardinal André Vingt-Trois on April 3, the first day of voting.
The new conference president is said to be highly appreciated for his analytical skills. He's been described as a pragmatic man with a clear idea of how the Church needs to deal with the crises it is currently facing.
Addressing the press for the first time as the newly elected CEF president on April 4, Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort emphasized his determination to handle issues pragmatically and to avoid using excessively churchy language.
""We will never go back to the village society that existed before 1965 where people went to Mass out of a sense of duty,"" he noted.
""Today, social relations are governed mainly by the search for pleasure,"" he responded when questioned about the tasks facing the French Church. ""We have a duty to evangelize this new world."" No question of giving up
Over the last few weeks he was highly touted as one of the favorites to succeed Archbishop Georges Pontier, whose second term as CEF president officially expires on July 1. Nonetheless, Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort said he was surprised by ""an election (that was) neither desired nor expected.""
He immediately added that there was no question of ""giving up at a sensitive time in the life of the Church.""
He admitted to only one regret, namely ""being unable to devote myself full-time for several years to the Diocese of Reims, where I only arrived five months ago and where a number of changes are already under way.""
The archbishop certainly gives no impression of ""giving up"" regarding the sex abuse crisis that continues to sap the life out of the Church.
""We need to face the fact that too many priests have behaved badly with young people without anyone noticing or that they were treated as inoffensive once their misdeeds became known,"" he said.
""The bishops are now unanimous on this issue and we will be able to move forward,"" he said.
It was, undoubtedly, precisely in order to ""move forward"" amid an ongoing series of revelations of sexual assaults by priests that the bishops elected Moulins-Beaufort as their conference president. They consider him a safe pair of hands. New life for the episcopal machine
He will be a worthy heir to Cardinal André Vingt-Trois. He gained solid management experience from the cardinal and has a similar lively spirit.
Since his arrival in Reims, the archbishop has also faced the problems that many of his confrères have experienced in more sparsely populated areas of France, particularly the dwindling number of priests and the collapse of the traditional ""parish network.""
His intellectual standing and his realistic manner of tackling problems without excessive nostalgia for the past also certainly contributed to his election.
Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort also represents a new generation of bishops. They hope he will breathe new life into the staid episcopal machine. Highly regarded teacher
Eric de Moulins-Beaufort is one of seven siblings and the descendant of a noble family. After graduating from the Institute of Political Science in Paris, he entered seminary and was ordained to the priesthood in 1991 for the Archdiocese of Paris. His seminary professors had seen early on that he was a man with ""potential.""
He served for three years as the personal secretary of Cardinal Vingt-Trois before being appointed auxiliary bishop and vicar general.
He also became a highly regarded teacher at the Faculty of Notre Dame and at the Studium of the Paris seminary.
A well-recognized theologian, Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort was recently appointed as the head of the CEF doctrinal commission.
He also serves as a member of the executive committee of the Cardinal Henri de Lubac International Associate.
And he sits on the editorial boards of two significant journals, Communio and the Nouvelle revue théologique (NRT).
Last year he published a much discussed article in the NRT entitled "" Que nous est-il arrivé? De la sidération à l'action devant les abus sexuels dans l'Église "" (What has happened to us? From bewilderment to to action on sex abuse in the Church).
The article sought to analyze the reasons for the crimes and suggested various legal and pastoral responses.
Well-liked by the lay people with whom he worked in the Archdiocese of Paris, he is known for his even temperament and easy manner, as well as his sense of humor.
All these qualities will likely prove useful in dealing with the storm that the Church is currently facing.
""I have never seen him get angry, or at least it took a lot for that to happen!"" commented Karine Dalle, information officer for the Archdiocese of Paris and a former colleague.
He is ""great news for the French Church,"" she added enthusiastically, touting the ""intellectual, spiritual and physical qualities"" of a man she regards as a ""well-balanced person"" even though some may ""find him a bit stiff."" Open spirit
Interviewed last year by La Croix about the difficulty of organizing debate in the Church in light of the controversies surrounding abortion, he sought to offer reassurance, insisting that he ""had always been able to say what he wanted to say"" in the Church.
At the end of February 2019, after a series of particularly damaging revelations of sex abuse, he wrote a letter to Catholics in the Reims diocese.
He told them them of his own ""disgust and discouragement"" that the revelations of ""concealed"" evil had caused.
The letter offered an essentially spiritual reading of the crisis.
""God has not abandoned his Church but, on the contrary, is working to purify it, including from the evil that exists within it and that it had obstinately refused to see,"" he wrote.Concerning Pope Francis' battle against clericalism, he has admitted to ""naiveté"" on the issue, having been convinced that ""as a result of Vatican II relations between priests and lay people had been profoundly renewed and simplified and had put them at the common service of the mission given by Christ rather than as a means of social control and supervision.""
Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort's open spirit will undoubtedly assist greatly in enabling him to lead his peers to deal clearly with the Church's present difficulties, as well as to envisage the structural reforms that the French Episcopal Conference has put off until now. "

Burning works of fiction beloved by children and adults the world over has backfired on Polish Father Rafal Jarosiewicz, whose incendiary response to literary references to magic and the occult has resulted in a fine by local city guards and a tidal wave of public criticism.
The Catholic priest, who serves at a parish in northern Poland, issued an apology on his Facebook account on April 2 after earlier leading parishioners to a public burning of Harry Potter books, Buddhist figurines, an African mask and other items in the city of Gdanks.
He claimed the move was aimed at deterring the influence of wizardry, evil forces and nefarious influences but later backtracked, describing the incident as ""unfortunate,"" according to The Associated Press .
After pictures of the open conflagration at the Parish of Our Lady Mother of the Church and St. Catherine of Sweden lit up social media courtesy of coverage by the SMS z Nieba foundation, a backlash ensued that made the priest rethink his call to action, the media reports.
In addition to alienating Catholics who found the measure too extreme, with some comparing it to the practices of Nazi Germany and witch hunts in the Middle Ages, an anti-smog group in Poland has apparently also contacted prosecutors about the illegal burning of waste in an open fire.
It was unclear at the time of writing if Father Jarosiewicz will face any charges or legal action. "

Father Ziad Hilal , a Syrian Jesuit, has published a book about his experiences during the past eight years of war in Syria.
The book is called Homs, l'espérance obstinée (Homs: Obstinate Hope) and is shortlisted for the literary prize awarded by l'Œuvre d'Orient, an association dedicated to helping Christians in the East.
In his book, Father Ziad Hilal pays homage to numerous Syrian victims, as well as to the Dutch Jesuit priest Frans van der Lugt, who was killed in Homs on April 7, 2014.
La Croix: Why have you based the title of your book about everyday life during the war in Syria on the word 'hope'?
Father Ziad Hilal: Even though we ourselves have not yet been able to see the fruition, we hope that the work that we have already begun in education towards peace and reconciliation, and towards the purification of memory, will allow the new generation to experience a god life.
The psalmist sang, ""I will sing of the Lord's great love forever… I will make your faithfulness known through all generations. I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you have established your faithfulness in heaven itself"" (Psalm 89). It is crucial to place this hope for Syria at the center of all that we do.
How did you write about the terrible conflict that has ravaged your country for eight long years?
Each of the 30 chapters tells a story, which I experienced with others. What I wanted to to do in this book is to recount what the media cannot show or describe what we Syrian Christians and Muslims of Homs – experienced during the siege of Homs and during the war.
I describe the realities of life in Homs: our suffering, our joy, our isolation, how we eat, and how we find water and electricity. I also describe how we have tried since the beginning of the war to respond to the humanitarian crisis and the immense need for education.
I demonstrate the role and strength of the Church, of Christian churches, in helping the Syrian people. We do not want the new generation to be a generation of war but rather a generation of peace. For this to happen, we have to combat religious fundamentalism and the discourse of hatred.
On April 7, it will five years since your fellow Jesuit Frans van der Lugt was murdered in the monastery garden. What was his role during the crisis?
Father Frans was a remarkable man of peace and reconciliation. It was thanks to him that our community sheltered Christian and Muslim families, exemplifying the unity in the country. He succeeded in making our house an oasis that flowered in a world of violence and destruction.
As a priest and psychoanalyst, he listened to others as a fellow human being. He was concerned about helping people to overcome the trauma of the war.
Father Frans' murder evoked reactions from all Syrians. It is rare that Muslims and Christians, both Catholic and Orthodox, find themselves gathered around the same figure: this is what happened. He is not only a Christian martyr: he is also a Syrian martyr!
How will the Company of Jesus celebrate his legacy?
At the beginning of April, a small delegation consisting of the Superior General. Father Arturo Sosa, his assistant general who was our provincial superior when Father Frans was killed, and the postulator for his cause for beatification, Father Pascual Cebollada, will go to Homs.
According to the rules of the Church, it is necessary to wait for five years after the death of someone before introducing his or her case for beatification. It is time now to begin the process.
As for me, I will be in Germany with Syrian refugees of all religions who also wish to pay homage to Father Frans. They hope to organize a two-day nature walk, like the ones that Father Frans used to organize with them in order for them to get to know the country and to encourage unity among communities.
We will also celebrate mass, in communion with our brothers in Homs.
What do you think of the news of the Islamic State's defeat in Baghouz, in the north of Syria?
We feel a little calmer since the defeat of ISIS. This fanatical group, which wanted to impose its way of life – of dressing, of eating etc. – on the entire Syrian population, has wreaked havoc. Dividing the world between believers and infidels: that is ISIS's method, and it's our nightmare in Syria.
However, we also know that military defeat does not make the ideology disappear. People who were members of ISIS, like those who are close to Al Qaeda, still think that those who do not think like them do not deserve to live. There is still an enormous amount of work to do!
I have heard no news about Father Paolo Dall'Oglio and the other hostages, and this worries me. Now, the matter is in the hands of the Kurds and the Americans.

ITCJ-ICMA conference on socio-political involvement of the Church. (Photo by Guy Aimé Eblotié)
The BARAZA Chair of African Theology at the Jesuit Institute of Theology (ITCJ) in Abidjan hosted its second conference addressing the theme ""The key challenges facing Christians in Africa today: Ivory Coast as an example.""
The March 30 event featured one of Ivory Coast's currently most influential personalities, Father Norbert Eric Abékan, parish priest at Holy Family Church in Abidjan's Riviera 2 district.
Opening the conference, Father Bienvenu Mayemba, director of the BARAZA Chair of African Theology, explained the reasons behind the choice of theme.
""We realized that our continent is facing major challenges,"" he said. ""After a series of academic conferences, we decided to hold a pastoral conference this time to create space for exchange on the issue.""
In his keynote address, Father Abékan spoke of the difficulties experienced by Africans and the negative perception of Africa in the minds of certain western and Asian presidents.
""When we listen to them, we hear our continent painted black despite its enormous potential,"" he lamented.
""However, let us not follow an ostrich policy,"" he warned. ""If we can keep in mind these external view of our reality as well as what we experience directly ourselves, we will achieve a certain balance,"" he added. Rethinking pastoral work
""Africa is a continent of paradoxes,"" Father Abékan said, ""because while the soil is rich, there is much poverty and misery.""
Given this socio-political context, there are significant challenges that Christians need to address.
""These challenges are at the level of education, reconciliation, health, ecology, inculturation, etc.,"" he explained, citing Ivory Coast as a particular example.
""Christians fill our churches but do not become involved,"" he noted. ""We therefore need to rethink our pastoral work.""
Father Abékan, who was a pioneers of the Charismatic Renewal in Ivory Coast and who still works regularly with the new communities, also raised the issue of the latter, warning that they can be ""a double edged knife.""
""Above all, it is necessary to rethink the pastoral approach health care, which until now has limited itself to evangelization and prayers of liberation,"" he added.
He also suggested to his priestly colleagues, who are often highly critical of prayer groups, that they should pay more attention to these communities and work together to assist them. Inculturation and reconciliation
Lastly, Father Abékan recommended that the ITCJ should launch a process of reflection on the issues of inculturation and reconciliation.
In response, Father Mayemba warmly welcomed the recommendation, adding that plans are now under way to organize workshops and courses focusing on reconciliation.
Father Abékan also proposed greater Church involvement in the field of ecology, e.g. through concrete actions to involve parishes.
""We could organise a competition for the cleanest parish or the most ecological diocese,"" he suggested. "
Vatican finds former Guam archbishop guilty of child sex abuse,international.la-croix.com,La Croix International staff (with Catholic News Service),04-05-2019,2019,4,https://international.la-croix.com/news/vatican-finds-former-guam-archbishop-guilty-of-child-sex-abuse/9841,"Vatican finds former Guam archbishop guilty of child sex abuse The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's decision is final and no further appeals are possible La Croix International staff (with Catholic News Service) United States

The Vatican has upheld its decision convicting the former Archbishop Anthony Apuron in the U.S. territory of Guam for sexually abusing minors.
""Our church on Guam can now continue with certainty, our collective journey toward healing and reconciliation. Most importantly, the victims, survivors and their families who have suffered greatly can have some measure of solace that justice has been rendered in the church's tribunal process,"" Archbishop Michael J. Byrnes of Agana, said of his predecessor.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith rejected an appeal by the now-former Archbishop Apuron upholding its earlier judgment of finding him guilty of abuse of minors.
The doctrinal tribunal's decision is final and no further appeals are possible, it said in a communique published April 4.
""We welcome this closure with great relief. We have needed it badly. It has been a long and painful period for our church and our island community as a whole,"" Archbishop Byrnes said in a statement released later in the day.
Vatican judges imposed the following penalties against Apuron: the privation of office; the perpetual prohibition from dwelling, even temporarily, in the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Agana, and the perpetual prohibition from using the insignia attached to the rank of bishop.
Apuron, 73, a Capuchin Fransican, was ordained a bishop in 1984 and he ""sacramentally"" remains a bishop, Alessandro Gisotti, interim director of the Vatican press office, told reporters April 4.
However, Bishop Apuron has been formally removed from the ""office"" of archbishop of Agana, where he was installed in 1986, and his removal from ""ecclesiastical office"" means he may no longer wear the usual ""insignia"" associated with it, such as a bishop's ring, miter and staff, Gisotti added.
Archbishop Byrnes, who was named coadjutor of the archdiocese in 2016, automatically becomes the archbishop of Agana, Gisotti said.
After conducting a canonical trial against Bishop Apuron, the apostolic tribunal of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith announced in March 2018 that it found Apuron guilty of several accusations against him, including the sexual abuse of minors.
However, the original statement never specified the number of charges the bishop faced.
Apuron was allowed to and did appeal the sentence and sanctions and said he was innocent. Because of the appeal, the imposed penalties were suspended until a final resolution.
Apuron left Guam in 2016 after he was accused of sexually assaulting four altar boys when he was a priest at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Agat.
His nephew later accused the priest of raping him in a Chancery bathroom nearly three decades ago when the boy was still a teenager. "

Among the many intentions and desires that Christians bring to prayer and the liturgies during April, Pope Francis is inviting them to consider a special group of people who are in his own heart and prayers this month — doctors and their humanitarian collaborators in war zones, who risk their lives to save the lives of others.
The pope is urging special prayers for this particularly heroic and brave group of professionals, during the very month that Christians will be commemorating Palm Sunday, Holy Week and Good Friday, and then festively celebrating of Easter.
It's part of the pope's Worldwide Prayer Network of the Apostleship of Prayer , as Francis explains in a video for this month's intention.
The full text of his intention is below: The presence of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers in war-torn areas is a sign of hope. They are wise, valiant, and good-hearted people who, following their vocation, work under extremely dangerous conditions. Let us pray for doctors and their humanitarian collaborators in war-torn areas, who risk their lives to save the lives of others.
The pope's Worldwide Prayer Network of the Apostleship of Prayer developed ""The Pope Video"" initiative to assist in the worldwide dissemination of monthly intentions of the Holy Father in relation to the challenges facing humanity. "

Penny Stocks to Watch: Is Office Depot too Risky?,microsmallcap.com,Maria Ohle,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://microsmallcap.com/penny-stocks-odp-04-05-19/,"Apr 5, 2019 143 Views Maria Ohle Penny Stocks to Watch: Is Office Depot too Risky?
Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) is a retailing penny stocks company that dropped significantly in yesterday’s trade. Dropping from $3.77 USD to its current price of $2.86 USD, investors have clearly been shaken.
Retailers are facing a tough climate in recent years, and Office Depot has suffered greatly. Is this penny stock still worth your time or is there a light on the horizon?
Let’s check this out. Penny Stocks to Watch: Office Depot
The most recent decline has come from the company’s disappointing preliminary first-quarter earnings report.
Office Depot reported that revenue and adjusted operating income for Q1 was to come in at $2.76 billion and $65 million, respectively. Enter Your E-mail Address To Subscribe * indicates required Email Address *
The revenue figure came in below the estimate of $2.82 billion and, even worse, showed an overall declining sales period with last quarter’s revenue income coming in at $2.83 billion. Further, it “compared unfavorably with $93 million in adjusted operating income the year before.” CompuCom
Okay, falling sales is a bad sign, but a bigger problem becomes more apparent when we look at the bigger picture. Office Depot acquired IT service provider CompuCom in 2017 for $1 billion. This acquisition was to mark a turnaround for the already ailing retailer. It was to be “a key part of the company’s plan to pivot to becoming an all-encompassing business solutions provider.”
>> ZYNE Stock Zooms Over 50% This Week, What Next for Zynerba?
Now, it is blaming its poor results on CompuCom’s poorer than expected performance—with an operating loss of $15 million expected at this division. This is the result of lower-than-expected revenue from existing customer projects.
So what investors must be hearing is, the acquisition to turn things around has failed. It’s no surprise that on this news, this penny stock is falling. Is There a Light?
For those willing to wait this one out, the company is promising to take steps to ensure performance improves at CompuCom. It says it will take steps to improve speed and efficiency as well as “reorganizing its customer-facing staff.”
With management aware of the issue CEO Gerry Smith furthered: “CompuCom’s operating performance was clearly disappointing and the actions we are taking to improve its operations and sales performance are expected to yield improving results in 2019. “
Of course, investors would have heard similar promises made before. So can this penny stock prove itself or has the plan simply not worked out? What are your thoughts?"
"ZYNE Stock Zooms Over 50% This Week, What Next for Zynerba?",microsmallcap.com,Ankit Singhania,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://microsmallcap.com/zyne-stock-50-week/,"Apr 5, 2019 282 Views Ankit Singhania ZYNE Stock Zooms Over 50% This Week, What Next for Zynerba?
ZYNE stock continued to gain momentum in Friday’s session and was recently moving up by 10.36% to $8.53 USD, extending its winning streak for the fourth straight session. Shares of Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ZYNE) are up over 55% since April 2nd, 2019, as the FDA has started looking into how it might legalize CBD-laced food products.
Earlier this week, the agency announced it will hold its first public hearings on CBD on May 31st. Zygel Drives ZYNE Stock
The FDA approving cannabis-laced food products is a step in the right direction, expected to validate Zynerba Pharmaceuticals’ flagship product, Zygel. The company is positioning Zygel as a novel treatment for children and adolescents struggling with Fragile X syndrome.
As it stands, it is illegal for kids below the age of 18 to consume cannabis-infused products without consent. The only time that kids can use such products is when they are prescribed for medicinal purposes. Enter Your E-mail Address To Subscribe * indicates required Email Address *
If the FDA approves infusing cannabis into food products, Zynerba Pharmaceuticals will have an easier time targeting a broader market, especially in the treatment of adolescents struggling with Fragile X syndrome.
>> ACHN Stock Climbs After Achillion Pharmaceuticals’ Trial Fills Up Ladenburg’s Analyst Turns Bullish on ZYNE Stock
Michael Higgins, an analyst at Ladenburg, believes that FDA approving CBD-laced food products would go a long way in strengthening ZYNE stock in the sector.
“This would support the market adoption of Zynerba Zygel, a CBD gel treatment for children and adolescents with Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited learning disability and attention deficit disorder,” Higgins in a statement .
Higgins has since initiated coverage of ZYNE stock with a buy rating. The analyst remains confident that the stock will make a run for the $26 share mark given the opportunity at stake with the legalization of CBD laced food products.
Zynerba Pharmaceuticals has what it takes to do this. ZYNE has been on an impressive run after reporting impressive financials that indicated a period of strong clinical and corporate momentum in 2018.
The company achieved significant milestones last year, in particular with the development of Zygel for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome. With ZYNE stock currently trending upwards, traders should keep this one on the radar."

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) from a strong sell rating to a hold rating in a research report sent to investors on Tuesday, Zacks.com reports.
According to Zacks, “Autodesk’s profitability is expected to hurt from higher spending in the near term. The company’s on-going business model transition remains an overhang. Moreover, significant product concentration is a headwind. Autodesk will stop disclosing subscriptions and ARPS data on a quarterly basis, which doesn’t bode well for investors. Nevertheless, improving subscriptions and recurring revenues along with new customer wins is positive. Increasing adoption of BIM 360 solution is a key catalyst. Shares have outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis.” Get Autodesk alerts:

For decades, executives at Wynn Resorts hidden allegations of sexual misconduct as per a report by Massachusetts casino regulators released Tuesday.
The 200-page report from the nation’s Gaming Commission does not make a recommendation about its almost $ 3 billion Boston-area hotel slated to start in June because of the fate of this business’s Massachusetts casino license. Get alerts:
However, it said recent reforms exemplified by the firm — notably the resignation of Steve Wynn since CEO and the ousting of every official who knew about the allegations but neglected to report them do not”erase how the corporate failures revealed in this investigation are significant, insistent and reflective of their company’s historical governance practices.” Steve Wynn was not in attendance Tuesday and didn’t submit to interviews with investigators. He confessed in a statement to investigators he had”multiple consensual relationships” with employees while leading the firm, said Karen Wells, leader of the commission’s investigations unit, even as she broke down the report to the five-member gambling commission Tuesday.
Brian Kellya Boston-based lawyer who symbolizes Steve Wynn, worried his customer isn’t the focus of their hearings. Regulators are contemplating how long company officials were aware of the allegations and the way they responded, as opposed to the facts behind the claims.
“Mr. Wynn denies all allegations of nonconsensual sex and nothing within this report changes ,” Kelly said in a statement. “In actuality , the Commission and its researchers have acknowledged today that it is not their function to decide on the truth or falsity of these allegations and that Mr. Wynn’s conduct isn’t the focus of their hearing loss.”
The report has been released as the commission started a series of hearings this week on whether Wynn Resorts can continue to hold a country casino permit. The hearings, which will last from Wynn Resorts officials with further testimony, have consequences such as Encore Boston Harbor, the corporation’s Everett casino.
Casino officials Tuesday didn’t dispute the facts of the report, and new CEO Matthew Maddox told the commission he is”deeply remorseful” for the harm inflicted on the accusers.
“I am sorry that our business did not live up to its worth,” he explained in brief opening remarks to the commission. “The transformation that we have gone through and also the changes that we’ve made, I hope, will help all of you recover confidence in us. We want to make you joyful as a licensee in Massachusetts.”
The nation commission launched an investigation after The Wall Street Journal published a report chronicling allegations of sexual misconduct against Steve Wynn, many by health club employees and casino cocktail machines.
Nevada casino regulators, who handed down a record $20 million nice however enabled the company to keep its casino license reported by The Wall Street Journal plus a subsequent investigation Lots of the incidents detailed in the report of Tuesday.
Massachusetts regulators largely found company officials were aware of a number of the allegations but failed to report them or take steps. As it sought a casino license in 2013 wynn officials also failed to disclose to say regulators reached with a few of the accusers, the report found.
One of the incidents the organization didn’t disclose was just a $7.5 million settlement which Steve Wynn paid in 2005 to some former salon worker who alleged she would become pregnant after Wynn raped her.
A cocktail host was paid $975,000 at a private settlement after she alleged he had pressured her by steve Wynn. The company paid a $700,000 settlement in 2008 into another former cocktail host on a sexual relationship she had with Steve Wynn.
And into some cocktail waitress who alleged she had been raped by Steve Wynn in 2005, only weeks earlier Massachusetts would award the firm a casino permit, it paid $ 9,000 out in 2014. Business executives were also aware of at least three additional complaints from Steve Wynn from casino massage therapists researchers found.
Gambling commission members asked especially how her period at the Clinton administration, which confronted its misconduct scandals, compared to the crossroads Wynn Resorts today faces.
“It was a different time, but I’ll say that the private behaviour of leaders possess a tremendous effect on the organizations that they lead. That has been true 25 years back and it is true now,” said Myers, who is presently an executive at Warner Bros.. Entertainment. “One of the things we need to perform as a board will be to set a good example of how you can move forward. How do you choose a company which wants to be improved and make it easier “

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Responds to Claim She Used 'Fake' Accent: 'I am from the Bronx. I Act & Talk Like It',www.newsweek.com,newsweek.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-defends-her-criticized-fake-accent-friday-1387980,"On 4/5/19 at 7:45 PM EDT Share U.S.
New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke Friday at the National Action Network convention, and for all the praise she received for her message about taking pride in your work, she drew an equal amount of criticism for her accent.
Ocasio-Cortez, a first-term Democrat from the Bronx, offered a message to the working class through her speech, stressing that any work is good work. She reflected upon her days as a “proud” bartender, about which she declared, “ain’t nothing wrong with that.”
“There's nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “There is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat. There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work. There is nothing wrong with being a working person in the United States of America and there is everything dignified about it.”
It wasn’t her pitch itself that got people on social media stirred up about the speech, but rather the delivery. A number of critics of the congresswoman claimed Ocasio-Cortez was using a “fake African American accent” or faux ""Southern accent” at the convention, which reportedly had an audience made up largely of African Americans.
Ocasio-Cortez snapped back on Twitter Friday before the sun set in New York.
“As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time.”
“Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up. My Spanish is the same way. These conspiracy mills are [trash].”
Before the congresswoman defended herself, Twitter users aired their opinions.
The National Action Network was formed by Rev. Al Sharpton in 1991 to “promote a modern civil rights agenda that includes the fight for one standard of justice, decency and equal opportunities for all people,” according to its website .
Ocasio-Cortez's bartender comment follows a remark that President Donald Trump made earlier this week in reference to the Democrats’ proposed Green New Deal, a sweeping climate change and social justice and jobs bill the young representative sponsored in the House.
“The Green New Deal done by a young bartender, 29 years old,” President said at a fundraiser on Tuesday. “A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. The first time I heard it I said, ‘That's the craziest thing’”
The president asked Republicans to keep the Green New Deal alive and not squash it so he can run against it during a reelection campaign in 2020."
