"BIRTHDAY OF THE DAY: Bert Kaufman, head of corporate and regulatory affairs at Zoox",www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/playbook-birthday-bert-kaufman-1348507,"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “My birthday and anniversary are five days apart, and my wife Zoe and I are celebrating both in London, where we first met.”
How did you get your start in your career? “To make a long, very wonderful story short: The Sunday before Christmas in 1998, as a 16-year-old, I ensured that current LSU football radio spotter and then Sen. John Breaux’s state director Jim Nickel could go home from Walgreens -- where we found ourselves in line together -- with a Furby for each of his two young daughters. That Walgreens was the last place in Baton Rouge selling the robot, which was the hottest Christmas toy of the year, and they limited one purchase per customer. Nickel said his wife wouldn’t let him return home with only one. I was there to buy toiletries (not Furbies), so without knowing who he was, I helped him out and bought a Furby. After we walked out of the store, I gave him my Furby and he gave me his business card. We stayed in touch. That Furby led to an internship in Sen. Breaux’s office in 2001, which then led to many other amazing opportunities. I am grateful for that serendipitous encounter and his generosity. Today, the Furbies are collecting dust, and I am working with robots.”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “ ‘The Foul and the Fragrant’ by French historian Alain Corbin. It’s about the de-odorization of France between 1750-1880. It has some insightful policy and public health lessons that are still very relevant today.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn't get enough attention? “The growth of mega-cities and mega-regions means our continued reliance on single-occupancy, gasoline-powered cars becomes untenable.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “It's refreshing to work at a startup with colleagues who are low on ego and high on ability. That said, I think constantly about the most vulnerable among us, America’s standing in the world, the need for strategic plans to invest in education and innovation, and the importance of taking the long view.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “When I joined Zoox, I got licensed to be an autonomous vehicle test driver in California.”"
A DIY Border Wall Rises in the Desert - POLITICO Magazine,www.politico.com,Ben Schreckinger,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/31/a-diy-border-wall-rises-in-the-desert-227034,"How a MAGA Stunt Became a Very Real Border Wall How a pro-Trump internet stunt backed by Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach became a very real barrier.

Ben Schreckinger is a reporter for Politico.
SUNLAND PARK, N.M. — Down a bumpy dirt road, past a dozen “No Trespassing” signs, two amateur sentries in neon safety vests guarded the way to a giant symbol of Trump-era politics rising up from the Chihuahuan Desert.
After one of the guards Armando asked our business and radioed someone called Viper, telling him to “stand down,” we were waved through a makeshift checkpoint and onto the site where supporters of President Donald Trump have built hundreds of yards of border wall on private land overlooking the Rio Grande. Story Continued Below
What began in December as a quixotic online crowdfunding effort to get Trump’s promised “big, beautiful wall” built has turned into a physical barrier constructed under the direction of influential right-wing immigration opponents. On Wednesday, its backers demonstrated the wall to a handful of reporters, showing off the structure in all its steel-and-concrete glory ahead of an official ribbon-cutting ceremony on Thursday.
Its organizers insist their version of the wall is a feasible model for securing hundreds of miles of southern border. Its critics call it a xenophobic scam. The fact that the effort has gotten to this point at all suggests a different and broader truth: That in the Trump era, the line between a surreal stunt and an important political development can be extremely blurry.
On Wednesday, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach offered a tour of the wall — at one point scrambling over crumbling hillside to demonstrate the difficulty of passing the terrain — while negotiating with local officials over a permitting issue that threatened to derail construction.
At the same time, Kobach has been overseeing legal aspects of the project, now housed under a nonprofit called We Build the Wall, he has been negotiating with the White House over a possible appointment as the nation’s actual “immigration czar,” a potential newpost that could give him vast influence over the federal bureaucracy.
Last week, The New York Times reported a list of Kobach’s conditions for accepting the job, which included 24/7 access to a government plane and were reportedly viewed as presumptuous by some inside the administration. On Wednesday, Kobach defended those conditions. “If you're serious about solving this problem you've got to have a position that has the authority and the tools to solve the problem,” he told me.
He also said he is “99 percent” certain he knows who leaked the list, though he did not offer any names.
Kobach said he last spoke to Trump about the wall project in the Oval Office three weeks ago, and that the president drilled him on the technical specifications, expressing special interest in their model’s anti-climbing features, a set of horizontal steel plates covering the tops of the wall’s vertical slats. “Are you going to paint it?” Kobach recalled the president asking him.
The wall stands on the same stretch of border where an armed militia group , the United Constitutional Patriots, was recently detaining migrants as they enter the United States. Kobach and other leaders of the wall project said they are not associated with the militias and do not condone armed vigilante action. They argue that putting up walls will put such groups “out of business.”
But his disavowals have not been entirely embraced by the movement. “I don’t support that sort of activity—yet,” said conservative pundit David Clarke, a former sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, who works on public outreach for the project. “I’m real close,” said Clarke, who said that if there is not a more significant migration crackdown by the end of Trump’s first term, he would endorse vigilante action.
There also appears to be some intermingling of the militia group and the wall efforts. We Build the Wall has shared footage shot by the group online, and people associated with the group continue to make appearances at the site of the private wall project, despite intense scrutiny of the militia’s activities.
On Wednesday evening, Jim Benvie, previously the spokesman for the United Constitutional Patriots, and now with a splinter group called the Guardian Patriots, showed up at the construction site. Benvie took issue with the group being described as “militia” or “vigilante.” He said the groups operated legally and complained that media coverage of the groups had been misleading. “There is a big difference between carrying a gun and pointing a gun,” he said.
Further blurring the lines between government and private efforts, Border Patrol vehicles constantly whizzed around the property.
The contractor building the private wall section, Fisher Industries, is using it as a show project in the hope of winning government contracts. We Build the Wall organizers said they designed the wall with input from Border Patrol agents, whose charge includes patrolling private land on the border.
A spokesman for Customs and Border Patrol said that Fisher Industries had notified the agency of the project. “It is not uncommon for vendors to undertake demonstrations of their capabilities utilizing their own resources,” said the CBP spokesman. “ We encourage all interested vendors to compete for border barrier contracts through established mechanisms to ensure any construction is carried out under relevant federal authorities and meets USBP operational requirements for border barrier.”
Along with Benvie and various We Build the Wall organizers, members of the media, laborers, and assorted activists milled about amid heavy construction equipment as large SUVs and pickup trucks came and went around the sprawling site. The property abuts Monument One, a white obelisk that marks the point where Mexico, New Mexico and Texas all meet.
Jeff Allen, co-owner of the brick company that owns the land, patrolled the property but declined to be interviewed, saying his words had been “twisted every time” he spoke to the media.
Susan Moore, 56, a retired EMS worker, strode around the site with a .45 revolver strapped to her hip, collecting signatures for two petitions, one advocating a border wall and another opposing a New Mexico state measure to impose stricter background checks on gun purchases. Asked how she connected with the wall-builders, Moore, a member of a Tea Party-type group called New Mexico Patriots, offered just a one-word response. “Networking,” she said, and left it at that."
5 Ways Trump Has Remade the Democratic Party - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/31/trump-remade-democratic-party-227033,"For years, a growing stripe of Democrats has argued that what their party needs is a leader willing to shatter old assumptions, a radical disrupter.
Well, Democrats already have found their transformational figure for the 2020 campaign. His name is Donald Trump.
No one could miss the obvious ways this president—despite his deviations from traditional conservative orthodoxy—has turned the Republican Party into the pro-Trump party. It could be easy to miss, however, some of the less obvious ways Trump also has made himself the defining force of the anti-Trump party.
All presidents tend to reshape the politics of their era, sometimes in ways that long outlast their time in office. JFK’s mastery of television infused once-dowdy progressive politics with a measure of glamour that politicians spent decades emulating; Ronald Reagan’s success in using well-turned anecdotes and homilies to drive a conservative movement shapes the presidency to this day.
It is striking, though, how true this has been even in the 2020 Democratic primary, in which the competition is over which candidate can most credibly claim that he or she will not just beat Trump but repudiate all he stands for.
On stylistic and even substantive grounds, Trump is arguably exerting more gravitational pull on Democratic politics than the party’s most recent president, Barack Obama, who left its down-ballot infrastructure in tatters, and far more than another Democratic figure, Bill Clinton, who once could claim that he had remade the party in his own fashion.
From the once-unthinkable candidates vying to replace this president to their mimicry of his hard-punching way of politics, Democrats are showing that it is possible—even unavoidable—simultaneously to loathe Trump and be swept along by his disruptive current. Here’s how Trump has indelibly altered how Democrats run for president:
1. Anyone's Plausible
The most immediate way Trump is driving the Democratic debate is in the size of the presidential field—unprecedentedly large—and in its diversity, filled with candidates who surely would have flunked the plausibility test in an earlier time.
The threshold question confronting any candidate is basically a matter of imagination: Does it seem conceivable this person could really be president of the United States?
That question will never be the same in a Trump context. What is inconceivable compared to a reality-TV star and habitue of the New York tabloids with a decadeslong trail of financial and sexual controversies?
Virtually every top-tier candidate on the Democratic side is benefiting to some degree from Trump’s demolition of old standards of presidential plausibility. Not long ago, a 77-year-old small-state socialist would have been deemed inconceivable, but Bernie Sanders is not. So would a 37-year mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana, but Pete Buttigieg is not. Nor Texan Beto O’Rourke, who made few waves in three terms in Congress and did not win his statewide race. Nor Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Massachusetts law professor who didn’t run for office until she was in her 60s, nor Julián Castro, who in years past would find few takers that his time as HUD secretary was a likely path to commander in chief. Even the most conventional pol, former Vice President Joe Biden, would at age 76 three decades after his first presidential run be seen as a highly improbable contender.
Some version of, “Well, if Trump can win … ” is the principal engine behind the fact that there are two dozen candidates—a number that itself would have been wildly improbable. In fact, it is candidates with impressive traditional credentials—senators like Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet and governors like Jay Inslee and John Hickenlooper—who are struggling most to clear the give-me-a-break bar.
Trump’s example has not only broadened the standards of presidential qualifications, but is helping erase old lines about disqualifications—unofficial standards that were nonetheless primly enforced by political insiders and the news media. If O’Rourke’s presidential campaign flops, it won’t be because arrests (charges later dropped) for drunken driving and burglary from the 1990s were an obstacle to his campaign, nor is the fact that Kamala Harris once publicly dated a married man (then-San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown) around the same time. The more recent controversy over whether Biden is too handsy and familiar in ways that made some women uncomfortable has passed quickly. Never mind the phenomenon of Andrew Yang, whose geekiness would have made him a laughingstock in years past; or that of spiritual guru Marianne Williamson, who will likely make the debate stage along with sitting lawmaker Kirsten Gillibrand and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.
Simply put, it is impossible to imagine the current field or the broader story arc of the Democratic race so far were it not for Trump shattering traditional norms.
2. Cable Is King
Speaking of outdated norms, there was once a president who made it is his signature to boast about his dignified distance from the raucous uproars and obsessions du jour of the modern media cycle. That president was Obama, who struck a superior air while boasting constantly of his indifference to “cable chatter.”
But it is impossible to imagine Obama’s successor becoming president without his fixation with cable television—by many reports he watches several hours daily, and even records his favorite shows—and his mastery over how to manipulate the hyperaccelerated news cycle powered by the social media-cable ouroboros.
When Trump’s rise from noisy celebrity to presidential contender began four years ago, his path was cable—not simply the televised debates of 2015 and 2016, but the way his performances dominated channels for days afterward. Every Democratic presidential candidate, including Biden as front-runner, is acutely conscious of the need to perform well at cable debates starting next month, and along the way to demonstrate that they are capable of competing with Trump on equal terms in the general election battle of media narratives. No Democrat could credibly claim to be indifferent to “cable chatter,” or would regard that as something to boast about.
3. Message Discipline Is for Losers
Not long ago, one of the paramount tests of effective campaigns was “message discipline,” the ability to stay on one’s own themes and avoid getting dragged into the daily rumpus. Operatives worked to make sure their candidate always managed to seem “presidential”—that is, with a certain dignified reserve and detachment from the seamier parts of the business.
To paraphrase Ronald Reagan (“We are the change”) Trump can credibly boast: “I am the rumpus.”
And with the possible exception of Biden, there aren’t any top-tier candidates on the Democratic side laboring to stay above the fray.
This has a substantive component, seen in the way candidates jostle with each other to be first to break from the crowd on questions like whether Trump should be impeached or whether they endorse the “Green New Deal” unveiled by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Edward Markey. As a Washington Post writer recently noted , it used to be virtually unheard of for presidential candidates to attack corporations and their leaders by name. But following Trump’s lead, Democratic candidates routinely unload on such companies as Amazon, ExxonMobil and Facebook.
The stylistic dimension is even more vivid. Pre-Trump, operatives likely would have worried that Pete Buttigieg’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, was making a spectacle of himself on social media with his free associations about their pet dogs, his Harry Potter obsession, the guy drinking ginger ale next to him on an airline flight, as well as more reflective posts on what the campaign has meant to him. As it is, the candidate’s spouse’s fluency on Twitter makes him an important asset. O’Rourke is mocked in some quarters for livestreaming his haircut, but on balance his willingness to share his fascination with self on social media is considered a good thing. Even Elizabeth Warren is tweeting videos of throwing back beers or greeting her dog.
Trump has firmly set the precedent that if a thought is on his mind it is on his keyboard; even as most Democrats don’t emulate his regular stream of insults they are plainly in debt to his example. Understatement and reserve as signatures of a presidential style are in the past.
4. Deficits Don’t Matter
A few days before Obama was sworn in at his first inaugural, he gave an interview with the Washington Post during which he was at pains to emphasize his commitment to fiscal discipline. He announced a “fiscal responsibility summit” and, expanding on rhetoric from the campaign, said he was determined to address unsustainable costs to entitlement programs like Social Security “under my watch” rather than “kick the can down the road.”
That’s a reminder that even progressive leaders used to feel an obligation to match their appeals for expensive new domestic spending with furrowed-brow professions about how they realized there is a cost to everything. These statements were aimed not so much at conservatives but at moderates within the Democratic Party.
Trump has offered scant evidence rhetorically or substantively that he cares about budget deficits or entitlements costs. This has given Democratic presidential candidates a green light to blow off these questions, too. No top-tier Democrat is emphasizing deficit reduction or cost-control, and they are under no particular pressure from the media or voters to do so. Instead the competition is over who can present the most ambitious and pulse-quickening ideas—‘Medicare for All,’ free college, teacher raises, massive infrastructure investment and so on. That is a change from the environment faced by Hillary Clinton, Obama, John Kerry or Bill Clinton in their turns as nominees, and Democrats have Trump to thank.
5. Being a Uniter Is So Yesterday
Trump did not create the ultrapartisan politics with which he is so associated—this had been building for a quarter-century or more before his election. One difference with him, however, is that most of the time he never pays rhetorical deference to the notion of the presidency as a national unifier.
Every president from George H.W. Bush (“a kinder, gentler nation”) to Bill Clinton (who said he wanted to be “a repairer of the breach”) to George W. Bush (“I’m a uniter, not a divider”) to Obama (“There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; There’s the United States of America”) produced signature lines emphasizing the desire to bridge differences. Hillary Clinton called herself a “progressive who gets things done” by working with all sides.
This kind of rhetoric is largely absent from the Democratic contest. The partial exception, again, is Biden, and he is learning fast about the perils of offering himself as bridge-builder at a time when even many party moderates believe that Trump Republicans are so not on the level there is no point in trying to get along. His statement that Vice President Mike Pence is personally “a decent guy” caused an online uproar on the left and forced Biden to say he didn’t think Pence’s policies or politics were decent.
It was a reminder that Biden, probably more than any candidate, formed his political sensibilities in an earlier era—and long before many Democrats concluded that the right way to beat Trump is by embracing the reality that he has changed the way to run for president."
"POLITICO Playbook: Trump gambles with the global economy, and his own reelection",www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/05/31/trump-gambles-with-the-global-economy-and-his-own-reelection-442195,"President Donald Trump arrives to speak at the National Association of REALTORS Legislative Meetings and Trade Expo, on Friday, May 17. | Susan Walsh/AP Photo DRIVING THE DAY IN THE LAST 12 HOURS, President DONALD TRUMP and his White House took two distinct actions that throw the global trade order in flux and could significantly damage markets, sharply raise prices for U.S. consumers and impose steep political costs in D.C. and other capitals around the world.
NUMBER ONE: THE TARIFFS. The president has vowed to slap a 5% tariff on all goods from Mexico in June unless it helps stop undocumented immigrants from coming into the United States. Here’s how WaPo explains it: Tariffs “would increase in size until all illegal immigration across the border halts, though that scenario has never occurred in modern U.S. history. … The tariffs would then increase by 5 percent on the first day of each month, starting on July 1.” The tariffs could hit as high as 25%.
-- ANNIE KARNI, ANA SWANSON and MIKE SHEAR on NYT A1: “An across-the-board tariff on all Mexican goods would exact a serious toll on American consumers and corporations, and is likely to generate significant opposition among businesses. Rufus Yerxa, the president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents the nation’s largest exporters, called the move ‘a colossal blunder.’ …
“Mexico is Washington’s largest trading partner, sending across the border items like tomatoes, cars and rugs. Mexico sent the United States $346.5 billion of goods last year — meaning that a 5 percent tariff on those products would amount to a tax increase of more than $17 billion. Most of the costs would then be passed on to businesses and consumers.” NYT
-- ANDRÉS MANUEL LÓPEZ OBRADOR, Mexico’s president, issued a stern warning in a letter saying this, via AP: “López Obrador said late Thursday in a public letter addressed to Trump that ‘social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures,’ and alluded to the United States’ history as a nation of immigrants: ‘The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol.’
“López Obrador wrote that Mexico is doing its part to avoid migration through its territory as much as possible, without violating human rights. The Mexican leader also urged Trump to ‘please, remember that I do not lack valor, that I am not a coward nor timorous but rather act according to principles.’” AP … AMLO’s letter to Trump, in Spanish
-- U.S. OPPOSITION RISING … SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IOWA), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said this Thursday evening: “Trade policy and border security are separate issues. This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump’s and what could be a big victory for the country.”
-- THE MARKETS’ EARLY REACTION, via WSJ’s Nathan Allen: “Auto makers and their suppliers, which are highly exposed to trade fluctuations, were among Europe’s biggest losers. The autos and parts subindex of the Stoxx Europe 600 was down 2.5%. …
“U.S. futures pointed to opening declines on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated to open around 1% lower, erasing Thursday’s modest gains. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys declined to 2.172% from 2.227% on Thursday, hitting a fresh 20-month low. … Yields and prices move in opposite directions.” WSJ
WHAT EVERYONE’S ASKING: COULD TRUMP BE BLUFFING? Maybe, yeah. But honestly, we don’t know, and in the political and economic sphere, it would be irresponsible to believe he is bluffing -- given what’s at risk. We are told he likes tariffs because they can be enacted unilaterally and pulled back on demand. The president has left himself wiggle room: He is the sole arbiter of the standard he set for imposing the new tariffs -- whether Mexico is doing enough to curb illegal immigration.
AND THAT ALL BRINGS US TO NUMBER TWO: THE USMCA. It’s fair to ask whether the tariffs have killed the president’s proposed trade deal with Mexico and Canada, which the White House says is his top legislative priority. Many analysts are saying this already. But we don’t know the answer to that, so let’s leave it aside for now.
If the USMCA had a chance before the tariffs, the White House did itself no favors Thursday when it took a move to significantly annoy Speaker NANCY PELOSI , the only lawmaker who matters when it comes to Trump getting a vote on the USMCA.
BREAKING IT DOWN …
-- THE WHITE HOUSE on Thursday evening started the clock on passing the USMCA . That means Congress would receive the deal for consideration in 30 days, and has to ratify it by the end of September -- 120 days. It’s a pressure tactic.
-- UP UNTIL NOW, U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer and the White House have been deferential to PELOSI, who controls the floor -- and the fate of this agreement. That strategy has, for the most part, worked so far.
-- PELOSI was getting ready to appoint Democratic negotiators to talk to Lighthizer about their concerns with the agreement -- something the White House had been pushing for weeks. Congressional aides were supposed to head to Mexico next week to talk with the government there about trade. Lighthizer and Pelosi seemed to be in agreement that they wouldn’t start the clock until the working groups were formed and the conversations between USTR and Democrats had started.
-- THINGS LOOKED GOOD FOR TRUMP, but suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, the White House tried to jumpstart the process by submitting the statement of administrative action -- which Pelosi had urged the White House not to do.
-- ELEMENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- including Marc Short, the VP’s chief of staff -- had pushed for a more aggressive stance in getting the trade deal passed.
WHAT HAPPENS NOW? WHO KNOWS. Pelosi said Thursday evening that the White House’s decision to start the clock indicated “a lack of knowledge on the part of the administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement.” House Democrats feel like this deal -- as written -- is toothless, lacking enforcement provisions Democrats had been demanding. One aide told us it was “worse than NAFTA” without the changes Democrats were seeking.
-- WE ASKED A SENIOR DEMOCRATIC AIDE what the implications for the trade deal were after the Trump administration tried to speed up the process. They said this: “I don’t think I can answer all of that right this moment. It’s clearly a setback for the USMCA.”
“THEY’RE TRYING TO SPEED UP a process that is not complete,” the Democratic aide told us Thursday evening before Trump announced his tariff gambit.
THIS SHOULD GUIDE YOUR THINKING …
-- LET’S SEE HOW THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT REACTS to the Trump tariff plan. Until now, they’ve cooperated and played nice with Trump. But they might decide that, for now, the political cost of completing the USMCA with this president is too steep, and the deal should get shelved. Jorge Guajardo, the former Mexican ambassador to China, told us this: “There will be no political will in Mexico to do Trump’s bidding.”
-- IF THE USMCA ISN’T DEAD, AUGUST IS THE REAL DEADLINE -- not September. There’s a widespread recognition among Republicans that if they do not get the USMCA through before August recess, it is dead. Period. This will make for a wild few weeks.

“Ms. Merkel, in her 13th year as chancellor and widely regarded as the leader of Western Europe, never mentioned President Trump by name in the commencement keynote speech. But she laid out a worldview that showed her deep differences both with his administration and the forces of right-wing populism that have emerged in Europe and elsewhere. And she did so on America’s most prominent academic stage.” NYT

Democrats roll out $90 million super PAC aimed at swing states,www.politico.com,MARC CAPUTO,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/democrats-super-pac-swing-states-1348502,"The nation’s largest super PAC devoted to grassroots Democratic turnout is launching its organizing efforts earlier than ever in seven swing states with a new campaign director and its largest budget to date: $80 million to $90 million.
For Our Future announced Friday that it’s hiring former President Barack Obama’s onetime Florida campaign chair, Ashley Walker, to coordinate its swing-state operations with the goal of identifying and turning out Democratic-leaning 2020 voters, namely people of color and so-called “sporadic voters” who don’t frequently cast ballots.
The committee, which was started in 2016 and historically has been funded by labor unions and billionaire climate change activist Tom Steyer, plans to build a network of 4,000 paid staff and an army of volunteers in Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, states where it operated in 2018 and 2017.
“Over the cycles, we’ve gotten smarter and better at what we do,” Walker said. “For Our Future builds state-based capacity to effect change at the electoral and community level. And we run our organization with the same standards as a presidential campaign.”
When it started three years ago, with a budget of $50 million, For Our Future hit the ground six months before the presidential election, only to see Donald Trump clean up in most big swing states. In the 2017 Virginia governor’s race and in other swing states during the 2018 cycle, For Our Future organized earlier, spent more and produced far better results.
This cycle, the group plans to start contacting Democratic primary voters later this year — before the first votes are cast in the party’s 2020 primaries and caucuses.
For Our Future operates in tandem with a “dark money” political nonprofit called For Our Future Action Fund that doesn’t have to disclose donors.
With a mission of having person-to-person interactions with voters, For Our Future differs from most other super PACs, which are devoted to running TV and digital ads to turn out voters. While For Our Future utilizes digital ads and mailers, its mission revolves around on-the-ground staffers and grassroots volunteers meeting voters personally at their homes. The group says it knocked on 10.2 million doors in 2018.
One reason the group was founded was that Republican-aligned groups, specifically those allied to the Koch brothers, were enjoying an asymmetrical advantage in election fundraising and organizing that Democrats were unable to match. As with conservative donors, there was a growing appetite among progressive contributors who wanted more of a say in how their money was spent outside the political party structure.
For large donors, Walker’s bona fides as a member of Obama’s campaign team that twice won Florida made her the perfect choice to be the swing state campaigns director of For Our Future. In the 2016 and 2018 cycles, Walker led the organization‘s Florida efforts.
“Ashley is a battle-tested leader and I’m thrilled she will be at the helm of FOF’s battleground effort,” said Heather Hargreaves, executive director of Steyer’s longtime organization, NextGen. “For Our Future is one of the most effective and important progressive grassroots organizations in the country, and their work will be integral to the 2020 outcome.”
Of the seven swing states For Our Future is targeting, Trump won five — Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But because of Trump’s large win in Ohio, more than 8 percentage points, Democrats have increasingly viewed the Buckeye State as less winnable.
Trump’s second-largest victory among those swing states was far smaller — 1.2 points in Florida, a state that Trump’s 2020 campaign views as critical to his reelection chances. In the other Rust Belt states, Trump won by less than a percentage point."
Kirsten Gillibrand’s Failure to Launch,www.politico.com,John F. Harris,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/31/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-democratic-campaign-president-primary-podcast-227032,"HAMPTON, New Hampshire—Kirsten Gillibrand is only asking for a dollar.
It’s not that she couldn’t use more money. In the first quarter of 2019, the junior senator from New York raised just $3 million for her presidential campaign, the weakest haul of the six senators running at that time and arguably one of the most disappointing totals of anyone in the sprawling Democratic field. Given her anemic polling since entering the race, Gillibrand’s feeble fundraising performance fanned skepticism about her viability to earn a nomination that Democrats believe will require close to $100 million in hard money raised.
But at this point, Gillibrand isn’t focused on winning the primary. She’s worried about surviving the next few months.
Despite a soaring national profile in the U.S. Senate, Gillibrand has failed to achieve liftoff as a presidential prospect. She has not broken 2 percent in a single national poll since officially declaring her candidacy in mid-March, and her 0.4 percent average in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of surveys places her behind the likes of Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard and even geeky long shot Andrew Yang.
Her bigger problem is fundraising. To secure a spot in the first double-header of Democratic primary debates in late June, candidates must meet two thresholds: surpassing 1 percent in three recognized national polls and collecting 65,000 unique campaign contributions. Gillibrand has checked the first box, however unimpressively. Yet the second mission remains unaccomplished. With the debates closing in—and with even quixotic candidates such as self-help guru Marianne Williamson hitting the 65,000-donor mark—Gillibrand is under the gun. The Democratic National Committee is limiting the total number of participants to 20. She could (and likely will) qualify by meeting the polling threshold only. But given the late gusher of contenders entering the fray, her place on stage can be guaranteed only by growing her donor ranks—and quickly.
Which brings Gillibrand to the climax of her stump speech. It’s the second weekend of May, she’s addressing a standing room-only crowd at a micro-pub four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and the senator has finally hit her stride. Whether it’s the booze flowing from the taps or some other environmental factor— OK, it’s the booze —this has been Gillibrand’s best event of the day. Her talking points are sharp. Her jokes are well executed. Her audience is energized and engaged. Candidates typically fade late in a long day on the campaign trail, but Gillibrand has gotten stronger. The voters are hanging on her every word—about reforming the EPA, battling the NRA, encouraging national service programs and confronting Russian aggression. Finally, Gillibrand decides, it’s time to make the ask.
“For anyone here, if you like what you’ve heard tonight, I want to earn my place on the debate stage. I can’t do it unless you send a dollar—literally, really ,” Gillibrand says, shaking her head as though to acknowledge the oddity of this request. “The measure is for anyone who wants to be on the debate stage, you need to get 65,000 individual supporters. So please go to KirstenGillibrand.com and just send a dollar. It will help me get to the debate stage.”
Gillibrand isn’t the only 2020 hopeful who has resorted to this method. Tim Ryan’s website features pop-up advertisements asking for $1. And Michael Bennet’s spots on social media make an identical solicitation.
But that’s Tim Ryan and Michael Bennet—an obscure congressman and low-profile senator, respectively. Ryan’s chief claim to relevance is being slaughtered by Nancy Pelosi as the sacrificial lamb who challenged her in the speaker’s race on behalf of disgruntled House Democrats after the 2016 election. Bennet has done little to distinguish himself as a senator and won his Colorado seat in 2010 only because the GOP snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, nominating a self-destructive Tea Party candidate whom Bennet managed to defeat by some 30,000 votes.
Gillibrand plays in a different league—or at least, she was supposed to.
***
A Dartmouth-educated lawyer who worked in corporate law before clerking on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Gillibrand gained national attention upon entering the political arena for possessing a rare combination of big brains, telegenic looks and personal magnetism. Her storming of a conservative upstate New York congressional district in 2006 announced her arrival as a player in Washington, and it was little surprise when, a few years later, after Hillary Clinton’s appointment as secretary of state, Gillibrand was tapped to replace her in the Senate. After winning her own full term in 2012—racking up the largest statewide victory in the history of New York politics—Gillibrand set about overhauling her political brand.
It wouldn’t be easy to shed the image responsible for her House victories—that of a down-home, gun-friendly, anti-amnesty, culturally conservative Democrat who identified with her rural constituents more than with the party’s coastal elite. But slowly, methodically, Gillibrand did just that, smartly picking and choosing fights that would burnish her populist progressive bona fides while elevating her national stature. She co-directed the effort that banned insider trading among members of Congress. She was an integral part of the campaign to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that governed gays in the military. She introduced pioneering legislation aimed at ensuring paid family leave. And she became Washington’s leading voice on sexual assault, first by focusing on cases in the military and then broadening to harness the energy generated by the #MeToo movement.
All the while, she raised tens of millions of dollars, wrote a New York Times bestseller and was named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people in the world.
As it became clear that Gillibrand was preparing to launch a campaign for the presidency in 2020, the only question seemed to be the height of the senator’s ceiling. Could she win the Democratic nomination? And if so, could she succeed where her friend and former mentor, Hillary Clinton, failed four years earlier?
Today, the question is whether Gillibrand can get off the floor.
In a conversation for POLITICO’s “Off Message” podcast, the New York senator vacillated between insinuating that she is being treated differently because of her gender and arguing that Americans are ready for a female president.
“Hillary won the election. She won the popular vote by 3 million votes, and you have to remember, she was definitely the most qualified candidate we’d ever had running for president,” Gillibrand says. “And, but for Russia, but for Comey, but for misogyny, but for a lot of things, she would have won. So, I believe that of course this country is ready to elect a woman president, but they need to know what we’re running on and what we’re for, and why we’re running and why we think we’re the best candidate.”
Yet Gillibrand has struggled to communicate this to voters. Things have gotten so grim for her that recently, a high-ranking campaign aide to Cory Booker—Gillibrand’s opponent for the Democratic nomination—tweeted that she had donated to the New York senator’s campaign and encouraged others to follow suit. This was done, the aide noted, to ensure that Gillibrand’s “important perspective is on the debate stage.” To other Democrats, this looked less like an act of short-term benevolence than one of long-term strategy: The historically large field will soon begin to be winnowed, and when it does, some of the surprising early exits will make for valuable endorsements. No name has surfaced in those conversations of late more frequently than Gillibrand.
How did it come to this? How did one of America’s best-financed senators come to rely on charity and presidential pan-handling, begging for a dollar at a time just to stay alive? How did one of Washington’s most recognizable women find herself buried in the polls beneath a number of less prominent men? And how does she breathe life into her campaign before it’s too late?
Politico Magazine analysis, 5/30/19, Getty and AP Images
Gillibrand and I discussed this, and much more, while having lunch in Manchester, in the car while driving to Goffstown and over a beer during her final stop of the day in Hampton.
Gillibrand claims, like all candidates do, that she’s having the time of her life campaigning for the highest office in the land. And yet her cheerful demeanor cannot mask the annoyance she is feeling—with the media, with the gender dynamics central to the race, and with the Democratic Party itself.
Gillibrand clearly doesn’t think much of the DNC’s rules governing the debates. Even before the national party announced the stricter criteria candidates would need to meet to qualify for the third and fourth debates this fall—effectively putting an expiration date on more than half of the Democratic candidacies—Gillibrand took issue with the emphasis on early polling to shape a process that has commenced far earlier that it once did.
“The last couple of presidential candidates who were Democrats who won, or even are nominees, you had to look at where they were at this early stage. I think somebody looked up where Bill Clinton was at this stage. He had 1 percent in the polls and had 30 percent name recognition in Iowa. So, like, it takes time,” Gillibrand said. “And with 20 candidates, it might actually take longer … because for each one of us to have a chance to be heard it’s going to take time. I mean, even the debates alone, if we get more than five minutes each on that stage, that’ll be surprising. So, you’re really even not even going to have more than a few minutes to talk about what you’re for and why you’re running and what your views are for the country.”
Gillibrand argues that both of the debate thresholds, polling and unique contributions, “are related to name recognition.” But she certainly is better known than the likes of Yang, or Williamson, or Gabbard, or Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, the latest 2020 candidate to “double qualify” by reaching both qualification milestones. Working the referees this early isn’t a sign of strategic savvy; it’s a sign of desperation.
Asked about the pressure she’s feeling, Gillibrand said it’s “created because of the DNC’s framework that they’ve put the candidates under,” which she suggests isn’t the “natural” or “normal” role for a national party. Asked whether she disagrees with the DNC’s rules, she replied, “I’m not sure. I don’t know that they’re serving the public well.”
Meanwhile, compounding Gillibrand’s frustration is her fraught relationship with the political issue that has defined her ascent: gender.
When I asked whether it was problematic to have so many white men—Beto O’Rourke, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg—soaking up the media spotlight, she replied, “Yeah, I think it’s problematic. …. We have amazing women candidates, amazing candidates of color, and hopefully through this process we will lift our voices up and be heard.”
The look on her face when I mentioned O’Rourke’s appearance on the cover of Vanity Fair was beyond description. “Unusual,” she finally mustered, biting her lip and her tongue at once, a litany of curse words no doubt suppressed underneath her smirk. “Never seen it before.”
And when I asked Gillibrand to name the worst part of running for president, she replied, “I don’t want to tell you.” She added that “it’s not an appropriate thing for me to say,” then promised to tell me later, off the record.
After hearing the off-the-record answer, I pressed for a sanitized version, which she offered in the most measured of tones. “The one thing that’s annoying to me is how many times reporters ask you about our male colleagues. Who cares? I’m running for president. I want to tell you what my vision is, why I’m running, and why I’m going to win,” she said. “I think reporters like yourself, who are super smart and super careful, will always ask me what I think about the male colleagues. Are you asking the male colleagues what they think about us? Probably not.”
The one thing that’s annoying to me is how many times reporters ask you about our male colleagues. Who cares? I’m running for president. I want to tell you what my vision is, why I’m running, and why I’m going to win,” Gillibrand said. “Are you asking the male colleagues what they think about us? Probably not.”
This is the hang-up of Gillibrand’s campaign. Never has the Democratic electorate been more exercised by issues of identity, and never has gender been more central to the national conversation—politically, culturally, socioeconomically and otherwise. And yet Gillibrand, despite having very little to lose at this point, remains cautious in interviews and on the stump—aiming for broad appeal instead of a niche brand, trying to draw in support from every cell of the party rather than cultivating a base and building out.
At every stop in New Hampshire, the senator was careful to modulate her answers and her tone in ways that would render her universally acceptable. She talks of how she dominated the blue boroughs of New York City—but also how she carried the state’s red, rural counties. She believes Trump is a “coward”—but she wants to calm the vitriolic nature of our politics. Gillibrand didn’t shy away from a single proposal—whether it was expanding the Supreme Court, increasing funding for indigenous groups or signing a breast cancer-related pledge—that voters asked her about.
Yet when it came to addressing the gender bias she believes is inherent to politics—a belief shared by many younger progressive women, a sizable chunk of the Democratic coalition—Gillibrand held back. Had her off-the-record answer been published, it would have gone viral overnight, racking up hundreds of thousands of clicks and instantly erasing any concerns about her small-donor disparity. But Gillibrand chose to be careful. Having won in a red district, having persuaded older, whiter, Republican audiences to support her in the past, she believes she can do so again.
***
The problem for Gillibrand is , the polls and the fundraising numbers show that this cautious approach isn’t getting her anywhere. The over-50 male demographic in Iowa and New Hampshire is likely to lean toward candidates such as Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, or perhaps even Elizabeth Warren, whose paeans to economic populism resonate with the dwindling remnant of blue-collar Democrats. The market Gillibrand was poised to corner—after becoming Washington’s leading voice on women’s rights issues and embracing the risk of calling for Al Franken’s resignation from the Senate—was that of the young, female voters who have mobilized the backlash to Donald Trump’s presidency.
Instead, in an overflowing field with more than 20 candidates slicing and dicing the electorate every which way, Gillibrand seems to believe that she can’t afford to alienate any one bloc of voters.
If the recent controversies surrounding new state-based abortion laws are any indication, it’s a tactical misreading of the race. Gillibrand’s forceful denunciations, on social media and cable news programs, earned her more free media coverage than anything else since the launch of her campaign. It was a reminder that she is more comfortable than any of the other Democrats in speaking to women’s issues, having not only mastered the messaging but worked extensively on the policies regarding everything from pay equality to workplace discrimination.
In that instance, Gillibrand seized the opportunity to gain headlines and eyeballs—and most likely, campaign donations—by owning an issue of visceral importance to what should be her core base of supporters.
Still, she seems conscious of doing so infrequently, wary of being typecast as a single-issue candidate. In a vacuum, for a generic Democratic woman candidate hoping to defeat Trump in a November election, it’s not necessarily a bad idea to downplay the talk of glass ceilings. And yet, for a female Democratic candidate like Gillibrand, whose image is heavily colored by her fights for gender equality, winning the party’s nomination—and the right to challenge Trump—might require a greater reliance on her identity.
This is the paradox of Gillibrand’s candidacy. She believes, as do many of her Democratic rivals, that voters want “electability” in a nominee—someone who above all else will defeat Trump in 2020. And she does have a case to make in that regard: As a former upstate congresswoman, she does have a feel for the nonideological challenges facing rural and poor America. And at her core, layers beneath the questions about her political evolution, she is inherently relatable, someone who quotes Scripture as easily as she sips a beer or rocks a baby.
But Gillibrand’s emphasis on long-term electability may be coming at the expense of her short-term viability. She has chosen not to pursue with reckless abandon the demographic that should be her core constituency in the primary—women—believing it would limit her appeal to other portions of the electorate. And she has ignored suggestions that she change course and act with more urgency in this regard, telling me, “I need to be patient, and know that it’s going to take time and hard work. … Your poll numbers are irrelevant today. What matters is where you are a year from now.”
The problem facing Gillibrand is, poll numbers at this stage of a presidential primary have never been more relevant to the outcome—and if she doesn’t do something drastic to improve hers, she won’t be around a year from now."
Inside Romney's Trump strategy,www.politico.com,BURGESS EVERETT,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/romney-profile-1348092,"When asked about Republicans’ criticism of his occasional anti-Trump stances, Mitt Romney doesn’t miss a beat: “I have to show you something.”
He grabs his iPad and pulls up an article: “Romney: why the Republican pros distrust him.” It’s a 1964 Look Magazine profile about his father, George, a former moderate governor of Michigan, which claims that “party people are troubled by what he says.”
Mitt Romney’s point is simple: Drawing GOP crossfire is essentially part of the Romney family business.
With both a pledge to be independent and membership in a party that demands support for President Donald Trump at every turn, the junior senator from Utah faces a squeeze on essentially every major vote he takes and each response to Trump’s controversies.
Romney has voted this year against Trump more than most other Senate Republicans, torpedoed Herman Cain’s chances on the Federal Reserve and even defended former President Barack Obama. Yet he still broadly supports Trump’s agenda and is with him far more often than not.
“People on the left: ‘You’re not hard enough on the president.’ People on the right: ‘You’re too hard on the president.’ The lane that I’ve chosen has almost no one in it,” a chuckling Romney says during a 30-minute interview in his Washington office. “There’s a long history and a family trait of saying what you believe and not worrying about what other people think.”
Though Romney is less tempestuous than former Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the Utah senator has brought something similar to the Senate. Like McCain, Romney is a former GOP presidential nominee whose comments carry far more weight than the average senator. And Romney enjoys a similarly tense relationship with the president.
Romney unleashed an op-ed critical of Trump just two days before he was sworn into the Senate, then quickly sought to fight off the government shutdown over Trump’s wall. Since then, Romney has settled into his self-proclaimed one-man lane, quickly mending fences with irked GOP colleagues, making the media rounds and working on bipartisan legislation.
He even says he’s likely to run for another term, a rebuttal to those in the Capitol who privately wonder if he’s on some sort of a six-year kamikaze mission against Trump. Instead, he says he's hoping to make huge breakthroughs on issues such as immigration and the national debt that have eluded Congress for decades.
At his core, Romney is not an explicit Trump foe, though he doesn’t enjoy the spur-of-the-moment phone calls or personal attention that most Republicans senators do. Romney also won’t yet support Trump’s reelection campaign. He says Trump is essentially ensured the Republican nomination, but calls his challenger Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, a “terrific guy.”
Yet Romney is also no Justin Amash, the first Republican to back impeaching the president, and doesn’t support removing Trump from office. His advice to the Democrats is to “let the American people decide” in the 2020 election.
“I don’t think he wakes up in the morning and figures out how to be a counterbalance to the president,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).
Indeed, Romney supports Trump’s tough-on-China policies and his hawkish stance toward Iran, gushes about the Trump economy and has voted for almost all of the president’s nominees.
“He’s by and large followed the Republican playbook. So I’ll be with him. The places where I’m not with him from time to time will be matters of conduct or communication that I think are highly divisive or misogynistic or anti-immigrant,” Romney says of Trump. “In places like that, I think it’s important for my own personal integrity to stand up and say, ‘No, I disagree with that.’”
Romney paused for a moment, then finished: “Maybe it will influence his thinking. Probably not. But it will certainly allow me to be true to the things I believe.”
This may be the most Democrats can wish for from a Republican senator.
“It’s refreshing how independent minded he is,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who traveled to the Middle East with Romney and runs a Foreign Relations subcommittee with him. Romney “agrees with the president on a lot. He just doesn't view it as his sacred responsibility to agree with the president on everything.”
Romney’s op-ed lighting into Trump’s character drew immediate ire from his colleagues and even his niece, GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. “Jeff Flake on steroids,” wrote Georgia Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). But that controversy cooled as Romney established himself as a relatively quiet presence behind closed doors, according to GOP senators. He's seeking to have individual meetings with all 100 senators and has already completed more than 60.
And he's in a good enough mood to frequently relay his oddball and sometimes corny sense of humor. After predicting Trump would easily win the Republican nomination, Romney then explodes into hearty laughter after delivering this line: “I do know who the Democratic nominee is going to be. But I’m not telling you.”
“I’m having fun,” Romney says of his short time as a senator.
But Romney has shown that even with his upbeat attitude, he can take serious action. He was the leading senator against Cain, called Trump to personally inform him he wouldn’t support his national emergency declaration and opposed a judicial nominee who had dubbed Obama an “un-American imposter.” In a March White House meeting with the president, Romney criticized Trump's tariffs on U.S. allies.
It’s not difficult to imagine Romney at some point becoming a headache for GOP leaders.
“He is very independent. And I get that. And I guess the only thing [is] that we always want to make sure that people are communicating to each other their positions,” said Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the party whip.
“Sen. Romney is a very sophisticated, very polite sort of guy. And I’m sure the president’s style rankles him,” said one Republican senator. But Romney’s anti-Trump votes haven’t “made the difference in the outcome. That’s where people start to get a little sensitive.”
The Utah senator has not been the deciding vote against a key party priority the way McCain was on Obamacare repeal. That’s kept some Democrats’ praise for Romney in check.
“He’s given me a lot of hope that he will chart an independent course,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). “I have to tell you I had a lot of dashed hopes and high expectations from my Republican colleagues that have been unfulfilled.”
Animating his independent streak, Romney harbors little internal ambition within the Senate power structure. He doesn’t want to be the chairman of the party’s campaign arm, though he’s donating to colleagues and offering to campaign for whomever he can help.
Romney is preoccupied by larger issues: Balancing the budget, immigration reform and climate change. If there’s political capital for Romney to earn and spend during his time as a senator, it will be there, not necessarily on poking the president to earn a quick headline.
He's able to assume his stance because his constituents are conservatives, but not emphatically pro-Trump. At town halls, he asks constituents to raise their hands if he’s too easy on Trump and then if he’s too hard on him: Voters’ responses are usually split down the middle.
“People look around the room and say: ‘Oh, we don’t all think the same way here.’ And you know, there are some people who support my approach, there are others that don’t,” Romney said. A Salt Lake Tribune poll showed Romney's stance of standing up to Trump at times has a 54 percent approval rate in the state.
Romney’s outlook and courting of Democrats suggests that he can see himself serving well into the post-Trump era.
As governor of Massachusetts, Romney was able to take care of his goals in one term before retiring. Now as the 97th-most senior senator, Romney understands it might take a good deal more time to finish his Senate checklist.
“If I get everything done in one term, well, I’ll probably not be looking for another term,” Romney said. “But it’s very unlikely. So it’s far more likely that I’ll be here more than one term given the agenda that I have."""
Battle over New Jersey’s tax incentive program spreads to Congress,www.politico.com,MATT FRIEDMAN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2019/05/31/battle-over-new-jerseys-tax-incentive-program-spreads-to-congress-1032355,"TRENTON, N.J. — New Jersey Democratic Rep. Donald Norcross is trying to downplay his role in creating a controversial tax incentive program that is roiling state politics — a program that benefited a company and nonprofit run by and tied to his brother, South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, and that generated business for a law firm run by his other brother, Philip.
Donald Norcross has maintained in recent months that, as a state senator, he was just one of dozens of co-sponsors of the bill that created the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013. While it’s true Donald Norcross was one of more than three dozen lawmakers who either sponsored or co-sponsored the final legislation, statements issued by his office now stand in stark contrast to the way he and his representatives talked about his role a few years ago.
“[The congressman] remains proud of the fact that he joined with almost every other member of the Legislature to support a program that is bringing so much positive change to Camden,” Dan Fee, a spokesperson for Donald Norcross, said in a recent statement to POLITICO. (A request for comment from Donald Norcross sent directly to his main campaign press email was answered by Fee.)
But in a February 2014 press release , Donald Norcross boasted that he had “led the charge” in getting the now-controversial bill passed.
When POLITICO, in an article published in January , cited Donald Norcross’ own words, his attorney pushed back aggressively, complaining the story gave the impression he was the lead sponsor rather than one of many.
The congressman’s actions now serve to put distance between himself and the tax incentive program his brother, George, has championed and which his companies have benefited from. The program, which has approved more than $7 billion in corporate tax breaks since 2013, is under scrutiny by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who has questioned whether the program has succeeded in bringing jobs to New Jersey or hobbled state revenue for decades to come.
Norcross is often mentioned by New Jersey Democrats as a potential U.S. Senate candidate should there be a vacancy — a prospect that arose in 2017 when Sen. Bob Menendez , the state’s senior senator, faced a corruption trial, and now, as Sen. Cory Booker runs for president.
In the House, he began climbing the ranks within days of taking office in November 2014, getting a coveted appointment to the House Democrats' Steering and Policy Committee, which helps shape the party’s policies and committee assignments. As a candidate running in New Jersey’s heavily Democratic 1st Congressional District that he was certain to win in 2014, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid personally fundraised for him.
The Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, signed by former Republican Gov. Chris Christie, established New Jersey’s current tax incentive programs and greatly expanded the tax breaks the state‘s Economic Development Authority awards to either attract new businesses to the state or keep those already in New Jersey from leaving.
But a task force appointed by Murphy earlier this year has shined a spotlight on the programs. During a May 2 hearing in Newark, the task force revealed alleged insider dealing and said it was targeting companies linked to George Norcross that claimed they would move jobs out of state to qualify for hundreds of millions in tax breaks though they allegedly had no real plans to do so.
In all, hundreds of companies have received billions in tax breaks. But the moves by the Murphy task force to zero in on several companies linked to George Norcross have erased any veneer of civility in the already tense relationship between the governor and South Jersey Democrats, who control the largest voting bloc in the 120-member Legislature and count Senate President Steve Sweeney as one of their leaders.
The Norcross family — the most politically powerful in New Jersey — is at the center of the controversy.
George Norcross, an insurance broker, is Sweeney’s political patron. Another Norcross brother, Philip, runs a law firm that, according to documents Murphy‘s task force and the New York Times publicized, wrote key language in the tax incentive law that allegedly benefited the firm's clients. Those clients included Conner Strong & Buckelew — the insurance firm run by George Norcross — along with two other companies that are about to move into a new shared headquarters on Camden’s waterfront.
In the months leading up to the task force’s first hearing in March, Bill Tambussi, an attorney for Donald Norcross, complained in an email that the Jan. 25 story POLITICO published had misrepresented Norcross’ role in crafting the law, including that he had “led the charge” for its passage.
Tambussi called the roughly 40-word passage in the more than 1,600-word story a “gratuitous inclusion of certain negative references to Congressman Norcross” written to “further some undisclosed agenda.”
He also stressed that Norcross was “one of 39 bipartisan sponsors” of the bill and stated — incorrectly — that state Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) was a primary sponsor in the upper house.
Norcross was one of four primary sponsors of the Senate bill before it was amended and combined with the Assembly version. He then became one of 29 co-sponsors. Then-Sen. Ray Lesniak (D-Union), who was the main sponsor, also became one of the co-sponsors of the final bill.
But Norcross’ officially-sanctioned statements, issued shortly after the law was passed, painted a different picture.
“As Senator, I led the charge on getting the Economic Opportunity Act passed into law — a game-changing law that will help to create thousands of jobs in our region,” he said in the February 2014 press release . Norcross’ campaign website used to echo those comments, but they no longer appear there.
In a May 2014 press release , his campaign spokesperson, Ken Shuttleworth, indicated the then-state senator “authored” the legislation.
“Senator Norcross has been incredibly effective during his time in Trenton — authoring landmark legislation like the Economic Opportunity Act, that is already spurring investment by small businesses and entrepreneurs in New Jersey’s distressed cities,” Shuttleworth wrote.
The bill underwent a series of amendments that added extra incentives for South Jersey and Camden in particular. Those changes were authored in part by Kevin Sheehan, a lawyer at Parker McCay, the firm run by Philip Norcross, and have led to many of the controversies that are haunting the program today.
Before the bill passed in 2013, its top Assembly sponsor, Al Coutinho, a Democrat from Essex County, said Donald Norcross had a major role in shaping it.
“The Senate president and (other) folks from South Jersey said we need to do more for it. Senator (Don) Norcross (D-Camden) was always trying to get more, more, more for Camden and wouldn’t sign off until he got enough that he was comfortable with,” he told NJ Spotlight .
Coutinho later pleaded guilty to stealing money from his family’s foundation and resigned from the Assembly.
Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray speculated Donald Norcross may want to distance himself from the tax break law to help boost his position in the House.
“As a member of Congress, Donald Norcross does not want to really get bogged down in what has become just an all-out, nasty war,” between Murphy and South Jersey Democrats, Murray said.
“His ambition is not just on moving up to the Senate, which would require state party support, but also to move up within the leadership in the House, which doesn’t require state party support,” Murray said. “I think that’s more of a key as to why he’s trying to distance himself from what’s going on right now. He doesn’t want that to float back into Washington and impact his ability to move up the ladder in leadership there.”
Tambussi insisted Donald Norcross hasn’t changed the way he talks about the law.
“Congressman Norcross is not deemphasizing his role in the revitalization efforts in the City of Camden in any way,” Tambussi wrote in an email."
Trump threatens Mexico with big tariffs,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/05/31/trump-threatens-mexico-with-big-tariffs-442338,"Editor’s Pro’s Trump threatens new tariffs on Mexico — President Trump on Thursday night said he would slap 5% tariffs on all imports from Mexico beginning June 10 in retaliation for what he described as Mexico’s failure to do more to stop the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. Unless Mexico takes unspecified actions, the tariffs would rise to 10% on July 1, 20% on Sept. 1 and 25% on Oct. 1.
Story Continued Below
The tariffs would remain at 25% “unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.” Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act as the legal basis for his action. MM asked WH chief of staff Mick Mulvaney how that act would apply to immigration and he referred the question to the White House counsel’s office and noted several GOP senators had the same question.
Mexico is the U.S.’s third largest trading partner and recently concluded the USMCA trade deal that faces an uncertain future in Congress. The tariffs will likely raise prices for auto parts, produce including avocados, building materials and much more.
Asked about imposing a tax on Americans to punish Mexico, Mulvaney said: “Americans are paying for this right now. Illegal immigration comes at a cost.” (More below).
Wall Street react — Investors are not likely react well to what is now effectively a two-front trade war with two of our biggest trading partners. Dow Futures dropped over 200 points shortly after the announcement and a promise by Mexico to retaliate.

MORE ON MEXICO —
MARKETS SHAKEN — Reuters: “U.S. stock futures slid and sovereign bonds surged on Friday as investors feared ... Trump’s shock move to slap tariffs on Mexico risked tipping the United States, and maybe the whole world, into recession.” Read more .
Our Ian Kullgren : “The president is also considering sweeping restrictions on asylum that would effectively block Central American migrants from entering the U.S., several administration officials and advocates briefed on the plan said earlier Thursday.
“Trump’s idea to use tariffs as leverage on immigration is not new. He said last month that a recent deal with Mexico on auto exports wouldn’t count if the country failed to stop Central American migrants from illegally crossing the border.”
More Mulvaney : “We really do not want to do this but we do this to protect the country.” On the USMCA: “The two are absolutely not linked. … This is an act that we take that is related to an immigration matter. These are tariffs as part of an immigration problem.” The Mexicans may not share this view. The WTO might not either.
He said Mexico would have to “make progress immediately” on border crossings in order to forestall the tariffs. He said Republicans on the Hill were generally supportive of the action but the White House didn’t talk to any Democrats.
Per statement from Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “Trade policy and border security are separate issues. This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump’s and what could be a big victory for the country.”
Deutsche Bank’s Torsten Slok in a note headlined “This is a serious risk to the outlook”: “US trade with Mexico is mainly intra-company trade. … [A] significant amount of US exports consists of imports from other countries, in particular for the auto industry. In other words, trade with Mexico is basically all about the supply chain, which essentially is all about cars.”
SPEAKING OF NAFTA — Our Megan Cassella and Andrew Restuccia: “The Trump administration has taken a step toward ratification of the new North American trade agreement, sending a draft statement to Congress that puts the legislative body on notice the pact could be coming soon.
“The move represents a procedural step forward on the path to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and starts a 30-day window that must pass before the Trump administration is allowed to submit the full implementing legislation to Congress.” Read more .
China and the rare earth card — China is threatening to limit exports to the U.S. of rare earth minerals used in a broad range of technology, consumer and defense products. Opinions are mixed on just how big an impact this would have. China would hurt itself by not exporting products using rare earth minerals. The U.S. also has plenty of rare earth deposits but very limited mining capacity.
It would take a long time and plenty of government support to reduce U.S. reliance on imported rare earth minerals. MM spoke with James Litinsky, CEO of JHL Capital, the investment firm that owns MP Materials, whose Mountain Pass facility is the only rare earth mining site in North America.
On whether China will follow through on its threats : “Neither you, nor me, nor anybody else knows if Trump and Xi will hug tomorrow and all this will be over …
On the minerals themselves : “Rare earths are not rare at all. They are ubiquitous. Rare earths in high enough concentration to be processed economically are extremely rare. … Mountain Pass is blessed with the Saudi Arabia of rare earths … The reality is there is a lot of hype but realistically it is hard to be a low-cost producer of rare earths. It is mainly China and Mountain Pass.”

First, the White House started the 30-day clock for Trump to submit his Mexico-Canada trade deal to Congress, despite warnings from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that her caucus still has problems with the agreement.
Story Continued Below
Trump administration officials had previously promised not to send the trade pact to Congress until Democrats were ready to vote on it. Pelosi said it was “not a positive step” for Trump to prematurely send Congress the draft statement of administrative action. “It indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the Administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement,” she said in a statement. More from WaPo’s Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Josh Dawsey: https://wapo.st/2wEzrHD .
Then, Trump announced that he will slap a 5 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico and ""gradually"" hike the tariffs until Mexico stops migrants from crossing the southern border. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) called the move a “misuse of presidential tariff authority” and warned it could “seriously jeopardize” Trump’s trade deal. But the president is clearly frustrated that he hasn’t been able to score major victories on trade or immigration, two of his signature campaign issues, heading into 2020.

ROMNEY’S RESISTANCE -- Sen. Mitt Romney has emerged as the Senate GOP’s no. 1 Trump antagonist, largely filling a void left by the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). Both lawmakers were GOP presidential nominees, meaning their voices carry more weight in the party than the average senator, and Trump has had a notoriously tense relationship with both men.
Romney kicked off his Senate career by writing a scathing op-ed criticizing Trump and immediately fought against a government shutdown over Trump's wall. Since then, the Utah Republican has voted against Trump more than most other Republicans and has even defended former President Barack Obama. Yet Romney still broadly supports Trump’s agenda, and he has not gone so far as to call for impeachment. Burgess has the dispatch on Romney’s Trump strategy: https://politi.co/2WzaoEa .

THIRD TIME’S NOT A CHARM -- A third House Republican blocked a disaster aid bill from passing the House by unanimous consent on Thursday, ensuring lawmakers won’t be able to send the package to Trump’s desk until after recess. Yet Texas Rep. Chip Roy — the fiscal hawk who has helped lead the conservative revolt over Congress’s bipartisan disaster bill — is unbothered by the wave of criticism over the last week.
Yes, he’s been chewed out by members of his own party since he held up the disaster aid bill last Friday. He was even cautioned by some in Republican leadership to think about the potential optics. But he’s also earned support from 10-plus GOP colleagues, helping to quietly orchestrate a wall of opposition that’s cemented a weeklong delay to the $19 billion package.

RIP THAD COCHRAN -- Longtime Sen. Thad Cochran passed away on Thursday at the age of 81. The Mississippi Republican, who served in the Senate from 1978 to 2018, was chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee.

Thad never let our Country (or me) down!""
The obit from the Mississippi Clarion Ledger : “Cochran, of quiet stately demeanor and known for playing piano to relax in his office, has been called ‘Gentleman Thad’ by his peers in Congress.

Kirsten Gillibrand can get off the floor. | AP Photo POLITICO Magazine: Kirsten Gillibrand’s failure to launch
HAMPTON, New Hampshire — Kirsten Gillibrand is only asking for a dollar.
It’s not that she couldn’t use more money. In the first quarter of 2019, the junior senator from New York raised just $3 million for her presidential campaign, the weakest haul of the six senators running at that time and arguably one of the most disappointing totals of anyone in the sprawling Democratic field. Given her anemic polling since entering the race, Gillibrand’s feeble fundraising performance fanned skepticism about her viability to earn a nomination that Democrats believewill require close to $100 million in hard money raised.
But at this point, Gillibrand isn’t focused on winning the primary. She’s worried about surviving the next few months.
Despite a soaring national profile in the U.S. Senate, Gillibrand has failed to achieve liftoff as a presidential prospect. She has not broken 2 percent in a single national poll since officially declaring her candidacy in mid-March, and her 0.4 percent average in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of surveys places her behind the likes of Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard and even geeky long shot Andrew Yang.
Her bigger problem is fundraising. To secure a spot in the first double-header of Democratic primary debates in late June, candidates must meet two thresholds: surpassing 1 percent in three recognized national polls and collecting 65,000 unique campaign contributions. Gillibrand has checked the first box, however unimpressively. Yet the second mission remains unaccomplished. With the debates closing in — and with even quixotic candidates such as self-help guru Marianne Williamson hitting the 65,000-donor mark — Gillibrand is under the gun. The Democratic National Committee is limiting the total number of participants to 20. She could (and likely will) qualify by meeting the polling threshold only. But given the late gusher of contenders entering the fray, her place on stage can be guaranteed only by growing her donor ranks — and quickly.
Which brings Gillibrand to the climax of her stump speech. It’s the second weekend of May, she’s addressing a standing room-only crowd at a micro-pub four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and the senator has finally hit her stride. Whether it’s the booze flowing from the taps or some other environmental factor — OK, it’s the booze — this has been Gillibrand’s best event of the day. Her talking points are sharp. Her jokes are well executed. Her audience is energized and engaged. Candidates typically fade late in a long day on the campaign trail, but Gillibrand has gotten stronger. The voters are hanging on her every word — about reforming the EPA, battling the NRA, encouraging national service programs and confronting Russian aggression. Finally, Gillibrand decides, it’s time to make the ask.
“For anyone here, if you like what you’ve heard tonight, I want to earn my place on the debate stage. I can’t do it unless you send a dollar — literally, really ,” Gillibrand says, shaking her head as though to acknowledge the oddity of this request. “The measure is for anyone who wants to be on the debate stage, you need to get 65,000 individual supporters. So please go to KirstenGillibrand.com and just send a dollar. It will help me get to the debate stage.”
Gillibrand isn’t the only 2020 hopeful who has resorted to this method. Tim Ryan’s website features pop-up advertisements asking for $1. And Michael Bennet’s spots on social media make an identical solicitation.
But that’s Tim Ryan and Michael Bennet — an obscure congressman and low-profile senator, respectively. Ryan’s chief claim to relevance is being slaughtered by Nancy Pelosi as the sacrificial lamb who challenged her in the speaker’s race on behalf of disgruntled House Democrats after the 2016 election. Bennet has done little to distinguish himself as a senator and won his Colorado seat in 2010 only because the GOP snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, nominating a self-destructive Tea Party candidate whom Bennet managed to defeat by some 30,000 votes.
Gillibrand plays in a different league — or at least, she was supposed to. ***
A Dartmouth-educated lawyer who worked in corporate law before clerking on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Gillibrand gained national attention upon entering the political arena for possessing a rare combination of big brains, telegenic looks and personal magnetism. Her storming of a conservative upstate New York congressional district in 2006 announced her arrival as a player in Washington, and it was little surprise when, a few years later, after Hillary Clinton’s appointment as secretary of state, Gillibrand was tapped to replace her in the Senate. After winning her own full term in 2012— racking up the largest statewide victory in the history of New York politics— Gillibrand set about overhauling her political brand.
It wouldn’t be easy to shed the image responsible for her House victories — that of a down-home, gun-friendly, anti-amnesty, culturally conservative Democrat who identified with her rural constituents more than with the party’s coastal elite. But slowly, methodically, Gillibrand did just that, smartly picking and choosing fights that would burnish her populist progressive bona fides while elevating her national stature. She co-directed the effort that banned insider trading among members of Congress. She was an integral part of the campaign to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that governed gays in the military. She introduced pioneering legislation aimed at ensuring paid family leave. And she became Washington’s leading voice on sexual assault, first by focusing on cases in the military and then broadening to harness the energy generated by the #MeToo movement.
All the while, she raised tens of millions of dollars, wrote a New York Times bestseller and was named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people in the world.
As it became clear that Gillibrand was preparing to launch a campaign for the presidency in 2020, the only question seemed to be the height of the senator’s ceiling. Could she win the Democratic nomination? And if so, could she succeed where her friend and former mentor, Hillary Clinton, failed four years earlier?
Today, the question is whether Gillibrand can get off the floor."
New Dem debate criteria has candidates miffed,www.politico.com,MICAELA RODRIGUEZ,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/debate-criteria-democrats-1348217,This week on the Nerdcast with host Scott Bland: a deep dive into Elizabeth Warren’s campaign strategy with a POLITICO reporter who was on the trail with her.

How Gov. Jay Inslee would address immigration,www.politico.com,DANIEL STRAUSS,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/jay-inslee-immigration-1348506,"In his first policy proposal not directly related to climate change, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee laid out plans to enact wholesale reversals of President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.
What would the plan do? Inslee’s plan would call for an immediate end to a number of signature Trump policies, including the construction of a wall on the southern border and the ban on travel from some majority-Muslim countries, and would reinstate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children from deportation.
Inslee also has pledged to allow more refugee admissions to the United States and change the Trump administration’s asylum policy, which makes migrants seeking asylum from Central American countries stay in Mexico. The plan also includes provisions to increase foreign aid to Latin America, which Inslee says would help reduce illegal immigration.
The plan would also raise the number of annual refugee admissions into the United States, eventually going past the target of 110,000 the Obama administration set during its final year. Most sweepingly, Inslee wants to overhaul the current legal immigration system with a focus on providing a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants.
How would it work? A number of Inslee’s top immigration priorities would be accomplished by executive orders rescinding Trump policies and reinstating older ones. But any major fix to the immigration system would require congressional action, which has eluded the federal government for decades, despite widespread, bipartisan discontent with the current legal system.
How much would it cost? The plan does not give a baseline total, but Inslee’s argument rests partially on the idea that Trump’s immigration policies are costing the United States. Inslee’s immigration policy paper argues, for example, that the Trump administration threat to close the border between the U.S. and Mexico “endangers $1.6 billion in daily cross-border trade.”
What have other Democrats proposed? Julián Castro has laid out a detailed plan that emphasizes a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. Beto O’Rourke has also proposed an immigration plan that says he would use executive authority as president to reverse key Trump administration policy positions on immigration.
Who opposes it? Anti-immigration hard-liners and supporters of Trump’s immigration stances will likely oppose Inslee’s plan."
"Honduras president, others targets of DEA investigation",www.politico.com,JENNIFER SCHOLTES,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/honduras-president-dea-investigation-1348514,"NEW YORK — U.S. federal court documents show Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández and some of his closest advisers were among the targets of a Drug Enforcement Administration investigation.
A document filed by prosecutors on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York mentions Hernández as part of a group of individuals investigated by the DEA since about 2013 for participating “in large-scale drug-trafficking and money laundering activities relating to the importation of cocaine into the United States”.
Hernández was elected president of Honduras in late 2013.
The document is a July 2015 application to the court to compel Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL to give investigators email header information, but not emails’ content, for a number of accounts. Two of the accounts are believed to be of Hernández, the documents says.
There is no indication charges have been brought against Hernández.
Also included in the request are the email accounts of the president’s sister Hilda Hernández, his adviser Ebal Díaz and his security minister Julián Pacheco Tinoco. Hilda Hernández, who helped manage the finances of the president’s political party and his presidential campaign, died in a December 2015 helicopter crash. The request also named four members of the wealthy and politically-connected Rosenthal family.
Yani Rosenthal, a former national lawmaker and presidential candidate, pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in 2017 for money laundering for the Cachiros drug trafficking organization.
The new court filing is part of the pre-trial motions in the case of Hernandez’s brother Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, who was arrested in 2018 in Miami and accused of scheming for years to bring tons of cocaine into the country. His trial is expected to start in September.
A spokesman for the Southern District of New York said on Thursday the court’s response to the application for email header information is not public information. He declined to comment further.
The document filed Tuesday raises the possibility that the DEA has email data for Honduras’ president and members of his inner circle dating to 2015.
Messages left for Díaz, who is Hernández’s de facto spokesman, were not immediately returned. Pacheco could not be immediately reached, but the government has previously denied allegations against him.
Pacheco has been dogged by allegations of his links to drug traffickers since at least 2017 when a leader of Honduras’ Cachiros cartel testified in another case in New York about his ties to drug traffickers.
Pacheco had served under Hernández’s predecessor, Porfirio “Pepe” Lobo Sosa, as the government’s chief of investigation and intelligence. Lobo’s son Fabio was sentenced to 24 years in a U.S. prison in 2017 for drug trafficking.
In another document filed Tuesday in Tony Hernández’s case, prosecutors said “the charges against the defendant arise out of a long-term investigation of politically connected drug trafficking in Honduras” that began in 2013.
On Thursday, a DEA spokeswoman referred questions asked by The Associated Press to the Southern District of New York.
The U.S. government has been a staunch supporter of Hernández’s government, pouring millions of dollars into security cooperation because Honduras is a key transshipment point for cocaine headed to the U.S. from South America.
Hernández had especially curried favor with Gen. John Kelly who had led the U.S. military’s Southern Command and later became President Donald Trump’s chief of staff. Kelly advocated for continued U.S. support of Hernández’s government, noting their contributions to the war on drugs and progress in combatting corruption.
When Hernández’s already controversial re-election was marred by irregularities in late 2017, the U.S. government congratulated him while the opposition was still contesting the vote count.
With Hondurans filling the ranks of several large migrant caravans during the past year, the U.S. has continued to support Hernández while pressuring his government to stem the immigration flow.
Many Honduran migrants encountered making the journey to the U.S. border during the past year have referenced government corruption among their reasons for leaving. Thousands of doctors and teachers have been marching through the streets of Honduras’ capital for three weeks against presidential decrees they say would lead to massive public sector layoffs. On Thursday, a massive march led to clashes with police who fired tear gas against some protesters’ rocks.
Retired history professor Dana Frank, whose recent book “The Long Honduran Night: Resistance, Terror, and the United States in the Aftermath of the Coup” details the country’s recent political turmoil said the documents confirm the U.S. government has known about drug trafficking activities linked to Hernández for years.
“Why have U.S. officials — from the State Department to the White House to the Southern Command — continued for years now to celebrate, and pour security funding into, a government whose very topmost officials and security figures it has known were drug traffickers?” Frank said. “This evidence underscores the vast hypocrisy of U.S. policy, which backs a known drug trafficker and his police and military cronies, while claiming to do so in the name of fighting crime and drugs.”"
A glimpse into the space rocket wars,www.politico.com,BRYAN BENDER,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/air-force-space-rocket-wars-1348504,"The debate is heating up this budget season over the Air Force's multibillion-dollar plan to acquire new space launch services, as Congress considers upending the tight schedule and contracting process.
At the same time, concerns are growing that changes will hurt competitors that have invested huge sums developing new rockets.
""You see things out of the [House Armed Services Committee],"" notes Kent Rominger, vice president of flight systems at Northrop Grumman, who is overseeing the development of its new OmegA launch system. ""They are saying, 'Hey let's delay it a year. Hey, what if we had three awardees instead of two?'
""Two is the right answer. If you spread it too thin, people's business cases may not close.""
A former naval aviator and NASA astronaut who flew on five space shuttle missions, Rominger also stressed in an interview that a restructuring could mean the United States will have to rely longer on the Russian-built RD-180 engine that currently powers the workhorse Atlas V rocket. Congress mandated it must be replaced by an American alternative by 2022.
""You can't have a development program that is so elaborate that you are not going to hit your milestones,"" he warned.
Northrop Grumman is competing with Blue Origin's New Glenn and United Launch Alliance's Vulcan for the National Security Space Launch Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement.
All three companies were awarded development contracts and the Air Force plans to select two winners next year. SpaceX, which was passed over, recently went to court to try to get another crack at the lucrative project.
Rominger discussed with POLITICO the progress of OmegA, which conducted a successful ground test of its first stage on Thursday, and the commercial prospects for the rocket if the Air Force doesn't choose it.
This
How is the development of the OmegA launch system progressing?
The plan we laid out we have been executing and hitting our milestones. We have to design a system that is very reliable, but it's got to be designed so it meets the schedule. We have to fly in early 2021. So we need to design this rocket and make sure we show up on time with it.
We also know that for this customer reliability is the number one priority. As time has gone on, a very close priority is you've got to show up on time. The Atlas V goes away in 2022. Once the RD-180 goes away, the Air Force is in a bind if this thing gets pushed out.
We designed exactly what they said they needed. Developing a new system and maintaining your schedule is a challenge. After [Thursday's test] that test the next major milestone is to fly it. This is the schedule we told the Air Force four year ago.
Congress seems to have some its own ideas about the Air Force should proceed.
You see things out of the HASC. They are saying, 'Hey let's delay it a year. Hey, what if we had three awardees instead of two?'
[The response of the Air Force is] 'Hey, look Congress, you gave us this problem. You are taking the RD-180 away from us. We've got to stay on schedule. Our backs are against the wall, so whatever it is you change, we got to maintain schedule. We'll find ourselves without any good alternatives.'
As far as three awardees, when you look at the markets and the number of launches we have in the future, two makes the most sense. Two is the right answer.
If you spread it too thin, people's business cases may not close. From where I stand, the Air Force has pretty sound logic. You can't have a development program that is so elaborate that you are not going to hit your milestones.
As a taxpayer, I care about these national security space payloads getting safely put on orbit. ... I look at how the Air Force designed this program. It's brilliant. They have three new launch systems because of the way they have structured this.
Where does SpaceX and its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets fit into the picture?
SpaceX has the least amount of development of everybody. They are flying two rockets today. Between the two they can do the majority of what is required. So they probably have a little bit of work to.
There is no reason they can't get there with the system they already have.
If your bid is not selected in the end, how do you see the commercial market shaping up for OmegA?
One of the things they said they needed was for it to be commercially viable. We designed it to make it commercially viable.
This thing was structured to be a combined investment between the government and industry. The rules are government will pay up to two-thirds; industry, we have to bring in at least a third. We are going to put in more than a third. By the time this whole thing is done we will have over half a billion of our own money into it, which is significant.
We are far along on OmegA. So if we aren't selected ... we could easily go either way.
They [the Air Force] get no intellectual property. Markets ebb and flow so we are kind of always watching the markets and what we think the other potentials are out there for OmegA."
Who’s winning the infrastructure primary? - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Sam Mintz,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-transportation/2019/05/31/whos-winning-the-infrastructure-primary-442414,"Editor’s Quick Fix — Infrastructure hasn't been an early focus in the 2020 Democratic primary — at least when it comes to the front-runners.
Story Continued Below
— Acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell is planning to stay at the agency “as long as he’s needed.”
— The drone industry seized on the news Thursday that a plane in Mexico was not in fact struck by a drone in December, as was widely reported at the time, but instead was the victim of faulty repairs.
IT’S FRIDAY: Get in touch with feedback, tips or song lyric suggestions at smintz@politico.com or @samjmintz .
“Bandwagon, it's coming into town / To turn your life around / And take you to the places that you once / Could only dream of.”
Infrastructure WHO’S WINNING THE INFRASTRUCTURE PRIMARY? As infrastructure talks wither in D.C., your host took a look at who’s saying what on the 2020 campaign trail. The verdict: So far, it’s not the front-runners who have made infrastructure a big part of their platforms, but some of the lesser-known names in the race.
The two candidates who have released full-fledged plans are former Rep. John Delaney and Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who are both trailing the main pack in polls so far. One divide in their proposals is a question that will be interesting to follow as more candidates eventually weigh in: whether or not to raise the gas tax. Klobuchar’s against it (she wants to fund infrastructure solely with a corporate tax hike), and Delaney wants to do both. In that sense, the debate mirrors Washington, where the issue of funding infrastructure has remained the biggest barrier.
Where’s “Amtrak Joe” Biden? The front-runner has talked a bit about transportation on the trail, but hasn’t released an infrastructure plan or gone into detail on his website. That could change since Biden is expected to come out with a climate plan, and versions of his stump speech have linked the two issues, as Bernie Sanders has.
HYPERLOOP LOBBYING TAKES OFF: Hyperloop companies are ramping up their lobbying efforts in Washington, with an eye toward winning regulatory approval for the nascent technology. As POLITICO Influence reports, Virgin Hyperloop One, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and Hyperloop America Inc. have all hired lobbyists and lawyers in D.C. this year.
TO BE CLEAR: Thursday’s MT included an item about a new report from the Problem Solvers Caucus coming up with infrastructure solutions. Not so fast: It turns out that it’s just a repackaged version (close to word for word) of a report the group first issued in 2018. Thanks to an eagle-eyed MT reader who noticed the similarities.
Aviation NOT GOING ANYWHERE: Elwell told our Brianna Gurciullo on Thursday that he has no immediate plans to leave the FAA if and when his replacement, Steve Dickson, is confirmed by the Senate. “I'm prepared to do whatever the president needs and Secretary [Elaine] Chao needs,"" he said. ""I will stay as long as the FAA, as long as Steve needs me. There's always a transition, so I'm prepared to serve as long as I'm needed.” The former deputy administrator could go back to that position if Dickson is confirmed (and if Congress passes a waiver allowing two former military officers to hold the top two positions at the FAA).
What’s next: The Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on Dickson’s nomination on May 15. A markup has yet to be scheduled.
DIG IN TO WAIT FOR SPACE RULE: The FAA has extended the comment period on a proposed commercial space launch rule until the end of July. As Brianna reports , the extension came after dozens of requests for more time to weigh in, given the proposal’s “breadth, significant impact, length, and complexity.”
The rule itself won’t be codified by the end of 2019, partially because of the government shutdown, according to the FAA’s commercial space chief Wayne Monteith.
WHEN IS A DRONE NOT A DRONE? When it’s really just not a drone. A Mexican airliner said to have been hit by a drone in December was actually damaged after a flawed repair job caused its nose to collapse and crack, Bloomberg reported . That revelation came in a report from the airline to the NTSB, and it’s vindicating for the drone industry, which has argued that reports of drone strikes are often false and the risk to aviation overblown.
“It would be nice if every news outlet that ran a scary story speculating about a drone collision would correct their coverage, but we know that probably won’t happen,” wrote drone giant DJI on a company blog. “Instead, we hope this will spur the media, the drone industry, government officials and the general public to be skeptical the next time they hear an unverified allegation that a drone had a close call with an airplane thousands of feet in the air.”
CRITICISM OF BOEING FROM THE HILL: Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who has been critical of Boeing and the FAA in the wake of two 737 MAX crashes, wasn’t taken by the company’s CEO apologizing during an interview with CBS Evening News this week. “Plane passengers deserve more than apologies & promises from Boeing's CEO about the updated 737 MAX's airworthiness, any 'fix' must be independently scrutinized. A new, robust review of all safety systems is paramount,” Blumenthal tweeted on Thursday.
TSA HIT SCREENINGS RECORD: U.S. airports experienced their busiest day ever on May 24, with TSA screening a record 2,792,525 passengers and crew members, the agency announced Thursday. In the same statement, the agency acknowledged that “increased traveler volume this summer may present challenges” as its resources are sent to support DHS’ mission at the U.S. border with Mexico.
WHO MAKES WHAT: The Bureau of Labor Statistics released an interesting new dataset on transportation industry employment. The numbers, which date back to May 2018, show employment levels and mean salaries. You should look through yourself, but a few randomly selected tidbits: The annual mean wage for airline pilots is $169,560. There were 1.8 million truck drivers working in the U.S at that date. And the rail industry wins the award for goofiest job titles, with “dinkey operators” and “hostlers” among the positions listed.
Rail PTC PROGRESS: The FRA said this week that, as of March 31, positive train control systems were being used on close to 48,050 of the 58,000 route miles subject to a statutory mandate. That’s a 3 percent increase from last quarter, with 19 months left before a December 2020 deadline. The agency also said it sent a letter to freight, non-Class I tenant railroads “emphasizing the importance of timely implementation, and inviting them to meet with FRA in Washington, DC, this summer.”

Moulton’s ‘cyber wall’ explained - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2019/05/31/moultons-cyber-wall-explained-639094,"With help from Eric Geller and Martin Matishak Editor's A Democratic presidential campaign that has advocated for building a “cyber wall” expanded on the term’s meaning to MC.
— President Donald Trump said Russia did help him get elected, before going back on it. He also talked about election security.
— A senior NSA official commented at length on The New York Times’ EternalBlue story for the first time. He suggested some of the story’s characterizations were off.
HAPPY FRIDAY And that’s the way our nation became “The Brady Bunch.”
2020 Watch WHAT IS A ‘CYBER WALL?’ — When Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) talks about his desire to build a “cyber wall” on the presidential trail, infosec Twitter often uses the occasion to crack wise , expressing befuddlement at what a “cyber wall” actually is. So MC asked his campaign. “Obviously, Rep. Moulton is referring to where we should be making security investments in contrast to Donald Trump's call for a border wall,” spokesperson Matt Corridoni said. “The ‘cyber wall’ is a metaphor for the actions we should be taking to protect our networks and prevent the intrusions that plagued the 2016 election.”
What are some of those suggestions? Corridoni said Moulton favors giving agencies the money they need to buy “top of the line” software to protect .gov domains. Then there’s .com, where Moulton suggests a start that would include “requiring all contractors to implement rigorous password requirements and staff trainings about phishing and email best practices in order to generate a new industry standard.” The federal government should invest in tech and cyber startups, “so that Silicon Valley isn't turning to the Chinese for startup funding.”
And Corridoni said Moulton wants to pump up deterrence by making sure hackers recognize the punishments outweigh the benefits of attacks. “Donald Trump has embraced Russia following their attack on the integrity of our election process, and we need to be doing exactly the opposite,” Corridoni said.
HOW AM I NOT MYSELF — Trump said on Thursday for the first time that Russia helped get him elected, but quickly reversed himself. “I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected,” he tweeted. Shortly after, he told reporters something else. “No, Russia did not help me get elected,” he said. “I got me elected.” Trump also commented on election security efforts in his administration. “We are doing a lot, and we're trying to do paper ballots as a backup system as much as possible, because going to good old-fashioned paper in this modern age is the best way to do it,” he said. While top administration officials have backed those policies, they also resisted legislation last year, S. 2593 (115) , that would’ve encouraged those practices.
Intelligence Community INTO THE ETERNALBLUE — A senior NSA official on Thursday weighed in publicly on the recent story that hackers used a stolen tool from the clandestine organization to facilitate cyberattacks on American cities, including San Antonio and Baltimore. ""NSA shares the concerns of all law-abiding cities around the world about the threat posed by criminal malicious cyber activity,” according to prepared remarks by NSA senior adviser Rob Joyce for a CrowdStrike event in Washington. “The characterization that there is an indefensible nation-state tool propagating ransomware is simply untrue. That is not true.”
Joyce’s remarks noted that Microsoft issued patches in 2017 to address a flaw in its software, ostensibly against the cyber tool, dubbed EternalBlue. While the remarks don’t suggest that NSA told Microsoft about the vulnerability, Joyce said his agency, along with DHS and other federal organizations, issued and disseminated advisories about it. “Two years have gone by — network administrators are responsible for ensuring that system patches are up-to-date.” Joyce went on to say that “focusing on a single exploit, especially one that ... has a solution through a patch is shortsighted.” Vulnerabilities “will continue to be found,” he said. In fact, Baltimore’s own IT office had warned about vulnerable computer systems.
CRYPTO CHECK-IN — Cybersecurity aficionados interested in encryption policy around the world can turn to a resource from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The organization on Thursday published a series of expert briefs describing how the EU, Brazil, Australia, China, India and Germany have approached encryption. “Regulation on encryption is imminent in India,” writes the Observer Research Foundation’s Bedavyasa Mohanty. “Its exact nature remains undecided, but it will significantly affect India’s newly recognized fundamental right to privacy.” Germany, meanwhile, “takes a clear and unambiguous stance on strong encryption as a fundamental element” for protecting government, corporate and personal data, according to Sven Herpig and Stefan Heumann of the think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung.
The papers are the product of Carnegie’s Encryption Working Group, which described them as resources “designed to shine light on key drivers of the debates in these countries, how they have evolved in the last five years, and the divergent approaches taken by different governments.” The group said it would publish “further briefings on aspects of the [global] encryption policy debate” in the next few months.
YOU’VE GOT ANOTHER WEEK — The Election Assistance Commission on Thursday extended the deadline for commenting on an updated version of the guidelines many states use for their voting machine regulations. The original deadline for feedback on the principles and high-level guidelines for the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines 2.0 came and went this week, but it’s now been pushed to June 7. Some major groups got their comments in under the original time frame.
 House members introduced bipartisan legislation to safeguard American research from foreign espionage. … Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller “could’ve reached a decision” on obstruction of justice. … “Lawmakers negotiating a national privacy bill are clashing over whether to allow consumers to sue companies like Facebook and Google over privacy violations.”

Driving the Day TRUMP STOMPS ON OWN USMCA MOVE WITH NEW MEXICO TARIFF: Trump on Thursday sought to increase pressure on Congress to pass USMCA this summer by taking a step toward ratification — but promptly complicated his efforts with just two tweets announcing a new tariff on Mexico.
Trump said he will impose a 5 percent tariff on all imports from Mexico starting June 10, then “gradually” hike the tariff unless Mexico stops migrants from crossing its border into the United States. The tariff will ratchet up to 10 percent on July 1 if Mexico has not taken sufficient steps and continue increasing by 5 percentage points every month until it hits 25 percent on Oct. 1. He added the tariffs would be removed once the “problem is remedied.”
Can he do that? Trump is taking the action under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate trade to deal with “any unusual or extraordinary threat” to national security that warrants a national emergency. (In February, Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico to access funds for a border wall.)
Mexico's former chief NAFTA negotiator, Kenneth Smith Ramos, countered on Twitter that the tariff would violate NAFTA and WTO rules. He added that since Mexico exports more than $350 billion in goods to the U.S., Mexico's retaliation “would be off the charts.”
The latest move from the self-proclaimed “Tariff Man” could also reignite lawmakers’ efforts to rein in Trump’s powers to use his favorite trade tool.
Immigration trumps USMCA: Trump just last month threatened tariffs on Mexico’s auto imports, saying curbing illegal immigration “will supersede USMCA,” though he ultimately never pulled the trigger.
Mexico takes the high road: Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said in a letter to Trump on Thursday night that he will not impose retaliatory measures; instead, he wants to deepen dialogue between the two countries to address the migratory situation.
""Social problems don't get resolved with duties or coercive measures,"" López Obrador said. ""I don't believe ... in 'an eye for an eye.'""
The letter did not mention USMCA. López Obrador said earlier that he was confident the pact would be approved ""soon"" by Mexico, which formally kicked off the process of ratifying the new NAFTA earlier Thursday.
How a new tariff trips up NAFTA 2.0: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle forced Trump to lift his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico and Canada by threatening that his beloved USMCA would be dead otherwise. Congress could pull the same move on the 5 percent tariff.
Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley , who was integral to removing the steel and aluminum tariffs, was quick to criticize Trump’s move on Thursday night as a “misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent.”
“Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA.""
— Sen. Chuck Grassley
As if USMCA didn’t have enough problems: The Trump administration on Thursday sent a draft statement of administrative action for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to Congress, a move Hill Democrats slammed as premature.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the submission was “not a positive step,” after Democrats “have been on a path to yes.” House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal said the move would not make Democrats move any faster on consideration of the deal. “The premature submission of a draft statement of administrative action has no impact on that outstanding work or the timeline moving forward,” he said.

HOW THE TIMELINE LOOKS FOR USMCA: Submission of the draft statement and text does not guarantee that the Trump administration will submit the implementing bill for USMCA to Congress in 30 days. It is a procedural step that must be done at least 30 days before the administration sends over the implementing legislation for the bill. That means the earliest USMCA could be sent to Capitol Hill for a vote is the end of June.
Room for change? It’s important to note that while U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer submitted the “final legal text as it now stands,” he specified that it was not the “final, binding text.” Lighthizer said in a letter to Pelosi that sending up the statement would not “prejudice the content of the final implementation package.”

INDIA BRACES FOR TRUMP’S TRADE WRATH: India could soon become the next target of Trump’s aggressive trade policy. A decision to cut New Delhi out of the Generalized System of Preferences program could come any day now. On top of that, the administration is considering launching a full-blown investigation into India’s trade practices, just as the U.S. did with China last year.
A potential new front in Trump’s trade war with the world would pit the U.S. against a country that has long maintained a fractious trading relationship with Washington. But any potential moves would come just as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emerged from a national election with an even stronger grasp on power.
“The challenge is you have both administrations taking a fairly strong stance,” said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S.-India Business Council. “Whether there is space to negotiate some compromises is an open question.” Adam has the full story here .
USDA SLASHES CHINA AG IMPORT FORECAST FURTHER: U.S. farm exports to China are now forecast at just $6.5 billion in fiscal 2019, down from the previous forecast of $9 billion, the U.S. Agriculture Department said Thursday. The report is the latest evidence of how sales to what was once the top market for U.S. agricultural exports continue to slide as a result of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing’s retaliation.
As recently as fiscal 2017, the United States exported $21.8 billion worth of farm goods to China, making it the top U.S. export market that year. Sales slumped to $16.3 billion in fiscal 2018, after Trump started imposing tariffs on Chinese goods.
U.S. agricultural exports to China hit a high of $25.7 billion in fiscal 2014, when Barack Obama was president. Now, U.S. suppliers are increasingly worried about permanently losing market as the trade war drags on, Beth Hughes, a top official at the International Dairy Foods Association, said earlier this week.
USDA also lowered its overall agricultural export forecast to $137 billion, down $4.5 billion from its February forecast and $6.4 billion lower than actual 2018 exports of $143.4 billion. Pro Agriculture’s Catherine Boudreau has more here .
ROSS TOUTS $1 TRILLION IN POTENTIAL EXPORTS AT EX-IM MEETING: The Commerce Department Advocacy Center has “almost $1 trillion in projects at play” that could benefit from Export-Import Bank financing now that the government-run bank is fully operational, Ross said Thursday.
“The United States is back in the export financing game,” Ross said at the Ex-Im Bank’s first board meeting in nearly four years, which came after the Senate approved a new president, Kimberly Reed, and two other new board members, Spencer Bachus and Judith Pryor. “Ex-Im financing will make U.S. company bids more competitive vis-à-vis their foreign competitors because in most cases those have strong export credit support.” Read Doug’s story here .

GOP senators warn Trump's Mexico tariffs could blow up trade deal - POLITICO,www.politico.com,DOUG PALMER,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trump-mexico-tariffs-trade-deal-1494055,"Republicans are warning President Donald Trump that he could sabotage his hopes of a new trade agreement with Canada and Mexico if he follows through on plans to impose harsh new tariffs on the latter country.
""The [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement] would provide much-needed certainty to our agriculture community, at a time when they need it,"" Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said in a statement Friday. ""If the president goes through with this, I’m afraid progress to get this trade agreement across the finish line will be stifled.""
Story Continued Below
She joined Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and numerous business groups who criticized Trump's latest tariff move and warned it could imperil approval of the replacement for NAFTA, the president's top legislative priority.
Trump said Thursday night that he planned to impose a 5 percent duty on all Mexican goods beginning June 10 to pressure Mexico to do more to stop illegal border crossings into the United States. That duty will increase to 10 percent on July 1 and rise by 5 percentage points each month until it reaches 25 percent on Oct. 1 if Mexico does not satisfy his demand.
Faced with widespread opposition to the move, Trump took to Twitter on Friday to defend his action.
""In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30 percent of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA,"" Trump wrote . ""Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!""
""90 percent of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico & our Southern Border. 80,000 people died last year, 1,000,000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years & nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It’s time!,"" Trump said in a second tweet .
White House aides also defended the legality of the move, which they said was within Trump's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They blamed Congress for refusing to deal with problems at the border.
""There’s case law that supports the action taken by the president,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""And frankly, if other people were stepping up and doing more the president wouldn't have to continue to look for ways to stop this problem on his own.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, in an interview on CNBC, urged investors to keep calm, arguing there is plenty of time for Mexico to take three key actions to stop the tariffs.
Those are stopping Central American immigrants from crossing into Mexico from Guatemala; breaking up the transnational gangs that profit from the undocumented immigrant trade; and keeping asylum seekers on Mexico's side of the border, Navarro said.
""This is not a tariff war here with Mexico in any way, shape or form. This is a measure to get Mexico to do what it should be doing,"" he said.
But the move to link immigration policy and trade is drawing sharp criticism from members of Trump's own party.
""Trade policy and border security are separate issues,"" Grassley said. ""This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump’s and what could be a big victory for the country.""
Grassley urged Trump to consider a different approach, ""such as imposing a fee on the billions of dollars of remittances that annually leave the United States to Mexico, which only encourage illegal immigration and don’t help the U.S. economy.""
Ernst said she also supported efforts to stop the illegal entries, but ""this isn't the right path."" She said she was worried it would endanger the livelihood of Iowa farmers who depend on exports to Mexico for part of their income.
Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a former U.S. trade representative, expressed similar concerns. ""Let’s focus on solving the crisis at the border, but not hurt our economy and endanger an important @POTUS goal — a better trade deal w/ #Canada & #Mexico,"" he wrote on Twitter .
A Republican who hails from a key border state, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), also urged Trump to reconsider his plan. ""Senator Cornyn supports the president’s commitment to securing our border, but he opposes this across-the-board tariff which will disproportionately hurt Texas,"" a Cornyn spokesperson said.
In the House, the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), urged Mexico to take advantage of the short window of opportunity to address Trump's concerns.
“Lawmakers in Congress and Mexico recognize that resolving this issue positively will be essential to passage of the new USMCA that will benefit workers, farmers, and businesses in both countries,"" Brady said in a statement.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said in a letter to Trump on Thursday night that he will not impose retaliatory measures; instead, he wants to deepen dialogue between the two countries to address the migratory situation.
""Social problems don't get resolved with duties or coercive measures,"" López Obrador said. ""I don't believe ... in 'an eye for an eye.'""
Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, was enroute to Washington on Friday afternoon to try to defuse the situation. On Twitter, Ebrard said he had a meeting scheduled with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday and would meet with others to prepare for the discussions.
The USMCA agreement that Trump is trying to get through Congress provides for tariff-free trade between the three North American neighbors. Administration officials on Thursday night sought to distinguish Trump's new tariff move from his desire to win approval of the new agreement, even though they seem contradictory.
White House budget director and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump resorted to the tariff move because Democrats in Congress refused to act.
""I can personally tell you it's been at least six weeks since I met with Senate Democrats to literally beg them [for help with the] situation,"" Mulvaney said. ""Instead of helping us, they left town. So, now we are asking Mexico to do what it can, because Congress will not.""
Trump is prepared to take tariffs to 25 percent if that is what is needed to stop the illegal crossings, but sincerely hopes it will not come to that, Mulvaney said.
""We actually have some level of confidence that the Mexicans government will be able to help in a very, very timely fashion,"" Mulvaney said.
But both national and border state business groups also quickly blasted the idea.
“Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,"" Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said. ""These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border.""
Glenn Hamer, Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry president and CEO, called Trump's move ""baffling"" and ""terribly damaging"" to the U.S. economy if implemented.
""It completely contradicts the spirit of NAFTA, not to mention the USMCA that we’re attempting to ratify,"" Hamer said.
Paola Avila, chair of the Border Trade Alliance, said Trump was undermining the United States' ability to strike trade deals with any country by threatening new duties on Mexico, just seven months after signing a new agreement that locks in the 25 years of duty-free trade the three countries have had under NAFTA.
“The president’s plan, if executed, will do tremendous harm to our relationship with Mexico, to our country’s ability to adopt new trade agreements going forward, and to U.S. consumers, who will be the ones who will pay for these tariffs,"" she said.

"Shanahan: 'Our job is to run the military,' not politics - POLITICO",www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/patrick-shanahan-military-politics-1494486," Patrick Shanahan, in the wake of the flap over the USS John S. McCain during President Donald Trump’s visit to Japan, reasserted on Friday the long-standing mandate to shield the military from politics.
""Our business is to run military operations and not to become politicized … Our job is to run the military,” Shanahan during a news conference in Singapore.
He said he hasn’t discussed the dust-up over the McCain destroyer with the White House or with top military commanders in the Pacific, explaining he’s leaving it to his chief of staff to check out.
Shanahan has directed Chief of Staff Eric Chewning “to look into the matter, and that’s different than saying ‘launch a formal investigation,’” the acting Defense secretary said.
His comments followed a report in The Wall Street Journal that the White House Military Office requested the McCain be kept “out of sight” during a presidential visit to Japan over the long Memorial Day holiday — instructions the Navy began to follow but then backed off from.
Shanahan has said he had no knowledge of the affair until he read about it in the press.
“I'll wait until I get a full explanation of the facts before I pass judgment on the situation,” Shanahan said.
Chewning will be talking to top Navy officers in the Pacific and in Washington, Shanahan said, adding his chief of staff had already searched the emails received by Shanahan’s own “front office” to see if any messages came in relating to preventing Trump from seeing the McCain.
“They did a quick — and I would say a not exhaustive look — and we received none,” Shanahan said.
Some retired military officials have called for a more formal inquiry by the Pentagon’s inspector general.
“I would not have moved the ship, I would not have given that direction, so I’ll just wait to see what’s reported back,” Shanahan said of Chewning’s inquiry."
California Democrats have unprecedented power. Why is the party so uneasy?,www.politico.com,JEREMY B. WHITE,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/05/31/california-democrats-have-unprecedented-power-why-is-the-party-so-uneasy-1034853,"SAN FRANCISCO — The California Democratic Party has never been this powerful — and its incumbents are feeling the heat.
The party rides into the 2020 election with Democrats in every statewide office, while California Republicans — who once gave the country Ronald Reagan — have been reduced to an afterthought in the Legislature and diminished to just seven slots in a 53-member House delegation.
Yet Democrats' rising fortunes have flowed in part from an energized activist base that, even as it buoys candidates, is channeling an anti-establishment wave roiling the national Democratic party as rank-and-file members clamor to elect not just Democrats but the right Democrats.
The outcome in this liberal West Coast stronghold could demonstrate to the national Democratic Party what happens when a base galvanized by Donald Trump pushes candidates and elected officials to embrace an unapologetically progressive agenda.
Moreover, Democratic presidential candidates are jostling over the deep vein of delegates at play in California’s wide-open primary, and 14 of them will be here on Friday for the California Democratic Party convention.
While they jockey for political support in a state that suddenly matters in 2020 after moving up its primary, activists will battle longtime delegates over the future at the California party.
“I think there’s a very vocal new contingent of delegates and activists and they simply reject the old way of doing things,” said John Vigna, who was a close lieutenant to ousted chair Eric Bauman. “A lot of the folks, particularly the ones who came in with Bernie Sanders, have a natural distrust of the establishment — any establishment, whether it’s Sacramento or D.C., [and] most of that distrust is the feeling that elected officials are not advancing the platform with the forcefulness or effectiveness they would like.”
Whoever becomes the next party chair this weekend will have to navigate those political crosscurrents while helping to heal from the fallout of Bauman’s departure last year in a sexual misconduct scandal. The activists have momentum, asserting that the top-down culture that fed Bauman's rise also enabled years of abuse.
After narrowly losing to Bauman in an acrimonious 2017 contest, Kimberly Ellis is taking another shot, having launched an organization to cultivate a new generation of progressive candidates after her defeat.
In an interview with POLITICO, she heralded a rising cohort of “revolutionaries who are not necessarily concerned with getting re-elected but with doing what they can while they’re there.” She warned that the party risks becoming irrelevant for vital blocs of the electorate — millennials, single women and people of color.
“We need to work with the Indivisibles and the Our Revolutions because they’re already here now. In many respects those programs started because there was a void and the party wasn’t doing its job in some of these places,” she said.
Those groups tend to fall farther on the left of the spectrum. They are also in the vanguard of a fundamental trend in California politics: The erosion of party affiliation, with evermore people registering as no-party-preference rather than declaring themselves Democrats or Republicans.
“The vast majority of those people who are in that no-party-preference category are the very demographic that this party must bring in to the fold if we have any hope of being relevant in the future,” Ellis said, warning “there will be trouble ahead,” including “a very real possibility of a third party.”
A surge of activism is playing out in traditionally obscure local party elections that place party members on committees responsible for making endorsements, which directly determine which candidates the party spends money on. Such Assembly District Delegate elections — often called ""ADems"" — used to be low-turnout affairs attended by a small universe of politically-connected players, but now attract a bloom of grassroots Democrats.
“Ten years ago you couldn’t find 20 people to show up to an ADem election, but I think people see that there’s something wrong and they’re not exactly sure what it is so they’re getting involved,” said Bill Wong, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon’s chief political consultant.
After an upwelling of enthusiasm attributed largely to Bernie Sanders acolytes brought a wave of new delegates into local slates in 2017, the landscape has shifted again after 2019 elections: Of the 80 Assembly slates, only a handful have retained at least half of their 2017 makeup.
Party insiders are trading information on where progressives prevailed and where more traditional, candidate-aligned slates took hold. Some are feeling discouraged.
“A lot of progressives say 2017 was A New Hope, 2019 was The Empire Strikes Back,” said RL Miller, a longtime party activist.
California Democrats point to multiple instances in the last few years where a restive base has clashed with elected officials. Democratic dominance, combined with a primary system in which the top two vote-getters advance regardless of party, has meant more Democrat-on-Democrat contests.
Last year, the Democratic Party of Sacramento County voted to remove three local elected officials for endorsing the incumbent district attorney, who was a registered Republican when she ran for reelection. The move was assailed by some Democrats as a counterintuitive purity test.
“I thought that was a bad decision, and those members who are my colleagues are great Democrats,” said Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, who as a state senator was head of the Democratic caucus. “If we’re going to have strict litmus tests on many things, then I think we are doing ourselves a disservice.”
Few issues have exposed fissures more than the pursuit of single-payer health care, a progressive dream that is now embraced by presidential candidates and a new wave of House members. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon faced fierce backlash when he shelved a single-payer bill last year, and a state senator who had voted against the measure was briefly threatened with an election challenge.
For Democrats who work for elected officials, the single-payer fracture in particular has crystallized a more treacherous landscape in which activists have policies “established as litmus tests to criticize the Legislature,” Wong said, without concern for ""whether or not that’s doable.”
Mounting pressure from the party’s political arm is making legislators more nervous about the consequences of taking the wrong position, a senior legislative staffer told POLITICO.
“AOC took out an incumbent,"" the staffer said, referring to freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . ""I don’t think this is something that’s unique to California. You’re seeing this movement across the country, especially in the safer Democratic districts.”
“It’s a tough time to be a legislator,” the staffer added, “because you have this pull toward the left with a much more vocal and engaged party, but then you also have this counterbalance of the fear of what happens when you take a vote that could be messaged very simply and cause outrage among voters.”
Those tensions erupted last year after legislative leadership introduced a measure that would have allowed them to control new campaign committees — effectively circumventing a system in which party endorsements determine where party money can be spent.
The bill was defeated after a backlash among activists, but Daraka Larimore-Hall — a longtime party official also running for chair — said that type of power play is a central justification for his campaign to be chair, calling the measure “a perfect example of some folks in the legislative leadership or staff just thinking that this whole small-d democratic process is a pain in the butt, and wouldn’t it be easier if the experts just picked the candidates and directed the big money to support them.”
“I really think a lot of people in the party underestimate how existential this question is,” Larimore-Hall said. “The party and legislative leaders and their caucuses have overlapping but distinct goals: their goal is to protect incumbents no matter what, ours is to evaluate candidates and electeds and support those who get the majority out of their activists behind them. Nine times out of 10 that’s the same thing, but that one time is really important for having a democratic process.”
Los Angeles County Labor Federation president Rusty Hicks, who is also running for party chair, said in an interview with POLITICO that his time in organized labor has included vetting candidates to see if they had “strayed from the values we thought we were on the same page with” and, in some cases, opposing those who had.
His history demonstrates one source of tension within the party’s base: conflict between environmentalists who advocate far-reaching climate change policies and unions worried about job losses. Party activists note that Hicks, in his capacity as a union official, last year signed a letter opposing a proposed regulation to ban modified hydrofluoric acid on the grounds it could eliminate thousands of jobs.
People underscored that intraparty tensions are cyclical: Just as pro-Sanders and anti-Trump sentiment have brought in a new wave of progressives, so too did Barack Obama’s insurgent bid and Howard Dean’s before that.
While it's not a new phenomenon, Andrew Acosta, a Democratic campaign consultant, pointed to diminished deference to incumbency, with people no longer in “awe of the assemblyman or the congressman.”
“This last election cycle I had people contacting me out of the blue,” Acosta said, “and they would say, ‘I want to run against congressman so-and-so or assemblyman so-and-so’ and I would say, ‘Why?’ And they would say, ‘Why not?'"""
Kasich says there's 'no path' to the White House for him in 2020 - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/john-kasich-2020-elections-1348649,"Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Friday quashed the idea of him launching a presidential run, arguing there is “no path” to the White House for him in 2020.
“I don't see a way to get there,” said Kasich, one of Trump’s challengers in the 2016 Republican primary. The former governor claimed on CNN that 90 percent of GOP voters support the president’s reelection efforts.
So far, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the lone Republican mounting a challenge against Trump for the GOP nomination in 2020. Names floated as other potential contenders include Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and, recently, Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan Republican who called on Congress to launch an impeachment inquiry into the president.
At a conference in Detroit on Thursday, Kasich did not completely rule out the possibility of running in 2020. “I can’t predict what’s going to happen in my life,” he said, according to The Detroit News .
Kasich for months has said “all of my options are still on the table.” Last year, he said he was “very seriously” considering a presidential bid.
But the Ohio Republican said Friday he’s “never gotten involved in a political race where I didn't think I could win.”
“Right now, there's no path,” he added. “But we never know what the future is going to bring.”
Kasich has been a vocal critic of the president since the 2016 campaign, becoming a leader in the anti-Trump contingent of the GOP since the election.
This has sparked the ire of the president, who has taken a number of jabs at Kasich and in December said he hopes Republicans challenge him in 2020.
“I think I have the greatest base in the history of politics,” Trump said at the time.
Kasich carried Ohio by more than 200,000 votes in the 2016 primary but fell flat elsewhere. The former governor has presented himself as a more moderate Republican.
On Friday, Kasich gave the Trump administration some credit for the country’s strong economy but criticized him for his handling of major issues, including the president’s recent decision to impose tariffs on Mexico in attempt to improve border security.
“The single biggest thing they did that made sense was to deregulate a lot of things, which the Obama administration was regulatory heavy,” Kasich said. “That has really worked. But you look at the chaos in the trade area, you look at the overhang of debt. These things — somebody’s going to have to deal with them at some point.”"

Nadler: 'There certainly is' justification for impeaching Trump,www.politico.com,Andrew Desiderio,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/31/nadler-there-certainly-is-justification-for-impeaching-trump-1035368,"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Friday that there “certainly is” justification for launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, but cautioned that the public first must agree that it’s warranted.
“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” Nadler (D-N.Y.) said during an appearance on WNYC. “The American people right now do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts. We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”
Nadler emphasized that he intends to use the next few weeks to bring special counsel Robert Mueller’s report “to life,” providing for a television audience the dramatic evidence that Mueller compiled about Trump’s efforts to thwart the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Part of that will include testimony from Mueller himself, Nadler said, even if Mueller sticks to his promise to limit his comments to the findings of his report.
Nadler said revealing Mueller’s words and findings to a television audience would educate Americans about the president’s conduct in a way they haven’t been to this point.
“Part of the function of Congress, just the same as the Watergate hearings 40 years ago, [is] to have a dialogue with the American people so people can make informed decisions and know what’s going on,” he said. Nadler added, “It’s very important that he, to a television audience and to the American people, state it and answer questions about it, even if there is no new information.”
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has so far firmly resisted mounting calls from Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump, worrying that such moves could endanger vulnerable House Democrats and arguing that the House must continue to investigate Trump.
But 11 of the 24 Democrats on Nadler’s Judiciary Committee — which has jurisdiction over impeachment — have already demanded Democrats begin proceedings to remove the president, and that number has risen sharply in recent weeks. Nadler said he intends to confer with them and other Democrats next week to determine whether an impeachment inquiry would be an appropriate step.
Nadler’s comments also reflected his colleagues’ deep frustration that the White House has been resisting myriad Democrat-led investigations into Trump’s actions and personal finances, to the point of slowing them down — a fact that has pro-impeachment Democrats worried that the window for impeaching Trump will close as the 2020 presidential campaign gets to full speed.
But Nadler said there might be a reason to seek Trump’s impeachment in 2020, even with the presidential election underway.
“There might still be a point to it. That point is to say to future presidents you cannot do this, to vindicate the Constitution and say there's certain things that can’t be done,” he said, adding, “Even in those circumstances, it might be well worth carrying on impeachment.""
Nadler also said he believes that Mueller could have stated whether Trump committed obstruction of justice — despite Mueller’s reliance on the Justice Department’s long-standing policy that prohibits the indictment of a sitting president.
“I think that he could’ve accused him anyway,” Nadler said. But, he added, “That is his interpretation of his ethical duty under the Justice Department guidelines.”
Mueller also stated that he believed it would have been unfair to accuse Trump of a crime if the president is unable to defend himself in court. Instead, Mueller said “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing” — a reference to impeachment.

A set of talking points prepared in October 2016 by Mike Boston, a former U.S. intelligence officer working with Flynn, indicate that “the client” backing the lobbying project complained that the GOP nominee had not gone to bat for Turkey. At the time, Flynn was also serving as a top foreign policy adviser to Trump.

“Republican Presidential candidate has not defended subject’s home country publicly. He should specifically ask questions about subject’s operations and funding,” Boston wrote under the heading “CLIENT FEEDBACK.”
The memo was obtained during special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and has now become part of the criminal case against former Flynn business partner Bijan Rafiekian, who was indicted last December for acting as an unregistered agent for Turkey in the U.S. and a related conspiracy charge.
Rafiekian, also known simply as Kian, has pleaded not guilty and is set to go on trial in July in federal court in Alexandria, Va.
The talking points prepared for Flynn less than a month before the 2016 presidential election track with other, handwritten notes Mueller obtained that indicate the critique was offered by Ekim Alptekin, the Turkish businessman who hired Flynn’s Flynn Intelligence Group to try to change attitudes in the U.S. about Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish dissident cleric who has lived for decades in Pennsylvania.
“Trump didn’t defend Turkey publically,” the notes say. “Potentially ask questions about $.”
Boston’s memo also makes another mention of the need to boost Turkey’s political clout with the incoming president.
“Start a strategic outreach campaign for the next President ... regardless of party,” he wrote, describing a discussion with Alptekin on Oct. 7, 2016.
Alptekin was also charged in the indictment filed against Rafiekian last December by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Alexandria. The indictment charges that both men were on the call Boston summarized.
Flynn was not charged in the indictment, but when he pleaded guilty in 2017 to a single felony count of making false statements to the FBI, he also admitted to providing inaccurate information to the Justice Department about his work related to Turkey.
An email accompanying the talking points says they were intended to be shared with Flynn, but it’s not clear that they were.
Flynn is expected to be a key witness against Kian at his trial. Alptekin remains at large and is not expected to appear at the upcoming trial.
Defense lawyers for Kian have indicated plans to aggressively challenge Flynn’s credibility, pointing to what they say are numerous lies by the former Defense Intelligence Agency chief who served for 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for allegedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence.
The newly disclosed documents could provide further fodder to attack Flynn as someone who was seeking to profit off his connection to the Trump campaign.
Attorneys for Flynn and for Kian did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
The memos indicate that part of the work done through the project included investigating alleged financial ties between Gulen’s schools and supporters and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
Those points made it into an op-ed piece Flynn published on the day of the 2016 election. The article included a video of President Bill Clinton calling Gulen a “friend” and noting that a foundation backing pro-Gulen charter schools in the U.S. has also made donations to the Clinton Foundation.
Flynn’s team also boasted of getting the anti-Gulen message out in the media, including having a negative Los Angeles Times story about some of the charter schools cited in the “syllabus” section of an October 2016 edition of POLITICO’s Morning Education newsletter.
The documents were filed publicly on Thursday as part of a motion by prosecutors to get the judge in the case to allow them to present evidence of Kian’s discussions with attorneys about the lobbying efforts. Flynn Intelligence Group filed reports under the Lobbying Disclosure Act about the work, but made no mention that Turkish government officials had played any part in the project. In March 2017, FIG filed a belated Foreign Agents Registration Act disclosure providing more details about the engagement and saying it may have benefited Turkish interests.
The Turkish government blamed Gulen for a coup attempt in July 2016 and sought his extradition from the U.S., a request that was denied. Gulen has denied involvement in the unrest."
Schiff to intel community: Share info on Barr's attempts to declassify docs,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/adam-schiff-william-barr-declassify-documents-1349063,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff demanded on Friday that the nation’s intelligence community report to Congress any effort by Attorney General William Barr to declassify national security secrets over its objections.
Schiff made his demand in a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, calling on Coats to brief his committee in person and to share any information that Barr has requested as part of a review of the origins of the FBI’s investigation of links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Last month, Barr announced his intention to review the decisions that led to the Russia probe, which later was taken over by Mueller. But Democrats have argued the effort is a politically driven attempt to appease Trump and feed his unsupported claims that the FBI was attempting to mount a “coup” against him.
Earlier this month, Trump granted Barr broad authority to declassify any material he needs to conduct that review, prompting outrage among Democrats who say such sweeping authority could damage national security.
“This approach threatens national security by subverting longstanding rules and practices that obligate you and other heads of IC agencies to safeguard sources and methods and prevent the politicization of intelligence and law enforcement,” Schiff wrote.
Schiff's letter came a week after Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) sent a similar letter to Coats, as well as the heads of the FBI, CIA and NSA. He urged the intelligence community leaders to inform the House and Senate Intelligence Committees if Barr's efforts threatened their agencies' morale, independence or capabilities.
Warner said he's particularly concerned that Barr's review could chill sources' willingness to work with U.S. intelligence or spook foreign intelligence agencies from cooperating with the United States.
In his letter, Schiff insisted his committee would conduct “rigorous oversight” of Barr’s efforts and asked that Coats keep him apprised of what material Barr has requested or any other information the attorney general conveyed to intelligence agencies about his review. He also asked Coats to provide to Congress any documents shared with Barr and to notify lawmakers prior to any declassification decision.
Schiff also asked Coats to identify specific moves by Barr to declassify material over the objections of the intelligence community — and to inform Congress of what harm might come to national security as a result."
Explainer: China’s manufacturing outlook weakens showing economic slump is yet to hit bottom,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/china-manufacturing-economic-slump-1495334,"This story is being published as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post. It originally appeared on scmp.com on June 1, 2019.
China’s manufacturing outlook took a sharp downturn in May, suggesting that the economic slump has yet to reach bottom, analysts said.
Story Continued Below
The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index is a gauge of sentiment among factory operators and is based on a survey, the responses to which are aggregated into a number. A number above 50 signifies a positive economic outlook, while below 50 means sentiment is in contraction.
May’s figure was 49.4, the first time the manufacturing PMI has slipped into negative territory since February and a sign that the effects of the U.S.-China trade war are being felt among the country’s producers. In April, manufacturing PMI was 50.1, with the reading for May lower than analysts’ expectations of 49.9.
Significantly, the biggest drops were in new orders, which were down to 49.8 from 51.4, and new export orders, which dropped to 46.5 in May from 49.2 in April. This means factories are expecting lower sales and to produce fewer goods.
The employment sub-index of the manufacturing PMI also dropped from 47.2 to 47.0, the lowest reading since March 2009, a sign that factories are generally not expecting to hire more staff.
The figures suggest that manufacturers in China are preparing for a downturn due to the collapse in trade talks between the United States and China, which will result in an increase in both the level and scale of tariffs on Chinese imports to the U.S..
As of June 1, U.S.$200 billion of Chinese goods to the U.S. will be subject to a 25 percent tariff, up from 10 percent previously. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently processing a new tariff of up to 25 percent on a further U.S.$300 billion of Chinese goods, meaning that with the exception of certain pharmaceutical goods and rare earth minerals, which are vital in the production of certain hi-tech goods, all Chinese exports to the U.S. are now under tariff.
“The sharp deterioration of the official manufacturing PMI confirms our more cautious views that downside pressures remain strong, growth has yet to truly bottom out, the double risk is quite real and Beijing cannot afford to stop easing. With a rapid escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions, worsening employment and deteriorating growth prospects, we expect Beijing to ramp up easing/stimulus measures in coming months to stabilise growth and employment,” said analysts from Japanese bank Nomura.
Also released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday was the non-manufacturing PMI, which covers the services and construction sectors, and which remained the same as last month at 54.3, in line with the expectations of analysts. The composite PMI, which combines both manufacturing and services activity, was 53.3 in May, a slight decrease on 53.4 a month earlier.
Again, these numbers point to prevailing fragility in the Chinese economy, despite the fact that it remains in slightly positive territory. It also suggests that the successive rounds of stimulus, which saw cuts to interbank interest rates and measures aimed at encouraging banks to lend more money to small businesses, are beginning to fade.
It might also suggest that more government support is on the horizon, as Beijing looks to shore up the economy.
“The sub-index for the service sector edged up. But this was offset by a further decline in the sub-index for construction to a 15-month low, which suggests that infrastructure spending may be losing steam as the front-loading of fiscal support wanes,” said Julian-Evans-Pritchard, China analyst at Capital Economics."
Trump’s two-front trade war triggers alarms,www.politico.com,BEN WHITE,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trumps-trade-tariffs-mexico-1495449,"President Donald Trump’s decision to open a second front in his trade war sent tremors through global markets, unnerved corporate America and spurred economists to raise new warnings about the potential for a sharp economic slowdown just as the 2020 presidential contest heats up.
Trump’s surprise Thursday night threat to impose tariffs — beginning at 5 percent and potentially rising as high as 25 percent on Mexican exports to the United States — also threatened to raise consumer prices on everything from avocados to blue jeans to automobiles.
The fresh trade war salvo came with markets already sagging on fear of an escalating battle with China and economists wondering whether the American economy could withstand the impact of bruising fights with two of the country’s biggest trading partners.
“A two-front trade war is clearly negative for growth, and I don’t know how our trade officials even have the bandwidth to deal with it,” said Megan Greene, global chief economist at investment firm Manulife. “It’s not just millennials not being able to afford their avocado toast. Auto parts in particular go back and forth several times before they get to the final product, and if each time you have to add a tax to that, it’s going to compress margins and could even put some smaller firms out of business.”
Trump’s announcement, born of his deep frustration at what he perceives as Mexico’s unwillingness to do anything to stop the flow of migrants to the U.S. border, poses its most direct threat to integrated supply chains that depend on the free flow of goods across the border, especially the automotive industry.
Around two-thirds of U.S. imports from Mexico, which totaled $371.9 billion last year, were “related-party” trade, meaning companies bringing in parts and products as part of their supply chain, according to data compiled by Deutsche Bank. The U.S. imported $124 billion in auto products from Mexico in 2018, which includes new and used passenger vehicles; medium, heavy and other trucks; and auto parts, according to the International Trade Administration.
Some auto parts cross the border as many as eight or nine times before becoming finished products, potentially opening up auto giants including GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler to tariffs exponentially higher than the headline number.
“The most important and the second most important and the third most important part of this is cars, car parts, trucks and buses,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. “This has everything to do with the auto industry, which is by far the biggest beneficiary of our relationship with Mexico and where you will see the most pain if this goes through.”
On any given day, more than $452 million worth of auto parts are traded in either direction across the U.S.-Mexico border, said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association.
“Our members flourish in an atmosphere of certainty,” said Wilson, adding that Trump’s other tariffs on China, steel and aluminum, and the threat of penalties on all imports of autos and auto parts, have already impacted investment and hiring decisions by her group’s 1,000 member companies.
The big three automakers fought hard for adoption of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump’s successor to NAFTA, which now awaits an uncertain fate in Congress. And they have strongly opposed Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on auto imports from Japan and the European Union.
The companies also celebrated earlier this month when Trump agreed to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, which raised their production costs. They now face a new and perhaps graver threat. Deutsche Bank estimated the Mexico tariffs could raise the cost of vehicles sold in the U.S. by about $1,300.
Business groups in Washington quickly slammed Trump’s decision, which White House officials indicated came after a haphazard internal process and against the advice of some of the president’s more free trade-oriented advisers.
“Intertwining difficult trade, tariff and immigration issues creates a Molotov cocktail of policy, and America’s manufacturing workers should not be forced to suffer because of the failure to fix our immigration system,” National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said in a prepared statement. “These proposed tariffs would have devastating consequences on manufacturers in America and on American consumers.” The Business Roundtable said unilateral tariffs on Mexico would be a “grave error.”
“These tariffs will be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement .
Shares in all three automakers fell on Friday. GM, which has the most exposure to Mexico, dropped over 4 percent. Fiat Chrysler shares fell nearly 6 percent and Ford ended down about 2 percent.
The broader market also took a hit from Trump’s announcement with the Dow closing down 354 points, or 1.4 percent, on Friday following fears about the deepening trade battles and a more uncertain future for the USMCA. The S&P and Nasdaq also dropped over 1 percent.
Bond yields also fell and prices rose as investors fled to safer assets while the trade wars intensified and the outlook for global growth darkened.
The selling, which began in Asia and in U.S. futures after Trump’s announcement Thursday night, capped a brutal month for stocks that saw the Dow drop 1,777 points, or nearly 7 percent. The broader S&P is also dropped nearly 7 percent percent on the month, and the tech-laden Nasdaq fell close to 8 percent.
“This is a colossal blunder,” said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. He said the advice of Peter Navarro, one of Trump's top trade advisers who favors liberal use of tariffs, “is wrongheaded and sinking his president.”
Much of the selling began in early May after talks with the Chinese about a trade deal broke down and Trump threatened to impose tariffs of 25 percent on over $500 billion in exports to the U.S. from China. China has promised sharp retaliation both directly through raising the level of existing tariffs on all exports from the United States — notably farm products like soybeans — and by making it harder for U.S. firms to do business in the country and potentially limiting U.S. access to rare earth minerals used in a range of high-tech and defense industry products.
Trump’s move on Mexico raises uncertainty for businesses considering investments and clouds the outlook for corporate profits and stock prices, investors said. “This is just the latest worry to put on the fire for investors. The big question at the end of the day, though, is can we really fight two trade wars at the same time?” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, in a note to clients Friday.
The potential impact from the proposed Mexican tariffs would extend well beyond automakers.
U.S. kitchens and cupboards could also take a huge hit from an across-the-board tariff. The tariff cuts made possible by NAFTA opened the U.S. border to Mexico’s year-round growing season and a cheap supply of produce. Nearly half the fruits and vegetables the U.S. imports come from Mexico, according to Commerce Department data. It could also hit oil imports. The U.S. imported over $14 billion in crude oil from Mexico last year. Oil prices suffered their worst monthly decline in six months as the trade disputes threatened global growth and thus raised questions about demand for fuel.
U.S. produce importers said Americans could pay an extra $3 billion for avocados, tomatoes, mangoes and other fruits and vegetables if the tariff goes up to 25 percent.
“This is a tax on healthy diets, plain and simple,” said Lance Jungmeyer, president of the Fresh Produce Association of the Americas, an Arizona-based group that represents companies that import and transport produce from Mexico.
But the pain doesn’t stop in the produce section. Nearly a third of sugar imported into the U.S. comes from Mexico, and a cost increase could send a price shock through food and beverage supply chains. The U.S. meat industry imported more than $840 million worth of live animals, primarily cattle to fatten and slaughter for U.S. consumers.
U.S. pork producers are already reeling from retaliatory tariffs Mexico only recently lifted after Trump agreed to drop steel and aluminum tariffs to ease passage of his new NAFTA deal.
“Over the last year, trade disputes with Mexico and China have cost hard-working U.S. pork producers and their families approximately $2.5 billion,” the National Pork Producers Council President David Herring said in a statement.
Rather than Trump opening a new front in his global trade war, U.S. farmers and ranchers desperately want ratification of Trump’s NAFTA replacement deal. The renegotiation of America’s largest trade deal has caused nearly two years of anxiety among U.S. producers over future access to their two largest export markets.
Business groups on Friday also once again rejected claims made by Trump that other countries pay the cost of tariffs he imposes. “A 5 percent increase is noticeable and will hit people’s pocketbooks,” said the U.S. Chamber's Bradley.
“There’s no money coming from Mexico,” he said. “Every dime of the tariff is going to be paid by an American consumer and an American business.”
The overall impact of across-the-board tariffs with Mexico, coupled with the reaction in financial markets and fear over the escalating tariff battle, has economists warning more strongly about a potential slowdown. The economy grew at a 3.1 percent annual pace in the first quarter, but forecasts made before the Mexico announcement mostly predict growth of 2 percent or less in the second quarter. And they would likely go lower if Trump follows through and Mexico responds.
“If this is implemented fully, then the probability of a recession has increased significantly,” said Deutsche Bank's Slok.

"Buttigieg campaign, brimming with cash, staffs up",www.politico.com,DANIEL STRAUSS,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/pete-buttigieg-2020-election-campaign-1349301,"South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign has come a long way from its humble roots.
Over the past few weeks, Buttigieg has brought on a host of new staffers to bolster his rapidly growing operation. The campaign recently snagged Hillary for America alum George Hornedo as national delegate director. And, with a swagger more often seen in Silicon Valley startups, it’s even hired something called a “chief innovation officer” — former Google senior engineer Ann Mei Chang — and a creative director, Obama White House alum Jillian Maryonovich.
The campaign has also bolstered its communications staff, led by hard-charging New York operative Lis Smith. It recently brought on Nina Smith (no relation) as its national traveling press secretary and added two deputy national press secretaries: Tess Whittlesey and Marisol Samayoa. Constance Boozer has been hired as surrogate communications director and Manuel Bonder has joined the campaign as media monitor.
Some of Buttigeig’s hires have turned heads in the insular world of Democratic operatives. For example, earlier this month, veteran Democratic ad makers Larry Grisolano and John Del Cecato of AKPD Message and Media signed on to consult for the campaign. Grisolano served as director of paid media and opinion research for Obama in 2008.
As of May 31, the Buttigieg presidential team has expanded dramatically from a shoestring operation with just a few employees. Now, the campaign numbers about 80 staffers — 55 percent of them women — after rocketing out of the first three months of the year with a $7 million fundraising haul. Reflecting its growth and maturation, the campaign this week held a retreat and rolled out a set of guiding principles for staff.
Buttigieg’s poll numbers have risen along with his payroll. A POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted from May 20 to May 26 found him tied for fourth place among the nearly two dozen Democratic candidates running for president at 7 percent, along with Sen. Kamala Harris. Ahead of those two, the poll found, are former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren."
Judge blocks Missouri from closing lone abortion clinic,www.politico.com,RACHANA PRADHAN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/judge-blocks-missouri-closing-abortion-clinic-1495681,"A Missouri judge on Friday temporarily blocked state officials from shuttering the state's only abortion clinic, just hours before its license to perform the procedure was set to expire.
The decision prevents Missouri, at least for a few days, from becoming the first state without an abortion clinic since the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. Had the judge not intervened, the clinic, a Planned Parenthood facility in St. Louis, would have been forced to stop providing abortions by midnight if the state hadn't renewed its license.
Missouri Gov. Mike Parson and state health officials contended that the clinic had numerous violations that must be addressed before its license could be renewed. Planned Parenthood said the state was unlawfully conditioning its decision on a routine license renewal application on a vague and politically motivated investigation.
Judge Michael Stelzer scheduled another hearing on the clinic's license for Tuesday. In his decision, Stelzer said the temporary restraining order was necessary to “prevent irreparable injury” to Planned Parenthood while the state and the women’s health provider sort out the larger licensing dispute.
""Following today’s ruling, the State will soon have the opportunity for a prompt legal review of our state health regulators' serious health and safety concerns regarding Planned Parenthood’s abortion facility in St. Louis,"" Parson said in a statement. ""We are committed to and take seriously our duty to ensure that all health facilities in Missouri follow the law, abide by regulations, and protect the safety of patients.""
Missouri is one of six states with just one clinic providing abortions, according to an analysis from Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. The state this month outlawed most abortions after eight weeks of pregnancy, joining a raft of states enacting early abortion bans. Lower courts have regularly blocked those bans, but conservatives are hoping the new wave of laws will trigger a Supreme Court challenge that could upend Roe v. Wade .
Missouri health officials said there was at least one incident at the abortion clinic in which patient safety “was gravely compromised."" They also said there were instances of failed surgical abortions in which patients remained pregnant, as well as a failure to obtain a patient's ""informed consent.""
The state also demanded interviews with seven physicians, including trainees, who have performed abortions at the clinic. Two agreed to interviews, but Planned Parenthood said it could not compel the others because they are not employed by the organization.
Planned Parenthood executives accused state officials of orchestrating an unfounded probe to stamp out abortion in a state that has strong restrictions limiting access to the procedure.
“Today is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over,"" Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen said in a statement. ""We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here—and in the rest of the country."""
Chinese companies under threat in U.S. stock market over ties to suppression,www.politico.com,PATRICK TEMPLE-WEST,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/chinese-companies-stock-market-1490000,"Two Chinese surveillance equipment makers, already facing the threat of Trump administration sanctions for helping China's government suppress dissent, are coming under pressure from lawmakers over their access to U.S. investors.
Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Dahua Technology are indirectly attracting the savings of American investors and pensioners unaware that they’re supporting the firms because their shares are included in broad global indexes of companies. More than 200 U.S. investment funds hold shares of Hikvision, one of the world’s biggest makers of video surveillance equipment, or Dahua Technology.
Story Continued Below
The amount of investment they receive is relatively minor, but growing criticism from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and other lawmakers is significant because it could open up the financial markets as a new front in the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.
The two companies, among the Chinese businesses that the Commerce Department is targeting for possible trade restrictions, are under fire in the U.S. for their role in the mass internment and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Rubio is exploring legislation that would require Chinese companies to disclose more information about their ties to their government’s security apparatus, according to a spokesperson. The Florida Republican's interest follows a letter that he and a bipartisan group of more than three dozen Senate and House members sent to the Trump administration in April saying the U.S. “should establish strengthened disclosure requirements” for these and other companies.
“Americans would likely be very troubled, if not outraged, to learn that their retirement and other investment dollars are funding Chinese companies with links to the Chinese government’s security apparatus and malevolent behavior,” read the letter. It was signed by a wide range of lawmakers, from liberal firebrand and 2020 presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to Freedom Caucus conservative Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.)
“There will be more activity on this. There will be more pressure on the regulatory authorities” such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Michael Wessel, a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a congressional panel that monitors trade and national security issues with China.
“We have some authorities that are not being used and the SEC should be more aggressive in doing it,” Wessel said.
Hikvision and Dahua Technology, whose shares trade on China's Shenzhen stock exchange, face the risk that the Trump administration will force most of the company’s U.S. suppliers to obtain a special license for export transactions, POLITICO has reported .
Hikvision said in a statement that it “takes these (U.S.) concerns very seriously and has engaged with the U.S. government regarding all of this since last October.""
A representative from Dahua Technology, which has an office in Irvine, Calif., could not immediately be reached for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent years, Hikvision and Dahua Technology have benefited from U.S. investor dollars flowing into China following the liberalization of stock market rules there to give foreign investors access to shares of domestic firms. In 2018, MSCI, a popular U.S.-based stock market index provider, opened some of its indexes to more shares of domestic Chinese companies, including Hikvision and Dahua Technology.
That meant more U.S. investors' savings are indirectly funding Chinese companies, said Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.
“People might not be aware of what’s in them,” Solomon said of the indexes. “You might not be happy that you’re in a company that is really the central keystone of a surveillance state,” he said.
About 182 U.S. investment funds contain Hikvision shares, according to Morningstar, a data provider, in an analysis for POLITICO. The T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Stock Fund holds the most Hikvision shares with about 24 million as of May 30. About 43 funds hold Dahua Technology shares, according to Morningstar.
Stock market indexes, such as the S&P 500, play an important role in the market because most asset managers use these as performance benchmarks.
While investors' exposure to these Chinese companies has been growing, the firms still make up only a small part of the global indexes.
For example, the iShares MSCI All Country World Index ETF is one of the top 80-largest exchange traded funds in the U.S. by assets under management, but only 0.01 percent of the fund consisted of Hikvision shares for a notional value of $1 million, according to BlackRock Inc., which owns the iShares ETFs.
Hikvision also comprises 0.02 percent of the iShares MSCI Emerging Market ETF, one of the top 25 largest exchange traded funds. The fund holds about 1.3 million Hikvision shares.
But the U.S. exposure to Chinese companies increases for ETFs that are focused specifically on China. Hikvision is a top-15 holding in the iShares MSCI China A ETF, which has about $143 million of assets. The ETF, which debuted in 2016, holds about 153,000 shares of Dahua Technology."
"Pot banking backers push hemp, 'Choke Point' plans to lure GOP votes - POLITICO",www.politico.com,ZACHARY WARMBRODT,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/pot-banking-backers-push-hemp-choke-point-measures-to-lure-gop-votes-1485882,"Backers of landmark legislation that would empower banks to enter the cannabis industry are considering expanding the bill to win over skeptical Republican lawmakers.
Among their pitches: offering greater protection for products derived from hemp, a cannabis plant used to make textiles as well as cannabidiol — a growing industry in Sen. Mitch McConnell's Kentucky — and preventing any revival of an Obama-era program that GOP lawmakers say targeted payday lenders and gun retailers.
With the House expected to vote on the bill in the coming weeks, Democrats and Republicans who support the banking overhaul are talking with GOP lawmakers who are uncomfortable with easing federal restrictions on marijuana but say they may come around if these other issues are addressed in the legislation.
The bill, which would protect banks doing business with the cannabis industry in states where the drug is legal, already has significant bipartisan support. But running up the number of Republican votes could bolster efforts to sell the legislation in the GOP-led Senate, where senior Republicans are wary of taking it up because federal law lists marijuana as a controlled dangerous substance.
""The stronger showing we have in the House, the better our chances in the Senate,"" said Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), the lead sponsor of the legislation.
The fact that greater numbers of Republicans may be in play, including those who previously opposed the bill, illustrates how fluid the politics around marijuana have become as states across the country legalize cannabis products. The struggle to win over more Republicans for a narrow, industry-backed bill also underscores the obstacles looming for cannabis legalization at the federal level.
The bill is a high priority for the banking industry, and enactment during this session of Congress would be a major victory. Banks and credit unions are lobbying for the legislation because of concerns that federal regulators will penalize them for serving cannabis businesses now legal at the state level. They're supporting the stopgap measure because it's unclear when the federal ban at the heart of the conflict will be lifted.
The potential amendments that House lawmakers are considering may not only increase the GOP vote tally but may also address priorities like hemp for McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and a controversial program under President Barack Obama's Justice Department that was known as ""Operation Choke Point"" for Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).
One proposal would extend the bill's financial services safe harbor to products derived from hemp, a non-intoxicating plant whose fibers can be used for clothing, plastics and rope that was removed last year from the Controlled Substances list.
Rep. Andy Barr, who opposes marijuana legalization and voted against the cannabis banking bill in committee, said he has had extensive discussions with Perlmutter about adding protections for hemp products.
Barr, a Kentucky Republican, said he’s responding to concerns that credit card processors can’t differentiate between cannabidiol derived from industrial hemp and marijuana. Otherwise known as CBD, the cannabis product has grown increasingly popular as a treatment for a range of health issues.
If the legislation addressed hurdles that hemp businesses face when accessing credit card processing services and banking, ""then that helps me get to a yes,"" Barr said.
""They need Republicans on this bill,"" he said.
The other potential addition being discussed would prohibit regulatory agencies from pressuring banks into cutting off customers because they're out of favor politically.
The proposal, which the House passed 395-2 as a standalone bill in 2017, is intended to prevent the potential comeback of Operation Choke Point.
Choke Point sought to cut off fraudulent merchants from the financial system, but Republican critics argued for years that it discouraged banks from serving a range of lawful businesses, including small-dollar lenders and gun sellers.
Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-Mo.), who has been driving the legislation, is talking with Perlmutter about adding it to the cannabis banking bill.
Luetkemeyer voted against the marijuana banking bill in committee and said he still isn't convinced that it would solve banks' legal problems with cannabis.
But he may come around to supporting it as a vehicle to cement the end of Choke Point.
Barr predicted that Perlmutter would be able to win over ""a lot more Republicans, especially in the Senate"" if a Choke Point amendment were added.
""If it's a chance to get my bill across the finish line, it's something that we need to consider,"" Luetkemeyer said.
The bill in the House has 184 co-sponsors, including 20 Republicans. Perlmutter said he hoped to add about a dozen more members to the list.
""You want it to be as broad-based and solid a vote as possible to have momentum and open the eyes of folks over in the Senate side,"" Perlmutter said.
Five GOP senators are co-sponsoring the Senate version. The Republican lead in the Senate is Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection next year in a state with a major cannabis industry.
""We've had a lot of good discussions about it over here with a number of members,"" Gardner said.
Though the White House has not yet announced its position on Perlmutter's legislation, said last year that he “probably will end up supporting” a separate Gardner bill that would shield cannabis businesses from federal restrictions if they're complying with state or tribal laws allowing the sale of marijuana.
One prominent hurdle in the Senate is Crapo, who leads the Senate Banking Committee. The Idaho Republican has so far been unwilling to commit to taking up the legislation.
""As long as cannabis is illegal under federal law, it seems to me to be difficult for us to resolve the issue,"" he said in April.
But Crapo has also been one of the most prominent critics of the Choke Point program. In an interview, he said he would be interested in any vehicle that would stop it from coming back to life, though he's unsure the amendment would change his approach to cannabis legislation.
Bank trade groups from all 50 states and Puerto Rico wrote to Crapo recently and urged him to move forward with hearings on their cannabis concerns.
""I don't feel pressure,"" he said. ""I'm looking at it but I haven't made any decisions."""
Trump weighing proposal that could deny asylum to thousands,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-shift/2019/05/31/trump-weighing-proposal-that-could-deny-asylum-to-thousands-442357," Quick Fix — Trump’s Homeland Security advisers are mulling a proposal that would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Story Continued Below
— A new court filing suggests Trump officials knew that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census could favor Republicans in redistricting.
— Unionized staff at the Service Employees International Union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union Thursday.
GOOD MORNING! It’s Friday, May 31, Your Morning Shift author is headed off to the Big Easy for the next week. Don’t worry, Ted Hesson and Ian Kullgren will have you covered. Send , and tnoah@politico.com . Follow us on Twitter at @RebeccaARainey , @tedhesson , @IanKullgren , and @TimothyNoah1 .
Driving the Day NEW PROPOSAL COULD DENY ASYLUM TO THOUSANDS: “President Donald Trump is considering sweeping restrictions on asylum that would effectively block Central American migrants from entering the U.S.,” POLITICO’s Ian Kullgren, Ted Hesson and Anita Kumar report. A draft proposal circulating among DHS advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have traveled through a country other than their own before coming to the U.S. — a policy which would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border.
While Trump aides say the changes can be made through an administrative rule, they are also seeking a legislative fix in Trump’s new immigration bill , a move that would be far less vulnerable to a court challenge that advocates for immigrants are expected to file. The White House expects to release the legislation in the coming days.
Trump hinted at immigration changes Thursday as he departed for Colorado, telling reporters he is ""going to do something very dramatic on the border."" Late Thursday night Trump announced that he would impose a 5 percent tariff next week on all imports from Mexico until the country addresses the influx of migrants coming to the United States.""The president said he would give Mexico one year to curb illegal border crossings before pulling the trigger on new tariffs,"" Kullgren writes, ""a softening of his earlier threat to close the border entirely, but one that could still inflict economic damage on both countries.""

Immigration NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS COMMERCE KNEW CENSUS QUESTION COULD BENEFIT REPUBLICANS, WHITES IN REDISTRICTING: New evidence laid out in a court filing Thursday suggests that a Republican redistricting strategist “played a significant role in orchestrating” the Trump administration’s effort to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, contradicting the Commerce Department’s explanation for the addition, I reported here . Attorneys for the ACLU argue in the filing that Thomas Hofeller, a longtime Republican redistricting guru who passed away in August 2018, “played a significant role in orchestrating” the addition of the citizenship question “in order to create a structural electoral advantage for, in his own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.'”
The evidence suggests that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ adviser Mark Neuman and a Justice Department official ""obscured"" Hofeller's involvement in the decision ""through affirmative misrepresentations,"" the ACLU, which sued on behalf of immigrants’ rights groups in the Southern District for New York, said. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department as part of an effort to better protect voting rights. DOJ sent the formal request in a December 2017 letter, which said in the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act. However, critics contend that the question is intended to strip immigrant communities of voting power and federal funding.
The ACLU filing states that in August 2017, Hofeller “helped ghostwrite a draft DOJ letter to Commerce” and the letter eventually sent by DOJ “bears striking similarities” to a 2015 study by Hofeller that concluded that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites” in redistricting. A DOJ spokesperson said in a statement that the study “played no role” in DOJ’s request to reinstate the citizenship question to the 2020 census. “These unfounded allegations are an unfortunate last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case,” the spokesperson said.

Unions STAFFERS FILE UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGES AGAINST SEIU: Unionized staffers at the Service Employees International Union filed an unfair labor practice charge Thursday against the union over “management’s failure to bargain the current contract dispute in good faith.” The workers represented by the OPEIU Local 2 allege in the complaint that SEIU management “failed to properly respond to an information request” which “has impeded the ability of unionized staff to successfully bargain over key issues” and provided “false information” to Local 2 members.
Last week , Local 2 voted to reject the SEIU’s latest contract offer and reauthorize a strike. “At a time when SEIU is courting presidential candidates to make it easier for workers to join unions, SEIU management is behaving more like the irresponsible employers it calls out on a daily basis than the progressive labor union it portrays itself to be,” said Omar Martinez, an SEIU communications staffer and Local 2 bargaining committee member. In a statement to SEIU spokesperson Sahar Wali said: ""We absolutely respect OPEIU Local 2’s right to reject this contract and to take collective action, including striking. We are a union that is also an employer who must serve as responsible stewards of our members’ resources and maintain their ability to fight for a better life through their union.""

In the Workplace JP MORGAN TO PAY $5 MILLION TO MALE EMPLOYEES DENIED PARENTAL LEAVE: JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $5 million to male employees who alleged they were discriminated against when they were denied access to the same paid parental leave as female employees from 2011 to 2017, The American Civil Liberties Union announced Thursday. In a proposed class action complaint filed Thursday along with the settlement, a male employee alleged that when he sought to take “primary caregiver” leave “he was told by Chase’s H.R. department that mothers were presumptively considered primary caregivers, eligible for the full 16 weeks of paid parental leave, while fathers were eligible for two weeks of paid parental leave unless they could show that their spouses or partners were incapacitated or had returned to work.”
Chase is not admitting liability in the settlement, according to the ACLU. Read a press release from the ACLU here .

WOMEN ALLEGE DISCRIMINATION AT FBI ACADEMY: “Sixteen women who trained to become FBI agents and analysts have come forward in a lawsuit filed Wednesday accusing the bureau of gender discrimination in how it trains and evaluates female candidates,” NBC News reports. The lawsuit claims that women who recently enrolled at the FBI's Basic Field Training Course in Quantico faced gender discrimination “and that the problem is worse for women of color or those with disabilities.”
One woman told NBC that when she reported “excessive discrimination” against a female co-worker to her female unit chief, “She looked me in the eyes and said: ‘You coming forward and speaking up will not go without consequence. I hope it was worth it.’ … And from there on out I was targeted. . .I was harassed constantly.” More here .
2020 Watch SOME 2020 DEMOCRATS SUPPORT DECRIMINALIZING PROSTITUTION: Four 2020 presidential candidates say that they support decriminalizing sex work, which is currently illegal in the United States with the exception of a handful of counties in Nevada, BuzzFeed News reports. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Kamala Harris all told Buzzfeed they support decriminalization. Rep. Seth Moulton also said he supports it, “though he has a caveat — he wants to maintain strict penalties for people who solicit prostitution.” BuzzFeed also points to a recent poll conducted by an advocacy organization and a progressive think tank Data for Progress, found that among Democrats, 55 percent support the decriminalization of consensual sex work and across all parties, 45 percent support it.

Sexual Harassment EXECUTIVES DEPART NATURE CONSERVANCY FOLLOWING HARASSMENT CLAIMS: “Two senior officials at The Nature Conservancy, one of the world's most influential environmental groups, have exited the organization after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct,” according to documents obtained by POLITICO’s Zack Colman. The Conservancy’s CEO announced the departure of Mark Burget, who headed the group's North American operations, and Kacky Andrews, who led global programs, in an email Tuesday.
An internal investigation into the conservancy’s workplace culture found that “[s]pecifically, in several instances where there were serious allegations of misconduct, TNC opted for no or minor discipline because TNC perceived the event as ‘he said/she said’ with no corroborating evidence. In these instances, the accused was given the benefit of the doubt,” the report said. More from Colman here .

What Democrats are talking about on Facebook,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-score/2019/05/31/what-democrats-are-talking-about-on-facebook-639182," An analysis of Democratic presidential candidates’ Facebook spending finds that candidates are spending a lot of money talking about the primary debates, President Donald Trump and dark money.

 WEB WARS — Facebook will be a sizable chunk of any presidential campaign’s media buy; through Saturday, Score has tracked over $10 million in Facebook spending from Democratic presidential hopefuls since the beginning of the year (Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have each spent in the ballpark of $1.2 million). President Donald Trump’s campaign and joint fundraising committee have spent over $5.1 million in the same time frame.
But when candidates are spending, what are they talking to potential supporters about? Data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, the Democratic digital firm, provided to Score finds that Democrats have spent the most talking about the primary debates — yet another example of how the DNC’s fundraising threshold has affected the campaigns’ strategy, and will do so in the future .
Data from March 23-May 18 pulled from BPI’s 2020 Campaign Tracker , which tracks digital spending, shows that Democrats have spent a combined $1.4 million on ads that mentioned keywords associated with the debate (in that timeframe, Score tracks roughly $6.3 million in spending from the Democratic field). Julián Castro has spent the most in this category at $325,000, with four other candidates spending at least six-figures.
The second-most talked about topic is Trump, with ads mentioning keywords associated with him at $735,000. Dark money is third at $555,000, Mueller is fourth at $474,000 and the economy rounds out the top five at $411,000. Categories that saw comparatively little spending? Paid leave ($100 worth of spending), trade ($200 in spending) or the opioid crisis ($2,600 in spending).
Candidates also vary on which topics they spend the most. Most of Biden’s ads, for example, are classified in the “other” category (a lot of his ads are explicit asks for donations), but his largest classified category is ads that mention Trump — about $148,000 worth in that time frame. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, meanwhile, has spent over $288,000 on ads that talk about the climate, his largest category (ads can be classified into multiple categories).
Presidential Big Board THE CRIME BILL — Sen. Cory Booker dinged Biden for his past support of the 1994 crime bill. “I use this word sincerely. I love Joe Biden,” Booker said in an interview with HuffPost’s Kevin Robillard , before sharply criticizing the bill: “We should all agree with the force of conviction: That bill was a mistake. … Good people signed on to that bill. People make mistakes. But let’s hold them to that. That crime bill was shameful, what it did to black and brown communities like mine [and] low-income communities from Appalachia to rural Iowa. It was a bad bill.”
THE DEBATE STAGE — Some staging details for the first round of Democratic debates on June 26 and 27: There will be a drawing to determine who is on which stage on June 14. During the debate, candidates will have one minute to give answers. Follow-ups are 30 seconds and allowing candidates to react to other candidates is up to the discretion of the moderator. The debates will begin at 9 p.m. and run for two hours, split into 5 segments ( Playboy’s Alex Thomas reported the details first and it's been confirmed by POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago and others on our 2020 team).
— The DNC will also require at least one female moderator at every primary debate, Refinery29’s Natalie Gotcharova reported.
— Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand talked to POLITICO’s Tim Alberta for the return of the “Off Message” podcast , where Tim explores why Gillibrand’s campaign has failed to get off the launching pad.
THE CASH DASH — Trump is headlining a big dollar fundraiser in Washington D.C. for Trump Victory, his joint fundraising committee with his campaign and the RNC. The dinner cost is $5,600 and the roundtable is a $100,000 give, per an invitation obtained by POLITICO’s Maggie Severns.

Down the Ballot THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION — A Republican cartographer was involved early on in discussions for including a citizenship question on the census, documents filed in federal court allege (the Trump administration says the citizenship question would be used to enforce the Voting Rights Act). “Thomas Hofeller, who died last August, concluded in a 2015 report that adding the question would produce the data needed to redraw political maps that would be ‘advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites,’ according to a court filing released Thursday,” NPR’s Hansi Lo Wang reported. “Plaintiffs in one of the New York-based lawsuits over the question say that Hofeller later ghostwrote an early draft of the administration's request for the question and helped form a reason for adding the question to forms for the national head count.”
The Supreme Court is due to rule on if the Trump administration is allowed to include a citizenship question on the census within weeks. The ACLU said it informed the Supreme Court about the documents. In a statement, the Justice Department characterized the filing as “unfounded” and said it was “an unfortunate last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case.” Hofeller’s estranged daughter Stephanie Hofeller discovered the documents after his death, The New York Times’ Michael Wines reported.
THE HOUSE MAP — It may only be the end of May, be House recruitment is well underway. Here’s some highlight’s from Campaign Pro’s Laura Barrón-López’s House recruiting notebook ( Pros can read the whole thing here ): Republicans are gearing up to challenge freshmen Democrats across California. Bob Elliott will challenge Rep. Josh Harder in CA-10, Young Kim and Michelle Steel are working to clear the fields in CA-39 and CA-48 and Ray Gennawey and Peggy Huang are running against Rep. Katie Porter in CA-45. In IA-02, retiring Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack endorsed Rita Hart for his seat. In NY-24, Democrat Fran Conole, a veteran, is running against GOP Rep. John Katko and raised $100,000 in the first few days of his campaign.
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE — Nevada’s Demcoratic Gov. Steve Sisolak vetoed a bill that would have seen the state join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, an initiative to circumvent the Electoral College by having states pledge to cast their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote (the compact would only go into effect once at least 270 electors were pledged to it). The compact “could diminish the role of smaller states like Nevada in national electoral contests and force Nevada’s electors to side with whoever wins the nationwide popular vote, rather than the candidate Nevadans choose,” Sisolak said in a statement, per The Nevada Independent’s Michelle Rindels and Riley Snyder .
It represents a speedbump in what has otherwise been a successful year for advocates backing the initiative. In 2019, Colorado, Delaware and New Mexico all signed on. Maine’s House of Representatives also rejected the compact on Thursday, per WMTW .
THE SENATE MAP — Arizona Democrat Mark Kelly picked up the endorsement of Rep. Ruben Gallego for his Senate bid, after Gallego himself contemplated running for that seat, per the Arizona Republic’s Yvonne Wingett Sanchez .
— The DSCC endorsed Jaime Harrison’s bid against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), per Campaign Pro’s James Arkin .
— Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is brushing off a primary challenge from a former state lawmaker, C. Wesley Morgan. “It is difficult to take Wesley Morgan as a viable threat in a Republican primary,” Kevin Golden, McConnell campaign manager, emailed McClatchy’s Jack Brammer . “He has supported Democrats over Republicans in the past and said he will do it again in 2020,” referring to a post Morgan made in 2018 after he lost his primary (Morgan said he never actually voted for a Democrat).
— Several big donors who supported Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) in the past are now giving to Garland Tucker, his primary challenger, The News & Observer’s Brian Murphy reported.
— The impeachment movement makes its way downballot: Colorado Democratic Senate hopeful Dan Baer called for impeachment proceedings.
IN MEMORIAM — Former Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) died early Thursday. The Jackson Clarion Ledger’s Geoffrey Pender has more.
WHERE ARE THEY NOW? — Many lawmakers who either retired or were defeated last year are now on K Street. A report from Public Citizen found that “nearly two-thirds” of the no-longer members “have landed jobs influencing federal policy.”

Trump close to hiring new congressional liaison,www.politico.com,NANCY COOK,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trump-congressional-liaison-1349404," is inching closer to hiring his third legislative affairs director, a job that is becoming increasingly challenging as Trump makes sweeping policy decisions that are alienating lawmakers.
Trump and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney are interviewing at least two internal candidates for the position in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon, according to two people familiar with the deliberations.
The candidates being interviewed Friday are Eric Ueland, a top official at the White House Domestic Policy Council, and Amy Swonger, the White House deputy director of legislative affairs. Neither Ueland nor Swonger immediately responded to requests for comment.
Ueland, a former top Senate aide, is seen inside the West Wing as the front-runner for the position after a handful of other top contenders took themselves out of the running. Jonathan Slemrod, a former top aide at the Office of Management and Budget and close Mulvaney ally, recently told top White House officials he did not want the job, according to people familiar with the matter. Slemrod recently started work at a lobbying firm, Harbinger Strategies.
Swonger, who works on Senate outreach, previously served in George W. Bush’s legislative affairs office and was also an aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, when he was majority whip, and former Sen. Trent Lott. Ueland previously worked for the Senate Budget Committee and as chief of staff to former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.
It’s unclear whether Trump will interview other candidates in the coming days. If he does not feel chemistry with either Ueland or Swonger, the process could begin again, according to one of the people familiar with the process.
Serving as the White House’s top liaison to Capitol Hill is seen as a tough job at this particular moment, as Trump threatens new tariffs that face bipartisan opposition and tries to pass a major trade deal through Congress amid skepticism from many Democrats. Trump also broke off talks with Democrats over a potential infrastructure bill because of House Democrats’ ongoing investigations of him.
The president also frequently speaks directly to members, circumventing his own director of legislative affairs, a move that could undermine anyone in that job.
The current director of legislative affairs, Shahira Knight, is slated to leave the White House in early June and is expected to take a job in Washington, D.C., in the private sector. Marc Short, the vice president’s chief of staff, previously filled the legislative affairs slot, helping to pass a tax reform bill and frequently appearing as a surrogate on cable news for the White House."

“The pivot came after heated rhetoric between Washington and Tehran over U.S. accusations that Iran was likely behind the sabotage of Saudi oil tankers, the people said, including a warning last week from President Trump that a war could see the ‘official end of Iran.’ The U.S. Treasury had planned to implement new sanctions in mid-May that for the first time detailed which Iranian petrochemical entities are off limits to foreign companies, the people familiar with the matter said, and could still move forward with them.” WSJ

ON THE WORLD STAGE -- “Pompeo hits Berlin for make-up talks with Merkel,” by POLITICO Europe’s Joshua Posaner: “[O]n Friday, 13 months into the job, [Secretary of State Mike] Pompeo landed in Berlin at last for talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and set about trying to smooth ruffled feathers. …
“Pompeo wasn’t in Berlin to trade barbs, but looking to eke out agreements on a number of issues — not least securing ongoing German support for operations in Syria and pushing Berlin to toe the U.S. line on Chinese tech giant Huawei.

-- “Cory Booker and the Orthodox rabbi were like brothers. Now they don’t speak,” by WaPo’s Kevin Sullivan in Oxford, England: “Booker’s intense and unlikely friendship with [Shmuley] Boteach, who was sent by the ultra-Orthodox Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic sect to establish a presence at Oxford, was a main pillar of his time in England, from 1992 to 1994. The two men in their 20s seemed to be always together — often with Booker in a yarmulke and Boteach in a Malcolm X baseball cap — and were energized by each other’s outsize charisma and shared passion for religious study …
“They disagree about what cratered an interfaith bond that had inspired blacks and whites, Christians and Jews, on two continents. They both call it betrayal. But Boteach says it was political while Booker says it was personal. … [T]he chill between Booker and Boteach — a liberal Democrat and a conservative Republican who once considered each other family — shows how hard it is to distinguish between the political and personal in today’s divided America.” WaPo

“Its organizers insist their version of the wall is a feasible model for securing hundreds of miles of southern border. Its critics call it a xenophobic scam.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— A new USDA trade forecast shows how falling U.S. soybean sales to China is driving a two-year drop in agricultural exports to the country.
— Senate Democrats are pushing the Agriculture Department to cut off trade aid to foreign-owned meatpackers, which have already received millions of dollars under USDA’s commodity purchase program.
— President Donald Trump announced Thursday he will slap a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods , a move that could jeopardize his efforts to get USMCA through Congress.
HAPPY FRIDAY, MAY 31! Welcome to Morning Ag, where your host is wishing congrats to all eight (!!) National Spelling Bee co-champs. Send tips to cboudreau@politico.com and @ceboudreau , and follow us @Morning_Ag .
Driving the Day USDA PREDICTS PLUMMETING FARM EXPORTS TO CHINA: American farmers and ranchers are expected to send just $6.5 billion in exports to China in fiscal 2019, accelerating a downward slide over the past two years because of the U.S.-China trade war. Last year, the U.S. shipped $16.8 billion in agricultural products to China, and in fiscal 2017 exports totaled $21.8 billion, according to the USDA’s latest trade forecast posted Thursday.
The drop is primarily driven by falling soybean sales. U.S. soybean exports are estimated to total $17 billion in fiscal 2019 compared with $21.6 billion last year. China's demand has slowed from last year because of the escalating trade dispute with Washington and the widespread outbreaks of African swine fever that have decimated the Chinese hog herd, reducing the need for feed.
China has put on hold the additional soybean purchases it committed to earlier this year, Bloomberg reported Thursday. Agriculture in February said the country agreed to buy an extra 10 million tons.
Perdue told reporters in Kennett Square, Pa., on Thursday: “If we cannot trust China to live up to their commitments of buying those products … how can we trust them to support any kind of agreement? If they want to be partners in world trade, they need to step up like big boys and do what they say they’re going to do.”
Lowest agricultural trade surplus in more than a decade: USDA predicted the surplus would total $8 billion this year, a drop from $15.8 billion in fiscal 2018 and $21.1 billion the year before that.
DISASTER AID DÉJÀ VU: Another day, another failure by the House to pass a $19.1 billion disaster aid package. Republican Reps. John Rose (Tenn.) and Thomas Massie (Ky.) objected to clearing the legislation by unanimous consent, meaning it won’t be sent to President Donald Trump’s desk until the House returns from recess Monday and takes a roll call vote. It was the third time this week that a member of the GOP’s most conservative wing blocked the bill.
Survivors of an extraordinary string of natural disasters have been in limbo for months as Washington politicians sparred over the specifics of the deal, which would free up billions of dollars to communities hit by hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, severe flooding, snowstorms, wildfires and tornadoes.
Pro Budget’s Jennifer Scholtes breaks down a dozen ways the disaster aid would extend help, including to American farmers and ranchers, fishing towns and rural communities. Read the story here .
DEMS DECRY TRADE AID FOR FOREIGN FIRMS: A growing number of senators are calling foul on USDA trade relief funds flowing to JBS USA, which is owned by the scandal-plagued Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS S.A. that is under investigation by the Justice Department. But Agriculture and pork industry groups are defending the payments as beneficial to U.S. hog farmers, regardless of who owns the processing plants, writes Pro Ag’s Ryan McCrimmon.
USDA has awarded JBS USA at least $62 million in contracts for pork products under the department’s initial $1.2 billion commodity purchase program, part of the 2018 trade aid plan. Perdue last week unveiled a second trade aid package for 2019, including $1.4 billion to buy goods like pork, milk, fruits and vegetables for distribution to food banks or school cafeterias.
Top Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Ag ranking member Debbie Stabenow sent a letter to Perdue this week asking him to make sure no more funds are directed to JBS or other foreign-owned companies like Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods, which pulled out of a bid for $240,000 under the program after a backlash including sharp criticism from Sen. Chuck Grassley .
Pork pushes back: The National Pork Producers Council has argued that cutting JBS out of the program would diminish competition and lead to higher costs.

TRADE CORNER TRUMP TO SLAP NEW TARIFFS ON MEXICO: President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday night that he will impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico starting June 10 as a way to get the country to curb illegal immigration into the U.S. The tariff will increase to 10 percent on July 1, then rise 5 percent every month until it hits 25 percent on Oct. 1. He added the tariffs would be removed once the ""problem is remedied.""
Grassley quickly panned the move as “a misuse of presidential tariff authority” and warned that “following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA.”
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he would not impose retaliatory measures. ""Social problems don't get resolved with duties or coercive measures. I don't believe ... in 'an eye for an eye,'"" López Obrador said in a letter to Trump that did not mention the new NAFTA.
CONGRESS ON NOTICE FOR USMCA: The Trump administration on Thursday sent a clear signal to lawmakers that it is trying to pressure them to pass USMCA this summer. The White House sent a draft statement of administrative action to Congress, a procedural step that must be done 30 days before it submits a bill to implement the trade deal, though that timeline is not guaranteed, POLITICO’s Megan Cassella and Andrew Restuccia report .
The submission created fresh tension with Pelosi, who said the move “indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement” — a slap at Trump, who recently said the speaker doesn’t understand his new trade deal.

 The White House is holding meetings with outside groups about the “gainful employment” regulation as it reviews the Education Department’s plan to scrap it.

Driving the Day CUMMINGS: EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OBSTRUCTING PROBE OF IG REPLACEMENT: House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings on Thursday accused the Trump administration of obstructing a congressional investigation into the attempted removal of the Education Department’s acting independent watchdog.
— Cummings said department officials were refusing to turn over documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts earlier this year to replace the agency’s acting inspector general. So far, just seven pages of documents have been turned over, most of which were “heavily redacted,” according to Cummings.
— The Education Department “is obstructing our investigation and appears to be part of an unprecedented cover-up by the Trump administration across multiple Executive Branch agencies and departments,” Cummings wrote in a letter on Thursday along with Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.).
— Reed D. Rubinstein, the department’s acting general counsel, said in a letter to the committee earlier this month that “Congress’ oversight requests here implicate core Executive Branch interests and raise serious separation of powers concerns.” The requests for documents, Rubinstein wrote, involve “deliberations regarding a presidential appointment, a core Presidential function.” He added that the department was “unclear about Congress’ legislative need and authority over such deliberations.”
— Democrats have cried foul over the Trump administration’s effort in January to remove Sandra Bruce as acting inspector general. The move came after Bruce resisted a request by Deputy Education Secretary Mick Zais to “reconsider” an investigation into Secretary Betsy DeVos’ decision to reinstate an accreditor of for-profit colleges. The department has previously said the decision to replace Bruce with Phil Rosenfelt, the agency’s deputy general counsel, was made internally before Bruce opened that investigation.
— Cummings and DeSaulnier on Thursday set a new June 10 deadline for the Education Department to produce all of the documents requested by the committee. They also requested that Zais sit for a transcribed interview on June 13.
— Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill declined to say whether Zais would agree to a transcribed interview. “We have answered the Chairman’s questions and are willing to work with the Committee on all lawful oversight requests on this or any other matter,” she said.

Higher Education OMB HOLDS MEETINGS ON PLAN TO SCRAP ‘GAINFUL’ RULE: The White House’s Office of Management and Budget has held nearly a dozen meetings over the last month with outside parties as it reviews DeVos’ proposal to repeal the Obama-era “gainful employment” rule, according to federal records.
— Among the groups that have participated in meetings with OMB so far, most have been advocates of the Obama-era regulations, which cut off federal aid to low-performing programs at career colleges and for-profit schools. On OMB’s calendar so far: New America, the American Federation of Teachers, the American Legion, the Century Foundation, the Center for American Progress, the Institute for College Access and Success, attorney and for-profit college critic David Halperin, Career Education Colleges and Universities, and Laureate Education.
— OMB’s review of the regulation is the final step before the Education Department finalizes its “gainful employment” proposal, which it first released last year. The department has indicated it plans to finalize the repeal of the rule by Nov. 1, so that it can take effect next July 1.
OVERALL ENROLLMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION DIPS AGAIN: The number of students enrolled in colleges and universities across the country continued its downward trend this year. Enrollment overall fell by 1.7 percent this spring compared with last year, according to new data released by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.
— Four-year for-profit institutions saw the largest percentage decrease , 19.7 percent, while community colleges and four-year public universities saw less drastic decreases of 3.4 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.
— Enrollments at four-year private schools increased by 3.2 percent, but the Clearinghouse noted that the increase “was largely due to the recent conversion of a large for-profit institution to nonprofit status,” an apparent reference to Grand Canyon University, which has more than 90,000 students.

Shanahan faces furor over McCain ship flap,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2019/05/31/shanahan-faces-furor-over-mccain-ship-flap-442347,"With Wesley Morgan Editor's The controversy over the USS John S. McCain is expected to make acting Shanahan’s quest to be the permanent Pentagon chief even tougher.
— The disaster aid package will have to wait until Congress comes back next week after a third failed attempt.
— The general nominated to be the chief of the new U.S. Space Command will face senators Tuesday.
HAPPY FRIDAY
Pentagon FEELING THE HEAT: The acting Defense secretary, who was already facing a rocky confirmation to the top job over senators’ anger with Trump administration policies, can expect things to get worse over news the White House worked with the Navy to hide the USS John S. McCain from President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan, write POLITICO’s Wesley Morgan, Marianne LeVine and Connor O’Brien.
Following The Wall Street Journal’s revelation that the White House was concerned as to how Trump might react if he saw the name of his old foe while touring a naval base in Japan, Shanahan said this was the first he’d heard about the issue. The Journal story had said Shanahan was aware of the White House’s concern and efforts to obscure the ship from view.
Retired brass and Democratic lawmakers now expect senators to hit Shanahan hard when he testifies during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. They also believe Shanahan made an error in calling on his chief of staff to investigate the matter, rather than refer it to the Defense Department inspector general.
“[Shanahan] ought to take responsibility no matter what , and he ought to demand that whoever in the White House made this request be fired,” said former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus. “Whether he knew about it or not, declining to take responsibility in his initial reaction ought to be looked at carefully” by Congress during Shanahan’s upcoming confirmation hearing.
Trump, meanwhile, said whoever decided to hide the ship had been “well-meaning,” Morgan writes .
""Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him. Okay? And, they were well-meaning,"" the president went on. ""I didn't know anything about it. I would never have done that.""
On the Hill SPENDING DEBATE KICKS OFF: “The House plans to start debating fiscal 2020 spending bills on the floor June 12, Democratic leaders announced,” per POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes.
Put on some coffee: “The chamber plans to hold votes late into the evening when appropriations bills are being debated, marking an intense start to a month of appropriations work.”
On the defense side: The House Appropriations Committee has already approved annual defense and military construction spending bills.
DISASTER AID FAILS: The third time was not a charm for the $19 billion disaster aid bill, Scholtes writes .
“Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) rose to object to passing the bill, H.R. 2157 (116) , by unanimous consent. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was by Rose's side. That move means the measure will not be sent on for President Donald Trump's signature until the House returns from recess Monday and takes a roll call vote. Trump has given his blessing to the disaster assistance.”
SPACE NOMINEE: SASC will hear from Trump’s nominee to head the new U.S. Space Command, Air Force Gen. John Raymond, when it holds a confirmation hearing on Tuesday, per O’Brien.
“The hearing comes as lawmakers debate Trump's proposed reorganization of the military's space mission, including whether to create a proposed Space Force.”
Iran Also on the docket: Sharing the stage with Raymond will be Trump’s nominee to head up the National Reconnaissance Office, Christopher Scolese. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which also oversees the NRO, held a confirmation hearing for Scolese earlier this month.
POMPEO’S CALMING TOUR: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Europe on Thursday in a quest to potentially ease tensions with Iran, The Associated Press reports .
“Even as the Trump administration revels in its “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, Pompeo is traveling to Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Britain to assure European leaders that the U.S. is not looking for conflict, press them to do what they can to cool the situation, and perhaps open a channel of communication with the Islamic Republic.”
White House TRUMP’S IQ TEST: POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia had this nugget in an overall piece on Trump’s affinity with those he believes have a high IQ:
“In private, according to interviews with a half-dozen people close to him, Trump frequently asserts that people he likes have genius-level IQs. At various points during his presidency, he’s told aides that Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Apple CEO Tim Cook are high-IQ individuals, for example, former White House officials said.”
Making Moves Rear Adm. Ross Myers has been promoted to vice admiral and appointed deputy commander at U.S. Cyber Command, per POLITICO’s Martin Matishak. He was the command’s chief of staff.
Bob Daigle , former head of the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, has joined Pallas Advisors.

IT'S FRIDAY! Duke Energy's Michael Sewell knew Carol Moseley–Braun was the first African-American female senator. For today: Who was the first lawmaker to select an office in the first-ever House office building in 1908? And what was the office? REAL WORLD, ROAD RULES: With few detailed proposals out there, presidential candidates' calls for net zero carbon emissions in the transportation sector will likely lean on increasing the share of electric vehicles on the road, experts say. But, while electric vehicles have experienced rapid growth, it hasn't come as quickly in the U.S. as some proponents hoped, Pro's Alex Guillén reports this morning. That leaves Democrats to figure out how to turbo-charge EV adoption.
""It's possible on paper"" to achieve entirely zero-emissions vehicle sales in the coming decades, said Gloria Bergquist, vice president for public affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ""But we need to see greater sales in the marketplace of the vehicles we already have. That's the crunch,"" she added.
Democrats point to restoring Obama-era vehicle emissions rules the Trump administration is rolling back. But, as Alex notes, it's unclear whether any future president would be able to lay the groundwork for a carbon-free vehicle fleet with existing regulatory authority. The CAFE program does help incentivize EVs, but Congress did not design it as a mechanism to get the U.S. off gasoline entirely.
Without significant action, experts agree EVs will only take off once they reach price parity with gasoline vehicles and can compete beyond the luxury market where companies like Tesla have been successful.
Dave Cooke, a senior vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists , thinks electric vehicles will become widely cost-competitive with gasoline vehicles sometime around 2025 to 2030. ""After that point, the consumer choice part of the equation is a lot more straightforward,"" he said. Read more .

Advocacy NATURE CONSERVANCY HOLDS TOWN HALL: The Nature Conservancy held an impromptu town hall Thursday regarding its internal sexual harassment probe, coming just hours after POLITICO's reporting revealed the results of that report and two senior executives' departures. Invites went out to staff in an 8:50 a.m. ET email, according to a copy reviewed by POLITICO and whose authenticity was verified by three sources.
Nature Conservancy President Brian McPeek was a focus of the town hall, where CEO Mark Tercek received pointed questions about whether McPeek should remain as the head of the organization. The report of the organization's workplace culture, conducted by law firm McDermott Will & Emery, did not name the three executives against whom complaints were made and who made up a bulk of its investigation. McPeek and the Nature Conservancy did not respond to requests for comment Thursday evening.
That review noted one former female employee received an ""unwelcome"" kiss from a person identified as Executive 1. Investigators found that woman ""credible"" despite the Executive 1's denials, but ultimately did not recommend punishment for the executive.
Around the Agencies E15 MINUTES OF FAME: Staring down a June 1 deadline, EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Gulliford will ""share an E-15 update"" in Iowa today during the grand opening celebration of the Elite Octane ethanol plant. GOP Sen. Joni Ernst will also attend.
President Donald Trump has called on EPA to release its final rule allowing year-round sales of 15 percent ethanol fuel before summertime restrictions kick in on June 1, fulfilling a pledge the president has made to corn-state farmers.
Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the final rule is expected to ""jettison proposed trading restrictions"" on compliance credits for the Renewable Fuel Standard and will ""make only a handful of modest changes.""
Biofuels groups have long wanted the rule, and several prominent trade groups will be represented at the opening. Meanwhile, oil interests have promised a legal challenge once the final rule hits the Federal Register.
IG ENDS PRUITT PROBE: EPA's Office of the Inspector General has closed its probe into former Administrator Scott Pruitt's meeting with the National Mining Association from April 2017, according to its semi-annual report released Thursday.
The IG agreed to establish a ""factual record"" about the meeting after Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee requested the inquiry. That came after POLITICO first reported NMA would support pulling out of the Paris climate agreement after meeting with Pruitt.
The OIG said it ""conducted multiple interviews"" during the inquiry and ""provided its fact-finding results to Congress."" The agency looked at whether Pruitt or his staff violated the Antideficiency Act or anti-lobbying provisions.
Also in the report: The IG looked into allegations of ""widespread downloading"" of encrypted apps onto EPA-issued mobile devices by EPA employees in order to leak damaging information regarding top agency officials. The investigation found that 58 employees had downloaded encrypted apps to their EPA phones, ""but the allegation that employees were leaking sensitive information or conducting official business on these applications was not supported.""
USDA ANNOUNCES CASH FOR RURAL GRIDS: USDA on Thursday announced it is providing more than $850 million in loans and grants across 17 states to support upgrades to rural electric systems. The department said the funding will help build and improve 3,741 miles of line so the grid is more reliable. The largest loan of $263 million was awarded to a cooperative that serves parts of Arkansas in Missouri.
On the Hill CLIMATE COMES TO INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: The House Intelligence Committee will hold a hearing June 5 at 8:30 a.m. titled ""National Security Implications of Climate Change."" Witnesses have not yet been announced, though a committee spokesman said more information will be unveiled in the coming days.
DISASTER BILL THWARTED AGAIN: Nearing the start of hurricane season on Saturday, House lawmakers once again failed to pass a disaster aid bill. Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) objected to passing the bill by voice vote, while Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who derailed the same measure earlier this week, was by his side, POLITICO's Jennifer Scholtes reports . The chamber will next take up the bill Monday when lawmakers return from recess.
The House did, however, pass a bill Thursday to authorize the National Flood Insurance Program through June 14, preventing the program from lapsing at midnight.

Tech of the Town GEORGIA BOYCOTT THREAT GROWS — A growing list of media companies is threatening to stop production of TV shows and films in Georgia if the state moves forward with implementing one of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the country, slated to go into effect in January 2020. Netflix and Disney led the pack, followed by AT&T’s WarnerMedia, and, most recently, Comcast’s NBCUniversal, all saying publicly they’re considering pulling out. “We fully expect that the heartbeat bills and similar laws in various states will face serious legal challenges and will not go into effect while the process proceeds in court,” NBCUniversal said in a statement on Thursday. “If any of these laws are upheld, it would strongly impact our decision-making on where we produce our content in the future.”
— Similar sentiments: CBS, its subsidiary Showtime, AMC Networks and Viacom have taken softer stances but indicated that they’re tracking the legal developments and might, down the line, re-evaluate their work there should the law take effect.
— The bigger picture: Film and television production has in recent years become a massive industry in Georgia, thanks to tax breaks offered since the 2000s, and the list of companies threatening to pull out of the state represents a large swath of the TV and film industry. It’s a reflection of the polarizing times that corporations, including seemingly staid telecom giants like Comcast and AT&T, are planting their flags on one side of such a divisive issue — and a sign of the economic might that media titans now command following years of consolidation. Still, even the most forceful statements stop short of a full-bore pledge to pull out of Georgia if the courts don’t block the law from taking effect, instead promising to strongly consider leaving the state in that event.
PIC DU JOUR — This giant angry emoji inflated outside Facebook’s annual shareholder meeting in Menlo Park, Calif., on Thursday. (H/t Karl Mondon , a photographer for The Mercury News in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.) Protesters from consumer and civil rights groups, some holding “break up Facebook” signs, showed up to demand checks on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s power after months of data privacy scandals and a rising tide of arguments that Facebook has become unaccountably large. Those concerns made it into a number of shareholder proposals to make changes like installing an independent figure instead of Zuckerberg as chairman of the board and diluting his voting power. All, however, were easily beaten back .
— “The outcome of votes at Facebook are never in doubt, due to Mark Zuckerberg’s 10-1 voting power and ability to single-handedly determine every decision put to shareholders,” said Brandi Collins-Dexter, senior campaign director for civil rights group Color of Change. “And that’s exactly the problem: Facebook’s leadership can continue to ignore demands for governance reforms and abdicate responsibility on the problems of safety, privacy, and manipulation the platform has created.”
SCOOT OVER? — Uber and Lyft joined scooter-sharing startups Bird and Lime in Washington on Thursday for a policy discussion on the growing e-scooter market, in which all four now operate globally. The panel, hosted by trade group the Consumer Technology Association, touched on the toll the trade war with China is taking on the companies’ scooter-sharing businesses and supply chains, affecting where and how quickly they can deploy. The majority of these e-scooters are manufactured in mainland China, according to Brenden Dooley, who leads federal policy efforts at Uber, “so there’s 25 percent added on to the price of the scooter,” he said. “It’s a shame for us to have to pay a 25 percent fee and have that going just to get our products here, rather than having those dollars being invested for future projects.”
DESPITE OBJECTIONS, ROBOCALL VOTE WILL HAPPEN — The FCC is standing firm on plans to vote June 6 on Chairman Ajit Pai's plan to fight robocalls by letting phone companies block them by default, John reports for Pros. The agency is facing down credit unions and other businesses concerned the proposal could hurt their ability to communicate with customers.
— And in related robocall news, standards group the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions on Thursday named Ericsson subsidiary iconectiv as the “policy administrator” that will lead industry efforts to crack down on illegal robocalls. The company will be responsible for putting into action “SHAKEN/STIR,” the call authentication framework that ensures the caller ID details consumers see are accurate. “‘Call authentication’ is critical for protecting consumers against these calls,” Pai said Thursday. “It will ensure that voice providers are exchanging accurate information about the source of calls traveling across their networks … I appreciate ATIS’s work on this issue and look forward to seeing deployment of SHAKEN/STIR by major carriers this year.”
NOTES FOR NEXT WEEK: STELAR WITNESS LINEUP — Tuesday’s House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on the video marketplace is shaping up to include a mix of witnesses representing DirecTV-owner AT&T, the National Association of Broadcasters, the small cable operators of America’s Communications Association, Public Knowledge and equestrian network Ride TV, multiple industry sources told John on Thursday.
— FIRST IN MT: In another chip in the broadcasters’ favor, Rep. Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa), a Democrat on the subcommittee, wrote a letter to House Energy and Commerce and House Judiciary leaders explaining how the law hits home for his constituents. Viewers in nearly 95 percent of the country’s markets can choose to get their local channels from DIRECTV or DISH, he writes, but the remaining 5 percent in “less populated” and “neglected” markets — including Loebsack’s congressional district in Iowa — do not have a choice, affecting their ability to get local news and information, he says.

Measles cases hit 27-year high,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2019/05/31/measles-cases-hit-27-year-high-639881,"With help from Alice Miranda Ollstein and Victoria Colliver
Quick Fix — Measles cases already have hit a 27-year-high , with seven months in the year left to go, CDC reported.
— FDA holds a landmark public meeting today on CBD , as regulators try to figure out how to regulate the marijuana-derived product.
— 828,000 fewer children were covered by Medicaid or CHIP last year after enrollment declines from 2017, Georgetown researchers write in a new report.
THANK GOODNESS IT'S FRIDAY PULSE — Where your author is happy to admit: he couldn't have spelled any of the winning words at the National Spelling Bee last night. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com .
Driving the Day NEARLY 1,000 U.S. MEASLES CASES ALREADY THIS YEAR — CDC on Thursday reported 971 cases so far, the highest annual total in more than 25 years … and with seven months still to go.
— The previous recent high was 963 cases in 1994, CDC said. Just 372 measles cases were reported all of last year.
— Driving the epidemic: Outbreaks in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in New York City and Rockland County, N.Y., which have been going on for nearly eight months.
— The U.S. will lose its WHO-designation for eliminating measles if the New York outbreaks continue into the fall. More for Pros .
FDA HOLDS PUBLIC MEETING ON CBD — It’s the first meeting of its kind since the government legalized cannabidiol, or CBD, late last year with the farm bill.
— What’s on the agenda: A parade of manufacturers, trade groups, patient organizations, physicians and researchers are holding forth today in two- and five-minute slots on what they know about CBD, how it’s being regulated at the state level and how off-the-shelf products might coexist with CBD-based prescription drugs.
State agriculture representatives from Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania will also speak, giving a glimmer of the road ahead that many states see for hemp’s most profitable byproduct.
POLITICO reporters previewed the hearing on the ""Pulse Check"" podcast this week.
WHY ARE KIDS LOSING MEDICAID COVERAGE? — Total Medicaid and CHIP enrollment for children fell by more than 2 percent last year, and Georgetown researchers probed the possible causes in a new report .
— It's probably not the economy, the researchers concluded, pointing to ""scant evidence"" that low-income families gained employer-sponsored insurance and left Medicaid.
— But it could be a result of ""pulling in the welcome mat,"" the researchers argued, pointing to the combined effect of reduced funding for outreach and changes to immigration policy that could be scaring off potential enrollees.
There's also more red tape for would-be enrollees to navigate, as GOP officials pursue work requirements, income reviews and other administrative barriers.
— One challenge: There's not enough information to understand the enrollment declines , the Georgetown researchers conclude.
""A lack of data specifying disenrollment reasons makes it difficult to pinpoint the extent to which state administrative or operational factors are leading to losses of coverage for eligible children,"" they write.
MICHAEL BENNET STUMPS FOR HIS HEALTH PLAN AND AGAINST ""MEDICARE FOR ALL"" — The Colorado senator appeared at a CNN town hall last night where he advocated for his plan to encourage health care public options while preserving the existing employer-sponsored health insurance system. He also warned that Sen. Bernie Sanders' own proposal would be too disruptive.
""Bernie is proposing if you like your insurance, we're going to take it away from you, from 180 million people who get it from their employer,"" Bennet said. ""I think Bernie is wrong to propose it."" Video .
... That criticism didn't sit well with Sanders' progressive supporters.
""It's a weird line of attack though given that in Bennet's plan people lose their health insurance constantly, every time they change jobs and every time their employer decides to change it,"" Matt Bruenig wrote on Twitter. ""His proposal is actually *worse* on this issue of switching than M4A.""
Join
Abortion JUSTIN TRUDEAU, MIKE PENCE agree to disagree. The Canadian prime minister and the U.S. vice president had a ""cordial conversation"" Thursday about their very different abortion views during Pence's visit to Canada.
""I highlighted to the vice president that there was a significant amount of concern amongst Canadians on the new anti-choice laws being passed in a number of American states,"" Trudeau said during a news conference. He stressed that Canada ""will always be a staunch defender of women’s rights and a woman’s right to choose.""
Pence, for his part, defended his anti-abortion stance and praised the U.S.-Canada relationship for allowing candid disagreements.
""But let me be clear: I’m very proud to be part of a pro-life administration,"" Pence said. ""Our administration has taken steps to stand for the sanctity of life at home and abroad.""
MEANWHILE: Missouri's last abortion clinic could lose its license today. Abortion rights advocates across the country are watching the Missouri situation closely to see if the clinic's closure could prompt a wave of similar enforcement tactics against abortion clinics in other states, POLITICO's Alice Miranda Ollstein reports.
Advocates are on high alert particularly in the five other states besides Missouri — Mississippi, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — that are down to a single abortion provider.
“A lot of states could look to how Missouri conducted this audit as a potential path for them to follow,” said Elizabeth Nash of Guttmacher Institute. “I imagine a large section of the country is watching for the outcome and combing through their laws and regulations and seeing where they could come up with additional implementation strategies.”
In the Courts Advocates sue HHS after lesbian couple rejected by foster care agency. The ACLU and other advocates are challenging the administration over Miracle Hill Ministries’ decision to reject a married lesbian couple on religious grounds.
The complaint was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in South Carolina. HHS Secretary Alex Azar and other top officials are named defendants.
— Origin of the lawsuit: South Carolina officials in January 2018 determined that Miracle Hill Ministries, which receives government funding, had violated nondiscrimination law by requiring would-be foster parents to meet religious criteria.
However, HHS in January 2019 allowed South Carolina to exempt Miracle Hill from nondiscrimination law and continue imposing a religious test. Miracle Hill this month denied the lesbian couple on grounds that they did not share the agency’s religious beliefs, according to an email shared by the couple.
— What the lawsuit alleges : That by allowing a foster-care agency to impose religious criteria, HHS is encouraging a practice that harms children by “denying them access to the loving families they desperately need.”
Inside the Humphrey Building HHS task force warns about overreliance on prescription drug monitoring programs. State PDMPs may contain errors and should not be used to cut off patients from opioid prescriptions without consultations to determine whether the move is appropriate, a federal interagency task force on pain management recommended Thursday.
The 29-member, HHS-led task force, which included a mix of federal officials and specialists, in general emphasized the importance of individualized patient-centered care in the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic pain. More for Pros .
Around the Agencies FCC not budging on robocall vote despite industry objections. The FCC is standing firm on plans to vote June 6 on Chairman Ajit Pai's robocall-fighting plan as credit unions, banking and healthcare business interests ramp up objections.
“We have no intention of delaying next week’s vote because now is the time to act,” an FCC spokesperson told POLITICO. “The American people are sick and tired of receiving a flood of unwanted robocalls, and allowing carriers to use call blocking services by default will help provide consumers with much-needed relief.”
The American Association of Healthcare Administrative Management is among the groups seeking to block the plan.
Around the Nation California’s Democratic convention rolls into town. More than a dozen presidential hopefuls are descending on San Francisco for this weekend's convention, and will address a wide range of issues including health care, POLITICO's Victoria Colliver reports.
The most populous state is not used to so much attention related to national elections, but it's finally getting its due after boosting the 2020 primaries two months earlier than 2016. All the front runners are expected to attend, with the notable exception of Joe Biden.
— On tap for health : California Sen. Kamala Harris is slated to appear at a Planned Parenthood reception in San Francisco on Friday evening. Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and others are also expected Saturday morning at the Democratic Women’s Caucus meeting at the Moscone Center, where all the action will be centered. Expect ""Medicare for All"" signs to be waving as candidates try to distinguish themselves on positions they share, including support of abortion rights and women’s reproductive health.

K Street decries Trump’s Mexico tariffs,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/05/31/k-street-decries-trumps-mexico-tariffs-640005,"With Daniel Lippman K STREET DECRIES TRUMP’S THREATENED MEXICO TARIFFS: Washington trade groups are predictably unhappy with President Donald Trump ’s plan to impose tariffs on Mexican imports until the administration decides the country has done enough to help the U.S. stanch illegal immigration. “Imposing tariffs on goods from Mexico is exactly the wrong move,” Neil Bradley , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s executive vice president and chief policy officer, said in a statement.
Story Continued Below
— “We share @RealDonaldTrump ’s frustration with our broken immigration system,” Jay Timmons , the president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers , tweeted on Friday morning. “But intertwining difficult trade, tariff and immigration issues creates a Molotov cocktail of policy.” Timmons, who’s taken care to build a good relationship with Trump despite their differences on trade policy, added that he’d taken his “concerns to the highest levels of the administration.” The Business Roundtable , the National Retail Federation and the Retail Industry Leaders Association also decried the tariffs, warning they could torpedo Trump’s new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, which must be approved by Congress.
A NEW CLIENT FOR BYRON DORGAN: Former Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), who’s now a senior policy adviser at Arent Fox , will lobby for Investment Company Institute on tax and financial services matters, according to a disclosure filing. He’ll lobby alongside former Rep. Phil English (R-Pa.) and two other Arent Fox lobbyists. Dorgan, who left the Senate in 2011, has been a registered lobbyist since 2014, but he’s represented only a handful of clients. He’s registered to lobby for only two other clients at the moment: American Airlines and the National Biodiesel Board .
CRUZ, OCASIO-CORTEZ AGREE TO WORK TOGETHER ON LOBBYING BAN: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) “set aside their Twitter bickering Thursday to strike an unusual bargain: an agreement to work together on a bill to ban former members of Congress from lobbying for life,” POLITICO ’s Theodoric Meyer reports. The lawmakers “made the pact on Twitter after Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a report by the watchdog group Public Citizen on the number of former lawmakers who’ve headed to K Street this year. ‘I don’t think it should be legal at ALL to become a corporate lobbyist if you’ve served in Congress,’ Ocasio-Cortez tweeted .”
— “Cruz, who’s feuded with Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter before, tweeted that he agreed, suggesting it might be 'a chance for some bipartisan cooperation.’ Ocasio-Cortez responded by proposing a deal : ‘If we can agree on a bill with no partisan snuck-in clauses, no poison pills, etc - just a straight, clean ban on members of Congress becoming paid lobbyists - then I’ll co-lead the bill with you.’ ‘You’re on,’ Cruz responded .” Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) quickly voiced their support for such a bill.
— “Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez aren’t the first lawmakers to propose banning their former colleagues from lobbying. Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced a bill to do so in February, and Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) introduced a companion bill in the House.” Bennet has introduced bills that would ban former lawmakers from lobbying since 2010. And Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa) have introduced similar legislation for years. Full story .
— Charles C.W. Cooke , meanwhile, argues in National Review that such a bill would be “almost certainly unconstitutional on its face.” “The right to petition is explicitly protected by the First Amendment, and there is no exception within its text for former government employees — employees who, after they have left office, enjoy precisely the same relationship with their government as does any other citizen,” Cooke writes . “Were Ocasio-Cortez, Cruz, and co. proposing to prohibit former federal legislators from engaging professionally in other First Amendment–protected behavior — say, from becoming paid writers or paid speakers or paid clergymen — it would be extremely obvious to us that their idea was unconstitutional.”
VIRGINIA PITCHED CRYSTAL CITY TO AMAZON AS A GREAT PLACE TO ‘INFLUENCE FEDERAL POLICIES’: Washingtonian ’s Luke Mullins and Will Peischel discovered that Virginia’s successful pitch for Amazon ’s second headquarters argued that Crystal City offered something few other finalists could: It would be a great base from which to lobby the federal government.
— “‘The high concentration of tech companies, federal agencies, and supporting organizations offer Amazon the opportunity to develop valuable future relationships,’ the officials wrote in their proposal. ‘Northern Virginia provides an unmatched place for Amazon to locate as it attempts to influence federal policies, particularly as it delves into complex areas of federal regulatory authority (e.g., unmanned drones).’” “ Holly Sullivan , the executive who led Amazon’s HQ2 search, told Washingtonian that the potential to increase the e-commerce giant’s political footprint played no role in the decision to go with Crystal City.” Full story .
CAMERON WILL ADVISE WASHINGTON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPANY: Former British Prime Minister “ David Cameron has taken up a senior role at an artificial intelligence company in one of his few business appointments since he quit politics in the aftermath of the 2016 EU referendum,” The Financial Times ’ Jim Pickard reports. Cameron “has been hired by Washington-based Afiniti to chair its advisory board, which features an array of high-profile figures. Members of the board include Lord Browne, former chief executive of BP , François Fillon , former prime minister of France, and Elisabeth Murdoch , chair of the Shine Group . Afiniti was set up by Zia Chishti , a US-Pakistani entrepreneur, and specialises in the use of AI in call centres.” Full story .
AN UPDATE ON THE CANNABIS BANKING BILL: “Backers of landmark legislation that would empower banks to enter the cannabis industry are considering expanding the bill to win over skeptical Republican lawmakers,” POLITICO ’s Zachary Warmbrodt reports. “Among their pitches: offering greater protection for products derived from hemp, a cannabis plant used to make textiles as well as cannabidiol — a growing industry in Sen. Mitch McConnell 's Kentucky — and preventing any revival of an Obama-era program that GOP lawmakers say targeted payday lenders and gun retailers.”
— Banks and credit unions have been pushing hard for the bill “because of concerns that federal regulators will penalize them for serving cannabis businesses now legal at the state level.” Full story .

eHealth tweet of the day, on HHS’ Office of Civil Rights’ guidance this week on business associate agreements under HIPAA, which we noted Wednesday: Farzad Mostashari @Farzad_MD , ""This new @HHSOCR clarification shows need for 21C regs.
OCR lacks authority to enforce the “reasonable, cost-based fee” limitation in 45CFR§164.524(c)(4) against business associates [eg med records vendors]- can take action against only the covered entity hhs.gov/hipaa/for-prof…

Deven McGraw @HealthPrivacy , ""Agree! OCR can enforce the fee limits on the covered entities who hire business associates (BA) to get records to patients - even if the fees are set by the BA. But BAs who take on this role should be accountable.""
IT'S FRIDAY at Morning eHealth. If you’re still frantically scribbling down responses to ONC and CMS’ proposed rulemaking this weekend, your author wishes you happy writing. Send letters and tips to mravindranath@politico.com . Tweet the team @Morning_eHealth .
Driving the Day TOO BROAD, TOO PRICEY, TOO SOON — As Monday's public comment deadline nears for HHS' dual proposals on health data sharing, a coalition of health IT groups are urging ONC and CMS to make major changes, or even issue an interim rule instead of a final version.
""A a core level, the rules do not work,"" Joel White said during a press call that his lobbying group, the Health Innovation Alliance, organized Thursday. ""ONC and CMS ought to go back to the drawing board.""
White and other trade group leaders on the call argued the proposed rules — designed to make patient data more sharable and accessible — were too broad, would curb innovation, and would be too costly to implement.
ONC's proposal outlines “reasonable and necessary” activities that are exempt from the 21st Century Cures Act's ban on ; it also proposes requiring certified EHRs to use the FHIR standard for APIs to make data sharing easier. CMS' proposal, released at the same time, would also require payers in federal programs to adopt those same API standards. In response to demand from trade groups, the two agencies extended the comment period to June 3.
One of the seven “reasonable and necessary” exemptions ONC outlines would let health groups turn down health information exchange requests if the request is infeasible. But that's too broad, according to Doug Peddicord, executive director of the Association of Clinical Research Organizations. ”Anyone can find a reason to fit"" into that exemption, he said on Thursday's call.
Pros can read the rest of the story here .
Opioids EASE UP ON PDMPS, TASK FORCE SAYS — A federal interagency task force led by HHS recommended that prescription drug monitoring programs — the state databases storing patient prescription data — shouldn't be used to cut patients off opioids without consultations with clinicians, our colleague Arthur Allen reports.
Clinicians ""should consider checking PDMPs"" before starting opioid therapy with patients, but they shouldn't be required to check them too often without good reason, the task force recommended. More research is needed to understand how the systems should be used in inpatient and outpatient settings.
""PDMP data alone are not error proof and should not be used to dismiss patients from clinical practices,"" the report says. Pros can read more here .
... Also on opioids, the American Medical Association's opioid task force updated its recommendations on managing the crisis this week. One suggestion was to remove prior authorization requirements and ""administrative burdens or barriers that delay or deny care for FDA-approved medications"" used in medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder.
“We need help from policymakers to ensure that more people have access to treatment,"" AMA President-elect Patrice Harris, who also chairs the task force, said in a news release. Physicians are seeing a dip in opioid prescriptions and a spike in PDMPs, but ""we cannot enforce parity laws, or eliminate administrative barriers without the help of state and federal authorities, and that’s what is limiting treatment now.”
Abortion A RIGHT IN NAME ONLY — Several states have enacted laws that — if they take effect — would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. As long as Roe v. Wade stands, abortion is still legal in the United States, but that's a right in name only for women in vast swaths of the country, writes your author with POLITICO colleagues Rachana Pradhan and Renuka Rayasam. Six states have just one abortion clinic, and Missouri may soon have none at all. Depending on where they live, women may have to travel more than 300 miles to be able to end a pregnancy.
...That's where telemedicine comes in, as we've reported at eHealth. Virtual check-ins could mean that women have to travel less — and in some cases not at all — to be legally dispensed abortion medication. Abortion clinics in several states across the country offer telemedicine consultations; as other states pass more restrictive early abortion bans, those clinics could see an influx of patients.

Veterans MOULTON'S PLANS FOR VETS — Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), the Marine veteran running for president, introduced a plan this week to expand mental health services for veterans, Arthur writes. Earlier this week, Moulton disclosed seeking treatment for PTSD after deployments during the Iraq War. His plan would require returning combat veterans to attend a counseling session and would institute annual mental health check-ups for active duty military and veterans. He would also fill all mental health vacancies at the VA and encourage the department to offer alternative therapies, including mindfulness and cannabis.
Senate Floor DURBIN: NO CONFIDENCE IN ACTING FDA CHIEF — The striking rebuke came after a recent meeting between Dick Durbin , the No. 2 Senate Democrat, and Ned Sharpless, who's led FDA in an acting capacity for nearly two months. The conversation about youth use of e-cigarettes was ""one of the most alarming and disappointing meetings in my time in public service,"" Durbin said in a letter earlier this week. (Read more from our colleague Sarah Owermohle here .)
The Illinois Democrat — who had forged a working relationship with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb — said the agency must do more, and quickly, to get e-cigarettes out of kids' hands.
""It is my belief that any person leading the FDA ... must, first and foremost, feel a deep sense of responsibility to protect the health and well-being of all Americans, especially our nation's children,"" Durbin wrote to Sharpless. ""I do not have confidence that you are that leader.""
""Dr. Sharpless is committed to continuing to tackle the troubling epidemic of e-cigarette use among kids,"" a spokesperson told POLITICO. ""This includes preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavored tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars, taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market or sell these products to minors, and educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products.""
HAWLEY CONTINUES CAMPAIGN AGAINST FACEBOOK — Sen. Josh Hawley this week blasted Facebook for failing to detail the information it collects from users' encrypted messages, our POLITICO colleague Cristiano Lima reports. Earlier this month, he'd pressed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on those details; Zuckerberg recently unveiled a ""privacy-focused"" plan for the company.
Facebook Vice President of U.S. Public Policy Kevin Martin wrote in a letter released this week that there are ""still many open questions about what metadata we will retain and how it may be used.""
""I am frankly shocked by Facebook's response,"" Hawley said in a statement. ""I thought they'd swear off the creepier possibilities I raised. But instead, they doubled down.""
""My advice to consumers is simple: When Facebook tells you its messaging services are private, you can't trust them,"" Hawley noted.

Back for more digital,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2019/05/31/back-for-more-digital-442403," Quick Fix — The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is set to release a final proposal on digital taxation today, which will be presented to Group of 20 finance ministers in Japan next week.
— Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is threatening holds against Treasury nominees, in retaliation for how the department has handled the request for President Donald Trump’s tax returns. But how much of an impact will that move actually have?
— The Urban Institute found that increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers would have a cascading set of benefits.
AND HELLO, FRIDAY, where Morning Tax — as a one-time middling regional spelling bee contestant — would have totally nailed “urfirnis.” (But don’t ask about “sphaeriid.”)
The Obamas apparently couldn’t or didn’t want to match this: Today marks 44 years since the White House hosted its first, and so far only, high school dance — the 1975 Holton-Arms senior prom. (Susan Ford, daughter of then-President Gerald Ford, was one of those seniors. Vanity Fair later called that prom a “ wild night .”)
Your tips and feedback don’t need to be wild, but it wouldn’t be the worst thing.
 DIGITAL FUN! Never forget — trying to craft a global consensus on how to tax big digital companies is exceedingly hard, and can bring out the sharp elbows among top finance officials around the globe.
Nonetheless, the OECD is expected to put out a 30-plus page document today that was approved by the 129 members of the group, including the U.S., who have been working on base erosion and profit shifting issues. The G-20 finance ministers will then take a look when they gather in Fukuoka.
The Japanese newspaper Nikkei reported this week that the G-20 officials are expected to sign off on a policy that moves toward taxing companies based more on their operations in a country, instead of where they place their headquarters. But that reminder again that this can be a tricky issue: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin lashed out that the U.S. would oppose any unilateral efforts to go after companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google after an interim OECD report on this issue in March 2018, though senior department officials have talked up the idea of a solution that involved a minimum tax for all kinds of companies.
WHAT’S IT ALL MEAN? This isn’t the first time that Wyden, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, has vowed to hold up Treasury nominees, as your Morning Tax author noted. He actually did block some of Trump’s staffing choices for a while last year, like Justin Muzinich, the current deputy Treasury secretary.
Wyden is floating the idea of holds this time after calling Treasury’s response to his questions about Trump’s returns “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.” But there’s also some question about just how meaningful his threat could actually be for the five Treasury nominees under Finance jurisdiction waiting for Senate approval. Not even two months ago, Senate Republicans unilaterally changed the chamber’s rules to speed through the nominations below the Cabinet secretary level with up to two hours of floor debate, instead of the previous 30, as one former GOP aide noted to Morning Tax. (The former aide also wondered how likely it would be for a Trump nominee at Treasury to move via unanimous consent even without Wyden’s latest maneuver.)
WIN-WIN: There is a lot of attention these days on how to potentially expand the EITC, in no small part because House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) keeps saying he wants a bigger credit to be part of a tax extenders package and because a number of Democrats running for president are discussing ways to enlarge or revamp the incentive.
And let’s just say, the new study from Urban looks like it could only bolster the case for those advocates. The conclusion from Elaine Maag, Kevin Werner and Laura Wheaton is that boosting the EITC for childless workers evens the playing field between that group and workers with children. “More importantly, increasing the childless EITC substantially could increase employment rates among this traditionally disadvantaged group, which might in turn reduce crime, increase marriage rates, and increase child support payments,” the authors added.
The study assumed that the credit would be tripled (from about $500 to $1,500 a year) for childless workers, who could also start getting the EITC at 21 (not 25) and would be eligible for at least a partial credit with an income of up to $28,000 (instead of $15,000). Those new benchmarks would make about 24 million childless workers eligible for the credit, around three times the current amount, with the government handing out more than 10 times the current amount of benefits — from about $2.4 billion a year to $26 billion.
ON THE CALENDAR: Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their wives are scheduled to attend a reception this afternoon for Gold Star families, relatives of service members who died in the line of duty. The reception comes as lawmakers are basically united in wanting to reverse a tax increase from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) , on the benefits that children of those military personnel receive, but are grasping about for how to actually do it.
Speaking of TCJA: Our DataPoint team noted that the IRS collected around 22 percent less in business taxes in fiscal 2018 than it did the year before. The TCJA cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent starting in January 2018, though business tax collections also fell the previous two years. View the full DataPoint graphic here .

Around the World WE ALL GO DOWN TOGETHER: Matteo Salvini, Italy’s deputy prime minister and a big winner in this week’s European elections, told the rank-and-file of his rightist League party that he’s willing to let the entire governing coalition collapse unless the other members get in line behind his proposed flat tax and other priorities, Bloomberg reports. Salvini told his fellow League members that the coalition could last another four years, or fall apart in the summer. The flat tax was a signature campaign issue for the League, but it could ratchet up the tension between Rome and Brussels. The European Commission could end up levying financial penalties on Italy, setting the two up for a sequel to previous budget clashes.
Around the Nation DON’T LOOK AT ME: Rep. Donald Norcross (D-N.J.) sponsored legislation while a state senator that has so far funneled out about $7 billion in business tax breaks over the past six years, and once maintained that he “led the charge” for the initiative. Both of his brothers, including George, a well-known South Jersey power broker, are among the beneficiaries of that program. And now that the program has become increasingly controversial, Donald Norcross is trying to downplay his links to it, our Matt Friedman reports. A spokesman for the congressman would only say that he “remains proud of the fact that he joined with almost every other member of the Legislature” in backing the program. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat like Norcross, has set up a task force to look into how well the tax break program has been administered — and investigators have wasted no time in checking out businesses tied to George Norcross.

"'Tariff Man' strikes again. This time, U.S. imports from Mexico are targets.",www.politico.com,TAYLOR MILLER THOMAS,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trump-tariff-mexico-imports-1349377,"On May 30, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will set a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico until the country makes efforts to reduce illegal immigration to the United States. “On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Trump also tweeted that the tariffs would increase until the “problem is remedied,” and said details of the tariffs would follow. In 2018, nearly 14 percent of all U.S. imports came from Mexico. Top states that would be affected by the tariff include Michigan, Texas and Arizona.
Story Continued Below
The tariff threats come nearly two weeks after the U.S., Canada and Mexico had reached a deal to lift Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, and subsequent retaliatory tariffs. Both Canada and Mexico said those tariffs would impede progress in ratifying the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which would replace NAFTA.
In 2018, 13.6% of all imported goods to the U.S. came from Mexico
Tariffs on all Mexican imports would hit a range of consumer goods, from food and fresh produce to household products and appliances. U.S. consumers would likely pay the price.
“The evidence is, those prices get passed all the way through,” said Sherman Robinson, nonresident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who added the announcement was a “very worrisome development” that is “completely in violation of our commitments to the WTO.” Robinson explained that the tariff rate increase could affect low-income Americans more than others.
“A lot of this stuff is the low-end, so it’s going to really hit Walmart, Target,” and similar retailers, he said. “And that will disproportionately hit poor consumers.” Robinson predicted the U.S. auto production industry would also be hurt by the tariffs, and that U.S. farmers could be hurt if Mexico retaliates.

The president faces opposition from various industry groups and policymakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who in a statement said the president “demonstrated a further lack of understanding of the recklessness of his actions by threatening tariffs on Mexico.”
“Yet again, the President is sowing chaos over the border instead of delivering solutions for American workers and for American consumers,” Pelosi said.

How Trump’s Mexico tariffs could scare Democrats away from his trade deal,www.politico.com,SABRINA RODRIGUEZ,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trumps-mexico-tariffs-democrats-trade-1495457,"President Donald Trump’s signature trade deal is in jeopardy with Democrats thanks to his latest tariffs against Mexico and other aggressive trade moves.
A very tight time window for the United-States-Canada-Mexico pact is closing, giving him long odds for a win this year on one of his few legislative priorities that could attract Democratic support.
Story Continued Below
“We don’t see how it makes getting USMCA done any easier,” a Democratic leadership aide said Friday. “In fact, it suggests that Trump doesn’t care about USMCA at all, since he clearly doesn’t feel bound by its provisions and doesn’t care if actions like these could blow it up,”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had already been telling people she thought she could get her caucus to a yes on the trade deal, but only if the Trump administration worked through Democrats' concerns about enforcement provisions, pharmaceutical pricing and labor and environmental rules. Until this week, Trump appeared willing to wait for Pelosi to signal readiness before sending Congress the pact for a vote.
But Trump exploded that goodwill in the space of a few hours Thursday, first by taking a formal step toward starting the clock for Congress to consider the pact, then by threatening to slap tariffs on Mexican goods unless America's southern neighbor does more to stem the flow of Central American migrants seeking asylum in the U.S.
House Democratic leaders see the moves as just one more way the administration has contributed to the chaos of its own trade policy in recent weeks and believe it could further antagonize rank-and-file Democrats who are on the fence about the USMCA in the first place.
“There is a path, but it gets narrower every time there’s a breach of trust,” a Democratic congressional aide told POLITICO on Friday.
With 28 legislative days before summer recess, the Trump administration is already facing a narrow window to reach a deal with Democrats. And getting the trade agreement passed only gets harder after recess with 2020 campaigns ramping up.
Trump’s trade chief Robert Lighthizer and Pelosi have been working to reach a compromise, with the two sides agreeing to set up working groups on the issues concerning Democrats. But those task forces have yet to be assembled and Trump's decision on Thursday to formally set in motion the process of sending up the USMCA for a vote raised alarm among Democrats who felt it was a premature pressure tactic.
Pelosi panned the move and the Mexico tariffs in a statement Friday.
“We hope that the President will join us in bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform, be strategic about our trade relationships and recognize the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship,"" she said. “Yet again, the President is sowing chaos over the border instead of delivering solutions for American workers and for American consumers.”
Lighthizer is expected to be on Capitol Hill next week working with party leaders in both chambers to iron out any outstanding concerns on USMCA. But some Democratic lawmakers are worried that their efforts to work with Lighthizer are futile if the president has a separate agenda.
It feels as if Lighthizer “is out of the loop and we’re wasting our breath when this president is going to do whatever he wants to do,” Rep.Ron Kind (D-Wis.) told POLITICO.
GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, had felt emboldened in recent weeks after the administration removed steel and aluminum tariffs against Canada and Mexico — something many had warned were a major obstacle to the deal’s passage. The new tariffs on Mexico provoked a barrage of criticism from Republican senators, particularly those from farm and border states.
Some Democrats are particularly worried that Trump’s surprise move could further rattle members who were already anxious about the recent whiplash on tariffs.
“It’s incredibly foolish and poor timing,” Kind said. “We just ended the trade war with Mexico and Canada only to have a new tariff threat. With tariffs in place, it’s hard to move forward on USMCA.”
While the latest steps have ramped up tension in an already fraught negotiation, Democrats and Republicans alike maintain there is some possibility of the deal moving forward.
So far, Pelosi and her deputies are not altering plans to move ahead with the caucus’ working groups to help “try to get to a yes,” according to one senior Democratic aide.
“It certainly doesn’t help but I don't think it scrambles the path,” the aide said. “It creates uncertainty and it creates a little bit more friction but there's still a path to yes.”
Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) — whose district is along the southern border and includes the nation’s largest trading port — has been one of the Democratic party’s most vocal proponents of the deal.
The Texas Democrat was so alarmed by Trump’s actions that he called White House officials at 10 p.m. Thursday night to plead with them to reverse the tariffs decision.
“I said, ‘Hey, what are we doing here?” Cuellar recalled in an interview Friday, adding that he’s already fielded phone calls from U.S. companies in his district panicking about the move. “If the goal is to get Congress to approve NAFTA 2.0, this is absolutely contrary and counterproductive.”
It remains unclear what will happen on USMCA while Trump is threatening tariffs, which would take effect June 10 if Mexico doesn’t find a way to stem migration. The threat alone is likely to slow the pact’s approval in Mexico. Before Trump announced his tariff threat on Thursday, Mexican officials had moved to start the USMCA ratification process in Mexico’s Senate.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Friday that he remains committed to pushing for passage of the deal. But former Mexican officials say any new tariffs would make it more difficult — especially in the face of Trump’s continuous attacks on Mexico.
“It’s hard to believe the U.S. would actually go through with this. It’s contrary to the spirit of what we’ve been trying to build to get USMCA ratified in the three countries,” Kenneth Smith Ramos, Mexico’s former chief NAFTA negotiator, told POLITICO. “It’s clear the impact would be seriously off the charts.”
There also is little incentive for Mexico to pass a trade deal aimed at eliminating tariffs when the Trump administration feels it can still impose duties against the country even with an agreement in place, another former Mexican official closely involved in trade issues said.
“The fact is there are plenty of things that easily can derail the process,” the official said. “And even if all of those things line up, there will still be people asking, ‘What is the point of all of this?’”"
Nature Conservancy president resigns in wake of sexual harassment probe,www.politico.com,ZACK COLMAN,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/nature-conservancy-president-resigns-sexual-harassment-1495778,"Nature Conservancy President Brian McPeek resigned Friday, just days after the group completed an investigation into sexual harassment and workplace misconduct at the world’s largest environmental organization.
The news came two days after POLITICO first reported on the internal investigation at the group, which reported $1.3 billion in revenues last year and has long drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans. Its board of directors includes former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and former Obama administration Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, and its executives include former Obama White House climate adviser Heather Zichal.
CEO Mark Tercek emailed staff Friday afternoon to announce McPeek’s departure.
“Brian McPeek and I jointly agreed that the best way for TNC to move forward at this time is for him to resign. We both think this decision is in the best interest of the organization as well as Brian and his family,” he wrote.
The investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and McPeek's departure came amid rising scrutiny of executives of a vast array of companies and organizations, as the #MeToo movement has heightened attention to pervasive mistreatment of women.
In statement to POLITICO, a spokesperson for the group said Tercek and McPeek decided the best option was ""for Brian to resign. They have agreed this decision is in the best interest of the organization and for Brian. ""
McPeek had stepped aside from his role as president while the law firm McDermott Will & Emery investigated allegations of sexual harassment at the environmental group. The firm said it found that some employees complained of an organizational culture that is hostile to women, and that decision-makers often sided with the accused when people reported misconduct.
Tercek had faced questions at a company town hall on Thursday about McPeek’s ability to lead the organization.
The investigation did not name the three executives that accounted for a bulk of its report. The report described a former female employee who said she received an “unwelcome” kiss from one of those executives. Investigators found the woman “credible” despite the executive’s denials, but didn’t recommend punishment.
McPeek's exit drew praise from Sarah Hunt, co-founder and CEO of the Rainey Center, a public policy research group that seeks to raise the profiles of women and minorities.
""Women working in public policy have overcome significant hurdles to fight for causes they believe in and they deserve better from the leadership of their organizations,"" she said in an email. ""The Nature Conservancy will become an even stronger voice for conservation when its female employees are safe, supported, and celebrated.”
McPeek had been with the organization for 16 years. He was named president in May 2018.
An employee at the group welcomed McPeek's departure.
“Saving nature is hard work and we can’t do it without strong moral leadership. This change gives TNC a fresh shot at success,” a current senior staff member said via text message.
Separately, the investigators' report drew criticism from lawyers for Mark Burget, who headed the group's North American operations, and Kacky Andrews, who led its global programs, both of whom exited the group after the probe. The lawyers took issue with the report's conclusion that the pair had not disclosed that they were in a romantic relationship.
""Mr. Burget and Ms. Andrews voluntarily and repeatedly disclosed their relationship in a timely manner to senior leadership of the Nature Conservancy (TNC),"" the lawyers Paul Kiyonaga and Avi Kumin
""At all times, Mark and Kacky followed the letter and spirit of all TNC personnel policies, frequently consulted with the HR department and strictly followed the guidance provided,"" they added.

States seeking clarity in booming hemp oil market,www.politico.com,SARAH OWERMOHLE,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/states-hemp-oil-market-1460113,"Federal regulators’ murky response to the rapid legalization of the hemp extract CBD has created a patchwork of state responses — ranging from broadly permissive to raids on retailers and seizures of trailers loaded with lucrative leaf.
At a meeting Friday, FDA panelists asked pharmaceutical companies and patient organizations whether the widespread availability of off-the-shelf CBD products — ranging from pet food to skin oils touted as salves for all sorts of ailments — had an impact on efforts to research and develop cannabis-based medicines. But companies that want to use CBD as medicine countered that federal red tape is what’s holding up progress on developing drugs.
Confusion about the status of CBD dates back to December, when Congress’s farm bill threw a curve ball at regulators and state officials. It legalized hemp production nationwide, and with it the plant’s most profitable byproduct, the non-intoxicating drug cannibidiol, or CBD. The chemical also is found in marijuana, which is still banned under federal law, though plentiful in 33 states that have legalized it for either medical or recreational use.
The FDA has reminded Congress that there was already one approved product containing CBD — a prescription drug for two specific forms of childhood epilepsy — but that it needed at least a year to make federal rules that reflected the oil's safety and effectiveness, as a medical product or a low-dose additive for foods, ranging from lattes to waffles.
Story Continued Below
In the meantime, states are working on their own rules to handle the growing number of farmers and retailers hoping to cash in on CBD. It’s already a $1.5 billion market, and it should expand to $16 billion by 2025, according to Cowen analyst Vivien Azer.
“State legislators and policymakers are responding to the ground truth in their own backyards and doing a range of things,” said Coleen Klasmeier, an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP who represents industry clients. “More needs to happen at the federal level before anyone can do anything long term.”
Like snake oil salesmen of yore, some advocates claim the compound is good for what ails you — everything from insomnia to diabetes to PTSD, Parkinson's disease, addiction, anxiety and depression. And that doesn’t even include the skin and beauty products.
Hemp and marijuana are two versions of the same plant. Marijuana, which is distinguished by containing at least 0.3 percent of the psychoactive extract THC that gives people a high, remains in the federal government's most-restricted drug class.
While the FDA is responsible for only a section of the CBD regulatory maze, that realm is large, and federal lawmakers, growing frustrated with the uncertainty in their own states, have called on the agency to speed up its plans.
FDA has approved only one CBD-based drug, the epilepsy treatment, but off-the-shelf medical claims have run wild. So far the FDA has taken a whack-a-mole approach, dishing out warning letters to manufacturers that make unsubstantiated cancer-killing or Alzheimer’s-treating claims but largely leaving the rest of the industry alone .
The Department of Agriculture, which would regulate hemp production itself, has promised to issue a framework this year. Other agencies, from the Drug Enforcement Administration to the Department of Transportation, have been thrust into the debate as states take aggressive steps to confiscate supplies or stop hemp-carting 18-wheelers from traveling across borders.
“In addition to the fact that you’ve got states moving in different directions, you got multiple federal agencies that are still trying to sort through the regulatory framework for these products,” said Michael Werner, a lobbyist with clients in the CBD industry. “So the whole thing right now is extraordinarily confusing.”
FDA has ""outlined a step-wise approach to evaluate the regulatory strategy to determine whether it is safe to include CBD in foods or other consumer products,” Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy tweeted this month . “The goal is to do this as quickly as possible without risking public health.”
In one of his last Congressional testimonies, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb suggested one scenario: that potent CBD be regulated as a pharmaceutical requiring FDA approval, while low-dose products stay on the shelves.
GW Pharmaceuticals, which makes the CBD-based epilepsy drug Epidiolex, wants the agency to provide incentives to manufacturers developing cannabis-based medicines, said CEO Justin Gover. He's concerned that the widespread availability of CBD would slacken pharmaceutical interest in researching its medical value, a worry also raised by Gottlieb.
Friday's FDA meeting won't resolve any big issues but might help crystallize the complex issues involved, said Ian Stewart, a California lawyer with Wilson Elser who represents CBD clients. “Even if the meeting is a disaster and nothing comes out of it, that’s not going to stop the industry.”
A coalition of multistate CBD manufacturers will make the case at the meeting that states have already laid the groundwork for CBD regulation. They have pathways for approving cannabis producers and retailers and in some cases are even requiring bar codes that allow tracking of products.
""It has often been the FDA’s perspective to funnel everything towards this safety issue. But you can stand back for a minute and say ‘wait, this product has been consumed this way for five years, it’s been regulated at the state level, and there have not been serious incidences,"" said Jessica Wasserman, a partner with Greenspoon Marder who is advising the coalition.
But only 33 states have legalized marijuana in some form, and not all have built those frameworks that can translate to CBD.
Instead, states have taken a variety of approaches as CBD has blossomed in popularity. Laws range from ""this is legal"" to banning it as if it were a controlled substance ""even though it’s not,” said Jonathan Havens, co-founder of the Cannabis Law Practice at Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr LLP.
Earlier this year South Dakota passed a bill removing FDA-approved CBD drugs from a list of controlled substances. Soon after, South Dakota’s attorney general issued a news release saying all forms of industrial hemp and CBD remain illegal in the state, with the exception of Epidiolex.
However, some county attorneys say they won’t prosecute such cases. “I do not think CBDs are illegal under South Dakota law,” said Mark Vargo, Pennington County state's attorney.
In Maine, meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed a bill that would allow manufacturers to add CBD to food. The bill is a response to a crackdown from the Maine health department ordering the products pulled off the shelves, but contradicts FDA guidance.
Georgia passed a law in May that also establishes a state-regulated industry for hemp farming and CBD oil sales. But the state’s agriculture commissioner, Gary Black, said FDA regulations bar Georgia retailers from selling food products or dietary supplements with CBD.
In Texas, lawmakers are trying to toe the line between opening the door to legal hemp production, a profitable business for farmers, while keeping the door shut on marijuana.
Retailers — and farmers — are confused, said state Rep. Tracy King, a Democratic lawmaker who represents a rural South Texas district and authored a bill, which establishes a state-regulated hemp industry. Gov. Greg Abbott has yet to indicate whether he will sign the bill.
Until then, the sale of CBD products will remain illegal in Texas, said Shannon Edmonds, director of governmental relations at the Texas District and County Attorneys Association.
The patchwork of regulation has also created headaches for national retailers that want to stock their shelves with profitable CBD oils.
Lazarus Naturals, which sells CBD products online to individuals and other retailers, doesn’t face any legal issues in Oregon, where it's based, but warns customers in other states that CBD is still a ""high risk"" product, said Dylan Summers, the company’s director of government affairs.

Prosecutors refute Roger Stone's claim that Russia didn't hack DNC - POLITICO,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/roger-stone-russia-hack-dnc-1349432,"By JOSH GERSTEIN and NATASHA BERTRAND
""For example, allegations concerning the time stamps and the time signatures would be equally consistent with Russia intelligence officers using a thumb drive to transfer hacked materials among themselves after the hack took place,"" prosecutors wrote. ""Similarly, the time zone analysis is wholly consistent with the fact that the victims were in the Eastern Daylight Time Zone, rather than providing any information regarding the location of the perpetrators.""
Ultimately, they argue, Stone presented no evidence ""that suggests that Russia was not involved in the hack.""
And prosecutors also emphasized that their search warrants for Stone would be valid even if his claims about the origin of the hacks were true.
""[R]eferences to Russia’s role played little if any role in the various probable cause determinations, which were primarily based on Stone’s communications with individuals and entities that took credit for the hacks or were disseminating the stolen materials,"" prosecutors wrote.
Prosecutors indicated they obtained their first search warrant against Stone in August 2017, more than a year before his indictment and they obtained another 17 through February 2019. Of those, 12 were signed off on by Washington’s federal district court chief judge Beryl Howell, three others were approved by other D.C.-based judges, and three more were backed by judges in New York and Florida.
Fourteen of the search warrants requests indicate that Stone was in touch with hackers — known by the moniker Guccifer 2.0 — and that Guccifer 2.0 ultimately claimed responsibility for the DNC hacks. And they also indicated that WikiLeaks disseminated the hacked emails, and that Stone communicated with WikiLeaks.
""Each affidavit submits that, based on those communications, there was probable cause to believe that evidence related to the DNC hack would be found in the specified location,"" they wrote. ""Many of these affidavits contain additional evidence alleging probable cause to believe evidence will be found of violations of additional crimes.""
Prosecutors also said they had probable cause Stone may have committed other crimes: accessory after the fact, misprision of a felony, conspiracy, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and foreign contribution bans."
Police: 12 dead in Virginia Beach mass shooting - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/police-11-dead-in-virginia-beach-mass-shooting-1349434,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A longtime city employee opened fire in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, killing 12 people on three floors and sending terrified co-workers scrambling for cover before police shot and killed him following a “long gun battle,” authorities said.
Police identified the suspect as DeWayne Craddock.
Four other people were wounded in Friday’s shooting, including a police officer whose bulletproof vest saved his life, said Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera. The city’s visibly shaken mayor, Bobby Dyer, called it “the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.”
The shooting happened shortly after 4 p.m. when the veteran employee of the Public Utilities Department entered a building in the city’s Municipal Center, and “immediately began to indiscriminately fire upon all of the victims,” Cervera said.
Police entered the building and got out as many employees as they could, then exchanged fire with the suspect, who was armed with a .45-caliber handgun, the chief said. “It was a long gun battle between those four officers and the suspect,” he said. He said officers gave the suspect first aid after he was shot, but he died.
Police initially said the gunman shot and killed 11 people, including one who was found inside a vehicle outside the municipal building. Cervera later said one more died on the way to the hospital.
The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state’s largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area.
Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a statement he was devastated by the “unspeakable, senseless violence,” and is offering the state’s full support to survivors and relatives of the victims.
“That they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,” the governor said during the news conference.
The White House said had been briefed and was monitoring the situation.
Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door.
“We tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,” she said. “We were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn’t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.”
She texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building and she and others were waiting for police.
“Thank God my baby is OK,” Banton’s mother, Dana Showers, said.
At a nearby middle school, friends and relatives were reuniting with loved ones who were in the building when the shooting happened. They included Paul Swain, 50, who said he saw his fiancee from across the parking lot, clearly in an agitated state.
“I think she knew some of the people,” he said.
Outside the school, Cheryl Benn, 65, waited while her husband, David, a traffic engineer with the city who was in the building where the shooting happened, gave a written statement to detectives.
She said her husband initially called her from a barricaded room and said it sounded as if someone had been working with a nail gun. Then he saw the bodies.
“This is unbelievable for Virginia Beach,” Cheryl Benn said. “By and large, it’s a pretty calm and peaceful place to live.”"
Trump’s tariff war leaves allies fretting about losing strong economy - POLITICO,www.politico.com,ANITA KUMAR,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/trump-tariff-war-allies-1349435,"Donald Trump’s aides and allies scrambled Friday to put a positive spin on the president’s threat to hit Mexico with new tariffs, fearing that the move could cost him his strongest re-election talking point — the economy.
Trump made the move late Thursday, overriding the concerns of several top aides, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and catching his surrogates off guard. In the hours that followed, the Trump campaign and some White House aides were slow to respond to questions about the decision, a sharp contrast to the coordinated messaging that came after other recent major news events, including the end of the Russia probe and Trump’s recent immigration policy rollout .
The reaction illustrated Trump’s isolation on the issue and the degree to which the president was freelancing — the rollout of the decision was not fully prepared when Trump tweeted about it. It wasn’t just White House aides who opposed the move. Prominent Republicans lashed out, business leaders sounded the alarm and the president’s biggest campaign supporters openly acknowledged their anxiety.
Scott Jennings, who worked under President George W. Bush and is close to the Trump White House, said Trump will get credit from his base, but conceded that he is “extraordinarily nervous” about the possible economic effect of the tariffs. Stocks took a hit Friday as jittery business leaders warned that the tactic was woefully misguided, damaging American consumers and likely resulting in retaliatory tariffs by Mexico.
“If the economy slows down and ceases to be red hot, that’s going to make it hard to be re-elected,” Jennings said.
By midday Friday, Trump allies had settled on their message: Trump was taking decisive action to cut illegal immigration, even if it meant threatening the U.S. economy in the short run. And they stressed that the economy has stayed strong despite similar dire warnings every time Trump previously imposed tariffs.
“The president has been doing these disruptive actions and the threats of these disruptive actions for two years and the economy is the strongest it’s been in half a century,” said Bryan Lanza, who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign and transition and remains close to the White House. “Economists don’t know how to mold around President Trump.”
Trump on Thursday said he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico starting on June 10 unless the country takes actions to stop Central American migrants from entering the U.S. If Trump remains unsatisfied with Mexico’s actions, he said he will jump the tariffs each month until they hit 25 percent on Oct. 1.
It’s not the first time Trump has used the threat of tariffs to try and bully a country into taking action. He favors using tariffs because they are immediate and don’t need congressional approval, according to people familiar with his thinking. The president has previously imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and on metals from Europe and Japan.
This time, Stephen Miller, the administration’s most influential advocate for stricter immigration policies, was the most vocal White House aide pushing to hit Mexico with tariffs. On the other side were aides, including Lighthizer, who opposed the move in part because it could risk a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, a top legislative priority.
A White House official said the aides who opposed the tariffs weren’t vocal enough when they spoke to Trump, perhaps because the tariffs won’t go into effect until June 10, giving Mexico time to act. When recently meeting with staff about the issue, Trump had made up his mind on the issue, but did ask senior advisers if anyone disagreed with the policy, the official said.
Trump has grown more frustrated in recent months with his administration’s inability to halt the surge of immigrants crossing the southern border, one of his signature 2016 campaign promises.
He has long considered tariffs in retaliation for what he believes is the Mexican government’s failure to stem the tide of immigrants coming into the U.S., which has reached its highest level in years. U.S. Border Patrol arrested nearly 99,000 migrants at the border in April, many from Central America.
But his announcement frustrated aides who think tariffs will drive up costs of consumer goods, hurt the broader economy and jeopardize the trading relationship with the U.S.’s neighbor and ally. Trump has said that he thinks tariffs are paid by the U.S.’s trading partners but economists say that Americans are actually paying for them.
After Trump made his decision Thursday, aides began to plan for the rollout — which had not been fully prepared — by contacting Republican lawmakers and holding a conference call with reporters.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump is “the only one who’s stepping up” to try to stop rising immigration at the southern border. Campaign spokesman Kayleigh McEnany said “President Trump's tariffs are a necessary step to catalyze action.”
Trump surrogates were sent an email Friday with talking points titled “President Trump Takes Decisive Action to Secure the Border and Keep Our Nation Safe.”
And Trump, as he often does, began his own messaging strategy on Twitter.
“Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD,” he wrote. “Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!”

Nunes demands public release of Mueller's 'backup and source documentation',www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/nunes-mueller-backup-source-documentation-1349437,"Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, called Friday for the public release of all of special counsel Robert Mueller's ""backup and source documentation,"" a call that goes even further than most Democrats' demands for more transparency around Mueller's report.
Though most Republicans in Congress have lambasted Democrats for continuing to demand access to Mueller's underlying files, Nunes (R-Calif.) argued that accessing those documents — and making them public — would expose Mueller's effort as a ""fraud."" Democrats say they want the same materials because they'll aid investigations into Mueller's evidence that repeatedly attempted to obstruct his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Nunes' argument followed the release by prosecutors of a voicemail left by one of Trump's attorneys in 2017 with a lawyer for Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who became a crucial cooperator for Mueller. The voicemail from Dowd came on the eve of Flynn's decision to abandon a joint defense agreement with Trump and begin working with Mueller. In his report's volume on obstruction of justice, Mueller highlighted excerpts of the voicemail noting that Trump's lawyer, John Dowd, asked for a heads up on any information that ""implicates the president"" and mentioned Trump's ""feelings toward Flynn.""
On Friday, Mueller's team released a full transcript of the voicemail on the order of a federal judge. In the fuller transcript, Dowd had indicated he wanted a heads up ""not only for the president but for the country.""
""Um, just for the sake of...protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any...confidential information,"" Dowd said, according to the transcript.
Nunes pointed to the omission of those lines from Mueller's report as proof of malfeasance on Mueller's part and said it justifies the public release of all of Mueller's backup information.
""This is why we need all backup and source documentation for the #muellerdossier released publicly. It’s all a fraud..."" Nunes tweeted.
Mueller highlighted Dowd's voicemail as part of his evidence suggesting Trump or his allies may have attempted to influence Flynn's willingness to cooperate with investigators. Mueller's argument that Dowd had conveyed Trump's continued warm feelings toward Flynn — combined with public and private efforts by Trump to encourage Flynn to stay strong — could have affected Flynn's willingness to cooperate, or limited the extent of his willingness to help. But Mueller also noted that attorney-client privilege issues prevented him from learning whether Trump ""was personally involved in or knew about"" Dowd's outreach.
Notably, Democrats have met fierce criticism from Republicans for making similar demands. They've accused Democrats of trying to relitigate Mueller's findings and Trump has attacked them repeatedly as seeking a ""do-over"" of Mueller's work. He asserted executive privilege earlier this month at the urging of Attorney General William Barr to shield Mueller's underlying evidence from efforts by Congress to obtain them.
It's not the first time Nunes has broken from the GOP message on the Mueller report. He signed two joint letters with Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) demanding access to all of Mueller's files for the committee, even threatening to subpoena for them if Barr didn't cooperate. Schiff issued that subpoena earlier this month."
DOJ exploring antitrust investigation of Google,www.politico.com,politico.com,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/31/google-antitrust-justice-department-1349436,"The Justice Department has taken the initial steps toward an antitrust investigation of Google, a clear signal that two years of a bipartisan anti-Silicon Valley backlash in Washington may be yielding concrete action.
But such a case, if it comes to pass, would represent a major new antitrust test for the Trump DOJ, which tried, and failed, to block to the merger of AT&T and Time Warner. And any attempt to break up Google — as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and others are proposing — would be a daunting challenge for the government, whose last big split up of a corporate giant was AT&T's former telephone monopoly in 1984.
Story Continued Below
Even so, DOJ officials have begun laying the groundwork for an antitrust probe of Google's search practices, having wrested jurisdiction over the issue away from the Federal Trade Commission, two people close to the situation confirmed to POLITICO late Friday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the development.
The department’s move intensifies the already considerable political pressure on Google at a time when lawmakers, regulators and government leaders in Washington, Brussels and beyond are turning a critical eye on the once-favored U.S. tech industry over everything from its mishandling of user data to its role in the subversion of democratic elections. And the action quickly got bipartisan cover with a statement of praise from Warren, a presidential candidate who called earlier this year for breaking up Google, Facebook and Amazon.
""I've been talking for years about how Google is locking out competition,"" Warren said Friday night, adding that it and its fellow online giants ""have too much power and they're using that power to hurt small businesses, stifle innovation, and tilt the playing field against everyone else. It's time to fight back.""
Google dominates the markets for online advertising and search, and has major footholds in email, streaming media, photos, e-books, television, car navigation and even its own branded smartphones. Its parent company, Alphabet, has also ventured into fields like drones and self-driving cars.
A move against Google would be in keeping with the agenda of DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, a Trump nominee who has been talking up the idea of subjecting internet firms to closer examination . In a speech last year, he said that ""if there is clear evidence of harm to competition in digital platforms, enforcers must take vigorous action and seek remedies that protect American consumers.""
Representatives for the DOJ, the FTC and Google declined to comment.
The decision to move a possible antitrust probe to the Justice Department instead of the FTC may be bad news for Google, which survived a previous FTC inquiry that ended in 2013 with no serious repercussions for the company.
But Trump’s Justice Department suffered a high-profile loss in a previous attempt at aggressive antitrust action, when it tried to argue that AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner would cause higher prices and reduced choice for media consumers. The courts ruled in favor of the companies, which were allowed to merge.
The DOJ has a range of enforcement tools to address anti-competitive behavior, and it’s not clear yet which it might seek to use in the case of Google. If the DOJ eventually goes the route of trying to break up the company, however, legal experts have cautioned that today’s online behemoths pose even bigger challenges for antitrust enforcers than age-old corporate giants such as Standard Oil.
For one thing, courts have become more conservative since the 1970s when it comes to antitrust doctrine, requiring the government to prove that anti-competitive behavior has a real economic impact on businesses or consumers. DOJ failed to meet that standard in the 1990s when it tried to separate Microsoft’s operating system and browser products, a case that Microsoft won on appeal.
And even successful antitrust cases can be lengthy and expensive. It took a decade for the Justice Department to break up AT&T’s old Bell System in 1984, and another decade for the government to wage its unsuccessful fight against Microsoft. The Bell telephone case began under President Gerald Ford and ended when Ronald Reagan was in the White House — and similarly, any attempt to break up Google could last years beyond Trump’s presidency.
Still, Trump, who frequently alleges that Google is biased against conservatives, has shown interest in subjecting internet giants to government scrutiny, saying in August that Google, Amazon and Facebook could be in a ""very antitrust situation."" He added of Google: ""I tell you, there are some moments where we say, 'Wow, that really is bad, what they're doing.'""
Google came under further attack in Washington this year when Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, publicly criticized the company for pursuing research projects in China while withdrawing from work with the Defense Department. Google decided not to renew an artificial intelligence contract with the military after an internal backlash from employees upset that the technology could be used for warfare.
Amid the increasing heat on Google, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, met with Trump at the White House in March, with Trump later tweeting that Pichai ""discussed political fairness and various things that @Google can do for our Country."" He added: ""Meeting ended very well!""
A full-blown antitrust investigation of Google would bring the U.S. more in line with the European Union, where antitrust enforcers have punished the search giant over how it does business.
In March, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager levied a $1.7 billion fine against Google over its online advertising practices, bringing the total penalties against the company in the European Union to nearly $10 billion.

Labor anger over Green New Deal greets 2020 contenders in California,www.politico.com,CARLA MARINUCCI,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/06/01/labor-anger-over-green-new-deal-greets-2020-contenders-in-california-1027570,"LOS ANGELES — Blue-collar union workers in solidly Democratic California are rejecting ""Green New Deal"" politics, a possible preview of troubles for 2020 presidential hopefuls in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.
When Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti launched his ""Green New Deal LA"" plan last month amid cheers from environmentalists, hundreds of jeans-wearing, tattooed union members outside the event chanted “Garcetti’s gotta go” and denounced the move as a betrayal. The Garcetti protest was followed by disputes in the state capital this month over a large buffer zone that would block new oil and gas wells, as well as a massive hydro project near Joshua Tree.
Robbie Hunter, president of the state Building and Construction Trades Council — which represents more than 400,000 workers — says that dozens of his members plan a major “Blue Collar Revolution” demonstration Saturday morning at the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco, which will be attended by 14 of the Democratic presidential contenders and 5,000 delegates and guests.
The effort aims to send a message that the party is in danger of eroding a critical base if it continues to back the Green New Deal resolution being pushed in Washington, D.C. by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and her allies. Hunter argues the measure's goals could endanger thousands of jobs in the Southern California oil industry alone.
“All it does is do what the Democratic Party seems to be very good at lately — which is export our jobs, while doing nothing for the end game, which is the environmental,’’ Hunter said.
And California labor forces this weekend are also expected to also put their clout behind Rusty Hicks, who heads the Los Angeles Labor Federation — a candidate in a contentious race to chair the California Democratic Party. Hicks has signaled labor’s concerns by signing a letter opposing a move to ban a hazardous acid from refineries, saying it ""will lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs for local people and cost our region millions of dollars in activity. We cannot dismiss these jobs or look at the women and as expendable: because they are not.”
“The Green New Deal may be the darling of the Democratic Party — but it really divides the Democrats on a fault line, which is more of the elites against the working class Democrats who are concerned about losing their jobs,"" said Jessica Levinson, a member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and a professor who teaches politics and ethics at Loyola Law School.
Lifelong union members “don’t necessarily want to be retrained’’ for other, greener work spots — “nor is it even possible,’’ says Levinson. She predicts with the 2020 election looming, Democratic leaders will have to wrestle with the fact that “unlike the Mueller report and impeachment and indictment — people vote on whether or not they’re going to lose their job.”
While there's no chance that President Donald Trump will take California, pushing too far on the Green New Deal could ""make it difficult for Democrats to recapture crucial Western states” like Colorado and Nevada — both won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 — “and it would certainly be an issue in states like Pennsylvania,"" said Jack Pitney, a veteran California political analyst and political science professor at Claremont McKenna College.
He says there’s a “cautionary tale” for Democrats, who should remember that “West Virginia, until 2000, was considered solidly blue."" Republican strategist Karl Rove, working for candidate George W. Bush, pushed the fact “that the Democratic nominee was Al Gore, author of 'Earth in the Balance,’'’ a fact that didn’t sit well with coal miners, Pitney recalls.
“So yes, this is a real hazard for Democrats, something that somebody from a state with extractive industries may want to recognize,’’ he said.
In Los Angeles, Garcetti's plan establishes a wide range of environmental goals, including an 80 percent renewable energy supply by 2036 and making every building emissions-free by 2050.
Unions argue that Garcetti hasn't considered his plan's effect on jobs. They say reducing in-state petroleum production and refining will simply shift Los Angeles to imported supplies, while forcing workers too old for retraining into retirement.
“[Garcetti's] got the big corporations with him, and he’s not thinking of the effects on the common people,’’ said Paul Valdez, 58, a third-generation building trades worker from Thousand Oaks. “If they start taking away our jobs, who’s going to pay our bills?”
Brian D’Arcy, business manager of the powerhouse International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Los Angeles, says that Garcetti’s move is just the latest on the environmental front that’s pushing his members toward the GOP — and into the arms of Trump, who effectively wooed blue-collar Rust Belt workers on his way to a 2016 presidential win.
“I’m getting hate mail and blowback from our workers, saying the Democratic Party is doing nothing for us,’’ D’Arcy says, sitting surrounded by his union members in a hall in Los Angeles as they prepared to protest on the streets. Asked if members might gravitate toward Trump, D’Arcy sighed and said, “It’s already happening.”
He said he has heard from scores of members who are so angered about the issue they are considering sitting out the election — or even casting a ballot for Trump .
While most political observers say the state is unlikely to shift red, Garcetti told POLITICO he is keenly aware of the concerns. “I never dismiss people’s fears — I think they come from a real place and a word of warning,’’ he said. But, he insisted, “I have deep confidence that those fears are not only unfounded, but it’s the opposite ... there is so much to gain.”
Though he's offered few specifics on some 400,000 new jobs he says would result from shifting to carbon-free technologies, Garcetti says his goal is to “take the skills that [workers] have and to be able to bring them into greener, more renewable jobs.”
That will mean balancing the concerns of labor with the environmental and health concerns of millions of Angelenos who live in the shadow of oil derricks that have been a fixture since the city's founding — and may be spewing pollution, he says.
At the state Capitol, unions helped defeat a bill that would have curbed oil production by establishing a 2,500-foot buffer zone around new oil and gas wells that aren't on federal land. The setback would have applied to homes, schools, hospitals and playgrounds, going further than local ordinances like Kern County's 210-foot buffer and Los Angeles County's 300-foot requirement.
Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi’s bill, CA AB345 (19R) , stalled in the Assembly Appropriations Committee this month, after union workers turned out in force at last month's Natural Resources Committee hearing to protest it.
The bill was “an overreach’’ that would have had a dramatic impact on jobs, said Scott Wetch, a lobbyist whose firm represents the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Utility Workers Union of America and State Pipe Trades Council, among other unions. ""We have to respond accordingly.""
In another high-profile instance, construction and electrical workers supported CA SB772 (19R) , which would have opened the door for a large hydropower project near Joshua Tree National Park pursued by NextEra. But the bill died this week amid sharp opposition from environmentalists, consumer advocates and clean energy suppliers.
Wetch says it's a false notion that labor works against environmental goals. He pointed out that unions backed several landmark bills that steadily increased the state's Renewables Portfolio Standard. And they took a potentially decisive stance this year against CA SB386 (19R) , which would have allowed some irrigation districts to count power from their hydroelectric dams, which currently is prohibited and opposed by environmentalists. The bill died this week in the Senate.
""We have environmental credentials that I'll defend anytime,"" he said. ""But when it no longer becomes a discussion of smart public policy and how you get to your stated goals but just one politician after another trying to outpander one another to claim they're greener than the next guy, that's when you run into extreme problems.""
He charged that Garcetti is bowing solely to environmental interests by announcing ""we're going to shut down all five of the gas-fired power plants in the L.A. basin without a legitimate plan.”
""Talk about the most pandering piece of political activism that I've ever seen,"" Wetch said. ""The mayor should be ashamed of himself.""
Union leaders and members say they’re also deeply concerned that other aspects of the Green New Deal may impact their members’ bottom line, such as congestion pricing for tolls on freeways during rush hour and higher gas taxes.
Environmentalists point to cooperation with labor in some areas, like electric vehicles, where the jobs argument is less potent. Dan Jacobson of Environment California said the frame used to be about the environment versus the economy, as with logging: ""You were going to cut down the tree or you were going to save a lumberjack's job. That was horrible compared to what it is now.""
He said he believes unions are getting greener in some areas, but remain in a dispute over oil-related jobs.
""If you looked at the people who work with EVs, they'd go, we're hand in glove with the unions.' If you work with people who are 'keep it in the ground,' it's more antagonistic.""
Muratsuchi, whose Los Angeles County district includes a refinery owned by PBF Energy (which also employs Wetch's firm), also argues that it's not a zero-sum debate. But he acknowledges the tensions.
""I'm not trying to shut down this industry,"" he said at last month's committee hearing on his bill. ""I've never talked about shutting down this industry and I have a strong record of supporting good union jobs. But the development of oil and gas should not come at the expense of our most vulnerable populations.""
Sierra Club California director Kathryn Phillips said that both Garcetti and Green New Deal backers like her organization are “all about just transitions” that will be fair to both labor and the environment. She said that environmentalists and union members agree on the goals but have different ideas on how to reach them.
“The sadness here is that if you talked to a lot of workers individually ... they know that we have got to get off of oil,"" she said. ""Everyone knows that. But it’s the pain of getting there.’’"
Progressives Should Read Progressive History—So They Don’t Blow It This Time - POLITICO Magazine,www.politico.com,John F.

Calls to overhaul the Supreme Court and replace the Electoral College. Many activists today are heralding a new progressive movement—a successor to the vibrant reform coalition that swept both major political parties in the early years of the 20th century.
There’s more than a little truth to this comparison. America’s current reality—marked by rising income inequality, the concentration of political and economic power and changing patterns of work and leisure—bears uncanny similarity to conditions that produced a burst of reform activity more than 120 years ago, including measures to improve urban health and safety standards, ameliorate labor conditions and introduce more efficiency and transparency in state and local government.
Story Continued Below
But if contemporary progressives aspire to drive the same degree of change as the progressive movement of the early 20th century, they might take a cue from their ideological forebears.
Many of today’s progressives define their movement by commitment to a specific menu of policies, and those who don’t share this very specific set of goals are easily read out of the progressive movement, typecast as “neoliberals” or “corporate liberals.” This kind of rigidity is something that their progressive forerunners never exhibited. The progressive movement of the early 1900s was successful precisely because it was flexible and incorporated a wide range of views—so much so that the movement defies easy definition.
Indeed, historians have struggled for decades to characterize the progressive movement. Was it a coalition of middle-class reformers dedicated to good government? A top-down drive by politicians and businessmen to smooth out the sharper edges of industrial capitalism and blunt the appeal of socialism? The political project of urban working men and women who demanded better working and living conditions? A full assault against concentrated economic power? A case could be made for any of these interpretations.
In some ways, the progressive movement is hard to pin down because it was no movement at all, but rather an ever-shifting coalition of organized groups and individuals who agreed on certain issues and disagreed on others. They worked together and in opposition with equal fluidity and enjoyed strongholds within each of the two major political parties. Bound together by a common self-definition and guided by malleable principles, they entertained a diversity of thought and action. It was precisely this wide range of thought and action that made progressivism so powerful.

America at the turn of 20th century was a wealthy nation distinguished by widespread income inequality and a growing concentration of wealth and political power. Increasingly, it seemed, a small number of companies controlled access to and pricing for the goods and services that people consumed and dictated how much ordinary families took home in pay. Citizens welcomed the conveniences of new technology and a burgeoning consumer economy but fretted over their general loss of personal autonomy.
Visiting in 1900, an English traveler marveled that “life in the United States is a whirl of telephones, telegrams, phonographs, electric bells, motors, lifts, and automatic instruments.” In constant dollars, adjusted for inflation, the country’s gross national product grew from $11 billion in the 1880s to an eye-popping $84 billion by 1919. By the mid-1920s, almost two-thirds of American households were electrified, representing a dramatic break with the 19th century. It meant that the typical nonrural family (electricity still remained rare in the countryside) could replace hours of labor with the satisfying hum of the electric refrigerator or vacuum cleaner. Americans also ate better and more cheaply than ever before and had more money left over each month to indulge in mass-produced clothing and new “public amusements,” such as professional sporting events, dance halls, amusement parks and nickelodeons. “You just spent your summer canning in 1890,” recalled a housewife from Muncie, Indiana, “but the canned goods you buy today are so good that it isn’t worth your while to do so much.”
But prosperity did not beget equality. In 1890, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans claimed 51 percent of the nation’s real estate and property. Two decades later, the Brookings Institution found that 42 percent of households lived on the edge of rough subsistence. The combined income of the top 0.1 percent of families equaled that of the bottom 42 percent. Cyclical unemployment and underemployment were the norm for many working people. In other words, the material conditions associated with poverty had changed, but many people remained poor.
Business consolidation also created schisms. Between 1895 and 1905 alone, 157 holding companies swallowed thousands of independent businesses and came into control of 40 percent of the market share in their specific industry verticals. Men who had so recently enjoyed a modicum of autonomy as independent farmers and artisans bristled at the regimented and monotonous life of wage work, whether in mines, factories or offices. Working and living conditions in the nation’s bustling cities grew dangerous in the absence of regulation. Farmers chafed at the outsize influence of banks and railroads that dictated their cost basis and profit margins. People increasingly felt themselves powerless at work—helpless in the face of large, influential interests that controlled the nation’s economic life—and pawns in a political system rife with corruption and generally unresponsive to the needs of everyday Americans.
Little wonder, then, that the first two decades of the 20th century gave rise to a vibrant reform spirit that expressed itself in a wide spectrum of political, economic and social causes—from settlement houses, which provided social services to impoverished urban immigrants, and advocacy for public health improvements and municipal reform, to occupational safety regulations (particularly for women and children), the direct election of United States senators, statutes governing the food and drug industries, and crackdowns on economic trusts.
In some basic fashion, these various progressive causes reflected a dissatisfaction with the status quo and a determination to restore economic and political power to ordinary Americans. But to call it a “movement” belies the very clear divisions and points of divergence between the broad cast of characters who identified as progressives.
Some of these divisions are obvious. Rural farmers who championed railroad and bank regulation often had little sympathy for urban Americans—particularly new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe whose claims to both citizenship and whiteness seemed suspect. Though farmers principally blamed railroads and intermediaries like grain-elevator operators for their troubles—in 1908, a federal commission found that 80 percent of farmers felt they enjoyed no influence over the prices their products commanded—they often lashed out at distant cities, too. In 1900, dairy farmers withheld milk products from Boston until they could secure price increases; syndicates selling to wholesalers in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago soon applied their own supply boycotts.
William Jennings Bryan, a populist orator who helped ignite the farmer rebellion of the 1890s and later anchored progressive forces in Woodrow Wilson’s Cabinet, was a fierce opponent of large economic combinations—the hulking monopolies and holding companies that had come to dominate the nation’s economy—and supported a state takeover of railroads, arguing that “public ownership is necessary where competition is impossible.” These views were common among progressives, rural and urban alike, but there remained a sharp cleavage between town and country. Bryan tapped into a deep reserve of rural resentment when he famously thundered, “Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.”
Progressives were also divided on race and civil rights. Some prominent white progressives like Oswald Garrison Villard and Joel Spingarn—and, in his own halting way, Theodore Roosevelt—joined black progressives in championing civil rights. Others—notably, Wilson, the Virginia-born progressive president who segregated the federal workforce, and Rebecca Felton, an outspoken feminist from Georgia who became the first woman to serve in the United States Senate—were extreme proponents of Jim Crow laws. Felton famously argued that “if it takes lynching to protect women’s dearest possession from drunken ravening human beasts, then I say lynch a thousand a week.”
Self-styled progressives were also at odds over women’s suffrage. Social reformers, particularly many who came of political age in the settlement movement, agreed with Jane Addams, the founder of Hull-House in Chicago, that women required the vote to fulfill their traditional roles as mothers, wives and guardians of the home. In effect, they didn’t challenge the traditional idea of separate spheres for each gender but used that notion to demand a voice in public affairs. Municipal governments in the early 20th century were notoriously corrupt and inefficient; women, argued Addams and other progressive advocates of women's suffrage, required the vote to ensure the provision of adequate schools, parks, sanitation and building and work codes. Not all progressives agreed. One study of 400 self-identified progressive congressmen who served throughout the era found its respondents almost evenly split on suffrage. Given the central role women played in progressive politics, the struggle for women’s political rights created a notable and often bitter split in reform circles.
It wasn’t just that progressives—like nonprogressive Americans—were divided by region, race and gender. They also differed in how they understood the very meaning of progressivism. For many in the movement—like reform mayors such as Mark Fagan of Jersey City, New Jersey; Seth Low of New York; Tom Johnson of Cleveland; and Samuel “Golden Rule” Jones of Toledo, Ohio—progressivism was principally about checking the power of large interests and providing better and more honest government to citizens. For settlement house leaders like Addams and Florence Kelley, it was about empowering poor urban residents by improving the environment in which they lived.
Progressives even disagreed over so fundamental an issue as what representative democracy should look like. While many in the movement concerned themselves with the reinvigoration of America’s political institutions (the direct election of senators, for example—a landmark progressive achievement), other progressive causes demonstrated darker, antidemocratic tendencies.
In American cities, many of which were rife with mismanagement and corruption, progressives’ infatuation with expertise and organization led to several innovations designed to reduce the power of political machines and increase the power of individual citizens, including the short ballot, which reduced the number of offices up for election at one time, thereby allowing voters to research their options more thoroughly.
But in 1913, the city of Dayton, Ohio, went a step further and introduced the city manager model wherein elected officials delegated administrative authority and responsibilities to a professional manager who had not been elected. As often as not, city managers pulled authority from elected officials who represented growing immigrant and working-class populations. The city manager system might have combated a corrupt political machine, but it also took power from the voting public, generating fissures between working-class voters and middle-class reformers, even as they supported the same health, safety and workplace reforms.
In the same way that middle-class progressives favored managerial expertise over participatory democracy, they also invoked science and standards to lock working-class Americans out of white-collar professions. For many decades, the barrier to practice law or medicine had been low, in keeping with the democratic spirit of Jacksonian America. Yet by 1901, 25 states adopted progressive reforms that required specialized education and licensing for doctors and lawyers.
The process improved standards, but at a price. Institutions that trained women and African Americans failed to achieve or quickly lost accreditation, leaving the professional ranks more white, male and elite. In 1912, the American Bar Association expelled three recently admitted members after learning they were black—a “question of keeping pure the Anglo-Saxon race.” When Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a Jewish American, to the Supreme Court in 1916, ABA President Elihu Root, who had served as secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt, andsix of the organization’s former presidents opposed the appointment. They reasoned that he lacked the proper character to serve.
One can see shades of these divisions in our current politics. It’s no less difficult today to sustain a diverse coalition that draws from the ranks of both middle-class professionals and working-class strivers. Their interests are not always aligned.
***
These fractures were on full display during the election of 1912, when two progressive candidates faced off against each other and against the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft. Running as the Democratic nominee was Wilson, whose closest adviser, Brandeis, was an outspoken opponent of trusts who believed that government should “regulate competition instead of monopoly, for our industrial and our civil freedom go hand in hand.” At the head of the breakaway Bull Moose Party, were Theodore Roosevelt and his adviser Herbert Croly, who accepted the enduring reality of economic trusts and championed an equally strong federal government to check their influence.
Americans—then and now—find the 1912 election confusing, as both candidates embraced many of the same policies: the abolition of child labor, new protections for workers and unions, a moderate tariff to boost American manufacturing, closer government regulation of the banking sector. Indeed, what makes progressivism so difficult to fathom is that its adherents were as often opposed as aligned, and even when they were aligned, they worked from a different set of principles.
However much they differed in background and disagreed on policy and principle, though, progressives shared a common faith. They tended to believe that systemic problems could be solved through study, scientific method and modern methods of governance and bureaucracy. Economists, sociologists and social workers flooded government commissions and offices, while “muckraking” journalists drew on the work of nonprofit think tanks to surface data that, they believed, would compel rational voters to action.
Progressives also shared a basic commitment to checking the rise of big business with the counterweight of organized producer and consumer groups.
Finally, progressives tended to view social disorder—as manifested by such urban ills as crime, vagrancy, spousal abandonment, drunkenness and unemployment—as a byproduct of environment rather than poor morals. This view represented a sharp break with earlier thinking that held individuals solely responsible for their lot in life.
In short, if there were no “progressive movement,” in the strict sense of the term, we can identify strains of a progressive persuasion. And progressives were, for a time, wildly successful. They achieved meaningful workplace, health and safety regulations; reformed the political system largely for the good; championed open space and conservation measures; and created a regulatory regime that was at least somewhat more capable of checking the growing concentration of corporate power and wealth.
But they didn’t achieve this with a single, inflexible voting bloc. Being a progressive in the opening years of the 20th century didn’t require strict adherence to a party line or blanket support for a set of specific legislative proposals. Because there was no progressive “movement,” in the singular and definitive meaning of the word, progressivism could draw freely from all sectors of society without demanding even broad consensus on basic questions like the morality of economic concentration or the right of women to vote. It was a malleable and shifting coalition of people who recognized common problems, believed in a rational and fact-based approach to resolving the challenges of modern society and animated public life with an innovative and optimistic spirit.
The same could be said of the New Deal coalition of the 1930s or the conservative coalition of the 1970s and 1980s, both of which drew from diverse wells of support and thought. Living history in real time, it was easy for Franklin D. Roosevelt’s and Ronald Reagan’s acolytes to believe their movements made perfect sense. But in retrospect, both have proved more difficult to describe with precision.
The lesson for today applies to people engaged in politics across the spectrum—from “new” progressives to free-market conservatives and just about everyone in the middle. Political moments that leave a lasting impression are often more complicated and textured than they seem in the moment. They defy easy definition. They’re made up of a common spirit more than by a legislative laundry list. That’s what makes them so compelling."

BEHIND THE SCENES -- “Trump defies close advisers in deciding to threaten Mexico with disruptive tariffs,” by WaPo’s Seung Min Kim, Josh Dawsey and Damian Paletta: “[D]uring a Wednesday night huddle inside the Oval Office, Trump was running into a roadblock: his own advisers. Calling in from his travels in the Middle East, presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner argued against imposing unilateral tariffs, warning that the move could imperil the prospects of ratifying a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, according to officials familiar with the meeting. Kushner, a senior White House adviser, insisted that he could still work directly with Mexico to resolve the burgeoning migration crisis.
“In the Oval Office with Trump, U.S. Trade Representative Robert E. Lighthizer also lobbied against the tariffs, similarly concerned that the drastic threat against the United States’ third-largest trading partner would upend the fragile trade agreement, which still requires Congress’s blessing. But Trump was unmoved by the arguments and repeatedly said Mexico had to do more, one person with knowledge of the meeting said.

“Mr. Trump’s campaign ultimately returned to the original idea of a mammoth ‘Make America Great Again’ rally in Florida, the bellwether on election night in 2016 that made it clear Mr. Trump was heading for a victory over Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and in 2020 a must-win state where his numbers so far are softer than the campaign would like.” NYT

Navy acknowledges request to hide McCain warship - POLITICO,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/navy-mccain-ship-trump-1349478,"The U.S. Navy confirmed Saturday that a “request was made” to “minimize the visibility” of the USS John S. McCain during President Donald Trump’s state visit to Japan.
""A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President's visit,"" Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement.
Story Continued Below
""There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain,” the statement said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday that the White House wanted to move the destroyer — named partly for the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) — “out of sight” ahead of Trump’s trip to Tokyo earlier this month.
Trump tweeted Wednesday that he “was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan,” and told reporters at the White House on Thursday that whoever was responsible for the request was “well-meaning.”
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan denied knowing about the directive prior to the Wall Street Journal’s report, telling members of the media traveling with him Wednesday that “this morning was the first time I’ve heard about it.”
Shanahan on Thursday added that he “never authorized ... any action around the movement or activity regarding that ship” and “would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain.”
“The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense,” Brown said in his statement Saturday. “Our forward-deployed Naval forces continue to stand ready to execute their assigned missions.”"

'Nasty' debate erupts over Trump's criticism of Meghan Markle ahead of U.K. trip - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/trump-meghan-markle-nasty-1349480,"Days ahead of ’s first state visit to the United Kingdom, debate is raging in both the U.S. and Britain over his use of the word “nasty"" in regard to America’s most famous royal: Meghan Markle.
The president, who is prone to creating controversies overseas, used the descriptor during a pretrip Oval Office interview Friday with the British tabloid The Sun, after a reporter brought up comments Markle made three years ago that were critical of then-candidate Trump’s White House run.
Markle, whose royal title is the Duchess of Sussex, is on maternity leave with her 3-week-old son, Archie, and will not join other members of the royal family in meeting with the president.
“She can’t make it because she’s got maternity leave. Are you sorry not to see her? Because she wasn’t so nice about you during the campaign. I don’t know if you saw that,” the Sun reporter asked Trump.
“I didn’t know that, no. I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that, no,” Trump replied.
“She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected. It turned out she moved to Britain,” the Sun reporter continued.
“A lot of people moving here, so what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty,” Trump said.
The Sun also asked the president whether it was “good having an American princess” and whether Markle’s May 2018 marriage to Prince Harry of Wales, now the Duke of Sussex, strengthened ties between the U.S. and the U.K.
“I think it’s nice. I think it’s nice, and I’m sure she will do excellently,” Trump said. “She will be very good. She will be very good. I hope she does.”
Markle accused Trump of being “divisive” and “misogynistic” during a 2016 appearance on Comedy Central’s “The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore.”
Amid a torrent of disapproving social media posts and a flurry of weekend news reports promulgating the president’s “nasty” remark about the 37-year-old duchess, the “Official Trump War Room” Twitter account — which claims to be managed by Trump’s reelection campaign — sought to exercise some damage control.
“Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ‘nasty,’” the account tweeted Saturday morning, along with a 44-second audio clip of the president’s interview with The Sun. “Here is what he actually said. Listen for yourself!”
That message was mocked online as self-defeating and for amplifying the president’s insult, which he has previously used to attack female political rivals.
Human Events, a relaunched outlet run by Breitbart alumni, also suggested Trump was referring to Markle's comments as nasty — and not the duchess herself.
A White House official said Trump did not call Markle nasty and that he was responding to the Sun reporter reading her critiques of the president.
The president on Saturday retweeted Christian Broadcasting Network's David Brody, who called it ""a false story."" On Sunday morning, Trump wrote online : ""I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty.' Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!""
Trump has a history of using the word ""nasty"" to describe women: He called 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “such a nasty woman” at a debate one month before the election. In April, he said 2020 White House hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris had “a little bit of a nasty wit” and described the California Democrat’s questioning of Attorney General William Barr at a congressional hearing last month as “probably very nasty.”
Trump also applied the sobriquet to San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz after she criticized the president's response to Hurricane Maria.
Trump’s assessment of Markle was just one of several diplomatic faux pas by the president in the past week that have done little to bolster the “special relationship” before he journeys across the Atlantic to London on Monday.
In the interview with The Sun, Trump expressed his support for former U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to become Britain’s next prime minister, remarking that the former London mayor is “a very good guy, a very talented person” who “would do a very good job” replacing outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party.
Trump also criticized May, who is set to resign June 7, for her Brexit negotiations with the European Union, remarking that her government allowed the international organization “to have all the cards.""
""And it is very hard to play well when one side has all the advantage,” Trump said.
Trump is scheduled to participate next week in a round of talks with May at 10 Downing Street, as well as attend a state banquet hosted by Queen Elizabeth II. The first time the president came face-to-face with the 93-year-old monarch in July 2018, he was widely rebuked online for walking ahead of her at Windsor Castle as they inspected her honor guard, a breach of royal protocol.
A month later, Trump told attendees at a Pennsylvania rally that the queen kept him waiting for their meeting. However, footage of their encounter broadcast live across Britain showed the queen waiting for the president for 12 minutes and looking at her watch."
Maryland Gov. Hogan won't challenge Trump for Republican nomination,www.politico.com,ALEX ISENSTADT,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/larry-hogan-trump-2020-1349479,"Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will not challenge Donald Trump in a 2020 GOP primary, leaving the president’s Republican critics with few options to prevent his renomination.
Hogan’s decision, first reported Saturday afternoon by The Washington Post, was confirmed by three people close to him.
Story Continued Below
The popular two-term governor had been weighing a challenge to the president and had received encouragement from ""Never Trump"" Republicans, including conservative commentator William Kristol. Hogan, who won reelection in liberal Maryland last year by a landslide, has cast himself as one of the few prominent Republican officeholders willing to speak out against the president.
But those close to the 63-year-old have long acknowledged that a 2020 primary run was unlikely. Trump remains wildly popular with the Republican base, and his reelection team has launched a comprehensive effort to ensure delegates to the 2020 Republican National Convention support him.
In a statement that stressed bipartisanship, Hogan said he was dedicated to serving his terms as Maryland governor and chairman of the National Governors Association. “I believe both of those roles will give me the opportunity to make an impact on the direction of my party and the nation.”
Yet with Hogan's newfound visibility, his team believes he has jump-started preparations for a potential 2024 White House run. The governor is at work on a book and on Saturday announced an outside group called An America United, which “rejects the extremes of both political parties, works to break the partisan gridlock and seeks to bring people together to advance bold, commonsense solutions for all Americans.”
Hogan is set to appear next week on a panel at the E2 Summit in Deer Valley, Utah, an annual retreat hosted by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).
Hogan is not the only Republican starting to lay the groundwork for a run when Trump is out of office. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has launched an outside group of her own and has a memoir coming out later this year.
With Hogan’s decision, Trump’s path to the Republican nomination is virtually unimpeded. Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld announced his candidacy earlier this year, though he has so far gained little traction."
"White House lawyer Emmet Flood to leave post, Trump announces",www.politico.com,CHRISTIAN VASQUEZ,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/trump-lawyer-emmet-flood-leaving-1349481,"The White House's lead lawyer during the Mueller investigation is to leave his post, announced Saturday.
“Emmet Flood, who came to the White House to help me with the Mueller Report, will be leaving service on June 14th. He has done an outstanding job – NO COLLUSION - NO OBSTRUCTION! Case Closed! Emmet is my friend, and I thank him for the GREAT JOB he has done,” Trump tweeted .
Following Mueller’s public statement earlier this week, there was a feeling by Trump and his aides that the Justice Department investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election was officially over, according to several people close to the White House. The investigation, they feel, has now moved to Capitol Hill.
Flood, who was brought on October 2018, called special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference and subsequent obstruction of justice probe a “law school exam paper” in a scathing 5-page letter last month, where he also claimed the special counsel's office did not follow proper regulation.
“This species of public report has no basis in the relevant regulation and no precedent in the history of special/independent counsel investigations,” Flood wrote.
Some Republicans close to Trump had advised the president to tap Flood when White House counsel Don McGahn left.
They thought Flood, who served as George W. Bush’s lead lawyer in responding to congressional investigations, could have helped attract other top-notch lawyers.
But Trump had Flood focus on the Mueller investigation and picked Washington, D.C., lawyer Pat Cipollone to be White House counsel.
Flood’s departure, which was widely expected after the probe ended, will undoubtedly disappoint some who wanted him to stay and help Trump fight a slew of congressional investigations.
Mueller announced his own resignation and the closure of the special counsel's office last week in his first televised address since the investigation concluded."
Harris challenges Axelrod over criticism she's too 'cautious' on trail - POLITICO,www.politico.com,CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/kamala-harris-david-axelrod-2020-campaign-1349600,"SAN FRANCISCO — Sen. Kamala Harris on Saturday pushed back at the emerging narrative that she’s been too timid while campaigning for president, using a POLITICO interview to challenge her naysayers to come watch her field questions on the road.
Harris’ uneven national TV appearances, in particular a pair of CNN town halls, have drawn repeated critiques from former top Obama strategist David Axelrod, now an influential political commentator and podcast host from his perch as director of the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.
Story Continued Below
Last month, after Harris vacillated on several CNN questions — including whether violent felons should be allowed to vote — Axelrod predicted the California senator's lack of directness could backfire.
“She is an incredibly compelling personality; a very bright and accomplished person,” he said in post-town hall analysis that aired on CNN. “But she’s very cautious — and that caution was pretty apparent in a lot of her answers.”
In a Los Angeles Times report Friday, Axelrod credited Harris for her tough questions during Senate hearings, but again pounded away at the impression that she plays it too safe.
“She’s a brilliant person, there’s no doubt about that,” Axelrod told the newspaper. “But what we’ve learned so far is that she’s great at asking questions but timid at answering them. She’s going to have to correct that to navigate this process.”
Asked by POLITICO about Axelrod’s concerns — part of a line of criticism that Harris aides and allies broadly believe is tinged with sexism and not applied in the same way to the men running for president — Harris paused for a few seconds before saying, “I don’t know what to tell you.""
“Axelrod was on the road with Barack a decade ago,” she added. “I’ve invited him to come on the road with me ... (and he’d see) “contrary to what he thinks is happening.”
As for whether the critiques of her are grounded in sexism, Harris said some of those making the charges about her “should do a better job of performing themselves.”
Despite the slip-ups, Harris has been fairly crisp at campaign events — and her supporters contend that when her Democratic rivals have been evasive, they’ve received praise for their ability to parry tough issues. They note that unlike some others — particularly Sen. Bernie Sanders, but also former vice president Joe Biden during the early weeks of his bid — she regularly takes questions from reporters and voters.
And Harris, some argue in a rosier assessment of the candidate, takes the time to consider an issue, unlike President Donald Trump and his shoot-from-the-hip style.
Axelrod pointed out that national media narratives around a candidate are largely shaped by mass media.
“Most folks are not on the road, so how a candidate presents on TV matters,” he wrote after POLITICO tweeted Harris’ response. “I was just commenting on what I see. That said, it is early. @KamalaHarris is certainly in the thick of this race.”
Some allies, though, wished she’d responded differently.
“I would have said, ‘What did he say? I didn’t read it,’” said Willie Brown, the former San Francisco mayor. “‘Axel-who?’”"
Protester grabs Kamala Harris' microphone at San Francisco forum - POLITICO,www.politico.com,CHRISTIAN VASQUEZ,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/01/protestor-grabs-microphone-kamala-harris-moveon-1349553,"SAN FRANCISCO — An animal welfare activist snatched Sen. Kamala Harris' microphone during a Democratic presidential candidates forum on Saturday before being escorted from the stage.
The California senator was discussing implementing her gender pay-gap plan at the MoveOn's Big Ideas Forum when the protester ran onto the stage, took the microphone from her hand and began speaking to the crowd. The protester was blocked by moderator Karine Jean-Pierre before being surrounded by security. Harris, meanwhile, quickly walked off the stage.
Story Continued Below
""We're asking for a much bigger idea than —"" the protester said before the microphone was cut off and he was removed from the stage.
The protester, Aidan Cook of the Direct Action Everywhere animal welfare advocacy group, was asking Harris to ""support ordinary citizens rescuing animals rather than the factory farms that abuse animals, sicken local populations and repress whistleblowing activity,"" according to a news release from the group.
""I live in Oakland and I'm one of Kamala Harris' constituents. I came to the MoveOn Big Ideas Forum today because there's one big idea that all of the 2020 presidential candidates are ignoring. Which is that is by raising and slaughtering billions of animals every year, not only are we completely ... undermining our values as a nation of compassionate animal lovers but we are literally preparing to drive our society off a cliff. Animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change,"" Cook told POLITICO.
""We've done everything we could to try to start this conversation through normal channels: We've reached out to all the campaigns, including Kamala's; we've reached out to MoveOn and pretty much have been completely ignored,"" Cook said when asked whether taking the microphone from Harris' hand could be seen as threatening.
As Cook was being taken off stage, a moderator said, ""Thank you so much, sir, for your big idea, but we want to make sure that we are able to get through this. It's OK, folks, it's OK. People have their own big ideas.""
After the incident, the crowd began to chant ""Kamala"" as the candidate walked back on stage.
""It's all good. It's all good. Don't worry,"" Harris told the crowd, before telling the moderator, ""You had a question I want to answer.""
""We sincerely regret that a protestor was able to gain access to the stage at our forum today & we apologize to Sen. @KamalaHarris. The protestor was removed & the program resumed. MoveOn members were excited to hear Harris continue to discuss her Big Idea to achieve pay equity."" MoveOn wrote on Twitter..
A Harris spokesperson declined to comment.
Cook was not charged and was let go after being escorted outside.
Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, who helped escort Cook offstage, later tweeted that the couple ""are good."""
De Blasio's climate rhetoric on the stump doesn't mirror reality back home,www.politico.com,Danielle Muoio,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/30/de-blasios-climate-rhetoric-on-the-stump-doesnt-mirror-reality-back-home-1032693,"NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio is pointing to his mayoral record on climate change as he tries to gain traction in the Democratic presidential field, but almost six years into his tenure, much of his environmental resume is heavier on rhetoric than actual gains.
De Blasio — known in New York City for being shuttled from his mayoral mansion in an SUV, albeit a hybrid model, to his gym in another part of town — has made a recent habit of making grand pronouncements on his climate accomplishments.
Story Continued Below
“It’s a priority unlike any other because we deal with, obviously, the health care issues, we deal with education, we deal with so many other issues, but nothing compares to survival,” de Blasio said during recent campaign swing through Iowa.
But whether it's building emissions, organic waste collection or even protections in the event of another major storm, the New York City mayor's priorities seem to have been largely elsewhere during his tenure, and his actual accomplishments on climate often fall short of his oratory.
“I think he is talking a lot about the environment because it’s trending and thinks that it will help him with his presidential ambitions,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, a Latino organization in Brooklyn that advocates for sustainability issues. “But just in terms of his record, I feel that he’s moved very slowly. He makes big, sweeping statements and has big, bold, sweeping goals, but the action doesn’t come close to those statements.”
Buildings are by far the biggest source of greenhouse gases in New York City, making up roughly 70 percent of the city’s emissions. De Blasio launched a program in 2015 to get landlords to voluntarily cut emissions. In 2016, he announced — just in time for a U.N. conference on the Paris climate accord — that he would mandate upgrades to buildings to improve their energy efficiency.
It wasn’t until April 2019, though, that a bill actually made it through the City Council.
Days before announcing his candidacy this month, de Blasio held a rally in Trump Tower to put President Donald Trump “on notice,” as the landlord of eight properties that must cut their emissions within 10 years or face fines under the new law. The mayor touted the measure as the city’s version of the “Green New Deal,” borrowing language from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who popularized the term at the federal level.
“I don’t just talk about Green New Deal — we’re implementing it here in New York City. Tough mandates on buildings to make sure there’s less emissions,” the mayor said on a recent swing through South Carolina.
But long-time environmental advocates in New York City say certain caveats in the law could blunt its purpose.
The measure, which city leaders tout as the first of its kind, contains a provison that was never envisioned in past versions: Rather than do the hard and expensive work of updating building systems to be more efficient, the bill allows owners to buy renewable energy credits to offset the use of fossil fuel-based energy — with some of that clean energy anticipated from sources that don’t yet exist. The city currently takes 70 percent of its power from fossil-based generation.
Building upgrades could have created new jobs, training unskilled workers in a growing trade while cutting energy use, but with the offset provision, critics say those jobs will be left on the table. Environmental groups say there’s concern landlords could avoid making energy efficiency improvements — the original intent of the bill — by only purchasing the credits and not upgrading their buildings.
“We have to change the way we address the climate, but at the same time, we’re going to create a lot of good-paying jobs,” de Blasio said during a stop in South Carolina this month.
Eddie Bautista, head of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, has pushed for years to use greenhouse gas reduction as a spur to create new “green jobs” — an espoused priority of the federal Green New Deal.
“If the unlimited renewable energy credit purchases could be the loophole it sounds like, not only are you not creating new jobs, you’re not reducing emissions at the level and scale the crisis demands,” Bautista said.
While building emissions are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the city, there are other climate issues where the mayor has not seemed to sense much urgency.
During his first mayoral campaign, de Blasio ran on the promise of mandating recycling of organic waste — food and yard scraps that are a potent source of methane when left to rot in landfills. That mandate never happened.
In 2015, he declared he would set the city on a course toward “zero waste” where 90 percent of city refuse would be diverted from landfills by 2030. That initiative appears way behind schedule.
Key to achieving zero waste is the expansion of organic waste collection. Food waste and yard detritus accounts for one-third of the city’s waste stream, amounting to an estimated 1 million tons of compostable material being sent to landfills annually.
But de Blasio has repeatedly withheld funding to expand the voluntary collection of organic waste, and the city is years behind its promise to make the program mandatory — the same way recycling glass and plastic is mandatory. De Blasio in April recommitted the city to enacting a mandatory program to collect organic waste, but released few details on how he plans to execute that vision.
In a trip to Iowa this month, he reiterated that pledge.
“We’re going to be doing a lot more with our organics program. We’re going to be going to the City Council for legislation to make it mandatory. That’s coming up this year,” the mayor said when asked by reporters, after touting the virtues of ethanol. “We’re going to be doing a lot more, also, to encourage recycling. A lot of work to do on that front, but I’m very hopeful.”
The current rate of residential recycling in New York is roughly 17 percent. By comparison, San Francisco's rate is about 80 percent, Los Angeles' rate is 76 percent and the national average is about 34 percent.
“I don’t want to be the person that is laying on the mayor because he wants to run for president, but if you look at it objectively, there’s no one in our community who can say he has been a champion or made a significant difference in how we handle trash in the city of New York to achieve the goals that he set forth,” said City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, who chairs the city’s sanitation committee.
It’s not just climate change prevention where de Blasio’s rhetoric runs ahead of his reality. He’s also lagged in protections for climate-related events, such as Hurricane Sandy.
“What folks in Charleston are experiencing, folks in New York have experienced, too. We obviously had Hurricane Sandy — the worst natural disaster in our history,” the mayor said in South Carolina recently. “Dozens of people were lost. Their lives were lost; billions in damage.”
But New York City’s coast remains almost as vulnerable today as it was nearly seven years ago when Sandy struck.
The administration faced pushback from local residents and green groups last September when, to the surprise of local residents, it drastically altered the design for the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project — a delayed initiative that received federal funding back in 2014 from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The project was originally supposed to break ground in 2017. Now, work won’t begin until spring 2020.
Earlier this year, de Blasio unveiled a $10 billion proposal to protect Wall Street by extending the shoreline of Lower Manhattan, while admitting there was no funding for the project to be realized.
The announcement sparked criticism from several Council members, who said if the de Blasio administration is going to unveil an unfunded vision to protect New York, why not include all five boroughs?
“The administration has not put forth or conducted a comprehensive five-borough plan,” said Council Member Mark Treyger, whose district includes Brooklyn's Coney Island. “They’ll keep pointing to their books and brochures that tell you they have these visions, but many of these visions were produced without community input.”
But where policies haven’t fully materialized, de Blasio should get credit for setting bold policy goals that drastically shifted expectations for the city’s environmental landscape, Bautista said.
“His announcement declaring a zero-waste goal for New York City was pretty significant,” Bautista said. “I’m hard-pressed to think of a large city in the United States that made that kind of bold statement in terms of an aspirational goal for the city. … You’re almost inviting disappointment, but that’s not how advocates think of the world.”
And the mayor has some real accomplishments on the environment.
The city banned foam food containers in January following a protracted legal battle against industry leaders. The de Blasio administration is also moving ahead with a waste franchising plan, which would cut emissions from commercial garbage trucks, improve recycling rates and give the city more control over the private waste industry. Proponents of the buildings bill say where it fails to encourage energy efficiency improvements, it will be made up by creating a bigger market for renewable energy.
But a tendency to overpromise and underdeliver on signature initiatives has prevented de Blasio from earning a reputation as an environmental crusader.
“It’s very much a mixed picture,” said Eric Goldstein, New York City environment director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The environment hasn’t been a top-tier issue for the mayor, but nevertheless he has moved the ball forward with the City Council on a number of really big issues.”
A City Hall spokesperson defended the mayor’s environmental record.
“We’ve helped more than 5,000 privately-owned buildings go green and we’re implementing the first-in-the-world buildings mandate that will take inefficient buildings to task,” Raul Contreras said in a statement. “We’ve also implemented enough solar energy to power nearly 50,000 households and put 2,000 electric vehicles on our roads while still reducing our fleet. To top this all off, we’re aggressively implementing our Green New Deal in the face of federal inaction, and this is only the beginning.”
But as de Blasio heralds his environmental initiatives in campaign rallies across the nation, advocates back home note there’s much more to be done on the ground to see them through.
“There have been moments of ambitious goal-setting, but then there’s been missed opportunity and then the question of, ‘What did you actually implement and change post-announcement?’” Bautista said. “Those things are still mixed bags so far.”

Michael Bennet after shooting: McConnell must act,www.politico.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/virginia-beach-shooting-michael-bennet-mcconnell-1349639,"Following a deadly shooting in Virginia Beach, Sen. Michael Bennet renewed calls for national background checks — but expressed doubt Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would allow such legislation to go anywhere in the Senate.
""We should pass those background checks,"" the Colorado Democrat said on ABC‘s “This Week” on Sunday. ""Ninety percent of the American people support it. But we know what's going to happen, which is the House has passed it, Mitch McConnell will not allow it to come to a vote in the Senate, and we will not have national background checks.""
A gunman entered a public government building in Virginia Beach on Friday, killing 12 people ; he was killed during a firefight with police. The shooter was a municipal employee who worked in the building and had purchased the firearms legally, Police Chief James Cervera said on ABC on Sunday. He also used a sound suppressor, which could make the gun shots difficult to hear throughout the building.
Bennet — who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 — mentioned that after the 1999 shootings in Columbine High School, his home state passed legislation to close loopholes that allowed criminals to purchase guns. He added that there were no legal barriers for the gunman in Virginia to acquire the weapons he used.
Bennet urged McConnell (R-Ky.) to advance legislation for national background checks, adding that it's ""impossible"" to argue Colorado is not safer after passing its post-Columbine measures. He also said the president ""can make a difference"" in bringing gun control to the forefront of Congress' agenda.
""My hope is that if McConnell does not take this on the floor, that the people of America and the people of Kentucky will hold him accountable for that and that we can actually put leadership in the Senate and the White House who will do something about this,"" Bennet said.
During his ABC Sunday appearance, Bennet also touched on the 2020 race, saying that he would back any candidate who could beat . When asked if that included Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic socialist, Bennet said ""absolutely."" (Bennet has previously affirmed that the United States would not and should not become a socialist country.)
""The only way we'll lose to Donald Trump is if we disqualify ourselves,"" Bennet said."
Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak,www.politico.com,NATASHA BERTRAND,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/julian-assange-cia-leak-1349425,"The Justice Department has decided not to charge Julian Assange for his role in exposing some of the CIA’s most secret spying tools, according to a U.S. official and two other people familiar with the case.
It’s a move that has surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to aggressively go after the WikiLeaks founder on more controversial Espionage Act charges that some legal experts said would not hold up in court. The decision also means that Assange will not face punishment for publishing one of the CIA’s most potent arsenals of digital code used to hack devices, dubbed Vault 7. The leak — one of the most devastating in CIA history — not only essentially rendered those tools useless for the CIA, it gave foreign spies and rogue hackers access to them.
Story Continued Below
Prosecutors were stymied by several factors.
First, the government is facing a ticking clock in its efforts to extradite Assange to the United States from the United Kingdom, where he is being held. Extradition laws require the U.S. to bring any additional charges against Assange within 60 days of the first indictment, which prosecutors filed in March, accusing Assange of helping former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning hack into military computers.
Second, prosecutors were worried about the sensitivity of the Vault 7 materials, according to an official familiar with the deliberations over whether to charge Assange. Broaching such a classified subject in court risks exposing even more CIA secrets, legal experts said. The CIA has never officially confirmed the authenticity of the leaked documents, even though analysts widely believe them to be authentic.
“There is no question that there are leak cases that can’t be prosecuted against the leaker or the leakee because the information is so sensitive that, for your proof at trial, you would have to confirm it is authentic,” said Mary McCord, who was acting assistant attorney general for national security at the Justice Department until 2017. “So the irony, often, is that the higher the classification of the leaked material, the harder it is to prosecute.”
So instead, the Justice Department will go after Assange on the one count for allegedly assisting Manning and the 17-count Espionage Act indictment. There are no plans to bring any additional indictments prior to his extradition.
While the Manning leak indictment was an expected move, the Espionage Act charges startled the legal community as a potential precedent-setting action. Traditionally, the law has been used to punish government officials who reveal classified information, not the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information. Press freedom activists immediately warned that the case could criminalize everyday journalistic behavior, such as soliciting sensitive information from government sources.
Federal officials insist they have a strong case, arguing that Assange is not a journalist and intentionally published the names of confidential sources in war zones over the objections of national security officials.
“There is a comfort level within the national security establishment of where the charges ended up,” the U.S. national security official told POLITICO.
Still, just several months ago, numerous experts felt confident that prosecutors would also hit Assange with charges over Vault 7. Prominent national security journalist Marcy Wheeler predicted in February that DOJ would “very clearly go after Assange” for the Vault 7 disclosure, and that a sealed indictment against him in the Eastern District of Virginia was likely related to that leak — the CIA is, after all, headquartered in Virginia, as ABC noted . Assange himself reportedly expressed concern that prosecutors would charge him with crimes related to Vault 7.
DOJ has charged one person in the Vault 7 theft. A former CIA employee, Joshua Schulte, was indicted for transmitting the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks. He has pleaded not guilty and his trial is set for November. In April, prosecutors in his case asked the judge to keep the search warrants confidential because disseminating them could “impede ongoing investigations,” prompting more speculation over potential charges against Assange.
“Going after Assange for the Vault 7 leak would seem to involve more serious misconduct and have fewer” press freedom implications, said Carl Tobias, the Williams Professor of Law at the University of Richmond Law School in Virginia. He noted that authorities have mechanisms, like redaction and judge reviews, to protect sensitive information.
But prosecutors have not accused Assange of coaxing Schulte to release the CIA tools, as they allege Assange did with Manning. According to court documents, Assange asked Manning for specific classified documents and advised her on how to hack into a government computer.
Manning is in jail over her refusal to testify before a grand jury in the Assange case. Her lawyers have argued that if the Justice Department does not intend to bring further charges against Assange, the previous need for her testimony should be rendered moot.
“If indeed the government has concluded their investigation, then there is no further need to coerce her compliance with the grand jury, and thus, there can be no legitimate ongoing reason to hold her in contempt,” Moira Meltzer-Cohen, an attorney for Manning, told POLITICO. “If the investigation has ended, then Chelsea must be released.""
WikiLeaks began releasing the Vault 7 documents in April 2017, prompting then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to slam the organization as a “hostile intelligence service.”
The exposed documents describe how the CIA’s secretive Center for Cyber Intelligence developed malware, viruses and weaponized “zero-day” exploits, or flaws in technology like smartphones and internet-connected TVs that are not yet known to the manufacturer.
Legally, the CIA can use these cyber weapons only against foreign targets, not against U.S. citizens. But WikiLeaks said at the time that it was given the documents by a former U.S. government hacker or contractor concerned about “whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers.”
Assange’s release of the Vault 7 tools jeopardized a potential immunity deal that law enforcement officials had been weighing for him in early 2017 in exchange for his testimony about WikiLeaks’ ties to Russian intelligence officers, according to The New York Times."
De Blasio's climate rhetoric on the stump doesn't mirror reality back home,www.politico.com,DANIELLE MUOIO,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/05/29/de-blasios-climate-rhetoric-on-the-stump-doesnt-mirror-reality-back-home-1032693,"NEW YORK — Mayor Bill de Blasio is pointing to his mayoral record on climate change as he tries to gain traction in the Democratic presidential field, but almost six years into his tenure, much of his environmental resume is heavier on rhetoric than actual gains.
De Blasio — known in New York City for being shuttled from his mayoral mansion in an SUV, albeit a hybrid model, to his gym in another part of town — has made a recent habit of making grand pronouncements on his climate accomplishments.
“It’s a priority unlike any other because we deal with, obviously, the health care issues, we deal with education, we deal with so many other issues, but nothing compares to survival,” de Blasio said during recent campaign swing through Iowa.
But whether it's building emissions, organic waste collection or even protections in the event of another major storm, the New York City mayor's priorities seem to have been largely elsewhere during his tenure, and his actual accomplishments on climate often fall short of his oratory.
“I think he is talking a lot about the environment because it’s trending and thinks that it will help him with his presidential ambitions,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UPROSE, a Latino organization in Brooklyn that advocates for sustainability issues. “But just in terms of his record, I feel that he’s moved very slowly. He makes big, sweeping statements and has big, bold, sweeping goals, but the action doesn’t come close to those statements.”
Buildings are by far the biggest source of greenhouse gases in New York City, making up roughly 70 percent of the city’s emissions. De Blasio launched a program in 2015 to get landlords to voluntarily cut emissions. In 2016, he announced — just in time for a U.N. conference on the Paris climate accord — that he would mandate upgrades to buildings to improve their energy efficiency.
It wasn’t until April 2019, though, that a bill actually made it through the City Council.
Days before announcing his candidacy this month, de Blasio held a rally in Trump Tower to put “on notice,” as the landlord of eight properties that must cut their emissions within 10 years or face fines under the new law. The mayor touted the measure as the city’s version of the “Green New Deal,” borrowing language from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who popularized the term at the federal level.
“I don’t just talk about Green New Deal — we’re implementing it here in New York City. Tough mandates on buildings to make sure there’s less emissions,” the mayor said on a recent swing through South Carolina.
But long-time environmental advocates in New York City say certain caveats in the law could blunt its purpose.
The measure, which city leaders tout as the first of its kind, contains a provison that was never envisioned in past versions: Rather than do the hard and expensive work of updating building systems to be more efficient, the bill allows owners to buy renewable energy credits to offset the use of fossil fuel-based energy — with some of that clean energy anticipated from sources that don’t yet exist. The city currently takes 70 percent of its power from fossil-based generation.
Building upgrades could have created new jobs, training unskilled workers in a growing trade while cutting energy use, but with the offset provision, critics say those jobs will be left on the table. Environmental groups say there’s concern landlords could avoid making energy efficiency improvements — the original intent of the bill — by only purchasing the credits and not upgrading their buildings.
“We have to change the way we address the climate, but at the same time, we’re going to create a lot of good-paying jobs,” de Blasio said during a stop in South Carolina this month.
Eddie Bautista, head of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, has pushed for years to use greenhouse gas reduction as a spur to create new “green jobs” — an espoused priority of the federal Green New Deal.
“If the unlimited renewable energy credit purchases could be the loophole it sounds like, not only are you not creating new jobs, you’re not reducing emissions at the level and scale the crisis demands,” Bautista said.
While building emissions are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the city, there are other climate issues where the mayor has not seemed to sense much urgency.
During his first mayoral campaign, de Blasio ran on the promise of mandating recycling of organic waste — food and yard scraps that are a potent source of methane when left to rot in landfills. That mandate never happened.
In 2015, he declared he would set the city on a course toward “zero waste” where 90 percent of city refuse would be diverted from landfills by 2030. That initiative appears way behind schedule.
Key to achieving zero waste is the expansion of organic waste collection. Food waste and yard detritus accounts for one-third of the city’s waste stream, amounting to an estimated 1 million tons of compostable material being sent to landfills annually.
But de Blasio has repeatedly withheld funding to expand the voluntary collection of organic waste, and the city is years behind its promise to make the program mandatory — the same way recycling glass and plastic is mandatory. De Blasio in April recommitted the city to enacting a mandatory program to collect organic waste, but released few details on how he plans to execute that vision.
In a trip to Iowa this month, he reiterated that pledge.
“We’re going to be doing a lot more with our organics program. We’re going to be going to the City Council for legislation to make it mandatory. That’s coming up this year,” the mayor said when asked by reporters, after touting the virtues of ethanol. “We’re going to be doing a lot more, also, to encourage recycling. A lot of work to do on that front, but I’m very hopeful.”
The current rate of residential recycling in New York is roughly 17 percent. By comparison, San Francisco's rate is about 80 percent, Los Angeles' rate is 76 percent and the national average is about 34 percent.
“I don’t want to be the person that is laying on the mayor because he wants to run for president, but if you look at it objectively, there’s no one in our community who can say he has been a champion or made a significant difference in how we handle trash in the city of New York to achieve the goals that he set forth,” said City Council Member Antonio Reynoso, who chairs the city’s sanitation committee.
It’s not just climate change prevention where de Blasio’s rhetoric runs ahead of his reality. He’s also lagged in protections for climate-related events, such as Hurricane Sandy.
“What folks in Charleston are experiencing, folks in New York have experienced, too. We obviously had Hurricane Sandy — the worst natural disaster in our history,” the mayor said in South Carolina recently. “Dozens of people were lost. Their lives were lost; billions in damage.”
But New York City’s coast remains almost as vulnerable today as it was nearly seven years ago when Sandy struck.
The administration faced pushback from local residents and green groups last September when, to the surprise of local residents, it drastically altered the design for the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project — a delayed initiative that received federal funding back in 2014 from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The project was originally supposed to break ground in 2017. Now, work won’t begin until spring 2020.
Earlier this year, de Blasio unveiled a $10 billion proposal to protect Wall Street by extending the shoreline of Lower Manhattan, while admitting there was no funding for the project to be realized.
The announcement sparked criticism from several Council members, who said if the de Blasio administration is going to unveil an unfunded vision to protect New York, why not include all five boroughs?
“The administration has not put forth or conducted a comprehensive five-borough plan,” said Council Member Mark Treyger, whose district includes Brooklyn's Coney Island. “They’ll keep pointing to their books and brochures that tell you they have these visions, but many of these visions were produced without community input.”
But where policies haven’t fully materialized, de Blasio should get credit for setting bold policy goals that drastically shifted expectations for the city’s environmental landscape, Bautista said.
“His announcement declaring a zero-waste goal for New York City was pretty significant,” Bautista said. “I’m hard-pressed to think of a large city in the United States that made that kind of bold statement in terms of an aspirational goal for the city. … You’re almost inviting disappointment, but that’s not how advocates think of the world.”
And the mayor has some real accomplishments on the environment.
The city banned foam food containers in January following a protracted legal battle against industry leaders. The de Blasio administration is also moving ahead with a waste franchising plan, which would cut emissions from commercial garbage trucks, improve recycling rates and give the city more control over the private waste industry. Proponents of the buildings bill say where it fails to encourage energy efficiency improvements, it will be made up by creating a bigger market for renewable energy.
But a tendency to overpromise and underdeliver on signature initiatives has prevented de Blasio from earning a reputation as an environmental crusader.
“It’s very much a mixed picture,” said Eric Goldstein, New York City environment director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. “The environment hasn’t been a top-tier issue for the mayor, but nevertheless he has moved the ball forward with the City Council on a number of really big issues.”
A City Hall spokesperson defended the mayor’s environmental record.
“We’ve helped more than 5,000 privately-owned buildings go green and we’re implementing the first-in-the-world buildings mandate that will take inefficient buildings to task,” Raul Contreras said in a statement. “We’ve also implemented enough solar energy to power nearly 50,000 households and put 2,000 electric vehicles on our roads while still reducing our fleet. To top this all off, we’re aggressively implementing our Green New Deal in the face of federal inaction, and this is only the beginning.”
But as de Blasio heralds his environmental initiatives in campaign rallies across the nation, advocates back home note there’s much more to be done on the ground to see them through.
“There have been moments of ambitious goal-setting, but then there’s been missed opportunity and then the question of, ‘What did you actually implement and change post-announcement?’” Bautista said. “Those things are still mixed bags so far.”

'I'm not a Bernie Bro': Sanders' base splinters in California,www.politico.com,CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/bernie-sanders-moveon-california-1349552,"SAN FRANCISCO — Bernie Sanders put down roots in California during the last presidential race — and he never really left. Now, he is making the delegate-rich, early-voting state, where progressives are ascendant, a central part of his 2020 campaign.
But as the Vermont senator sets up camp, he finds himself in a different and perhaps less favorable environment: Without Hillary Clinton to play off, he's losing momentum to a progressive rival, Elizabeth Warren, and fighting off a popular home-state senator, Kamala Harris.
A crush of events this weekend revolving around the Democratic State Convention — from ballroom speeches to intimate meals to a liberal forum organized by the influential group MoveOn — laid bare the emerging scramble to cut into Sanders’ progressive base.
“Last time, Sanders was able to run as the only progressive against an establishment candidate,” said Doug Herman, a California-based Democratic strategist. “There are multiple options for a progressive candidate at this point — if that’s who you want to elect. And polling is showing that Warren is taking the biggest bite out of Bernie’s base.”
California’s Super Tuesday primary — and the liberal-leaning state’s glut of delegates — has heightened its importance next year. The state convention served as a kind of curtain raiser for the state's millions of voters and gave candidates a chance to chip away at Sanders’ standing in front of plugged-in activists. Public and private polls of the state, which largely mirror national figures at the top, show former Vice President Joe Biden running in the lead, followed by Sanders, Harris and Warren.
Warren, Sanders’ chief rival on the left, made an unmistakable show of force in San Francisco, offering herself as an uncompromising fighter while touting her plans to hike taxes on the richest Americans and zero out mounting student loan debt. A day after headlining a big rally Friday in Oakland, she used the convention to promote her platform of ambitious, structural change: “We will not be a party that nibbles around the edges,” she said to huge applause.
The Massachusetts senator implicitly contrasted her transformational appeals with the stance of Biden, who was absent from the events in California after using the first weeks of his campaign to advocate a return to bipartisanship. “Too many powerful people in our party say, ‘Settle down, back up, nothing to be angry about,'"" Warren said.
“Some say if we all just calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses,” she added to boos. “But our country is in a time of crisis. The time for small ideas is over!”
The early jostling for key liberal constituencies played out at other events as well, such as a union-sponsored breakfast that drew a half-dozen presidential hopefuls vowing to turn back the Trump administration’s rollback of some labor protections, which Harris called an “unapologetic attack” on labor.
In an interview with POLITICO, Harris addressed how she's appealing to California progressives who didn’t support Clinton in 2016 and found themselves drawn to Sanders’ bid that year.
“My message to them is that I intend to earn their vote and I’m not taking anything for granted,” said Harris, who drew large, energetic crowds everywhere she went and had a heavy footprint at the convention. “They’ve been with me, shoulder to shoulder, arms and arm through many fights together, whether it’s fighting the big banks in the U.S. or marriage equality or the Homeowners Bill of Rights. We’ve been in tough fights before — and we’ve won.”
At the labor meeting, Sen. Amy Klobuchar highlighted her family’s union roots; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke spoke of raising the minimum wage and springing working-class immigrants from wage “bondage,” and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg talked about his city’s postindustrial path back to prosperity, acknowledging that he doesn’t resemble the “dictionary definition” of a presidential candidate who has been “marinated in Washington.”
""In these times, Democrats can no more promise to take us back to the 2000s or 1990s than conservatives can take us back to the 1950s,” Buttigieg said. “We can only look forward.""
In the liberal bastion of Oakland, Harris’ hometown, a crowd of more than 6,000 people lined the streets for a half-mile and packed Warren’s rally on a soccer field. In the mix of baby boomers and millennials, many wore T-shirts emblazoned with “Persist” and clutched signs that said, “She Has A Plan.’’ At the end of an hourlong speech, Warren offered to stay as long as necessary so that “everyone gets a selfie.”
John Foster, a party activist from the city, voted for Sanders in 2016 but said he’s searching for a different voice and a different candidate — with the priority being someone who can unseat President Donald Trump.
“I’m not a ‘Bernie Bro,’” he said, adding, “Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden feel a little tired to me.”
Foster said Warren piqued his interest because she appears substantive and ready to offer more details about her plans for change. “I really appreciate her economic justice package and a lot of what I’ve read on her taxation and education proposals,’’ he said.
At the MoveOn forum Saturday, Warren and others made their pitches to the left. Cory Booker talked about his “baby bonds” plan to confront wealth inequality by giving newborns savings accounts and adding money into them every year. But the New Jersey senator also took a hard line on locally based tech giants that he said facilitate the spread of racism: “I’m going to make sure that here out in Silicon Valley, these social media platforms do not become platforms for hate and bigotry,” Booker said.
O’Rourke’s big idea centers on respecting immigrants rather than punishing them with threats of deportation, a position he said should not be embraced anywhere in his party. And he acknowledged that women in the presidential race face unequal — even sexist — treatment in how their campaigns are covered or talked about: “There are advantages in this race that I have that I did not earn,” O’Rourke said.
Asked about Warren’s wealth tax earlier in the day, Harris said her rival was “onto something,” before pivoting to her own tax proposal that would provide $500 monthly rebates to families earning less than $100,000 a year. Harris' plan to pay women equally to men drew a standing ovation at the liberal event while the loudest cheers on the convention floor came amid her calls to impeach Trump.
Sanders, who addresses the full convention Sunday, focused his MoveOn remarks on ideas that have become commonplace in the party, such as ""Medicare for All."" He directed considerable time to stopping “endless wars” and cutting military spending.
Sanders’ aides and allies liken California to the four traditional early-voting states and pledged a vigorous campaign in the state. At a rally Friday in Pasadena, he went out of his way to thank the state’s voters for their “great support” in 2016 in talking about its importance to him in 2020.
Sanders also drew what his campaign said were 3,000 in San Jose and held his first fundraiser Saturday night in San Francisco that brought in several hundred.
Sanders announced on the opening day of the convention that he had made his first hires in California, including Shelli Jackson as state coordinator and Susie Shannon as political director. He also installed regional directors in Los Angeles, San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Inland Empire and Orange County. Campaign manager Faiz Shakir said Sanders would build a “volunteer army” in the state.
But some Democratic strategists privately noted Sanders’ apparent lack of emphasis in the state’s more conservative Central Valley — a potential opening for others to claim voters. O’Rourke and Julián Castro have both traveled to the Central Valley recently, and Buttigieg is scheduled to appear at a town hall in Fresno on Monday.
Dan Gordon, a North Hollywood Democratic strategist who runs the ""Schmolitics"" podcast and served as a delegate for Sanders in 2016, said he remains a “big supporter of his ideas.” Though he may support Sanders again this year, he said, he is still looking at others, including Warren, Buttigieg and Harris, and he wished Sanders wouldn’t run.
“I think he’s divisive, and it’s not entirely his fault,” Gordon said. “There’s still bad blood from people who were Hillary supporters and Bernie supporters. Like most every Democrat, I want to make sure that a Democrat wins in 2020, and I’m a little bit nervous about the divisiveness that comes with Bernie.”
He said, “I think he can do more good as a visionary leader on the outside.”

Rebuilding Paradise: Finding health care after wildfire destruction,www.politico.com,VICTORIA COLLIVER,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/paradise-california-wildfire-health-care-1349430,"PARADISE, Calif. — This Northern California town, decimated by wildfires, is trying to rebuild a health care system in a place that no longer exists for a future that’s impossible to predict.
Paradise is little more than a large charred debris removal site — and it lost its hospital, several clinics, its nursing homes, its doctors in the fire last year. Without health care, Paradise, a remote town 90 miles from Sacramento nestled into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, has no chance of coming back.
Story Continued Below
Recovery may also provide opportunity. Paradise is trying to piece together a new, more flexible health care system, relying on new partnerships and better technology, including telemedicine. If it works, Paradise could become a template for how to deliver health care to rural America, not just those communities hit by disaster, but areas that have seen hospitals close and the numbers of doctors dwindle.
“They have the really unique perspective right now to create something based on need that can grow in the community as it looks toward the future,” said Brock Slabach, senior vice president with the National Rural Health Association.
A $19 billion federal disaster assistance bill, long delayed in Congress because of disputes between President Trump and the Democrats, may finally be approved in the coming week. California stands to get up to $12.6 billion, and some of that money will come here to Paradise, where the Camp Fire, the biggest and most destructive fire in state history, killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes when it struck six months ago.
The new vision for health care here builds on primary care based in the community, with telemedicine access to specialists. Whether the town will have a hospital of its own — or just an emergency facility, at least for the next few years — is an unresolved question.
Adventist Health hasn’t decided whether to rebuild or reopen Paradise’s only hospital, which was severely damaged though it didn’t burn to the ground. Physicians have left because they have no place to practice or live. Patients have fled to makeshift homes with friends or relatives, uncertain whether to return.
The rebuilding task for the city is monumental, and health care has to be at its heart.
“I don’t think there is a similar instance in the United States where a community has been essentially completely destroyed and had to rebuild,” said Richard Thorp, a physician and president of the Paradise Medical Group, which served about 10,000 patients at three clinics in what was once a serene rural community.
Paradise has one of the worst cleanup jobs since 9/11, but signs of recovery are starting to appear. Thorp’s medical group has started seeing patients at its one surviving clinic. On the other side of town, Adventist’s Feather River Health Center, a federally designated rural health clinic that treats Medicaid patients, reopened in late December.
“Every time there’s a ribbon-cutting around here, there’s a little more confidence,” said U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa who was on hand for the clinic’s official re-opening last week. He was the only California Republican to defy Trump and vote for the Democrats’ aid package.
While the federal money stalled, state officials tried to step in. The California Legislature is considering a bill designed to help Paradise reclaim some of its emergency medical services. For instance, while Adventist Feather River, the 101-bed hospital, sustained too much damage to stay open, its ER survived . California law doesn’t allow freestanding emergency departments, so a bill would let Adventist Health operate the ER for up to six years under a consolidated license with another Adventist hospital 50 miles away.
“They’ve just got to have something somewhere,” said the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen, whose district includes parts of the fire area. “Our biggest challenge since the fire has been to inspire confidence in the citizens to rebuild and come back.”
Adventist Health supports the bill but hasn’t made any decisions yet on its future footprint. “We are anxious to provide access as much as we possibly can in a quick time frame, but it’s hard to do that,” said Jill Kinney, the hospital's spokesperson.
Building a hospital is a complex, multiyear process under the best of circumstances, Kinney said. “Right now, some of our challenges are we don’t know where the population is going to end up,” she said. “Are they going to rebuild? Are they coming back? It’s really hard to tell what the community will look like.”
Rigid federal regulations has made it hard for rural communities to rebuild health facilities after disasters, says Slabach. Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) offered a bill that would allow Medicare to reimburse a new kind of rural clinic-hospital hybrid. But it hasn’t gotten traction in Congress.
Paradise’s Feather River hospital didn't qualify as a “critical access” hospital — a designation that offers rural hospitals higher Medicare rates — and won't qualify as one without a legislative fix or waiver, because of its size and proximity to hospitals in Chico and Oroville, respectively 16 and 21 miles away.
And changes in medicine — a new emphasis on primary and community based care, less on acute care hospital settings — means Paradise is rethinking its needs. Slabach, of the rural health association, said post-disaster communities need flexible options. Many of them ""really don’t want or need inpatient capacity because the population no longer supports it,” he said.
But while some people could get to Chico or Oroville with relative ease, it’s harder for elderly residents who lived in Paradise. The topography — on a wide ridge surrounded by deep canyons — makes it even more remote.
In the immediate aftermath of the fire, doctors worked out of Chico's Enloe Medical Center and clinics. With the reopening of the Paradise Medical Group clinic, the practice also unveiled “PMG Connect,” a virtual care platform supported by Teladoc. Blue Shield of California gave the medical group $2 million to help pay for the technology, while covering 90 days of payroll and other expenses.
The technology allows patients to connect virtually with their doctors online and through mobile apps. The group is starting to experiment with home-based care and remote patient monitoring. The hospital’s closure has limited Paradise’s health capacity to primary care, increasing the need to access outside specialists.
If the hospital rebuilds, it will undoubtedly do so with a smaller footprint, one that reflects the overall trend of shifting care to outpatient settings.
Dustin Corcoran , CEO of the California Medical Association, said Paradise’s rebuild from the ground up offers it the opportunity to be the “most technologically advanced, the most forward-facing medical group in the entire state of California.”
The medical group already had a strong technological foothold; a new cloud-based EHR system retained the last three years of patient records, and the group’s quick-thinking technology manager managed to save the hard drives containing earlier patient history from a basement before the clinic burned to the ground.
Problems like recruiting physicians and providing specialty care services ""were always an issue pre-fire,"" Corcoran said. ""Now it's a greater issue. But now they have the technological capacity and that's quite an asset to the community as it rebuilds.""
“As we restore Paradise, the medical group and its services, it probably won’t be the same as it was before,” said Bradford Ogden, 65 and a longtime resident and patient. “It will be different. It might be better.”"
Los Angeles labor official wins Democratic Party chair race,www.politico.com,JEREMY B. WHITE,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/06/02/los-angeles-labor-official-wins-california-democratic-party-chair-race-1036514,"SAN FRANCISCO — California Democrats have selected labor leader Rusty Hicks to lead them into the 2020 election, a contest that came amid critiques of an acrid party culture after former chair Eric Bauman was ousted while facing allegations of sexual harassment.
Hicks prevailed over progressive activist Kimberly Ellis, party official Daraka Larimore-Hall and others to become the party’s next chair. Members lined up for hours to cast ballots, still abuzz from being wooed by a dozen presidential candidates.
Party members were bracing for the possibility that no candidate would reach the 51 percent threshold needed to avert a runoff, with campaigns asking voters not to fly home Sunday ahead of a potential followup vote. But Hicks ultimately secured a comfortable victory.
He will now direct the party’s brimming war chest toward defending sweeping gains in Congress, where California Democrats picked up seven formerly GOP seats in a 2018 route. Meanwhile, Democrats have a supermajority in the state Legislature and hold the keys to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ambitious agenda.
While both Ellis and Hicks professed a liberal agenda and scored endorsements from elected officials, the contest echoed the establishment-versus-incumbent tension seen across the national political landscape. It played out as elected California Democrats face intensified pressure from a base animated by anti-Trump rancor and intent on a sweeping progressive platform.
Much of the state’s formidable organized labor apparatus swung behind Hicks, who as president of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor led the most potent political operations in a state where unions still wield plenty of political clout. He garnered the support of most of California’s statewide elected officials, along with dozens of state legislators and members of Congress.
In making his case to party members, Hicks highlighted his successful political record as evidence that he could protect and build on sweeping gains from the 2018 election. Backers described him as a source of stability who could help guide the party out of a tumultuous stretch.
“I have led my campaign not by promising things but by doing things,” he told delegates, noting that he helped power resounding Democratic success with labor muscle, including rallying support to “take on Trump’s number one enabler, Kevin McCarthy, and his sidekick Devin Nunes.”
Ellis was back for another shot after narrowly losing a bitterly contested 2017 chair’s race that arrayed Bernie Sanders supporters behind her candidacy (she backed Hillary Clinton). She won the endorsements of progressive California luminaries like Reps. Ro Khanna and Barbara Lee, and she emphatically backs liberal goals like banning fracking and enacting single-payer health care.
An African-American woman, Ellis built her campaign around a message of bringing in disaffected and neglected voters — particularly women, people of color and millennials — whom she warned Democrats were at risk of forfeiting if the party did not do a better job of connecting."
Democrats roll out $90M super PAC aimed at swing states,www.politico.com,MARC CAPUTO,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/05/31/democrats-roll-out-90m-super-pac-aimed-at-swing-states-1034856,"The nation’s largest super PAC devoted to grassroots Democratic turnout is launching its organizing efforts earlier than ever in seven swing states with a new campaign director and its largest budget to date: $80 million to $90 million.
For Our Future announced Friday that it’s hiring former President Barack Obama’s onetime Florida campaign chair, Ashley Walker, to coordinate its swing-state operations with the goal of identifying and turning out Democratic-leaning 2020 voters, namely people of color and so-called “sporadic voters” who don’t frequently cast ballots.
The committee, which was started in 2016 and historically has been funded by labor unions and billionaire climate change activist Tom Steyer, plans to build a network of 4,000 paid staff and an army of volunteers in Florida, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin, states where it operated in 2018 and 2017.
“Over the cycles, we’ve gotten smarter and better at what we do,” Walker said. “For Our Future builds state-based capacity to effect change at the electoral and community level. And we run our organization with the same standards as a presidential campaign.”
When it started three years ago, with a budget of $50 million, For Our Future hit the ground six months before the presidential election, only to see Donald Trump clean up in most big swing states. In the 2017 Virginia governor’s race and in other swing states during the 2018 cycle, For Our Future organized earlier, spent more and produced far better results.
This cycle, the group plans to start contacting Democratic primary voters later this year — before the first votes are cast in the party’s 2020 primaries and caucuses.
For Our Future operates in tandem with a “dark money” political nonprofit called For Our Future Action Fund that doesn’t have to disclose donors.
With a mission of having person-to-person interactions with voters, For Our Future differs from most other super PACs, which are devoted to running TV and digital ads to turn out voters. While For Our Future utilizes digital ads and mailers, its mission revolves around on-the-ground staffers and grassroots volunteers meeting voters personally at their homes. The group says it knocked on 10.2 million doors in 2018.
One reason the group was founded was that Republican-aligned groups, specifically those allied to the Koch brothers, were enjoying an asymmetrical advantage in election fundraising and organizing that Democrats were unable to match. As with conservative donors, there was a growing appetite among progressive contributors who wanted more of a say in how their money was spent outside the political party structure.
For large donors, Walker’s bona fides as a member of Obama’s campaign team that twice won Florida — the most recent statewide Democratic campaign to do so, in 2012 — made her the perfect choice to be the swing state campaigns director of For Our Future. In the 2016 and 2018 cycles, Walker led the organization‘s Florida efforts.
“Ashley is a battle-tested leader and I’m thrilled she will be at the helm of FOF’s battleground effort,” said Heather Hargreaves, executive director of Steyer’s longtime organization, NextGen. “For Our Future is one of the most effective and important progressive grassroots organizations in the country, and their work will be integral to the 2020 outcome.”
Of the seven swing states For Our Future is targeting, Trump won five — Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But because of Trump’s large win in Ohio, more than 8 percentage points, Democrats have increasingly viewed the Buckeye State as less winnable.
Trump’s second-largest victory among those swing states was far smaller — 1.2 points in Florida, a state that Trump’s 2020 campaign views as critical to his reelection chances. In the other Rust Belt states, Trump won by less than a percentage point.

Ocasio-Cortez joins Bronx town hall to push for rent law overhaul in Albany,www.politico.com,JANAKI CHADHA,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/05/30/ocasio-cortez-joins-bronx-town-hall-to-push-for-rent-overhaul-in-albany-1034854,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , whose upset election last year helped spur a reshuffling of Albany politics, returned to the Bronx Thursday night calling for an end to real estate industry influence in New York politics — a theme of her insurgent campaign and one that could soon bring significant change for tenants in New York City and beyond.
“It’s no secret that big real estate has an enormous financial grip over elections in New York state and federally,” she said during a town hall with a coalition of tenant groups pushing a nine-bill package to overhaul New York’s rent laws.
Ocasio-Cortez said city, state and federal housing policies come ""together to make a picture that all too often enriches people who are already powerful and impoverishes people who are already vulnerable.”
The crowd of more than 100 were intent on passing the nine bills currently being debated in Albany carrying signs and chanting slogans directed at New York's legislative leaders. Ocasio-Cortez didn’t go into detail on the bills tenant activists are currently pushing, but when asked if she supports “universal rent control” in New York state — as the package as been termed — she said yes.
State lawmakers including State Sens. Alessandra Biaggi and Jamaal Bailey and Assemblywoman Nathalia Fernandez, were pressed by attendees on the level of support for the nine-bill package in both chambers, and how legislative leaders plan to move negotiations forward.
Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie put out a joint statement on Thursday vowing to pass a strong package of tenant protection bills this session and committing to the ""principles"" of the legislation sought by tenant groups. But they left themselves some wiggle room for negotiations to get the package over the line before the rent laws sunset on June 15.
Housing activists said their statement fell short. They have called for the Legislature to leave Gov. Andrew Cuomo out of rent law negotiations and for both houses to come out in clear support of all nine bills.
One statewide measure that activists worry would go on the chopping block is the ""Good Cause"" bill, which would prohibit landlords from evicting tenants without sufficient cause. Housing groups are also calling for programs that allow landlords to raise rents for building and apartment improvements to be fully eliminated, rather than simply modified.
Bailey, Biaggi and Fernandez said they are pushing the entire package in their conferences, but indicated some of the measures need to gain more support before the conferences can come out and support them. They also emphasized the importance of keeping the door open for negotiations.
Biaggi was asked about a NY1 report that said only three of the bills out of the nine-measure package have enough support from Senate Democrats to pass.
“I have not heard that rumor — I’m also inside that room, that’s not something that has come up,” she said. “But I will say that not everyone is going to agree on every single thing, that’s just the reality.”
Ocasio-Cortez implied the story was leaked to weaken support for the package.
“I’m obviously not in the state Senate and I’m not in those rooms,” she said. “But I do know that this is a tactic that’s often used in D.C., where someone will leak a story to demoralize the organizers.”
On housing reforms at the federal level, Ocasio-Cortez said she is advocating for more funding for the New York City Housing Authority and Section 8 vouchers.
She said the city and state’s “hands are tied” when it comes to NYCHA, and that they can’t make up for the lack of federal funding for the housing authority. She also slammed the recent Trump administration decision to bar families from public housing if any member is undocumented, as well as other policies that allow public housing tenants to be evicted for low-level drug offenses."
POLITICO Magazine: Kirsten Gillibrand’s failure to launch,www.politico.com,TIM ALBERTA,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/31/politico-magazine-kirsten-gillibrands-failure-to-launch-1035028,"HAMPTON, New Hampshire — Kirsten Gillibrand is only asking for a dollar.
It’s not that she couldn’t use more money. In the first quarter of 2019, the junior senator from New York raised just $3 million for her presidential campaign, the weakest haul of the six senators running at that time and arguably one of the most disappointing totals of anyone in the sprawling Democratic field. Given her anemic polling since entering the race, Gillibrand’s feeble fundraising performance fanned skepticism about her viability to earn a nomination that Democrats believe will require close to $100 million in hard money raised.
But at this point, Gillibrand isn’t focused on winning the primary. She’s worried about surviving the next few months.
Despite a soaring national profile in the U.S. Senate, Gillibrand has failed to achieve liftoff as a presidential prospect. She has not broken 2 percent in a single national poll since officially declaring her candidacy in mid-March, and her 0.4 percent average in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of surveys places her behind the likes of Julián Castro, Tulsi Gabbard and even geeky long shot Andrew Yang.
Her bigger problem is fundraising. To secure a spot in the first double-header of Democratic primary debates in late June, candidates must meet two thresholds: surpassing 1 percent in three recognized national polls and collecting 65,000 unique campaign contributions. Gillibrand has checked the first box, however unimpressively. Yet the second mission remains unaccomplished. With the debates closing in — and with even quixotic candidates such as self-help guru Marianne Williamson hitting the 65,000-donor mark — Gillibrand is under the gun. The Democratic National Committee is limiting the total number of participants to 20. She could (and likely will) qualify by meeting the polling threshold only. But given the late gusher of contenders entering the fray, her place on stage can be guaranteed only by growing her donor ranks — and quickly.
Which brings Gillibrand to the climax of her stump speech. It’s the second weekend of May, she’s addressing a standing room-only crowd at a micro-pub four miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and the senator has finally hit her stride. Whether it’s the booze flowing from the taps or some other environmental factor — OK, it’s the booze — this has been Gillibrand’s best event of the day. Her talking points are sharp. Her jokes are well executed. Her audience is energized and engaged. Candidates typically fade late in a long day on the campaign trail, but Gillibrand has gotten stronger. The voters are hanging on her every word — about reforming the EPA, battling the NRA, encouraging national service programs and confronting Russian aggression. Finally, Gillibrand decides, it’s time to make the ask.
“For anyone here, if you like what you’ve heard tonight, I want to earn my place on the debate stage. I can’t do it unless you send a dollar — literally, really ,” Gillibrand says, shaking her head as though to acknowledge the oddity of this request. “The measure is for anyone who wants to be on the debate stage, you need to get 65,000 individual supporters. So please go to KirstenGillibrand.com and just send a dollar. It will help me get to the debate stage.”
Gillibrand isn’t the only 2020 hopeful who has resorted to this method. Tim Ryan’s website features pop-up advertisements asking for $1. And Michael Bennet’s spots on social media make an identical solicitation.
But that’s Tim Ryan and Michael Bennet — an obscure congressman and low-profile senator, respectively. Ryan’s chief claim to relevance is being slaughtered by Nancy Pelosi as the sacrificial lamb who challenged her in the speaker’s race on behalf of disgruntled House Democrats after the 2016 election. Bennet has done little to distinguish himself as a senator and won his Colorado seat in 2010 only because the GOP snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, nominating a self-destructive Tea Party candidate whom Bennet managed to defeat by some 30,000 votes.
Gillibrand plays in a different league — or at least, she was supposed to.
***
A Dartmouth-educated lawyer who worked in corporate law before clerking on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Gillibrand gained national attention upon entering the political arena for possessing a rare combination of big brains, telegenic looks and personal magnetism. Her storming of a conservative upstate New York congressional district in 2006 announced her arrival as a player in Washington, and it was little surprise when, a few years later, after Hillary Clinton’s appointment as secretary of state, Gillibrand was tapped to replace her in the Senate. After winning her own full term in 2012— racking up the largest statewide victory in the history of New York politics— Gillibrand set about overhauling her political brand.
It wouldn’t be easy to shed the image responsible for her House victories — that of a down-home, gun-friendly, anti-amnesty, culturally conservative Democrat who identified with her rural constituents more than with the party’s coastal elite. But slowly, methodically, Gillibrand did just that, smartly picking and choosing fights that would burnish her populist progressive bona fides while elevating her national stature. She co-directed the effort that banned insider trading among members of Congress. She was an integral part of the campaign to repeal the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy that governed gays in the military. She introduced pioneering legislation aimed at ensuring paid family leave. And she became Washington’s leading voice on sexual assault, first by focusing on cases in the military and then broadening to harness the energy generated by the #MeToo movement.
All the while, she raised tens of millions of dollars, wrote a New York Times bestseller and was named one of Time ’s 100 most influential people in the world.
As it became clear that Gillibrand was preparing to launch a campaign for the presidency in 2020, the only question seemed to be the height of the senator’s ceiling. Could she win the Democratic nomination? And if so, could she succeed where her friend and former mentor, Hillary Clinton, failed four years earlier?
Today, the question is whether Gillibrand can get off the floor.

Pelosi calls Facebook a ‘willing enabler’ of Russian election meddling,www.politico.com,CRISTIANO LIMA,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/05/29/pelosi-calls-facebook-a-willing-enabler-of-russian-election-meddling-1033590,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday blasted Facebook over its decision to keep up videos doctored to falsely depict her slurring her words, calling it proof that the social network isn't taking disinformation campaigns seriously.
During an interview with San Francisco radio station KQED , the Democratic leader responded for the first time to the company's decision to leave up the flurry of videos that had been slowed to make her appear inebriated.
""We have said all along, poor Facebook, they were unwittingly exploited by the Russians. I think wittingly, because right now they are putting up something that they know is false. I think it's wrong,"" she said. ""I can take it. ... But [Facebook is] lying to the public.""
She added: ""I think they have proven — by not taking down something they know is false — that they were willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election.""
A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on Pelosi's remarks.
The company said Friday it would not take down the videos, some of which have garnered millions of views, because its rules don’t prevent users from posting false information.
That justification quickly drew scorn from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who have long criticized the company for not doing enough to curb misinformation on its platform. House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) on Sunday called the manipulated videos a “sad omen of what is to come in the 2020 election season.”
The dust-up adds to a growing list of political headaches for Facebook in Washington and around the world. The company has said it expects a historic, multi-billion dollar fine from the Federal Trade Commission, and lawmakers are contemplating new privacy rules that would restrict how it collects user data.
In Canada, a parliamentary committee this week issued an open-ended summons for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and threatened to hold them in contempt if they don't appear to answer questions if they set foot in the country. And leaders from France to New Zealand are calling for the social network to be more accountable for terrorism-related content and other material that flows through its platform.
Facebook's treatment of the Pelosi video threatens to turn one of the most powerful members of Congress, who represents Facebook's home state of California, against the company.
Just last week, Pelosi was presented with a lifetime achievement award by the Internet Association, an industry lobbying group that counts Facebook as one of its members."
Schiff says Mueller has 1 more duty left - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/adam-schiff-robert-mueller-testimony-1349640,"House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said special counsel Robert Mueller isn't done serving his country and should testify before Congress about his investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election.
""I was disappointed ... to see such a profound reluctance to testify,"" The Democrat from California said on ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday. ""I think he has one last service to perform. It's not enough merely to speak for 10 minutes and say, 'I'm not going to answer questions for Congress and the American people.' There are a great many things that are not in the report.""
Story Continued Below
Mueller delivered remarks Wednesday as he closed up shop as special counsel and said that he did not intend to testify before Congress. Mueller characterized his report as his testimony, emphasizing that it did not clear President Donald Trump of misdeeds or criminal acts such as obstruction of justice.
""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller said at the news conference.
That has not satisfied House Democrats, who continue to probe into a litany of the president's affairs, from his actions during the 2016 presidential campaign to his personal finances.
Schiff said he wants to ask Mueller whether Russia has collateral on Trump, keeping him in its influence, and about a number of other topics that were not in the report. If Mueller does not willingly testify, Schiff said he would recommend issuing Mueller a subpoena.
Though pressing for more information, Schiff did not say that impeaching Trump was an immediate priority. The congressman continued to toe House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's line of focusing on the party's legislative agenda rather than impeachment now that Democrats have a majority in the House.
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a vocal Trump ally, retorted on ABC that Mueller had had ample time to establish whether Trump had obstructed justice. Still, Jordan said he had questions for Mueller and did not oppose having him testify.
""Bob Mueller had 22 months, $30 million, 19 lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas. If he could have accomplished obstruction, he would have done it,"" Jordan said."
Mulvaney: Trump 'deadly serious' about Mexico tariffs,www.politico.com,KELSEY TAMBORRINO,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/mulvaney-trump-deadly-serious-about-tariffs-1349665," is ""deadly serious"" about his threat to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico over his concerns of illegal immigration, Mick Mulvaney, the acting staff, said Sunday.
""He is absolutely, deadly serious,"" Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday. ""I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10.""
Trump last week tweeted the United States would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico ""until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP.""
Mulvaney doubled-down on that timeline Sunday, explaining that the White House ""for months"" has been talking about an ""emergency situation"" at the U.S.-Mexico border.
""The president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border,"" Mulvaney said.
The president tweeted last week the tariff would ""gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied."" The White House later clarified the tariff would increase to 10 percent on July 1; 15 percent on Aug. 1; 20 percent on Sept. 1; and 25 percent on Oct. 1.
""The reason we're doing things people don't expect is that we're facing things at the border we never experienced before,"" Mulvaney said on NBC. ""We're using extraordinary tools because there is extraordinary circumstances that dictate those.""
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan also defended the use of tariffs to deter illegal immigration on Sunday, appearing on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
""I think what the president said, what the White House has made clear is we need a vast reduction in the numbers crossing,"" McAleenan said.
He listed various benchmarks where the U.S and Mexico can work together to decrease the flow of illegal immigration, including ""going after"" those transporting migrants and profiting, and ""partnering and coordinating on asylum and how we treat people that actually need protections coming from Central America.""
McAleenan also called movements into the U.S. from Mexico ""overt"" on Sunday and said the U.S. needs Mexico to do more to counter the flow.
""These crossings into Mexico are happening on a 150-mile stretch of their southern border,"" he said. ""This is a controllable area. We need them to put their authorities down there and interdict these folks before they make this route all the way to the U.S.""
Mulvaney also elaborated Sunday on what else the Mexican government can do to secure the border, including cracking down on the flow of migrants from other countries in Central America, and on domestic terror organizations.
""That border along the southern Mexico needs to be secured,"" he said. ""It is much easier to secure that border than it is our border because it is so much shorter. It is about quarter of the length.""
Mexico’s border with the United States is approximately 1,950 miles in length. It has two southern borders, with Belize and Guatemala, that add up to about 700 miles."
China says U.S. ‘solely to blame’ for collapse of trade talks,www.politico.com,ANITA KUMAR,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/china-trade-talks-trump-1349666,"This story is being published as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post. It originally appeared on scmp.com on June 2, 2019.
China has laid the blame squarely on the United States for the breakdown of trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies, but hinted at its willingness to resume stalled negotiations with Washington while rejecting any attempt to force concessions from Beijing.
Story Continued Below
In a white paper on China’s official position on the trade talks released by the State Council Information Office on Sunday, Beijing made it clear the U.S. government “should bear the sole and entire responsibility” for the current stalemate, and hit back at allegations that Beijing had backtracked from its earlier promises.
On the specific allegation that China significantly changed the text under negotiation after the latest round of talks, the white paper said it was “common practice” to make new proposals and adjustments as the talks progressed, something the U.S. had done consistently.
“The more the U.S. government is offered, the more it wants,” the document said.
At a press conference in Beijing on Sunday, Wang Shouwen, China’s vice-minister for commerce, accused the U.S. of being “irresponsible” in accusing Beijing of backtracking on its promises.
“Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,” he said in English, the only time he strayed from his native tongue.
Meanwhile, the white paper said that Beijing remained “committed to credible consultations based on equality and mutual benefit”, but would “not give ground on matters of principle”.
When asked what the U.S. side needed to do for the negotiations to continue, Wang referred to a preliminary agreement made by Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump in Argentina in December.
“The consensus then was to not raise tariffs, and work towards canceling them,” he said.
Despite the presidents’ efforts, Beijing’s white paper came just a day after it introduced new tariffs on goods imported from the United States.
In a separate allegation, Sunday’s document accused the U.S. of insisting on “mandatory requirements concerning China’s sovereign affairs.”
Though it did not elaborate, the Post reported earlier that Washington had asked Beijing to “completely open its internet” as part of the trade deal. And at a seminar in Beijing on Friday, a group of former Chinese officials accused the U.S. of using the trade talks to undermine China’s national security on issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea. They also did not elaborate.
Beijing has been increasingly critical of Washington in recent weeks over the breakdown of the trade talks and its treatment of Chinese technology giant Huawei.
On Friday it said it planned to publish a list of “unreliable” foreign entities deemed to have damaged the interests of Chinese firms, based on anti-monopoly and national security grounds.A day later, Beijing announced an investigation into US logistics company FedEx for the “wrongful delivery of packages,” after Huawei accused FedEx of re-routing of its packages from China to the US.
Speaking about the case, Wang said that any foreign company suspected of breaking the law was subject to investigation.
At the same time, the lawful rights of foreign firms operating in China would always be protected, he said.
When asked about U.S. firms’ complaints that customs clearance was taking longer since the start of the trade war, he advised companies to contact the relevant authorities.
“If certain firms are faced with specific issues, they can talk to local commerce departments,” he said.
On the matter of exports of rare earth minerals, Wang repeated Beijing’s comments of the past week.
“With the world’s richest rare earth resources we are willing to satisfy the normal needs of other countries,” he said. “But it’s unacceptable if other countries use rare earths imported from China to suppress China’s development.”
On the possibility of a summit between Xi and Trump on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, later this month — as suggested by the American president in May — Wang said he had no information on the matter.
Shi Yinhong, an adviser to China’s State Council and a specialist in U.S. affairs at Renmin University in Beijing, said that despite the pressure from the US, Beijing had shown restraint in its efforts to fight back.
“In the areas of trade and technology, China has less leverage than the U.S., but it has kept its retaliatory measures within these areas,” he said. “If it extended its efforts to areas like North Korea and Iran, it could do much greater damage to Trump.”
On the chances of the two sides achieving a breakthrough in their trade negotiations by the time of the G-20 summit, Shi said: “The difference is too wide and would be impossible for them to bridge in a month.”
The Trump White House and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not respond to questions."

Michael Bennet renewed calls for national background checks — but expressed doubt Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would allow such legislation to go anywhere in the Senate.
“‘We should pass those background checks,’ the Colorado Democrat said on ABC‘s ‘This Week’ on Sunday. ‘Ninety percent of the American people support it. But we know what’s going to happen, which is the House has passed it, Mitch McConnell will not allow it to come to a vote in the Senate, and we will not have national background checks.’” POLITICO
-- CORY BOOKER to JAKE TAPPER on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: “Enough is enough. We can do so much more.”
Good Sunday morning. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP will be Europe all week departing tonight and returning Friday.
IT’S A FAMILY AFFAIR … THE DAILY MAIL’S EMILY GOODIN and DAVID MARTOSKO: “Trump’s children are getting TWO dinners with the British royal family: Ivanka, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany are all expected at Queen’s state banquet and dinner for Prince Charles held by U.S. ambassador to London”
WHAT’S ON THE PRESIDENT’S MIND THIS A.M. -- @realDonaldTrump at 8:30 a.m.: “NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, NO NOTHING! ‘What the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.’ David Rivkin, Constitutional Scholar. Meantime, the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress. They are frozen stiff. Get back to work, much to do!” …
… at 8:44 a.m.: “I never called Meghan Markle ‘nasty.’ Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!”
-- FACT-CHECK -- FROM TRUMP’S INTERVIEW IN THE SUN: “LA-born Meghan, 37, accused him of being ‘misogynistic’ and ‘divisive’ during his 2016 presidential campaign. The ex-Suits actress also pledged to vote for his rival Hillary Clinton. Told of Meghan’s barbs by The Sun, Mr. Trump insisted it was the first time he’d heard them. He said: ‘I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.’” The Sun
THE LATEST ON IRAN -- AP: “Pompeo says U.S. ready to talk to Iran with ‘no preconditions’,” by Matthew Lee in Bellinzona, Switzerland: “Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that the Trump administration is ready for unconditional discussions with Iran in an effort to ease rising tensions that have sparked fears of conflict. But the United States will not relent in trying to pressure the Islamic Republic to change its behavior in the Middle East, America’s top diplomat said.
“Pompeo repeated long-standing U.S. accusations that Iran is bent on destabilizing the region, but he also held out the possibility of talks as President Donald Trump has suggested. ‘We’re prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions,’ Pompeo told reporters at a news conference with his Swiss counterpart. ‘We’re ready to sit down with them, but the American effort to fundamentally reverse the malign activity of this Islamic Republic, this revolutionary force, is going to continue.’” AP
MORE SUNDAY BEST -- CHRIS WALLACE spoke with acting White House chief of staff MICK MULVANEY on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY”: MULVANEY on Trump’s relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un: “[H]aving a relationship with a person – and you heard the president’s language and for those of us who know the president, and we do, that’s – that’s his manner, that’s how he speaks. And to have a good working relationship with somebody, with anybody, how is that ever a bad thing? How is having the ability to pick up the phone or write a letter, as the president referenced, and talk to another world leader, regardless of what they might be doing domestically or internationally, how is that a bad thing?”
-- CHUCK TODD also spoke with MULVANEY on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS”: TODD: “Does [the president] accept the fact that Russia interfered to benefit him?” MULVANEY: “Keep in mind what --” TODD: “Which is what Robert Mueller found.” MULVANEY: “What happened – the answer to the short question is yes, Russia did attempt to interfere in our election. There is no question. Let’s not lose sight of the fact that it was the previous administration that let that happen.”
ON MUELLER ... JAKE TAPPER spoke with CORY BOOKER on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: TAPPER: “After special counsel Robert Mueller spoke this week, you came out. You tweeted that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings immediately against President Trump. I’m a little confused, because Mueller didn’t really say anything on Wednesday that he hadn’t written in his report. What made you change your thinking?”
BOOKER: “Well, it was a few weeks of seeing a president who wants to undermine congressional -- excuse me -- constitutional intent, and say that he’s above the law. … This president is not above the law. He should not be able to stop the checks and balances on the executive. And I feel like we have a moral obligation now to investigate this president. Impeachment proceedings will give us more legal leverage to be able to get the information Congress needs to get to the bottom of what his administration has done while they're in office.”
-- GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS interviewed House Intel Chairman ADAM SCHIFF on ABC NEWS’ “THIS WEEK”, via Matthew Choi: “‘I was disappointed ... to see such a profound reluctance to testify,’ Schiff said. … ‘I think he has one last service to perform.

TRUMP’S TRADE WARS -- “Mexican president hints at migration concessions to defuse U.S. trade spat,” by Reuters’ Dave Graham in Mexico City: “In a news conference in the Gulf of Mexico port of Veracruz, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico could be ready to step up measures to contain a recent surge in migration in order to reach a deal with the United States.
“A major Mexican delegation led by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard will discuss the dispute with U.S. officials in Washington on Wednesday, and Lopez Obrador said he expected ‘good results’ from the talks, and for a deal to emerge. ‘The main thing is to inform about what we’re already doing on the migration issue, and if it’s necessary to reinforce these measures without violating human rights, we could be prepared to reach that deal,’ Lopez Obrador said.” Reuters
-- JAKE TAPPER spoke with acting Homeland Security Secretary KEVIN MCALEENAN on CNN’S “STATE OF THE UNION”: TAPPER: “I’m not disputing the idea that Mexico and the Mexican government need to do more. Obviously, they could be doing more, if there are hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Central America through Mexico into the United States. But tariffs will make Mexico and Mexicans struggle, and then more people will cross the border. That’s -- that’s the question. Won’t this make your job tougher?”
MCALEENAN: “So, the bottom line for me is, we need them at the table looking at new strategies that we can aggressively move out on. Operationally, we have had great partnerships in Mexico in the past, but 1,000 people a day, when we’re apprehending 4,500 a day, is not making an impact. We need more.”
-- MICK MULVANEY to CHRIS WALLACE on “FOX NEWS SUNDAY”: “[The president] is absolutely, deadly serious. I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10th. The president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border.”
THE LATEST ON CHINA -- “China and U.S. clash again on trade and regional security,” by Reuters’ Lee Chyen Yee in Singapore: “China and the United States clashed again this weekend on trade and security, accusing each other of destabilizing the region and potentially the world. Speaking on Sunday at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia’s premier defense summit, China’s Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea.” Reuters
-- BUT, BUT, BUT -- “China says U.S. ‘solely to blame’ for collapse of trade talks,” by South China Morning Post’s Jun Mai: “China has laid the blame squarely on the United States for the breakdown of trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies, but hinted at its willingness to resume stalled negotiations with Washington while rejecting any attempt to force concessions from Beijing.
“In a white paper on China’s official position on the trade talks released by the State Council Information Office on Sunday, Beijing made it clear the U.S. government ‘should bear the sole and entire responsibility’ for the current stalemate, and hit back at allegations that Beijing had backtracked from its earlier promises.
“On the specific allegation that China significantly changed the text under negotiation after the latest round of talks, the white paper said it was ‘common practice’ to make new proposals and adjustments as the talks progressed, something the U.S. had done consistently.” POLITICO
ON THE WORLD STAGE -- “Trump Calls on Britain to ‘Walk Away’ if E.U. Does Not Concede to Its Demands,” by NYT’s Katie Rogers: “Just before his state visit to Britain was to begin, President Trump subverted diplomatic norms by rattling an already precarious political situation there: He suggested that the next prime minister of Britain ‘walk away’ from trying to reach a deal to withdraw from the European Union and that the far-right populist Nigel Farage be sent in to negotiate.
“In an interview with The Sunday Times, of London, Mr. Trump also said he had told the current prime minister, Theresa May, who announced last month that she would step down after repeatedly failing to get her Brexit plan through Parliament, to sue the bloc for greater leverage in talks. Mrs. May left her government in a weaker position, he said, for not threatening to walk away ‘in the form of litigation or in the form of a request.’” NYT
UPDATE -- “Military Reviews Handling of White House Request to Obscure USS John McCain,” by WSJ’s Gordon Lubold and Rebecca Ballhaus: “The U.S. military is reviewing the handling of a White House request to move ‘out of sight’ the USS John S. McCain during President Trump’s trip to Japan last week and doesn’t yet have a clear picture of what happened, U.S. officials said Saturday.
“Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan told reporters Friday in Singapore he would look into the matter, as he faces questions about whether he was aware of the White House request. Mr. Shanahan has said he learned about it from news reports, but a U.S. official has said Mr. Shanahan was aware of concerns about the warship’s presence and approved measures to avoid what officials believed might be a disruption. ...
“‘The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense,’ Rear Adm. Charlie Brown said in a statement. He acknowledged a request was made by the White House to the Navy to ‘minimize the visibility’ of the McCain, named after the late Sen. John McCain, his father and his grandfather.” WSJ
-- MICK MULVANEY to CHUCK TODD on NBC NEWS’ “MEET THE PRESS” on the request: “I absolutely believe it was probably somebody on the advance team. … The fact that some 23 or 24-year-old person on the advance team went to that sight and said ‘Oh my goodness, there’s the John McCain’ we all know how the president feels about the former senator, maybe that’s not the best backdrop, can somebody look into moving it? That’s not an unreasonable thing to ask.”

BEHIND THE SCENES -- “Insurgent Democrats, Many of Them Women, Worry a New Party Policy Will Block Them,” by NYT’s Jennifer Steinhauer: “A move by House Democratic leaders to thwart party members from mounting primary challenges to incumbents, even in safe Democratic districts, could have the unintended consequence of arresting the party’s shift toward a more female and racially diverse caucus, one of its most striking achievements of the last election.
“This past week, a Democratic political consultant with longstanding ties to the party’s campaign committees quit a senior-partner position at the firm Deliver Strategies after it, like most dominant campaign outfits, agreed to comply with a [DCCC] policy barring it from conducting business with a primary opponent of a sitting Democrat.
“Her reason: She feared the policy’s impact on female challengers. ‘It is hard enough for challengers, for a lot of reasons,’ said the consultant, Amy Pritchard, who worked last year for Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, in her successful campaign to defeat a 10-term Democratic incumbent. ‘And this policy is a bridge too far. I’d like to see a majority of women in Congress, and it’s not going to happen with this policy.’” NYT

NATASHA BERTRAND: “Assange won’t face charges over role in devastating CIA leak”: “The Justice Department has decided not to charge Julian Assange for his role in exposing some of the CIA’s most secret spying tools, according to a U.S. official and two other people familiar with the case. It’s a move that has surprised national security experts and some former officials, given prosecutors’ recent decision to aggressively go after the WikiLeaks founder on more controversial Espionage Act charges that some legal experts said would not hold up in court.
“The decision also means that Assange will not face punishment for publishing one of the CIA’s most potent arsenal digital code used to hack devices, dubbed Vault 7. The leak — one of the most devastating in CIA history — not only essentially rendered those tools useless for the CIA, it gave foreign spies and rogue hackers access to them.” POLITICO

A year before the plane was finished, Boeing made the system more aggressive and riskier.
“While the original version relied on data from at least two types of sensors, the final version used just one, leaving the system without a critical safeguard. … [M]any people involved in building, testing and approving the system, known as MCAS, said they hadn’t fully understood the changes. … Boeing declined to say whether the changes had prompted a new internal safety analysis.” NYT

Pompeo offers to talk to Iran with ‘no pre-conditions’,www.politico.com,NAHAL TOOSI,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/pompeo-iran-trump-negotiations-1349845,"President Donald Trump’s desire to avoid a war with Iran appears to be prevailing in his own administration — for now.
On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was willing to talk to Iran’s Islamist leaders without preconditions, even as the U.S. deploys hundreds more troops to the region amid rising tensions.
“We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no preconditions, we are ready to sit down,” Pompeo said.
While Pompeo added that the U.S. still wanted Iran to behave like a “normal nation,” his overall remarks appeared to be a climb-down from the past, including his insistence that Tehran meet 12 far-reaching conditions as part of any deal. Pompeo is known for his closeness to Trump and a willingness to adjust his own messaging to fall in line with the president’s thinking.
His announcement followed reports that President Hassan Rouhani of Iran had said Tehran would talk to the Americans if they showed “respect” instead of issuing orders. Iranian officials had previously ruled out talks with the Trump team.
Taken together, the developments suggest that international efforts, either publicly or behind the scenes, to persuade the two sides to de-escalate tensions were having an effect. Pompeo spoke while visiting Switzerland, which often serves as an intermediary between the U.S. and Iran, though the Swiss have been unwilling to detail what role, if any, they now play.
The statements from both sides also come as Trump has made it increasingly clear that he does not want a military conflict with Iran. His stance has put him publicly at odds with aides such as Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, who have taken a harder line.
Bolton has been especially bellicose, even though it has strained his relationship with Trump. He has threatened Iran with “unrelenting force,” and in recent days blamed Iran for a spate of attacks on U.S. allies, including drone attacks carried out by Houthi rebels on targets in Saudi Arabia.
Pompeo has been more cautious, indicating that he’s trying to channel the president, an effort that is not easy given Trump’s mercurial nature.
Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the Trump administration was asking Iran to believe both that the U.S. would be very hard-line and that it didn’t want war.
“It remains to be seen if that combination represents a viable basis for talks,” O’Hanlon said. “Certainly, skepticism is in order.”
Trump ran for office in 2016 pledging to reduce U.S. entanglements abroad. He’s reached out to Iranian leaders in the past, such as during the 2017 U.N. General Assembly, only to be rebuffed, and even as early as July 2018 he said he’d be willing to talk to Iran without preconditions.
The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. The State Department referred reporters to Trump’s July 2018 comments amid questions about Pompeo’s remarks.
More recently, however, Trump has appeared to effectively dismiss most of the 12 conditions that Pompeo had said must be part of any deal with Iran.
Those conditions included everything from Iran ending its support for militias outside its borders to halting its ballistic missile program. They were so far-reaching that analysts said they were essentially a call for regime change.
Trump, however, has said in recent weeks that he’s interested only in making sure Iran never obtains nuclear weapons.
“We aren’t looking for regime change,” the president said last week while in Tokyo. “I just want to make that clear. We are looking for no nuclear weapons.”
He also stressed that if Iran and the United States could come to an acceptable agreement, the U.S. would be able to help Iran save its economy, which has been battered by American sanctions.
The mixed and muddled messages from Trump and his team have frustrated Middle Eastern officials, Democratic lawmakers and other observers of the region, some of whom fear that even if both sides don’t want a war, a miscalculation could lead to it.
James Acton, co-director of Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he was skeptical that the Trump administration had engaged in the necessary planning to ensure that any talks would be productive.
“It is difficult to see why Iran would trust the administration to deliver on any promises it offers,” Acton said.
Critics note that many of the tensions today stem from Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015. That deal lifted many U.S. sanctions on Iran in exchange for the country's shuttering its nuclear program.
In the past, Trump has complained that the 2015 deal didn’t do enough to restrain Iran’s nonnuclear misbehavior, including its support for terrorist groups. His more recent comments suggest he’s willing to make essentially the same kind of deal.
“I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal,” he said while in Tokyo. “And I think that’s very smart of them. And I think that’s a possibility to happen, also.”
According to reports that Quote: d Iranian state media, Rouhani, the country’s president, said Saturday: “We are for logic and talks if (the other side) sits respectfully at the negotiating table and follows international regulations, not if it issues an order to negotiate.”
It’s not at all clear that Iran will view Pompeo’s latest offer as showing enough respect, or whether it will believe Trump’s words given his actions toward Tehran. In an interview with ABC‘s “This Week,“ Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran wasn’t likely to negotiate with the United States.
“It's not very likely, because talking is the continuation of the process of pressure,” he said. “He's imposing pressure. This may work in a real estate market. It does not work in dealing with Iran.”
The president has levied extremely tough sanctions on Iran, badly damaging its economy, even threatening other countries with sanctions if they keep buying oil from Iran. He also decided to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — a government body — as a terrorist group, a move that some believe has contributed to the recent tensions.
Even as he’s said he wants to talk to the Iranians, Trump approved a decision last month to speed up the deployment of an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf, in response to alleged Iranian threats against U.S. troops and facilities in the region.
Days ago, he deployed or extended the tours of some 1,500 U.S. troops to the region amid suspicions that Iran was behind attacks on oil and related infrastructure of U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia.
Trump administration officials say this “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran is designed to cut off its funding so that it cannot support militia or terrorist activity outside its borders, eventually forcing it to come to the table for talks.
Officially, the administration’s position is that it is not seeking a change of leadership in Iran, but rather a change in the country's behavior. There are some in the administration, however, who hope that economic conditions will become so dire that the Iranian people will rise up and overthrow their Islamist rulers.

Mulvaney: 'Let's not get too deep into politics too soon' after shooting,www.politico.com,KELSEY TAMBORRINO,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/mulvaney-virginia-beach-shooting-1350701,"Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney cautioned against focusing too heavily on politics ""too soon"" after a gunman on Friday killed 12 people at a city government building in Virginia Beach, Va.
""We have too many of these shootings, and every time the first thing we talk about is politics,"" Mulvaney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
""The mourning period hasn't even stopped yet, let alone the healing process,"" he added. ""So, let's not get too deep into politics too soon. Let's think about the families.""
Police Chief James Cervera said on ABC on Sunday the shooter, who was killed during a firefight with police, was a municipal employee who worked in the building and had purchased the firearms legally.
Mulvaney said there are things the federal government can do to address gun violence and pointed to moves the has already made, including banning bump stocks and offering legislation on background checks.
""But we're never going to protect everybody against everybody who is deranged and insane,"" he said. ""You're never going to make everything perfectly safe, but we are doing a lot better on enforcement.""
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Sunday the investigation into Friday's shooting is proceeding with the help of the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
""We want to do the best we can to support communities to get out in front of these kind of issues, to identify anything we can see to prevent this kind of violence up front,"" he said on CNN.
When asked by CNN host Jake Tapper whether the Department of Homeland Security should look at gun violence differently than it does now, McAleenan said DHS is ""focused on the violence, regardless of the ideology or motivation and regardless of the means to carry it out."""

McCain during his state visit to Japan, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday.
""The president didn't know about it. I didn’t know about it,"" Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday,“ adding ""literally hundreds of people are involved in moving the president overseas.""
Story Continued Below
""The president's feelings about the former senator are well-known,"" Mulvaney added. ""The fact that a low-level person might have asked the question shouldn't surprise anybody. We think it's much ado about nothing.""
The Navy confirmed Saturday that a ""request was made"" to ""minimize the visibility"" of the McCain during the president's recent state visit to Japan. The Wall Street Journal first reported last week that the White House had wanted to move the destroyer ""out of sight.""
The warship is named for the late Sen. John McCain as well as his father and his grandfather. The Arizona senator died in August.
Mulvaney was asked on “Fox News Sunday“ whether anyone in the White House would be disciplined over the move, but he dismissed the premise of the question.
""For what? For asking an innocuous question about that? No,"" he said. ""Does someone get disciplined at Fox News for saying that so-and-so does not want to sit next to so-and-so at a meeting? No. Again, this is a minor issue that we think the media is trying to make into a larger matter.""
He said there are many people involved in the lead-up to the president's overseas travel and that any one of them could have ""asked this question.""
""If a 23- or 24-year-old person says, 'Look, is it really a good idea for this ship to be in the background?' — that is not an unreasonable question to have and it certainly is not something that takes up two minutes of national television on Sunday,"" he said."

""I have never said he should not be impeached. What I have said time and time again is, [special counsel Robert] Mueller has developed the grounds for impeachment. The House has to determine the timing for impeachment. There's a big difference,"" he said.
The South Carolina Democrat appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday and was asked whether he believes Trump will be impeached and whether impeachment proceedings will begin in the House ""at some point, but just not right now.""
""Yes, that's exactly what I feel,"" Clyburn responded. ""I think we have already begun. We have got all of these committees doing their work. We're having hearings. We have already won two court cases. And there are other cases that are still to be determined.""
Clyburn added: ""We are winning this issue. Why should we go out and make missteps and cause us to lose a court decision that will have people saying, 'Why didn't you take your time?'""
His comments come amid growing calls from Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against the president in the aftermath of the special counsel investigation — calls that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has so far resisted.
“All it takes is 218 votes to effectively impeach the president. That doesn't say that it will be the efficient way to do it,"" Clyburn said. ""What Nancy Pelosi is trying to do and the rest of us in the House of Representatives is to develop a process by which we can efficiently move on this issue, so that, when we get to a vote, it would be something that she calls ironclad, I call effective.""
Clyburn added it was important for the public to understand the need for impeachment first and that House Democrats are working to ""bring the public along.""
""We do believe that, if we sufficiently, effectively educate the public, then we will have done our job and we can move on an impeachment vote, and it will stand, and maybe it will be what needs to be done to incent the Senate to act,"" he said."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print LONDON — Theresa May has been liberated, but don’t expect a ""Love Actually"" moment with Donald Trump.
Having finally raised the white flag in her battle to extricate Britain from the European Union before she leaves office, the U.K. prime minister has a final duty to perform: hosting the U.S. president.
Trump's visit has been long in the making — conceived during May’s first trip to Washington as prime minister back in 2016 when she was riding high in the polls and was the first world leader to visit the Trump White House.
Trump has already made one visit to the U.K. as U.S. president, in July last year, when he attracted widespread protests and was involved in an unseemly row over whether he kept Queen Elizabeth waiting. But this is his first trip to be classed as a ""state visit,"" involving extra pomp and pageantry.
Despite the uneasy relationship that has developed between the U.S. leader and the British prime minister, May had been looking forward to the visit, senior U.K. officials familiar with her preparations told POLITICO. It was a chance to put the special relationship back on a firmer footing amid growing signs of disinterest in Washington.

Yet, since May’s forced resignation announcement, planning for the visit is now in “disaster management” territory, according to one official close to the prime minister. With Brexit unresolved and the Conservative Party leadership race already exploding into life ahead of May's official end date of June 7, the Trump visit could hardly be more badly timed.
Even before setting off, Trump waded into British domestic politics. He expressed admiration for Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, who is aiming to replace May as Tory leader and prime minister. They are both “very good guys” and “very interesting people,” Trump told reporters. He doubled down with vocal backing for Johnson in an interview just ahead of the trip.

Acting defense chief: Major drills with South Korea still on hold - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/shanahan-south-korea-north-1351068,"SEOUL, South Korea — Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Sunday that so far he sees no need to restore large-scale military exercises with South Korea that have been curtailed over the past year as a diplomatic olive branch to North Korea.
“I’m confident that we have the readiness that we are required to have,” Shanahan said as he flew to Seoul to meet with his commanders and South Korean officials. But he also said he wants to discuss the issue with his top American commander in South Korea, Army Gen. Robert Abrams, to “make sure that the plan that we put in place is sufficient.”
Story Continued Below
Shanahan’s visit to Seoul comes as the U.S. and partners in the region weigh how to respond to missile tests conducted last month by North Korea. The tests fuel debate over whether the elimination of drills may impair the U.S. and South Korea’s ability to respond if the North is once again turning away from diplomacy and moving to heighten hostilities.
Senior U.S. officials, including Shanahan, have said that the North Korean test launches of what they believe were short-range ballistic missiles were a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The North has defended the launches as efforts to exercise its right to self-defense.
South Korea and the U.S. last year eliminated larger military drills and said they would replace them with smaller exercises. The North has viewed the large drills as an invasion rehearsal. In place of the bigger exercises, the U.S. and South Korea have been doing newly designed command post drills and revised field training programs.
The decision to dump the bigger drills came last June after President Donald Trump’s first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump abruptly announced the decision, saying that he disapproved of what he called U.S. “war games” in South Korea. He called the maneuvers provocative and expensive.
At the time, military leaders defended the move as a way to support diplomacy aimed at resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis. Pentagon officials said they believed the shift to smaller exercises would not harm military readiness, but that the decision would be periodically re-evaluated.
Last September, Abrams said at his Senate confirmation hearing that the suspension of the drills had contributed to a “slight” dip in combat readiness.
And some experts say it will likely weaken the allies’ military readiness and hurt the ability of the U.S. and South Korean troops to work seamlessly together in the event of an attack or other emergency.
On Saturday in Singapore, Shanahan made clear that the U.S. believes that North Korea “remains an extraordinary threat.” He told the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference that Pyongyang has “neared a point where it could credibly strike regional allies, U.S. territory and our forward-deployed forces.”
Heightened tensions with the North in 2017 were followed by a surprising diplomatic outreach by Pyongyang in 2018, when Kim attended summits with the South Korean and Chinese presidents and with Trump. But North Korea has not received what it wants most from its summitry: relief from punitive sanctions imposed over its nuclear and missile programs.
A summit earlier this year between Trump and Kim ended in failure, with the United States saying that North Korea was not offering to take enough disarmament steps in return for the widespread sanctions relief it sought."
Mulvaney: 'There is no question' Russia attempted to interfere in election - POLITICO,www.politico.com,KELSEY TAMBORRINO,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/02/mulvaney-russia-election-1351067,"Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Russia definitely tried to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
""Yes, Russia did attempt to interfere in our election. There is no question,"" Mulvaney said on NBC, before adding: ""Let's not lose sight of the fact that it was the previous administration that let that happen.""
Mulvaney was pressed by ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd on whether accepts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election ""in order to help him win,"" after Trump last week offered conflicting signals on the issue in response to special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Critics of Trump have suggested that because of his defensiveness over the Mueller investigation, Trump has not taken seriously Russia’s past behavior or its ongoing threat.
""Russia, Russia, Russia! That’s all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected,"" Trump wrote .
He later told reporters Russia did not help him get elected. ""You know who got me elected? I got me elected. Russia didn't help me at all. Russia, if anything, helped the other side,"" he said.
In his report, Mueller outlined a sweeping effort by Russian actors to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, but he also determined ""that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy"" between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
Mulvaney said the ""bottom line"" was ""that it didn't make any difference"" and that the Trump administration has been working for two years to fend off further foreign interference in elections.
""It's stuff that doesn't percolate up to the level of national attention,"" he said. ""But our Department of Justice, our DHS, have been working with states and local governments to make sure that no foreign government, Russia or anybody, has the ability to do, what in 2020, what they did in 2016."""
Rebuilding Paradise: Finding health care after wildfire destruction,www.politico.com,VICTORIA COLLIVER,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2019/06/01/rebuilding-paradise-finding-health-care-after-wildfire-destruction-1036245,"PARADISE — This Northern California town, decimated by wildfires, is trying to rebuild a health care system in a place that no longer exists for a future that’s impossible to predict.
Paradise is little more than a large charred debris removal site — and it lost its hospital, several clinics, its nursing homes, its doctors in the fire last year. Without health care, Paradise, a remote town 90 miles from Sacramento nestled into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, has no chance of coming back.
Recovery may also provide opportunity. Paradise is trying to piece together a new, more flexible health care system, relying on new partnerships and better technology, including telemedicine. If it works, Paradise could become a template for how to deliver health care to rural America, not just those communities hit by disaster, but areas that have seen hospitals close and the numbers of doctors dwindle.
“They have the really unique perspective right now to create something based on need that can grow in the community as it looks toward the future,” said Brock Slabach, senior vice president with the National Rural Health Association.
A $19 billion federal disaster assistance bill, H.R. 2157 (116) long delayed in Congress because of disputes between President Trump and the Democrats, may finally be approved in the coming week. California stands to get up to $12.6 billion, and some of that money will come here to Paradise, where the Camp Fire, the biggest and most destructive fire in state history, killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes when it struck six months ago.
The new vision for health care here builds on primary care based in the community, with telemedicine access to specialists. Whether the town will have a hospital of its own — or just an emergency facility, at least for the next few years — is an unresolved question.
Adventist Health hasn’t decided whether to rebuild or reopen Paradise’s only hospital, which was severely damaged though it didn’t burn to the ground. Physicians have left because they have no place to practice or live. Patients have fled to makeshift homes with friends or relatives, uncertain whether to return.
The rebuilding task for the city is monumental, and health care has to be at its heart.
“I don’t think there is a similar instance in the United States where a community has been essentially completely destroyed and had to rebuild,” said Richard Thorp, a physician and president of the Paradise Medical Group, which served about 10,000 patients at three clinics in what was once a serene rural community.
Paradise has one of the worst cleanup jobs since 9/11, but signs of recovery are starting to appear. Thorp’s medical group has started seeing patients at its one surviving clinic. On the other side of town, Adventist’s Feather River Health Center, a federally designated rural health clinic that treats Medicaid patients, reopened in late December.
“Every time there’s a ribbon-cutting around here, there’s a little more confidence,” said U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa who was on hand for the clinic’s official re-opening last week. He was the only California Republican to defy Trump and vote for the Democrats’ aid package.
While the federal money stalled, state officials tried to step in. The California Legislature is considering a bill designed to help Paradise reclaim some of its emergency medical services. For instance, while Adventist Feather River, the 101-bed hospital, sustained too much damage to stay open, its ER survived . California law doesn’t allow freestanding emergency departments, so a bill CA SB156 (19R) would let Adventist Health operate the ER for up to six years under a consolidated license with another Adventist hospital 50 miles away.
“They’ve just got to have something somewhere,” said the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen, whose district includes parts of the fire area. “Our biggest challenge since the fire has been to inspire confidence in the citizens to rebuild and come back.”
Adventist Health supports the bill but hasn’t made any decisions yet on its future footprint. “We are anxious to provide access as much as we possibly can in a quick time frame, but it’s hard to do that,” said Jill Kinney, the hospital's spokesperson.
Building a hospital is a complex, multiyear process under the best of circumstances, Kinney said. “Right now, some of our challenges are we don’t know where the population is going to end up,” she said. “Are they going to rebuild? Are they coming back? It’s really hard to tell what the community will look like.”
Rigid federal regulations has made it hard for rural communities to rebuild health facilities after disasters, says Slabach. Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) offered a bill S. 1130 (115) , that would allow Medicare to reimburse a new kind of rural clinic-hospital hybrid. But it hasn’t gotten traction in Congress.
Paradise’s Feather River hospital didn't qualify as a “critical access” hospital — a designation that offers rural hospitals higher Medicare rates — and won't qualify as one without a legislative fix or waiver, because of its size and proximity to hospitals in Chico and Oroville, respectively 16 and 21 miles away.
And changes in medicine — a new emphasis on primary and community based care, less on acute care hospital settings — means Paradise is rethinking its needs. Slabach, of the rural health association, said post-disaster communities need flexible options. Many of them ""really don’t want or need inpatient capacity because the population no longer supports it,” he said.
But while some people could get to Chico or Oroville with relative ease, it’s harder for elderly residents who lived in Paradise. The topography — on a wide ridge surrounded by deep canyons — makes it even more remote.
In the immediate aftermath of the fire, doctors worked out of Chico's Enloe Medical Center and clinics. With the reopening of the Paradise Medical Group clinic, the practice also unveiled “PMG Connect,” a virtual care platform supported by Teladoc. Blue Shield of California gave the medical group $2 million to help pay for the technology, while covering 90 days of payroll and other expenses.
The technology allows patients to connect virtually with their doctors online and through mobile apps. The group is starting to experiment with home-based care and remote patient monitoring. The hospital’s closure has limited Paradise’s health capacity to primary care, increasing the need to access outside specialists.
If the hospital rebuilds, it will undoubtedly do so with a smaller footprint, one that reflects the overall trend of shifting care to outpatient settings.
Dustin Corcoran , CEO of the California Medical Association, said Paradise’s rebuild from the ground up offers it the opportunity to be the “most technologically advanced, the most forward-facing medical group in the entire state of California.”
The medical group already had a strong technological foothold; a new cloud-based EHR system retained the last three years of patient records, and the group’s quick-thinking technology manager managed to save the hard drives containing earlier patient history from a basement before the clinic burned to the ground.
Problems like recruiting physicians and providing specialty care services ""were always an issue pre-fire,"" Corcoran said. ""Now it's a greater issue. But now they have the technological capacity and that's quite an asset to the community as it rebuilds.""
“As we restore Paradise, the medical group and its services, it probably won’t be the same as it was before,” said Bradford Ogden, 65 and a longtime resident and patient. “It will be different. It might be better.”"
Sources: EDA hit with grand jury subpoena over tax credit program,www.politico.com,MATT FRIEDMAN,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2019/06/02/eda-hit-with-grand-jury-subpoenas-over-tax-credit-program-1036710,"A state grand jury is looking into New Jersey’s tax incentive program and has issued at least one subpoena to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, according to three sources.
The sources requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation.
It’s not clear if a special grand jury was convened to look into the program or if the subpoena came from an ongoing grand jury. However, this is the first indication a grand jury is involved. The state attorney general’s office said in January that it had begun a probe into the program after a comptroller’s report cited lack of oversight and other problems.
A spokesperson for the EDA did not respond to calls and emails seeking comment. A spokesperson for the attorney general’s office said only that the office will neither confirm nor deny investigations.
According to two of the sources, the subpoena is seeking documents related to several companies that have received tax incentives, as well information on the EDA’s policies and procedures.
A task force appointed by Gov. Phil Murphy announced in March that it made a criminal referral to law enforcement about alleged unregistered lobbying during the drafting of the legislation that created the state’s current tax incentive programs, although it did not specify who the subject was.
The task force has raised questions about whether several companies — including Jackson Hewitt and several South Jersey firms linked to Democratic power broker George Norcross — submitted documents that suggested they would move to Philadelphia based on what the task force characterized as cursory and unrealistic office space lease proposals.
WNYC reported last week that Holtec, which was approved for a $240 million tax incentive, falsely said on its application for tax credits that it had never been barred from doing business with a state or federal agency, when in fact it had.
And The New York Times reported that attorney Kevin Sheehan of Parker McCay — the law firm run by Philip Norcross, the brother of George Norcross — had drafted key provisions of the tax credit legislation in 2013. His firm’s clients reportedly went on to take advantage of the provisions.
A spokesperson for the Norcross-linked companies told POLITICO on Friday that none had received subpoenas. A spokesperson for Holtec did not respond to an email seeking comment.

How a Sex Offender's Case Before the Supreme Court Could Bring Down the Administrative State Magazine,www.politico.com,John F. Harris,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/02/supreme-court-gundy-rapist-227038,"Herman Gundy was out on supervised release in 2004 from a 1996 crack distribution conviction when he met an 11-year-old girl. He served her cocaine and raped her.
As soon as Monday, the Supreme Court will rule on his fate.
Story Continued Below
While court-watchers have been focused on other headline issues the court may decide this term—including cases on abortion, citizenship questions on the Census, and partisan gerrymandering—the Gundy case could mark a watershed of its own. At issue isn’t the lurid crime itself, but just how much power Congress can delegate to the executive branch.
Along with a new trade-related case the court may choose to take up in the coming weeks, it’s part of a campaign to use the courts in service of a libertarian rollback of the administrative state. And a nation in which both Gundy and American Institute for International Steel (the trade case) go against the government could look very different.
Gundy has become a cause célèbre among libertarian legal activists, who see in his case an opening they’ve long sought. The question before the court turns on whether Congress delegated too much of its legislative power. It concerns the 2006 Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act—under which Gundy was convicted—a law named after the kidnapped and murdered child of “America’s Most Wanted” host John Walsh and which established detailed instructions for state governments to maintain sex offender registries. For sex offenders whose original offenses and convictions came before the law was enacted Congress opted to let the Department of Justice set up detailed rules for those registries.
This is where the libertarians and their lawyers have pounced: They argue that Gundy’s case is emblematic of a government that concentrates too much decision-making power in the hands of bureaucrats not directly accountable to the people. Gundy ran afoul of these rules when he did not register while living in a New York halfway house. He was rearrested, put on supervised release and ordered to register. If the underlying law were unconstitutional, then Congress would have to rewrite the law or he might skirt registration requirements in the future.
In a series of amicus briefs in his support, groups with names like DownsizeDC.org and Gun Owners of America,which considers itself even more hard-line on gun rights than the NRA, have cited everything from the Bible to the French philosopher Montesquieu in their efforts to attach the convicted rapist to a holy crusade for liberty from government interference.
This is part of a long argument over just how much power Capitol Hill can hand over to presidents. For adherents of the “nondelegation doctrine""—people who believe that any kind of law like this is an invitation to overreach by a bloated executive branch—Article 1, Section 1 of the Constitution vests Congress with “all legislative powers.” This power is unalienable, meaning Congress can’t decide to let courts or agencies make law. Nonetheless, the line is blurry between law-writing, law-enforcing and law-interpreting.
The Supreme Court has only twice struck down laws under the so-called nondelegation doctrine—both times in the 1930s, reining in FDR’s New Deal. In Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan in 1935, the justices deemed that a New Deal oil conservation law provided “no criterion to govern the President’s course.” Five months later, in Schechter v. U.S., a unanimous ruling by liberals and conservatives on the bench found that New Deal “fair competition” codes for industry lacked “any adequate definition of the subject to which the codes [were] to be addressed,” allowing the president to restructure the whole economy. President Franklin Roosevelt, his governing agenda under threat, threatened to pack the court. Miraculously, the court would never rule against the New Deal again. Indeed, in the 88 years since, conservative and liberal justices alike have deferred to the division of labor that the political branches agreed to. In the words of Justice Antonin Scalia, “We have almost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to those executing or applying the law.”
Libertarian organizations dislike this deference. What they’d prefer is a regime in which Congress kept the power over the nitty-gritty of executing laws—which would mean, to their delight, lawmaking would basically screech to a halt in a morass of tiny details. This would make it nearly impossible for Congress to write rules for the economy. One of their strongest likely allies is the newest justice, Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the Federalist Society. As he has written in a lower court case against the Environmental Protection Agency, “Congress’s failure to enact general climate change legislation does not license an agency to take matters into its own hands, even to solve a pressing policy issue such as climate change.”
Long-game-playing legal activists are betting that Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, who has made similar rulings, will be more willing than Scalia and others to revisit the old political bargains. With Gundy, who more moderate groups like the American Civil Liberties Union also support for sound criminal justice reasons, they may have found their opening. As awkward as it is for avowed Christian conservative judges to side with a sex offender, the plaintiffs are betting that justices’ dislike of the administrative state is even greater.
Beyond Gundy, waiting in the wings is another major nondelegation case. American Institute for International Steel v. U.S., is a case brought by progressive lawyers on behalf of steel importers upset with the Trump administration's levying of steel tariffs for national security reasons. Like the Adam Walsh bill, the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, which enabled the steel tariffs, delegates substantial authority to the executive branch. Not only does the president get to determine the nature and duration of import restrictions, he is allowed to consider factors such as preserving a stock of experienced steelworkers and “the economic welfare of the nation.” And sure enough, the administration’s argument for the tariffs is not a traditional national security one but is one based more on competitiveness and concern with the health of manufacturing communities.
If Kavanaugh and company side with Gundy, they may well side with the steel group—because both cases would require rolling back 88 years' worth of the same line of precedent. Unsurprisingly, libertarian groups have weighed in on the steel group's case as well with amicus briefs. The upshot: Sex offenders and steel importers may get some relief, but at the risk of giving the conservative legal movement a legal cudgel to weaken ambitious schemes to rebuild our economy and halt the rise of inequality.
A post-Gundy nation may be one in which Congress faces even higher hurdles than those it already faces. Instead of merely having to get a majority of the House, a filibuster-proof Senate majority, a veto-empowered president and aggressive courts on board, lawmakers may have to spell out in excruciating detail how agencies have to do their jobs. Imagine already overwhelmed lawmakers having to micromanage thousands of scientists and financial regulators in between constituent services and fundraising. Not a recipe for success.
While libertarian groups claim to be supporting Gundy and American Institute for International Steel in the name of the rule of law, skeptics can be forgiven for concluding the real aim is fewer laws altogether."
