The resident wasn't injured, the station added.
WIAT-TV said the incident occurred around 9:20 p.m. and that the suspect will remain in police custody.
Detectives were questioning an individual at the scene, WVTM said, adding that there's no word if any arrests have been made.

Walmart upends the minimum wage debate by adding on a fleet of robots,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/walmart-minimum-wage,"In a blow to the minimum wage campaign targeting Walmart, the superstore company says they will expand their fleet of robots at their stores.
Walmart will add 4,000 robots to replace human workers doing mundane work at its stores and facilities.
They made the announcement in a blog post explaining their plans for ""automated assistants.""
Smart assistants have huge potential to make busy stores run more smoothly, so Walmart has been pioneering new technologies to minimize the time an associate spends on the more mundane and repetitive tasks like cleaning floors or checking inventory on a shelf. This gives associates more of an opportunity to do what they're uniquely qualified for: serve customers face-to-face on the sales floor. The post says they will order 1,500 floor-cleaning robots, 300 shelf-scanners, 1,200 truck unloaders, and 900 pickup towers for online orders.
In January of 2018 Walmart announced that they were raising their employee wages, and then immediately followed with layoffs to their workforce.
Presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) made it a personal mission to pressure Walmart to raise their wages to $15 a hour in November 2018.

Breaking: Pentagon awards $1 billion in contracts to build President Trump's border wall,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-is-building-his-border-wall,"The Pentagon announced Monday that the first of contracts to build the border wall proposed by President Donald Trump have been awarded and construction will begin shortly.
And it's almost $1 billion in funding so far.
The announcement named SLSCO Ltd., a company from Galveston, Texas, as the major recipient of $789 million for the construction of ""border replacement wall"" in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The contract is to be completed by October 2020.
Barnard Construction Company from Montana was also awarded $187 million by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct ""primary pedestrian wall replacement"" in Yuma, Arizona. That project is also estimated to be completed by October 2020.
A spokesman for the Department of Defense told The Hill in a statement that ""30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate"" would be constructed in the Santa Teresa contract. For the Yuma contract, ""18-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate"" would be constructed.
The construction would be the first since Trump announced the declaration of a national emergency at the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Many of his critics have decried the action as unconstitutional since he admitted that he was only doing so in order to avoid the opposition from Congress.
The president had threatened to shut down the border to trade in order to force Mexico to do more to stop illegal immigrants from attempting entry into the U.S., but he later backed off on the threat.

Widow of slain police officer slams Kamala Harris on death penalty stance: 'I want people to know who she is',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/widow-of-slain-police-officer-slams-kamala-harris-on-death-penalty-stance-i-want-people-to-know-who-she-is,"The widow of a San Francisco police officer who was killed in the line of duty nearly 15 years ago spoke publicly for the first time to CNN about the pain Sen. Kamala Harris' (D-Calif.) opposition to the death penalty caused her family.
What's the backstory? Renata Espinoza's husband, officer Isaac Espinoza, was gunned down by David Hill on April 10, 2004 after Espinoza and his partner approached him for walking down the street while appearing to conceal a weapon.
That weapon, which Hill used to murder Espinoza, turned out to be an AK-47. Hill is now serving consecutive life sentences , one without a chance at parole.
Why is she going public now? Renata Espinoza said she was and is upset by how Harris, who was San Francisco's district attorney at the time, refused to consider pursuing the death penalty for Hill, and how she never spoke to the family before announcing that decision.
""I want people to know who she is, how she was back then and how her actions affected us,"" Espinoza told CNN. ""I want people to know everything about her, even in the past, before they vote for her. And I want them to hear Isaac's story.""
Three days after Hill was arrested for the murder, Harris held a press conference announcing that she would be seeking a sentence of life without parole for Hill.
Gary Delagnes, who was the president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, was at the press conference with Harris and remembers being alarmed by Harris' statement.
""I'm standing there and I'm going, 'Oh my God.'"" Delagnes said. ""The kid's not even in the ground yet. You're thinking to yourself, OK, is she sorry that this kid died or is this just a political opportunity? Is this just an opportunity for her to double down on the fact that she's not going to pursue the death penalty?""
Espinoza was discouraged that Harris would go on camera days after her husband's murder without even calling the family.
""She did not call me,"" Espinoza said. ""I don't understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It's like, you can't even wait til he's buried?""
'For the people' or for yourself? Espinoza's view of Harris was further complicated by Harris' 2014 decision to appeal a U.S. District Court judge's ruling that California's death penalty was unconstitutional.
If Harris was so strongly against the death penalty, Espinoza wondered, why would she fight for it then but fight against it when it could've brought justice for Isaac Espinoza?
""It feels like, why are you changing your mind now?"" Espinoza told CNN. ""Why couldn't you change your mind back then and put your feelings aside?""
Espinoza said she's talking publicly about the situation now because she wants people to understand who Harris is since she's running for president, and because her late husband would not have approved of how Harris handled their case.
""You're trying to be President of the United States,"" Espinoza said. ""That's a lot. Are you going to show compassion? Are you going to be 'for the people?' Or are you going to be for yourself?"""
Former NFL star gives a powerful response when asked how to reduce violence in the black community,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/violence-in-the-black-community,"Former NFL running back Reggie Bush gave a stunningly powerful and candid response when asked what could be done to reduce the violence in the black community.
""This is such a deep question,"" he replied, ""and honestly, I'm so thankful that Fox would take this leap of faith to even allow us to talk about this because the only way I feel like things can change is if we have conversations like this with a platform like this.
""But I will speak to my personal upbringing,"" Bush explained. ""My real dad was not in my life growing up.
""And so the foundation of why I wanted to be so great on the football field was I wanted to make my dad jealous,"" he added. ""And I had this resentment and this aggression that I grew up with toward my real dad. And as I got older I realized my dad never had his dad in his life.
""My dad met his dad for the first time five years ago,"" he continued. ""My dad is 53 years old. And my biological grandfather, who I still haven't met to this day, lived in L.A. this whole time.
""So to me, we've got to get back to the foundation at home with the parenting,"" Bush said. ""And a lot of my boys who I grew up with didn't have their dads. A lot of guys I knew in the NFL didn't have their dads growing up.
""I learned from a lot of the men through football,"" he continued. ""Football ultimately became that father for me because that is where other men there. Now the issue with that is I'm learning from other men who are just as broken as me.
""I think a good start is getting back to the foundation of where kids are young and making them understand that listen, just because you have a tough upbringing doesn't mean you can't go on to be successful,"" Bush said.
""And I think if you start there with the parenting because not having a man in your life to show you how to be a man, that has significant effects,"" he concluded. ""A lot of those effects have stuck with me up until my relationship with my kids and my wife.""

West Virginia woman charged after making up story about Egyptian man trying to kidnap her daughter,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/west-virginia-woman-charged-after-making-up-story-about-egyptian-man-trying-to-kidnap-her-daughter,"A West Virginia mother is facing jail time after being charged with fabricating a story about an Egyptian man trying to kidnap her child in a mall, according to The Washington Post .
The woman initially told a heroic story about her scaring the man off with her gun as he tried to drag the child away by her hair. Turns out, none of that happened.
What actually happened? The woman, Santana Renee Adams, told police that a Middle Eastern man tried to kidnap her 5-year-old daughter from an Old Navy store by dragging her by the hair. Adams said she pulled out her concealed handgun and pointed it at the man, causing him to flee.
However, no employees or shoppers reported any knowledge of such a scene in Old Navy that day, and security cameras revealed that the suspect police arrested, Mohamed Fathy Hussein Zayan of Egypt, hadn't so much as looked at Adams or her child while he was in the store.
How does Adams explain the lie? After her initial report, Adams admitted that things may not have happened as she initially said. She changed her story to cite a ""cultural misunderstanding"" in which Zayan may have been simply patting her daughter on the head and smiling. But even that doesn't seem to have happened.
Zayan's charges dropped: Even though Zayan's name was cleared, he still was arrested, had to spend time in jail, and had his name smeared for absolutely no reason because of this situation. Still, he thanked police for finding the truth.
Zayan was in West Virginia doing contract work as an engineer, and was shopping for clothes for his own daughter when he was framed for attempted abduction.
""I can't say that she had any kind of agenda or what her agenda was, but it still was very, very bad to hurt this man and upset our entire community like it did,"" said Barboursville Police Detective Greg Lucas.
Adams faces a fine of up to $500 and a maximum penalty of six months in jail if she is convicted."
AG Barr plans to release a redacted Mueller report within a week; some Dems still aren't satisfied,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ag-barr-plans-to-release-a-redacted-mueller-report-within-a-week-some-dems-still-arent-satisfied,"Attorney General William Barr said he plans to release the full (redacted) report from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation within a week, according to CNN .
Barr said the redactions will be color-coded and come with explanations of the specific reason that information was not made public.
So everyone's happy, right? Of course, the news of the impending release of the report did not satisfy all congressional Democrats. Barr's promised release does not satisfy those who do not trust the Trump-appointed AG to handle the redaction process appropriately.
House Judiciary Committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) stands ready to issue a subpoena if the information doesn't contain all the information he believes it should.
""I presume we're going to get the redacted report within a week,"" Nadler said Tuesday. ""When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue a subpoena and go to court.""
Barr defends the infamous four-page letter: Barr has been heavily criticized by Democrats for the four-page letter he sent to Congress upon reviewing Mueller's report; specifically, the portion where he determined that President Donald Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice based on the available evidence.
Still, Barr maintains that it wasn't intended to be a full summary, and that Mueller declined to review the letter before it was sent.
""I suspect that they probably wanted more put out,"" Barr said. ""In my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries or trying to summarize, because I think any summary, regardless of who prepares it, not only runs the risk of being under-inclusive or over-inclusive, but also, would trigger a lot of discussion and analysis that really should await everything coming out at once."""

""The Office of the Inspector General has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russian investigation, and I expect that that will be complete in probably in May or June, I am told,"" said Barr during congressional testimony Tuesday.
The president alleged that he had been ""wire tapped"" by the former Obama administration, which later admitted that some members of the campaign had been surveilled during an investigation into claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
""So hopefully we'll have some answers from Inspector General Horowitz on the issue of the FISA warrants,"" added Barr.
He also said that he was personally looking into the controversial acts of the FBI.
""More generally,"" Barr said, ""I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around of all the aspects of the counter-intelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.""
Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has also said that Barr is interested in investigating how the FBI came to the conclusions they made about former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's transgressions over her private email server.
And here's the point,"" said Graham. ""How could she win if the Department of Justice indicted her? I think that's what drove the decision not to indict.""
""They wanted her to win,"" he concluded.

The California congressman made his big announcement during CBS' ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" but the campaign video that followed on social media failed to generate much enthusiasm. But Swalwell's announcement did garner a fair amount of mockery over his robotic, deadpan delivery of an already overused speech.

A white woman opened a 'healthy' Chinese restaurant in NYC — but then the cultural appropriation police stepped in,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-white-woman-opens-a-chinese-restaurant-in-nyc-the-backlash-is-intense,"A new restaurant in New York City is taking fire for ... well, everything about the new Chinese food restaurant.
What, exactly, are people complaining about? The majority of the complaints center around the fact that a white woman is owning and operating the Chinese food restaurant. Other complaints include the fact that it's called ""Lucky Lee's,"" the fact that the owner, nutritionist Arielle Haspel, is marketing the restaurant as a ""clean"" alternative to traditional Chinese restaurants with regard to its all-natural ingredients, and more.
The restaurant's marketing insists that the food is cooked in less oil, avoids MSG, refined sugars, and is gluten-free. Some of the traditionally meat offerings can also be substituted with healthier vegetable-based picks, like cauliflower. The branding also suggests that the food is much healthier and lighter than traditional Chinese restaurant menu items.
According to Eater NY , Haspel said, ""There are very few American-Chinese places as mindful about the quality of ingredients as we are.""
""We're excited to offer it to people who want this type of food, and it can make them feel good and they can workout after and they can feel focused after and it will add to their health,"" she added.
What else? Some people, especially on social media , find the restaurant's name problematic for its ""superficial understanding of luck and fortune in Asian culture.""
One post by the restaurant in particular caught social media's ire. The post has since been deleted, but Eater NY was able to spot it before it was pulled down.
According to the outlet, a portion of the Instagram post read, ""We heard you're obsessed with lo mein but rarely eat it. You said it makes you feel bloated and icky the next day? Well, wait until you slurp up our HIGH lo mein. Not too oily. Or salty.""
The restaurant's latest Instagram posts have been inundated with negative comments, mostly consisting of their insistence that the restaurant is engaging in cultural appropriation, racism, and more.
One user, as highlighted by Eater NY, wrote, ""This white woman just opened a 'clean' Chinese food restaurant ... not only is she using Chinese food stereotypes/naming, she is shaming traditional Chinese food cooking with MSG/grease/starch.""
According to WNBC-NY , another social media user added, ""This is terrible. Why do you feel the need to grossly appropriate another culture while simultaneously calling it 'unclean' and 'unhealthy?'""
Another Instagram user wrote , ""On Behalf of subtle asian traits, F*** OUTTA HEREEEE.""
Social media users are even taking their issues to Haspel's personal Instagram page.
One user wrote , ""Your intentions don't matter if you don't take accountability for your actions and realize how they've affected people, especially people of color who felt alienated by your use of racist tropes and s****y orientalist marketing. Thanks for continuing to perpetuate the idea that Chinese food is somehow dirty and unclean, I'll take my mom's home cooked Chinese food over your bland cauliflower mess any day.""
About the controversy, Haspel told Eater NY, ""I love love love American Chinese food. I made some tweaks so I would be able to eat it and my friends and other people would be able to eat it. I am by all means never ever looking to put down a culture at all. I am very inclusive, and we're here to celebrate the culture."""
Universities aren’t for intellectuals anymore; they’re just leftist echo chambers,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/universities-arent-for-intellectuals-anymore-theyre-echo-chambers-for-leftists,"If you want a snippet of what it's like to live in George Orwell's ""1984"" fiction novel, try challenging progressive ideologies on college campuses.
Many who do will find themselves in academic purgatory where the only holiness that can summon you back to heaven's gate is obedience.
In Orwell's ""1984"" novel it's called Newspeak. In 2019, it's called ""political correctness"" and if you fail to abide by it in the pious halls of academia, you risk becoming an ""unperson"" disrobed of any social and/or job status you thought was merited.
For those entering college in a student or professor role in 2019, be prepared to be baptized in leftism or castigated into affliction.
In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal , two Catholic college professors criticized the Orwellian tactics being systematically put in place by campus administrators to coerce professors into adopting progressive ideals in their classrooms.
Colleen A. Sheehan, a professor of politics, and James Matthew Wilson, an associate professor of religion and literature at Villanova University, described how students are now ""being asked to rate professors according to their perceived agreement with progressive political opinion on bias and identity"" and to ""comment on the instructor's sensitivity to the diversity of the students in the class.""
To ensure professors hold up this end of the deal, the university will reportedly monitor the evaluations filled out by the students.
The framing of the questions, however, are inherently lopsided and only adhere to those who subscribe to progressive doctrines.
For example, one question asked students to rate the professor's sensitivity to a student's biological sex, disability, and gender identity.
The term ""gender identity"" — now called gender dysphoria — was coined by Dr. John Money , a psychologist and sexologist who theorized that a person's identity in regard to gender is solely based on one's personal sense instead of biology.
Conservatives have, for the most part, rejected the notion of gender identity and are almost immediately labeled bigots for choosing to acknowledge that sex is determined by biology instead of a person's subjective sense.
So if a professor were to disagree with the idea of gender identity, misgender, or deadname someone in their classroom, they'd not only be labeled a bigot or insensitive but that mark would remain on their faculty record permanently.
Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, received worldwide attention for making a YouTube video strongly condemning political correctness and the Canadian government's decision to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act.
The new law made it a federal crime to discriminate on the basis of ""gender identity and expression"" which Peterson argued would have severe implications for free speech and could potentially subject many Canadians to be prosecuted for mistakenly misidentifying another's preferred pronouns.
Of course, Peterson's criticisms drew the ire of transgender groups and faculty who accused him of fostering a climate of hate and protests on campus ensued.
In an op-ed for the National Post, titled, ""The right to be politically incorrect,"" Peterson explained why he'd refuse to use the pronouns: ""These words are at the vanguard of a post-modern, radical leftist ideology that I detest, and which is, in my professional opinion, frighteningly similar to the Marxist doctrines that killed at least 100 million people in the 20th century.""
Classrooms that were once seen as a lighthouse for ideas, honest debate, and healthy skepticism are now old hollowed out versions of themselves where professors are afraid of challenging the intellect of their students in sincere ways.
What happened to an Evergreen State College professor is another textbook example of this.
In 2017, the Evergreen State College administration completely caved to mob rule when Bret Weinstein — a beloved biologist and evolutionary theorist who wasn't a conservative by any means — penned an open letter to campus administrators criticizing the school's annual ""Day of Absence.""
""Day of Absence"" written by Douglas Turner Ward is based on a 1965 play in which all blacks in a Southern town disappear for one day. Their absence is meant to emphasize the roles they play in a white society, which quickly crumbles resulting in white people begging for them to return.
At Evergreen, minority students were typically asked to stay home so that their white peers could reflect on the contributions they've made, but the roles had been reversed.
White students were asked to stay home instead.
As a Jew, Weinstein took issue with one group absenting another group from a shared space.
He explained his reasoning his letter of dissent in a podcast with Joe Rogan, saying that ""there was all the difference in the world between a population deciding to absent themselves from a shared space in order to highlight their role and a population deciding to absent another population from a shared space"" which Weinstein said he found ""unacceptable as a person devoted to the gains of the Civil Rights movement.""
Protests erupted over his criticism after his letter was made public by the school's newspaper and students quickly branded Weinstein a racist even though he describes himself as an ""anti-racist"" progressive.
Evergreen State warned Weinstein not to return to campus and refused to allow law enforcement to quash the apoplectic drove of students.
The intimidation at Evergreen State started ideological then turned physical and we're currently witnessing an uptick of contempt for dissenters manifest itself into more physical forms.
Just last month, Hayden Williams was punched in the face during an argument at UC Berkeley while he was recruiting students for a conservative campus organization.
Peyton Lofton, a libertarian activist, had his room door set on fire at Tulane University in New Orleans.
""It's a sad day in America when radical activists are lighting dorm room doors on fire because they disagree with you politically,"" wrote Young Americans for Liberty, the campus organization Lofton is associated with.
Just this week, it was also reported that a student at Michigan State University reported by his dorm roommate to a bias reporting system for watching a video by conservative commentator and Daily Wire editor in chief, Ben Shapiro.
In the report, the student claimed that ""Ben Shapiro is known for his inflammatory speech that criticizes and attacks the African American community"" and that he ""thought hate had no place on MSU's campus yet MSU has roomed me with someone who supports hate speach [sic].""
Shapiro, can't step foot on a college campus to speak without an expensive security detail.
This week, Matt Walsh, a popular conservative writer and commentator for the Daily Wire, also kicked up controversy at Baylor University for spreading Christian values — at a Christian school.
The early stages of purging defectors began rearing its macabre head when college professors at their pulpits began teaching a debased and atoning version of American history.
This ""woke"" interpretation surmises that America's success can only be attributed to racism, greed, colonialism, and exploitation by way of capitalism which leaves us with only one option: to repent.
Soon, students began believing, repeating, and internalizing this restricted tableau of American history. Then, the language began to change when the left's Frankenstein that is ""political correctness"" was introduced and self-victimization became a tug-of-war.
How do students interpret history correctly when only 18 percent of high school kids in America are proficient and some of the top tier universities such as Stanford no longer require that students take Western Civilization courses?
The poor understanding of history allowed PC culture to take root at the expense of reason, honest debate, and intellectual curiosity.
The only one's remain untouched are the ones who fall in line with their dogmas.
Today's campus leftist make a self-described progressives look conservative.
That intense displeasure at ideas that don't align with their own is magnified when rage-filled, 18- to 21-year-olds rationalize their own intolerance challengers under the guise of critical mass ""wokeness"" at the expense of a truly liberal education.
They accomplish weeding out edgy conversations when administrators are complacent and much worse, when they endorse their maniacal demands."
'Why the hell do you think?': Glenn reacts to alarming rise in child suicide rates,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-radio/increased-children-suicidal-thoughts-attempts,"The number of children between ages 5 and 18 who ended up in the emergency room for suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide has doubled in the United States since 2007, according to a recent study .
Data provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the number of children with ""suicide attempts (SA) and suicidal ideation (SI)"" increased from 580,000 to 1.12 million between 2007 and 2015. And 43 percent of these children were younger than 11 years old. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among America's youth.
On Tuesday's radio program, Glenn Beck and Stu Burguiere discuss many possible reasons for this alarming trend, from stress (or lack there of) to social media and video games to the loss of faith in today's families and communities.
""Why the hell do you think they're killing themselves? Why do you think they're depressed? It's really quite simple, and so is the solution,"" Glenn said. ""Every label, occupation, race, physical characteristic, every label of honor — all of those things are temporary . Eternally, they're temporary.
""Don't label yourself,"" Glenn continued. ""Don't let someone else label you or your kids. Don't put a limit on the goals that you can strive for. We're still Americans. ... My father taught me: 'As you think, so shall it be.' What are our kids thinking right now? What were you thinking as a kid?
""Help our kids,"" he added. ""Start believing again in yourself. Start believing again in God. Start believing again — not in the country, not in the flag, not in our military, not in our banking system -- but in our principles. Start believing in American principles again, and God's principles, they're interchangeable.""

"Watch: Dogs can sniff out cancer with 97 percent accuracy, study shows",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/study-dogs-sniff-out-cancer-with-97-percent-accuracy,"Dogs have an uncanny ability to sniff out bombs, drugs, and even some health issues such as seizures and low blood sugar in diabetic patients.
A new study shows that specially trained dogs can also smell cancer in blood samples with a 97 percent accuracy, according to Heather Junqueira, the lead researcher at Florida-based BioScentDx.
""Although there is currently no cure for cancer, early detection offers the best hope of survival,"" Junqueira told Science Daily . ""A highly sensitive test for detecting cancer could potentially save thousands of lives and change the way the disease is treated.""
Dogs' smell receptors are 10,000 times more accurate than humans, which means they can detect subtle changes in blood and breath chemistry that humans cannot smell, according to researchers.
Junqueira presented her team's study this week at the annual American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Florida.
How did the program start using dogs to detect cancer? About five years ago, Junqueira founded BioScent K9, a nonprofit organization, that trained beagles to alert diabetic patients of an oncoming drop in blood sugar.
Soon after she started the organization, her father died after a late-stage cancer diagnosis. His death prompted Junqueira to begin researching cancer.
She found the Pine Street Foundation in San Anselmo, California, where researchers used dogs to identify lung and breast cancer using breath condensation and saliva.
Junqueira reached out to the foundation and the researchers shared their findings with her.
From there, she and her team started training a team of four beagles to identify the difference between blood serum samples of healthy patients and those with lung cancer.
Three of the dogs identified cancer with an accuracy of 96.7 percent, and they identified normal samples 97.5 percent of the time.
One of the pups, named Snuggles, was unmotivated to perform, Junqueira told Science Daily.
The inexpensive screening test has shown great promise for early cancer detection, according to the researchers.
""We had one patient where the dog identified the cancer, but doctors couldn't find it until 18 months later,"" Dr. Tom Quinn told Your Observer in an interview earlier this year. Quinn is a research professor at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Bradenton, Florida, who has partnered with BioScentDx.
Scientists are using the research to help them develop other diagnostic tools based on the biologic compounds detected by the dogs, she added.
""This work is very exciting because it paves the way for further research along two paths, both of which could lead to new cancer-detection tools,"" Junqueira said. ""One is using canine scent detection as a screening method for cancers, and the other would be to determine the biologic compounds the dogs detect and then design cancer-screening tests based on those compounds.""
Can anyone be tested? The company offers a mail-order cancer detection service that uses a person's breath.
Samples are collected by having the person breathe into a surgical mask for several minutes and sent to the company for testing.
It takes about four weeks to receive results from the $50 test.
The test cannot identify the location of the cancer. The company recommends sharing positive results with a physician.

British supermarket pulls chocolate ducklings from store inventory after complaints of racism,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chocolate-easter-ducklings-pulled-over-compaints-of-racism,"U.K. supermarket Waitrose has issued an apology after selling chocolate ducklings that many people said promoted racism.
What are the details? According to a Tuesday report by CNN International , the item in question featured three chocolate ducklings in milk, white, and dark chocolate varieties. The three ducklings were named, respectively, ""Crispy,"" ""Fluffy,"" and ""Ugly.""
One social media user pointed out the store's apparent gaffe, and wrote, ""Crispy, Fluffy and Ugly — trio of Easter ducklings at #waitrose. Ugly is the dark one on the right. Overheard women saying 'this is not right', I agree, doesn't look good at all. Thousands of other options... why #ugly ""
Another user wrote, ""Yeh, definitely a balance to be found with identity politics and colour blindness. Chocolate ducks seem silly but for me I feel showing 3 shades of light to dark where the dark is labeled ""ugly"" is a problem, no matter the object. I guess I just wanted people to understand why.""
What else? A spokesperson for the store told CNN International that they did not mean to cause offense in selling the Easter-themed item.
The statement read, ""We are very sorry for any upset caused by the name of this product, it was absolutely not our intention to cause any offence. We removed the product from sale several weeks ago while we changed the labeling and our ducklings are now back on sale.""
On Tuesday, the Daily Mail reported that the store did restock the items both online and in stores after changing the packaging and marketing. The new product simply reads ""Waitrose Trio of Easter ducklings,"" with no mention of ""Fluffy,"" ""Crispy,"" or ""Ugly.""
Though many people decried the advertising as racist, there were just as many people on social media — particularly Twitter — who insisted that the grocery chain did nothing more than cave to bullying, politically correct culture."
President Trump is reportedly considering scrapping a government agency - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-reportedly-considering-scrapping-a-government-agency,"President Donald Trump is expected to dissolve the Office of Personnel Management at some point during this summer, according to a report from the Washington Post .
What is the Office of Personnel Management? The Office of Personnel Management works as sort of a massive human resources agency for the federal government. According to its website , ""OPM directs human resources and employee management services, administers retirement benefits, manages healthcare and insurance programs, oversees merit-based and inclusive hiring into the civil service, and provides a secure employment process.""
In 2019, OPM had a self-declared total operating budget of $295,920,000 .
Trump only recently appointed a new head to the agency, nominating Dale Cabaniss of Virginia on March 4 .
What happened now? The Washington Post reported that Trump plans to break up the agency into three sections, which would be absorbed by the Defense Department, the General Services Administration, and the Office of Management and Budget. Initially, all employees would be reassigned to one of these different sections, rather than being laid off. However, the total number of employees would be slowly reduced by not replacing those who retire or who leave due to other reasons. Currently, the agency employs 5,565 people.
The acting head of the agency, Margaret Weichert, called the move ""a big, exemplary step,"" according to the Washington Post. She said that the agency was ""fundamentally not set up for success, structurally.""
Democrats like Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) spoke out strongly against this move, calling it executive overreach. However, as the Washington Post noted, both the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign had considered dissolving the agency.
But why? This could be a move to help shrink the overall size of the federal government. While Trump has spoken repeatedly about cutting federal spending, including asking members of his own cabinet in October to cut 5 percent of their budgets, spending has ballooned under his leadership.
Federal government spending during the last year was 13.7 percent higher than it was during former President Barack Obama's final year in office. The federal budget deficit, the amount the government spends beyond what it takes in, for the first six months of the year came to $693 billion, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates . It is expected to pass $1 trillion in 2020 .
The federal budget deficit differs from the national debt, which is made up of each yearly deficit combined with accruing interest. The budget deficit itself resets at the start of each fiscal year. The current national debt is in excess of $22 trillion ."
'It's not a baby': Student says a baby born alive after a botched abortion should not receive medical care - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/its-not-a-baby-student-says-a-baby-born-alive-after-a-botched-abortion-should-not-receive-medical-care,"During a recent event sponsored by Boston College's Pro-Life Club, a female student stood in front of a microphone and said a baby born alive during a botched abortion should not receive medical care — and, in fact, isn't a baby at all, LifeNews said .
Video of the exchange shows Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins asking the student if she believes that babies dying in immigration centers at the U.S.-Mexico border should be given medical treatment.
""Yes,"" the student answered.
With that Hawkins asked a second question: ""Do you believe that a baby who's born alive during an abortion at Planned Parenthood should get care?""
""No,"" the student replied.
Hawkins attempted to get a fuller explanation from the student, asking her if the U.S. should pay for the heath care of baby who's dying in her mother's arms when the mom crosses the border — and, again, the student said ""yes.""
Once again, Hawkins presented the abortion scenario, asking the student if an abortion doctor should provide health care to a baby born alive during a botched abortion — and, again, the student said ""no.""
""Why?"" Hawkins asked.
'They've already determined that it's not a baby' ""Because they're performing an abortion,"" the student responded. ""So ... they've already determined that it's not a baby."" She also added a mostly inaudible phrase with the word ""science"" in it.
Things grew more testy in the room at that point, and the student said such a botched abortion is rare — which Hawkins agreed with.
And then she asked the question again: ""So, do you think it's a baby?""
""No,"" the student replied.

California airport to open a Chick-fil-A — but city council isn’t happy: Make it the ‘gayest Chick-fil-A in the country’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/san-jose-airport-chick-fil-a,"Council members in San Jose, California, aren't happy that a Chick-fil-A is set to open at the Mineta San Jose International Airport in May.
The franchise's airport site approval went through in 2018 for a period of six years, but city council members are regretting the move.
Now the council is saying that they will not approve any extensions for the franchise, and the business will remain open only under a six-year operations deal.
What are the details? The planned opening of the restaurant has drawn protests and sparked outrage among city council members.
Taking their ire even further, the city council placed LGBTQ flags all around the airport in hopes of making it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country,"" according to one member, to rail against the company's supposed ""anti-LGBT stance.""
Ken Yeager, an openly gay former county supervisor, told the San Jose Spotlight that he was heartsick over the opening of the restaurant.
""My heart just sank when I saw the construction wall [at the airport],"" he said. ""I've been doing LGBTQ rights activities for 35 years. I remember when this city was not welcoming, and we've come a long way. I feel like this is a throwback to those times.""
Council member Pam Foley said that her brother died of AIDS more than two decades ago, and Chick-fil-A's presence personally affects her.
""When I hear of an injustice specifically to the LGBTQ community, I take it to heart,"" she explained. ""Going forward, I hope that we are very sensitive as it relates to all of our diverse populations.""
According to KTVU-TV , Yeager added, ""This is going to be people's first impression of San Jose and what are they going to see is a store that is known for its anti-gay attitudes.""
Council members also said that they rejected the business' extension bid because it would not open on Sundays, which is reportedly one of the airport's busiest travel days.
City Attorney Rick Doyle reportedly suggested that the council members not reject the company's bid on religious or political grounds — as it would possibly violate First Amendment rights — so the council reportedly rejected the extension bid based on the fact that the company is not open on Sundays.
What else? In March, San Antonio International Airport in Texas announced that Chick-fil-A would not be permitted to operate at the airport, nixing plans for a potential site.
The airport blamed the decision on the company's ""legacy of anti-LGBTQ"" behaviors.""
That same month, an airport in Buffalo, New York, made a similar announcement, blaming the decision on allegations that the business doesn't adhere to anti-discrimination policies."
Good Samaritan murdered at Waffle House shortly after paying for other customers' meals,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/good-samaritan-murdered-at-waffle-house-shortly-after-paying-for-other-customers-meals,"A good Samaritan was shot and killed after he handed out cash and paid for other people's meals at a Florida Waffle House over the weekend.
Ezekiel Luke Hicks, 25, is accused of killing Craig Arttez Brewer early Sunday morning at the Gainesville restaurant, according to the Alachua County Sheriff's Department news release.
The 41-year-old man died after being shot in the head, authorities said.
""There was at least one gunshot to the head but the medical examiner will offer authoritative information on that,"" Lt. Brett Rhodenizer said, the Gainesville Sun reported.
Police arrested Hicks shortly after the incident. He's been charged with first-degree murder.
What are the details? At about 3 a.m., Brewer was buying meals and passing out $20 bills to random customers inside the restaurant.
A woman became angry because Brewer had not paid for her meal or given her money, officials said. Her anger prompted Hicks to confront Brewer.
""The victim was engaging folks at the restaurant, and there was a disagreement with a female customer,"" Rhodenizer said.
Police initially received a call for assistance from employees who wanted help dispersing the large crowd that had gathered.
At some point during the argument, Hicks went outside briefly but returned with a gun. A bystander tried to stop Hicks from going back in the restaurant, police said.
""The evidence in the case is fairly straightforward. We're working with the state attorney. It's pretty obvious. We have on video what happened,"" Rhodenizer said, the newspaper reported.
The two men got into a physical fight shortly before Hicks pulled the gun from his pants and fired it at Brewer's head, according to the release.
Rhodenizer said the shooting likely occurred just before or as they were arriving.
Investigators recovered a 9 mm Glock handgun not far from the scene.
What else? Authorities are still working to determine whether or not Hicks and Brewer had a relationship prior to the fatal shooting.
""What we're trying to find out in the days ahead is if this was truly a verbal argument that turned into a murder case or if there is something missing there.""
The restaurant has reopened since the incident. Waffle House management declined the newspaper's request for comment."
MAGA hat-wearing suspect accused of slashing man's hand pleads not guilty; lawyer says he was unfairly targeted for hat,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/maga-hat-swordsman-pleads-not-guilty,"The lawyer for a suspect accused of using a sword to slash a man who knocked a ""Make America Great Again"" hat off the suspect's head said his client was unfairly targeted for wearing the hat, Bay City News Service reported .
The iconic red cap was the symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and has become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say the MAGA hat is synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .
Leor Bergland, 30, pleaded not guilty at his Tuesday morning arraignment to attempted murder, mayhem, and assault, the outlet added. He also was arrested in Multnomah County, Oregon, in 2012 during an unlawful entry incident in which he was accused of using a knife, the San Francisco Chronicle reported .
Image source: Multnomah County Sheriff
Police said a 27-year-old Berkeley man was standing near the Church of 8 Wheels roller skating rink in San Francisco on the night of March 29 when he saw Bergland wearing the MAGA hat and swatted it off his head, the Chronicle said — and that's when Bergland pulled out a sword and slashed the man's left hand.
Suspect's lawyer says there's more to the story But outside of court Tuesday, Bergland's attorney — Deputy Public Defender Steve Olmo — told Bay City News Service his client was ""minding his own business"" before the incident took place.
Olmo added to the outlet that the victim flipped off Bergland and also assaulted him with the hat prior to the slashing.
""I'm tired of this so-called liberal, political area having acts of violence against people who have different views. I don't agree with what Trump does, but look at what's happened over at [University of California, Berkeley] with conservative speakers speaking,"" Olmo added to Bay City News.
""This was all triggered because he was wearing a hat?"" he asked, the outlet said.
Olmo added, ""You have a right to be walking down the street with your views. ... It's outrageous, and I'm just tired of it in this area. I'm tired of people not allowing the expression of other people,"" the outlet reported.
Bay City News service said Bergland remains in custody with bail set at $250,000, citing jail records. The Chronicle reported that his bail was set at $1 million."
Attorney General William Barr tells Congress that 'spying' on Trump campaign 'did occur',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/attorney-general-barr-spying-on-trump-campaign-did-occur,"During a Senate hearing Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr said he believed ""spying"" by federal intelligence agencies on the Trump campaign "" did occur ."" Barr said he was interested in determining whether or not the surveillance was legally justified.
What did he say at the hearing? At a hearing before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) asked Barr about a team he had indicated the day before that he was putting together to investigate the FBI's handling of its Russia probe during the 2016 campaign, prior to the appointment of a special counsel. After President Donald Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey in 2017, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed special counsel Robert Mueller to head an independent investigation that would be separate "" from the normal chain of command .""
Barr responded that he planned on ""reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed against — at the Trump campaign during 2016."" He said he wanted to ""pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill, and in the department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed.""
Shaheen asked Barr why he thought this was necessary.
""Well, for the same reason we're worried about foreign influence in elections,"" he responded. ""We want to make sure that during elections — I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. It's a big deal. Generation I grew up in, which was the Vietnam War period, people were all concerned, you know, about spying on anti-war people and so forth, by the government. And there were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there's an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in ... political surveillance. I'm not suggesting that those rules were violated, but i think it's important to look at that. And I'm not just, I'm not talking about the FBI, necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly.""
""So you're not suggesting, though, that spying occurred?"" Shaheen asked.
""I think spying did occur. Yes, I think spying did occur,"" Barr said. ""But the question is whether it was predicated, adequately predicated — and I'm not suggesting it wasn't adequately predicated. But I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane, and I want to make sure that happened.""
He also said that this investigation was not targeting the FBI as a whole, and he didn't think any issues were ""endemic"" of the agency.
But what does this mean? It's not entirely clear what spying Barr is specifically referring to. Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz is currently investigating whether or not federal investigators abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, in order to get a warrant to investigate former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
Barr told a House Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday that he expected Horowitz's investigation to wrap up ""in May or June.""
Barr toned down his phrasing as the Senate hearing progressed.
Later in the hearing, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) asked Barr if he cared to rephrase his statement, noting, ""I think the word 'spying' could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out, and I think it's necessary for you to be precise with your language.""
Barr responded, ""I'm not sure of all the connotations of that word that you're referring to, but you know — unauthorized surveillance. I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance. Is that more appropriate in your mind?""
""This is your call,"" Schatz responded, adding that he just wanted to make sure that Barr had used the right words after so many hours of testimony.
Barr would later hedge somewhat, adding ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I am saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it. That's all."""
Conservatives secure majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/conservatives-secure-majority-on-wisconsins-supreme-court,"A conservative has won a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court on Wednesday when his opponent conceded defeat, guaranteeing a conservative majority for years to come.
What's the story? Thanks to Judge Brian Hagedorn's victory, conservatives will now have a 5-2 majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.
""Judge Hagedorn said that he was running to get partisan influences out of our courts,"" liberal judge Lisa Neubauer said in a statement conceding defeat. ""[A]nd I hope he lives up to his promise.""
Hagedorn won his election by 6,000 votes. This is a close enough margin to justify a recount, but Neubauer has decided not to pursue this option. Neubauer will remain on the Court of Appeals.
""I am deeply humbled and grateful that the people of Wisconsin have placed their trust in me,"" Hagedorn said in an email to supporters, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel . ""I said that partisan politics has no place at the Wisconsin Supreme Court, that I would protect the public, and that our job is to uphold the Constitution as written. I meant every word, and I will endeavor to fulfill these promises with all my ability.""
He will replace Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who was a liberal.
Wisconsin is largely considered to be a swing state in 2020. Trump won a surprising (and narrow) upset in the state in 2016, a state which Hillary Clinton had considered to be so much of a sure thing that she failed to campaign there. However, Republican Scott Walker lost the governorship in 2018 to Democrat Tony Evers.
Trump tweeted his congratulations to Hagedorn on April 5, but it would take another 5 days before Neubauer would concede defeat.
What else? Liberals had been hoping to upset the conservative majority on the court.
""It is absolutely critical we win this race,"" liberal attorney Tim Burns, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate himself, told The Associated Press in April. ""It does set us up for next year to get a court that's likely to look very differently on issues of the day like voters' rights and gerrymandering.""
After the election, liberal outlets were predictably disappointed. Slate noted that this conservative majority could not be undone until August 2023 at the earliest.
The far-left Daily Kos griped that this would contribute to a ""brazen, years-long plot"" of gerrymandering by Republicans ""to stymie the will of the majority of voters precisely because they know the judiciary won't check them."""
Comedian Chelsea Handler says her ‘white privilege’ made her act like a ‘spoiled brat’ after Trump’s 2016 election win,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chelsea-handler-says-white-privilege-made-her-acdt-like-spoiled-brat,"Comedian Chelsea Handler appeared on Tuesday's episode of ABC's ""The View"" and claimed that it was her ""white privilege"" that prompted her to act like a ""spoiled brat"" in the days following the 2016 election win of President Donald Trump.
What did she say? During her appearance, Handler, 44, said that her latest creative project — a documentary about white privilege — opened her eyes to her own behaviors.
""White people certainly don't want to talk about [race relations and white privilege],"" she said. ""So I figured, start with myself, so, you know, I can hang myself out to dry at my own privilege, at my own reaction to the presidency.""
""Like a spoiled brat, you know, the way that so many people were crying and screaming,"" Handler said of the early days of Trump derangement syndrome. ""It was like, 'Well, nothing in your life has ever gone that wrong before?' I really had to take a look and go, 'No.' Yes, my brother died — that was traumatic and awful. But I've never been hungry, I've never been starving, I've never been discriminated against that I knew about.
""I think it's important to have uncomfortable conversations about race because we have a big situation that's happening,"" she insisted. ""And I thought, like an idiot, Barack Obama being elected was the end of racial tension in this country, and that's not the case.""

What else? In a recent interview, Handler admitted that she had a breakdown in the days after Trump's election win, so she entered therapy.
During Friday's ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Handler told the show's namesake host that Trump's win sent her spiraling into a ""mid-life identity crisis.""
""I had a mid-life identity crisis once Trump won the election because I had never had my world feel so unhinged, I think,"" Handler explained. ""I had to pay a psychiatrist to listen to me b***h about Donald Trump for about the first three weeks.""
""For me, as I can imagine it must have been for so many people, it was a huge emotional trigger of everything being destabilized and I realized just how spoiled and privileged I had been all my life to realize to be this upset and this on-a-ten every day and the outrage and the anger, I just wanted to f***ing fight people, you know?"" she added. ""And I was like, 'I have to go see a psychiatrist.""

"Watch: In weirdly fascinating video, football-sized bugs devour dead alligator on the ocean floor",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-bugs-devour-alligator-ocean,"Scientists in Louisiana captured video of massive football-sized bugs devouring a dead alligator they placed on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year.
In February, scientists Craig McClain, Clifton Nunnally, and River Dixon dropped two alligators into the ocean in what they described as a ""first-ever experiment on reptile falls.""
The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium researchers wanted to grab a first-hand glimpse into deep-sea food webs and what might have occurred millions of years ago when now-extinct reptiles fell to the bottom of the ocean.
The state of Louisiana donated the ""humanely euthanized"" alligators in the study, the researchers said.
What happened? The reptiles were weighted and taken ""tens of miles"" off the coast of Louisiana where they were dropped into the ocean where they sunk about 1 1/4 miles down, according to the video.
Within 24 hours, ""giant deep-sea isopods"" about the size of footballs started eating the alligator.
The isopods are related to roly-polies or pill bugs that are found on land.
""They're scavengers that eat dead animals,"" one of the researchers said in the video.
The pinkish colored isopods crawled over and inside the dead carcass while gorging themselves throughout the 6-minute video. They ate so quickly that they appeared to become ""immobile or stupefied,"" the researchers noted.
One of the most surprising findings was how easily the isopods were able to eat through the tough hide of the dead alligator.
""Obviously, their pinching and crushing mandibles made easy work of the hide,"" the researcher said in the video.
These types of incidents are described as ""food falls"" and scientists believe alligators and crocodiles may be the last food source for some invertebrates that lived millions of years ago.
""Indeed, alligator and crocodile food falls may be the last remaining refuge of specialized invertebrates that were also in ancient oceans,"" according to the video.

What else?
Alligator falls could be common in the ocean, according to the video. Hurricanes and other tropical storms are believed to carry the reptiles out to sea.
The scientists are planning to return to the site in a couple of months to see what other species the dead alligator might have attracted."

A 78-year-old Chicago homeowner told WBBM-TV three men posed as repairmen and asked if they could fix his concrete steps and walkway Monday afternoon, repeatedly asking the homeowner to let them inside to get water.
""The first time he came was afternoon, about 4:30, 5 o'clock, and he said, 'I want to fix your cement, but I've got to get in the house to get water,'"" the homeowner told the station, which did not identify him. ""When I heard that, I said no. He wants to get in the house to get at me, you know, attack me, and I said, 'I don't want nobody in the house.'""

But it appears the trio came back that evening — and this time they weren't asking for permission to come inside.
The homeowner told WBBM he saw three men — the same ones, he believes — using a crowbar to get inside his home.
""I was in fear for my life,"" the homeowner told the station.
Something with a little more power than a crowbar
When the homeowner opened his door after hearing a noise, one of the men trying to break in raised the crowbar to smash the glass, WBBM said.
So the homeowner shot one of the men through the storm door, the station said, and police added that he limped away from the house.

""He should have never came back,"" the homeowner added to WBBM.
The other two men got away in a red Dodge Caravan, police told the station.
'It's you or him' ""That was a tough decision,"" the homeowner told WBBM. ""It's not like going hunting. It's hard to shoot a human and not think about it. It's going to stay with me the rest of my life, what happened. You hate to do something like that, but like the police said, it's you or him. I didn't feel good doing that, but he would have gotten me with that crowbar. If I get hit with something like a baseball bat or a crowbar, you ain't gonna make it.""
Does the homeowner think the three men — particularly the one who got shot — will return at some point?
""I doubt it,"" he added to the station. ""Not when he knows that he's got trouble on his hands, too.""
Police told WBBM the homeowner has a valid Firearm Owner's Identification card.
No one was in custody as of Tuesday morning, the station noted, but detectives were investigating.

In the video, Jessy Taylor of Tampa, Florida, yells at, cries to, and warns her followers against reporting her account. Taylor says her previous account — which had over 100,000 followers — was deleted after people allegedly reported the account for being spam.
What's going on in the video? In the video, which she shared on YouTube, Taylor — who now apparently lives in Los Angeles just to be an Instagram star — can be seen sobbing openly at the prospect at having to perform like a normal adult in the real workforce. She adds that her biggest fear is that she'll end up a drug-addicted prostitute living on the streets if she can't be an internet star.
""I'm nothing without my following,"" she cries. ""I am nothing without my following.""
Taylor, who apparently went to college and previously worked at McDonald's, says she's in debt and has no skills.
""I want to say to everybody that's been reporting me, think twice, because you're ruining my life, because I make all of my money online — all of it! — and I don't want to lose that,"" she wept.
""The people who work 9-5 — that is not me, I am in L.A. to not be like that,"" she insisted.
Taylor, who admitted to being a former sex worker, said that she simply couldn't go back to that life.
""I was a f***ing prostitute,"" she admitted. ""I used to strip every single day. I don't even do that s**t anymore because I make all my money online. I don't want to go back to that life.""
She continued, lamenting her time as a former McDonald's worker.
""I used to work at McDonald's before I did YouTube, Instagram, before I had 100,000 followers!"" she cried. ""Before I had everything in my life I was a f***ing loser!""
She concluded her video with a plea. Or a demand. Or something.
""I'm not work material! I will never be work material! So stop f***ing reporting me on motherf***ing Instagram!"" she warned. ""The last thing I want to do be is a homeless prostitute in the f***ing street doing meth. That is the last thing I f***ing want to do so stop f***ing trying to ruin my life!""
According to the Daily Mail , Taylor's other social accounts — Twitter, Facebook — have between 3,000 and 4,000 followers a piece.

"Nobody believed a boy's story about his parents until he grew up, bought his family's old house, and found his mom's body. Now his dad is on trial for murder.",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boy-said-dad-shot-mom-finds-body-years-later,"In a tragic twist, a man found his own mother's body in the backyard of his childhood home, reopening an investigation into whether his father had murdered her more than two decades earlier.
Wait, what happened? In January 1993, Bonnie Haim went missing from her home in Jacksonville, Florida. Her 3-year-old son, Aaron, kept telling police ""Daddy hurt Mommy"" and ""Daddy shot Mommy,"" but since he was so young his testimony was dismissed. He told investigators at the time that his grandparents thought he had been ""brainwashed"" and wasn't telling the truth. He had reportedly added details that were provably false, leading investigators to dismiss his entire testimony.
His mother had reportedly been having marital issues and was planning on leaving Aaron's father, Michael Haim. She even had a secret bank account that Michael Haim had recently discovered before her disappearance.
Michael couldn't be tied to Bonnie's murder, although police considered him to be a suspect. He insisted that his wife had abandoned him and Aaron, and that he had tried to look for her but could not find her.
Aaron was adopted by another family and now has the last name Fraser.
Fast forward to 2014 In 2014, Aaron, now an adult, bought the house he had lived in as a child. But when he was renovating the backyard, he made a grisly discovery.
According to a 2016 story from WJXT-TV , Fraser was digging in his newly purchased backyard when he found a bag containing what he at first thought was a coconut buried about six inches under a concrete slab.
""I ripped the bag. And I was ... like, 'Why would someone bury a coconut in a bag?' It looked like a coconut shell,"" he told WJXT.
But he soon realized that it was something quite different.
""You could actually see, like, the top of the eye socket,"" he said. ""And it was like this part of the head, the top half of the head. I set it back in the hole.""
Fraser quickly alerted authorities. The remains were positively identified as belonging to his mother, and a year later, his father was charged with her murder. In addition to Bonnie Haim's body, investigators found a spent shell casing that matched a rifle owned by her husband.
Opening statements in Michael Haim's murder trial were on Tuesday ."
Flight shaming over climate change has some Swedes opting to travel by rail,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/flight-shaming-sweden-rail-travel,"There's a new buzzword in Sweden that's causing a growing number of Swedes to opt out of air travel, Agence France-Presse reported.
""Flygskam,"" which means ""flight shame"" in English, has helped push a trend that has many young Swedes choosing trains over planes citing guilt over climate effects caused by jets.
Those who've joined the #stayontheground effort to save the planet include TV personalities such as skiing commentator Björn Ferry, along with film industry workers who've called for producers to limit projects abroad.
Air travel has reportedly soared by 61 percent among Swedes over the past three decades with the increase in low-cost airlines, according to researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.
Last year, the scientists' study found per capita emissions among Swedes were five times the global average between 1990 to 2017.
What do travelers say? Viktoria Hellstrom told AFP that the movement has affected how she travels.
""I'm certainly affected by my surroundings and [flight shame] has affected how I view flying,"" Hellstrom, a political science student in Stockholm, told AFP.
Last summer, the 27-year-old Hellstrom traveled by rail to meet her friends in Italy who had flown to their destination.
""The only way I could justify going there was if I took the train,"" she said, adding that it would have been her second flight in only a few weeks.
The trend appears to be most common among women and younger travelers, according to the World Wildlife Foundation, AFP reported.
The conservation website's survey last month showed that about 20 percent of Swedes had chosen train travel over air travel to minimize their impact on the environment.
Has train travel increased? Government-owned railway service SJ reported a 21 percent spike among business travelers over the winter.
What other factors could play a role in Sweden's travel trend? Some experts believe that while some Swedes might be motivated to take take a train because of flight shaming, there are a number of other factors that could also play a role in the decision.
Swedish psychologist Frida Hylander told AFP that last year's massive wildfires may have sparked environmental concerns among some.
Last May, the regional airline NextJet went bankrupt and canceled its operations meaning there were fewer domestic routes for Swedes.
And a year ago, a new flight tax was also introduced.
""You should exercise caution when pointing to one single factor,"" Hylander told AFP."
College students are told 18 states offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants. Check out how they react.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-students-are-told-18-states-offer-in-state-tuition-to-illegal-immigrants-check-out-how-they-react,"At least 18 states offer in-state tuition for illegal immigrant students, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Sixteen of them — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington — do so through state legislation, the conference website says.
Two others — Oklahoma and Rhode Island — offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrant students through Board of Regents decisions, the NCSL site indicates.
Armed with those facts, Campus Reform 's Cabot Phillips recently teamed up with itsmikeaye_ to ask University of Nevada, Las Vegas, students their opinions concerning illegal immigrant students getting in-state tuition.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
The reactions were unanimous: Not cool. Here's a bit of what the UNLV students had to say:
""Why do they get to pay less when I've got to pay more?"" ""That's disappointing ... because I did quite a bit to earn my college."" ""What do you get for like living here all your life legally instead of like coming here illegally? I dunno. I just don't think that's fair."" ""I pay my taxes, I pay my fair share ... and someone who comes here illegally ... that doesn't seem fair."" Image source: YouTube screenshot
What's more, several students said they expressly avoided certain colleges because they would've been on the hook for far more expensive out-of-state tuition — which didn't sit well with them, given illegal immigrants might get to pay in-state tuition at some of those schools.
Check out the interviews:
Other schools, states The National Conference of State Legislatures' website adds that the University of Hawaii's Board of Regents and the University of Michigan's Board of Regents in 2013 adopted policies to allow illegal immigrant students to access in-state tuition. In addition, Virginia's attorney general in April 2014 began allowing in-state tuition for those covered under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the site also notes.
But three states — Arizona, Georgia, and Indiana — specifically prohibit in-state tuition for illegal immigrant students, the NCSL site says, while Alabama and South Carolina prohibit illegal immigrant students from enrolling at public postsecondary schools."
WATCH: Two thugs attack security guard outside Chicago McDonald's. What happened next sent the video viral.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mcdonalds-assault-security-guard-gun,"Dramatic new video generating buzz online shows two men assaulting a security guard outside a McDonald's in Chicago. What that security guard did just moments into the attack has sent the footage viral.
What happened? The video shows two men approach the security guard outside a McDonald's in downtown Chicago. The men slam the security guard against a wall and begin striking him.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
About six seconds into the attack, as the two men continue to pummel the victim, the security guard reaches toward his waistband. As the fight moves out of frame, one of the assailants suddenly starts running away from the fight.
Suddenly, people inside the restaurant begin screaming, ""No! No!""
The reason for the screams? The security guard was armed — and turned the tables by pulling his concealed firearm.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
Fortunately, the security guard exercised self-discipline and did not open fire on his attackers. Pointing the firearm at the attackers was enough to stop the attack and deescalate the tense situation.
The footage ends as the attackers simply walk away from the scene.

What are the details?
According to WMAQ-TV, the incident took place on Saturday.
CWBChicago, which reported on the incident Tuesday , has more details:
Chicago police this afternoon offered new information about the incident: The security guard, a suburban policeman, was on-duty for the McDonald's restaurant Saturday afternoon. He was leading the two men out of the restaurant when one of them struck the guard on the head with a glass bottle, police said. A struggle ensued and was captured on video.
A CPD spokesperson on Monday said the department did not have a report about the incident on file. Today, however, Chicago police said officers were called to the scene, but the two offenders were gone by the time cops arrived. The security guard was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. According to WBBM-TV , the McDonald's where the incident occurred has an unfortunate reputation for being fraught with crime. In fact, Chicago police have been dispatched to the restaurant 35 times in the last month for 23 disturbances, nine batteries, and three assaults.
""The safety and security of our employees and customers is our top priority. We are disturbed by this situation and will continue to take appropriate measures to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for our customers,"" the franchise owner of the McDonald's, Nick Karavites, told Chicago media."
Hundreds of Hondurans form new caravan headed to the US,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hundreds-of-hondurans-form-new-caravan-headed-to-the-us,"Nearly 1,000 Central Americans gathered Tuesday night in northern Honduras where they formed a new caravan with hopes of traveling to the United States, France 24 reported.
""There are more than 800, almost a thousand,"" a police official told Agence France-Presse. The Red Cross reported the same number, according to France 24.
The group, prompted by a social media call, gathered in the northern Honduras town of San Pedro Sula near the border of Guatemala to begin their long journey en masse.
The large number reportedly caught authorities off guard since similar calls in recent months had gone mostly ignored.
The asylum-seekers cite widespread violence, drug traffickers, and poverty as reasons for fleeing their country where political corruption has caused instability.
""We are done with this government,"" Alex Perez said. ""There is no work.""
Are there children among the group? There were single travelers, along with a number of migrants who appeared to be traveling as family units with children, according to France 24.
Many of the migrants packed into minibuses and started on their journeys.
The influx of adults traveling with children has exhausted U.S. agencies' resources and has placed serious strains on local organizations trying to help feed and care for the migrants.
""The numbers are overwhelming right now,"" Gregory Archambault , ICE director of enforcement and removal operations in San Diego, said last week. ""Everybody is stressed. The agency is stressed, the [local governments] are stressed, the law enforcement agencies. Everybody is stressed because there are these mass numbers of people.""Thousands of Central American caravans have traveled to the U.S. in similar convoys since October.
What else? President Donald Trump recently threatened to close the southern border to try to stop the migrants from coming into the U.S.
A record number of more than 100,000 immigrants crossed the U.S. border last month. More than 55,000 of those apprehended in March arrived in the U.S. as family units, which must be handled differently than adults traveling on their own.
Overwhelmed agency officials are forced to release illegal immigrants who are caught crossing the border."
Karen Pence reacts to Democrat Pete Buttigieg's targeting of her husband,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/karen-pence-responds-to-buttigieg-comments-about-vice-president,"Second lady Karen Pence laughed off an attack on her husband, Vice President Mike Pence, on Tuesday, responding to comments aimed at him by Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg.
What are the details? Buttigieg — the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has had a long working relationship with the vice president — hit out at Mike Pence over the weekend, accusing him of having ""a problem"" with the mayor's homosexuality.
On Tuesday, Fox News radio host Brian Kilmeade asked Karen Pence if she was surprised by Buttigieg's apparent unprovoked targeting of her husband, during an interview to promote her and her daughter's book, ""Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President.""
Karen Pence noted that Buttigieg and her husband ""have always had a great relationship,"" and circled back to her book, saying, ""In our country, we need to understand: You shouldn't be attacked for what your religious beliefs are.""
Kilmeade then played an excerpt from Buttigieg's speech directed at her husband, to which Karen Pence laughed.
""Well, it's kind of funny, because I don't think the vice president does have a problem with him,"" she said. ""But I think it's helping Pete to get some notoriety by saying that about the vice president.""
The Fox News host followed up by playing Mike Pence's comments about Buttigieg after the mayor came out of the closet in 2015: ""I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard, and we have a great working relationship, and I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot.""
Karen Pence reacted with laughter again, saying, ""Well, I'm just like, 'Pete, did ya not like that?' I mean, because that's what the vice president said about him, so what's the problem with that?""
Anything else? While the vice president has not made a public statement regarding Buttigieg's recent comments, CNN characterized the dust-up as an escalating ""feud,"" saying, ""Buttigieg appeared to respond to the pushback from Pence's orbit"" when he tweeted Tuesday, ""People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms. Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square."""
Top Democratic senator shocks with comments during Senate hearing on bill that protects unborn children,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/maize-hirono-oppose-pro-life-bill-protect-here-already,"Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) is one of the most outspoken pro-abortion lawmakers in Congress, even leading the charge against Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination because she feared he might overturn Roe v. Wade.
On Tuesday, Hirono continued her stalwart defense of abortion, condemning legislative efforts that focus on extending protections for unborn children.
What happened? During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Hirono suggested efforts be spent on children ""here already,"" rather than the millions who die from abortion each year.
""The word hypocritical doesn't even begin to cover what is happening to women and children across our country,"" Hirono said.
""I hope supporters of the bills that we're talking about today, both in the states and in Congress, turn their efforts to improving the lives of the children who are very much here already and who are so poorly served by the Trump administration and its policies,"" she added.
Hirono At Hearing On Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: Should Focus On People “Here Already"" www.youtube.com
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which is also known as ""Micah's law,"" bans abortions after 20 weeks on the scientific basis that unborn children feel pain by 20 weeks gestation.
The House has passed the bill during the last three sessions of Congress, but the Senate has yet to approve it.
Hirono also spoke out against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act , which Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) introduced in January in response to Virginia Gov. Ralpn Northam (D) seemingly endorsing infanticide during a radio interview that later went viral.
This writer's perspective Hirono, like many outspoken critics of the pro-life movement, often points out the ""hypocrisy"" of pro-lifers, namely that they allegedly only care about unborn children, but are indifferent once those children are born.
In many instances, this criticism is not unfair — perhaps even true. Pro-life means advocating for life on all fronts, including those that are not politically expedient or comfortable, and the pro-life movement has often failed in this regard (Hello criminal justice reform).
However, the idea that we cannot legislatively extend protections for unborn children because pro-life advocates are often hypocrites does not only fail the constitutional purpose of our government (to protect life) — it's pure evil."
Washington Post asks federal court to throw out a Covington Catholic student's defamation lawsuit,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/washington-post-wants-court-to-throw-out-covington-student-lawsuit,"The Washington Post is trying to get a defamation lawsuit filed against it by one of the Covington Catholic High School students dismissed.
Remind me, what happened again? During the annual March for Life on Jan. 18 in Washington, D.C., a video clip emerged that seemed to show a Kentucky high school student, Nicholas Sandmann, in a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat smugly grinning in the face of a Native American activist. The video clip generated outrage and led to calls for Covington Catholic High School to punish the student. Both CNN and the Washington Post reported extensively on this initial video.
Later, further videos emerged showing the Native American man walking into the group of students, rather than the students confronting him.
After these later videos emerged, Sandmann sued the Washington Post for $250 million in damages. Soon afterward, his attorneys announced a second lawsuit , this one against CNN for $275 million in damages. The lawsuit alleges that the reporting by these outlets did ""permanent harm"" to Sandmann's reputation, and that he now has to ""live his life in a constant state of concern over his safety.""
According to the Post , Sandmann's ""$250 million figure for damages was arrived at because that is the sum that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos paid for The Post in 2013.""
What happened now?
On Tuesday, the Post asked a federal court to throw out the lawsuit. According to a story on this update by the Post , the paper ""asserts its stories were accurate and did not impugn the reputation of Covington (Ky.) Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann, who entered a social media storm through video footage shot during a chaotic afternoon.""
The Post said in its motion to dismiss that the initial articles on the incident ""may not have been flattering of the Covington Catholic Students ... but they do not give rise to a defamation claim by Sandmann."" The motion also says that ""the Post's overall coverage — including the articles that the Complaint fails to mention — was not only accurate; it was ultimately favorable to him [Sandmann].""
When it comes to public figures like the president or a member of Congress, it's almost impossible to successfully sue a news publication for libel. Sandmann will have a greater chance of successfully proving a libel case since he is not a public figure, although it is unclear if he will be able to convince a jury that he deserves the more than half-a-billion dollars he's seeking from the Post and CNN."

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) got back a scorching response from her House colleague Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) over her comments about the 9/11 terror attacks.
Omar has been criticized over resurfaced comments she made dismissing the horrendous 9/11 terror attacks against the U.S.
She singled out Crenshaw and Fox News' Brian Kilmeade as examples of what she said was incitement to violence against her.
""This is dangerous incitement, given the death threats I face,"" Omar tweeted. ""I hope leaders of both parties will join me in condemning it.""
""My love and commitment to our country and that of my colleagues should never be in question,"" she added. ""We are ALL Americans!""
She was referring to a New York man who was arrested for making an alarming death threat against her on a phone message. He was identified as a supporter of President Donald Trump.
But Crenshaw called her out for conflating the accusations from the Fox News host with his much more measured response.
Crenshaw pointed out that he never called Omar ""un-American,"" and that he did not incite violence against her.
""You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something,'"" he added.
""It's still unbelievable, as is your response here,"" he concluded.
The comments from Omar were made in March at an event for CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, in Los Angeles.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" she said.

What's the background? In 2009, a 16-year-old named Derrion Albert was killed when he got caught up in a gang fight on the way home from school.
Four teenagers were charged with the murder. Three of them were convicted and are still in prison. One of them, however, was only 14. His circumstance was a bit different.
Foxx, who at the time was the assistant state's attorney, opted to charge him as a juvenile in an Extended Juvenile Jurisdiction prosecution.
Under the EJJ prosecution, the 14-year-old, Dionte Johnson, would serve a shorter sentence in juvenile detention, and would only serve the full 30-year sentence for his role in the murder if he was convicted of another felony after being released.
Well, in 2015 Johnson was convicted of aggravated fleeing after being involved in a police chase. Although that should've triggered Johnson's 30-year sentence, newly elected State's Attorney Foxx told Derrion Albert's family that their son's killer was only getting probation.
How did the family react? ""I felt like [Foxx] sat in our face, she cried with us, she hugged us and then you turn around and let this murderer, I don't care how old he is, he was convicted of first degree murder,"" said Albert's mother, Anjanette. ""My son is not here anymore and she gave us all this hope and she promised us that this was going to be OK. And it didn't turn out like that.""
""I don't have anything to say to Kim Foxx,"" Albert continued. ""The person that I thought that she was, her heart, her kindness the way she was with us in court, that's, I don't never want to see her again. Never.""
What does Foxx have to say about it? Foxx's office sent the following statement to WLS: ""Based on the Class 4 Felony, which carries a sentencing range of probation or up to three years in prison, it was not in the interest of justice to pursue a 30 year prison sentence in this case."""
Conservatives secure majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/conservatives-secure-majority-on-wisconsins-supreme-court?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily-Newsletter__PM-Final%202019-04-10&utm_term=TheBlaze%20Daily%20PM%20-%20last%20270%20days,"A conservative has won a seat on Wisconsin's Supreme Court on Wednesday when his opponent conceded defeat, guaranteeing a conservative majority for years to come.
What's the story? Thanks to Judge Brian Hagedorn's victory, conservatives will now have a 5-2 majority on Wisconsin's Supreme Court.
""Judge Hagedorn said that he was running to get partisan influences out of our courts,"" liberal judge Lisa Neubauer said in a statement conceding defeat. ""[A]nd I hope he lives up to his promise.""
Hagedorn won his election by 6,000 votes. This is a close enough margin to justify a recount, but Neubauer has decided not to pursue this option. Neubauer will remain on the Court of Appeals.
""I am deeply humbled and grateful that the people of Wisconsin have placed their trust in me,"" Hagedorn said in an email to supporters, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel . ""I said that partisan politics has no place at the Wisconsin Supreme Court, that I would protect the public, and that our job is to uphold the Constitution as written. I meant every word, and I will endeavor to fulfill these promises with all my ability.""
He will replace Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who was a liberal.
Wisconsin is largely considered to be a swing state in 2020. Trump won a surprising (and narrow) upset in the state in 2016, a state which Hillary Clinton had considered to be so much of a sure thing that she failed to campaign there. However, Republican Scott Walker lost the governorship in 2018 to Democrat Tony Evers.
Trump tweeted his congratulations to Hagedorn on April 5, but it would take another 5 days before Neubauer would concede defeat.
What else? Liberals had been hoping to upset the conservative majority on the court.
""It is absolutely critical we win this race,"" liberal attorney Tim Burns, a former Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate himself, told The Associated Press in April. ""It does set us up for next year to get a court that's likely to look very differently on issues of the day like voters' rights and gerrymandering.""
After the election, liberal outlets were predictably disappointed. Slate noted that this conservative majority could not be undone until August 2023 at the earliest.
The far-left Daily Kos griped that this would contribute to a ""brazen, years-long plot"" of gerrymandering by Republicans ""to stymie the will of the majority of voters precisely because they know the judiciary won't check them."""
Here's how an airline CEO responded when a 'mortified' flight attendant spilled a tray of drinks on him - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/airlines-ceo,"Maddie Peters said she had never spilled a drink on a passenger in her four years of working as a stewardess for American Airlines.
That's why she was ""mortified"" when a passenger bumped her and made her spill an entire tray on another passenger.
But that got even worse after she realized who the passenger was — the CEO of American Airlines.
Peters posted the story of her little accident on her Instagram account. She says that the crew was tipped off about CEO Doug Parker being on board the flight from Phoenix to Dallas.
""We knew he was going to be on board and had to be on our best behavior,"" Peters said to NBC News.
She said she dropped the tray and the drinks splashed on Parker and on herself.
""I wanted to drop dead right there,"" she said in the Instagram post.
Parker laughed off the accident, and she says that he went to the galley to reassure her that everything was all right.
She says that she asked him if she was fired.
""Of course not!"" he responded.

A former Obama aide will reportedly be charged as a result of Mueller investigation findings,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-former-obama-aide-will-reportedly-be-charged-as-a-result-of-mueller-investigation-findings,"Former President Barack Obama's first White House counsel expects to be charged in connection with alleged crimes uncovered during special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, according to The Washington Post .
Former Obama aide Gregory Craig was interviewed twice by Mueller's office as a part of Mueller's investigation into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.
Why would he be charged? Craig, who was Obama's White House counsel from 2009 until 2010, went on to work for the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.
The firm was hired by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's Justice Ministry in 2012. Skadden produced a report on the prosecution and imprisonment of one of Yanukovych's political rivals, Yulia ­Tymoshenko. That imprisonment was widely condemned in the west, and some human rights advocates accused Skadden of whitewashing what actually happened.
Craig, as a part of his work for Skadden, had numerous contacts with U.S. reporters to discuss the report, which had been disseminated by Paul Manafort, among others, to help Ukraine's image.
The Justice Department investigated whether Craig should've registered as a foreign lobbyist for his work on behalf of Ukraine. Craig's lawyers believe he will soon be charged for providing false statements to the Justice Department about his activities.
Skadden already paid a $4.6 million settlement to the Justice Department in January after admitting to misleading the government about its Ukrainian work and specifically blaming Craig for the false info.
What does Craig have to say? Craig hasn't addressed this publicly yet, but his legal representatives issued a statement in advance of the expected charges, according to The Wall Street Journal .
""This case was thoroughly investigated by the SDNY and that office decided not to pursue charges against Mr. Craig. We expect an indictment by the DC US Attorney's Office at the request of the National Security Division. Mr. Craig is not guilty of any charge and the government's stubborn insistence on prosecuting Mr. Craig is a misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion,"" lawyers for Mr. Craig said in a statement.

Treasury Secretary Mnuchin responds to House demand for President Trump's taxes — and Democrats are angry,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mnuchin-responds-to-trump-tax-demand,"Steve Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury Department, responded to a request from House Democrats to hand over the tax filings from President Donald Trump on Wednesday just ahead of their deadline.
Mnuchin said in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee that he would not meet their deadline to hand over the tax returns, which was midnight on Wednesday evening.
""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" Mnuchin said in the letter.
""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information,"" he added, ""regardless of which party is in power.""
Mnuchin indicated that he would consult with the Department of Justice on how to move forward on the request from the committee.
Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) responded by tweeting that Mnuchin was violating the law by refusing the request.
""The law is clear,"" Cicilline responded. ""Title 26, Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code.""
""The Ways and Means Committee can compel the production of [President Trump]'s tax returns,"" he added. ""Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is now violating the law to protect [President Trump].""
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said that Mnuchin had responded in a contradictory manner about whether the House had the right to request the tax returns from the U.S. Treasury.
""He has been contradictory in how he talked about whether or not he was going to follow the law and release those tax returns as the law mandates that he do and so we need to do our oversight,"" Waters said .
According to a Quinnipiac University poll, 64 percent of Americans said that the president should release his tax returns while 29 percent said he shouldn't do so.

Democrats were scheduled to vote to defeat a request from President Donald Trump to raise spending for the Department of Defense on Wednesday, but that vote has been canceled.
Progressive Democrats refused to join centrists to pass the rebuke against the president, according to the Washington Times.
Ranking Budget Committee Republican Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas mocked the Democrats for their failure.
""House Democrats had to throw in the towel on a bill that addresses only a small part of the budget,"" Womack said. ""The result is another embarrassing failure to govern.""
Progressive Democrats wanted an amendment to increase spending by $67 billion over two years, and they threatened to defeat the leadership budget bill without the amendment.
""Progressives will continue to seek equality in outlays between excessive Pentagon spending and critical domestic priorities and end decades of harmful austerity imposed on our communities,"" said Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).
""This is not an outcome,"" said Pelosi of her defeat. ""This is a process.""
Pelosi also notably ridiculed one of the leaders of the progressive faction, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) when asked how she was going to keep the Democratic Party from fracturing.
""While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers,"" Pelosi said dismissively, ""what's important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House.""
Those votes failed to coalesce for the leadership budget effort.

Texas state rep submits bill that would make abortion a homicide,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-state-rep-submits-bill-that-would-make-abortion-a-homicide,"A Texas state representative reintroduced a bill that would make abortion a homicide, sparking intense debate in the Texas state Legislature this week, according to The Washington Post .
Whose bill is it? The bill was authored by state Rep. Tony Tinderholt (R). He first introduced the bill during the 2017 legislative session. The Texas Legislature only convenes every two years. In 2017, Tinderholt received so many threats over the bill that he was placed under state protection.
What's in the bill? The bill seeks to amend Texas law to include abortion in the definition of criminal homicide. The way the penal code is currently written, abortion is explicitly excluded from the definition of homicide.
The bill, seemingly acknowledging the legal challenges it would face even if passed due to its conflict with Roe v. Wade, calls for its enforcement ""regardless of any contrary federal law, executive order, or court decision.""
Why did he submit this bill? Here's what Tinderholt said in 2017 when he first introduced the bill, according to the Texas Observer:
""Right now, it's real easy. Right now, they don't make it important to be personally responsible because they know that they have a backup of 'oh, I can just go get an abortion.' Now, we both know that consenting adults don't always think smartly sometimes. But consenting adults need to also consider the repercussions of the sexual relationship that they're gonna have, which is a child."" Tinderholt also said his goal is simply to ""equalize"" the law, pointing out that people who kill pregnant women are charged twice.
What are opponents saying? ""I'm trying to reconcile in my head the arguments that I heard tonight about how essentially one is okay with subjecting a woman to the death penalty for the exact — to do to her the exact same thing that one is alleging she is doing to a child,"" said state Rep. Victoria Neave (D).
What's next? The bill is a longshot to pass, but that it has gotten a hearing in committee is already further than it got in 2017. The bill is still pending in the Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence.

Twitter's claims to Congress for why it suspended account of pro-life movie 'Unplanned' on opening weekend raise more questions,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-testifies-about-unplanned-suspension,"Comments from a Twitter representative uttered on Wednesday during a congressional hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution are sparking new questions about how and why the social media giant recently suspended the account of pro-life film “Unplanned.
Filmmaker Chuck Konzelman — writer and director of ""Unplanned,"" a film about Planned Parenthood clinic director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson — is slated to appear before Congress as well later Wednesday to tell the same subcommittee how his film has faced intense bias and social media roadblocks since its release last month.
""From the outset, making a pro-life film in a pro-choice town, we knew we would face a number of challenges,"" Konzelman said in prepared testimony, noting that the film received an R rating, was denied advertising from select cable networks, and faced an uphill battle on social media.
(Read also: Ex-Planned Parenthood Director on the Moment She Fled Her Clinic )
He went on in the prepared text to explain the most well-publicized roadblock: Twitter briefly suspending the @ UnplannedMovie account on its platform during the movie's release weekend.
""In the early morning hours of Saturday, March 30th, the film's Twitter account — technically the account owned by the film's single purpose marketing entity — was suspended,"" Konzelman said. ""The reason for the suspension has not — to the best of my knowledge — been made clear, beyond being 'accidental.'""
He went on to decry the timing of the suspension — a suspension that came seven months after the account was first created in August 2018 — as ""suspect.""
""Roughly three hours after the suspension, service was restored, although it's also my understanding that our posting of a Twitter announcement with words to the effect of 'We're back' was deleted from the account, without explanation,"" Konzelman stated.
Carlos Monje Jr., director of public policy and philanthropy for Twitter, addressed the suspension during earlier appearance at the hearing, alluding to the notion that it was based, in part, on an automation issue.
""In the recent instance regarding the account @UnplannedMovie, the account was caught in our automated systems used to detect ban evasion,"" Monje said. ""Ban evasion occurs when an individual registers for a new account despite having been suspended previously for breaking our rules.""
He said the account was restored ""as soon as it was brought to our attention that the new account was not intended for similar violative activity.""
(Read also: Abby Johnson Reveals Shocking Impact of 'Unplanned' )
This explanation raised a number of important questions. Among them:
● Regardless of ban evasion, why was the account suddenly suspended more than seven months after its creation?
● Why did this happen during the film's theater release weekend?
And the questions don't end there. Pure Flix Insider spoke with the person who created the account, and he stated that he had never been suspended in the past for violating Twitter's terms. Furthermore, he said he registered the @UnplannedMovie account with a new email address that had not previously been used for account creation.
The suspension, alone, wasn't the only issue, though, as Konzelman said that the majority of @UnplannedMovie's followers were seemingly ""deleted"" from the account during the hours after the suspension, with the total follower count appearing to be fewer than 200 when it had really amassed more than 200,000 followers leading up to that point.
(Read also: Inspired by 'Unplanned'? 5 Pro-Life Movies You Can Watch Now )
This came along with reports from other Twitter users who had followed the account, but suddenly discovered that they were no longer following.
The @UnplannedMovie account was later returned to normal, but both the suspension and follower count issue caused a great deal of confusion and fueled claims that the film was being unfairly targeted.
Monje addressed this issue as well, telling Congress that Twitter was not hiding follower accounts or disallowing people from following. Instead, he said the number discrepancies were related to the reinstatement of the account after the suspension.
""If users searched for and followed the account during this time, it appeared as if the account was unfollowed,"" he said. ""Individuals who followed the account during that time period were automatically restored as a follower to that account once it stabilized.""
Konzelman noted in his prepared testimony that he doesn't see any ""collusion"" between social media companies or cable outlets that rejected or purportedly restricted the film, but pointed to an imbalanced worldview that restricts free speech.
""For the record, we allege no collusion between any of the social media or cable media entities. At least not in the formal sense,"" Konzelman said. ""They require no coordinated communication or agreement between them, because they are universally progressive in their orientation, political beliefs, and worldview.""
In the end, the question of why the account was suspended on opening weekend when the account had been active for months still remains.

Pete Buttigieg admitted Pence has never attacked his sexuality—but he still attacks the VP's faith,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2020-dem-buttigieg-admitted-pence-has-never-attacked-his-sexuality-but-he-still-attacks-the-vps-faith,"The media has taken notice of the alleged ""feud"" between South Bend mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg and Vice President Mike Pence. Upon closer examination, however, it doesn't appear to be much of a feud at all—since Pence is not participating.
The backstory: Buttigieg has, even before gaining national recognition in recent months, consistently opposed Pence's view on LGBTQ issues . Although both are professing Christians, Pence adheres to the traditional biblical views of sexuality and marriage. Buttigieg is openly gay, and married.
At particular issue between the two Indiana natives is the issue of religious freedom, which is typically viewed by liberals as anti-LGBTQ.
Pence signed the 2015 Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act to protect businesses and individuals from being forced to violate their religious beliefs, but the bill caused significant controversy due to accusations that it legalized discrimination against LGBTQ people.
Did Buttigieg ever discuss this with Pence? The two men certainly crossed paths at different times while Pence was governor of Indiana, but Buttigieg, by his own admission last year, never approached the issue with Pence. And, notably, Pence never attacked Buttigieg for his sexuality, despite their disagreement.
Edward-Isaac Dovere of the Atlantic recalled asking Buttigieg about it last year. Buttigieg told Dovere that Pence never mentioned Buttigieg's sexuality, and said ""I think he knew not to discuss that with me.""
When Dovere asked Buttigieg if he ever tried to bring the topic up to Pence, Buttigieg seemed to imply that it would be pointless to do so—although that hasn't stopped him from taking numerous public shots at Pence.
""No. You know, once I was in a room with some mayors and we were talking about, I think, a totally different issue. I was president of the Urban Mayors Caucus, and we were there to talk about tax stuff. And it was in that period when he was getting ready for the religious freedom thing and he just said, ""I want you to know that in my heart I just believe this is the right thing to do."" I was just like—maybe I should have tried to talk him out of it, but I don't think I would have reached him. It was just clear that you weren't going to get anywhere on the social stuff with him. He's just in a different place, and that kind of reasoning, I don't think, reaches him.""
Buttigieg said over the weekend that if Pence or any other Christian has a problem with someone being gay, they have a ""quarrel"" with God."
House passes bill that will ban the IRS from providing free online tax filing,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bill-bans-irs-from-providing-free-online-tax-filing,"The House of Representatives has posted its stamp of approval on a bipartisan bill that would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from directly offering taxpayers a free method of filing tax returns, reportedly at the behest of companies that profit off providing such services.
What are the details? H.R. 1957 , also known as the Taxpayer First Act, is a bill to ""redesign"" the IRS and was sponsored by Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and Mike Kelly (R-Pa.). It sailed through the Ways and Means Committee last week and was passed on the floor Tuesday.
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) hailed the legislation as a measure that would ""protect low- and moderate-income taxpayers, create sensible enforcement reforms, and ensure the IRS provides taxpayers and small businesses the assistance they deserve.""
Kelly promised the plan would help the IRS ""be a resource, not an adversary"" to Americans.
But ProPublica says the bill bans the IRS from ""creating a free electronic tax filing system"" and is a result of $6.6 million spent last year in lobbying efforts by H&R Block and Intuit (the owner of TurboTax), whose businesses rely on upcharges from taxpayers who utilize their services.
The outlet also noted that Neal ""received $16,000 in contributions from Intuit and H&R Block in the last two election cycles.""
Proponents of the legislation say it's a good thing, because it would keep the government from competing in a market it created. Others argue the provision would favor corporations for profiteering reasons and that providing a free tax filing service is the least the IRS can do to give citizens a break.
Numerous outlets have raised alarm over the legislation, with Slate noting that ""the IRS currently has an agreement with an industry group called Free File Alliance , under which the IRS has agreed not to create its own free online system as long as the companies offer free filing for Americans below a certain income threshold.""
While services from H&R Block and TurboTax do offer free federal filing, the firms have been accused of deception and upselling by requiring users to pay for filing state returns — which has nothing to do with the federal government. The companies also offer additional services like audit protection for a charge.
But not everyone in the House is happy with the legislation, particularly from the far left. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) pointed out that the IRS should do even more, arguing from the House floor, ""It is a huge scandal that Congress has not yet instructed the IRS to automatically prepare taxes for the vast majority of Americans. The IRS has all the information required to do that for all but a few taxpayers, and the main reason it hasn't to date is lobbying by companies like TurboTax and H&R Block.""
Anything else? The bill also has bipartisan support in the Senate, according to Slate. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, proclaimed after the House vote, ""During the debate on the tax administration bill, my staff pushed back on a prohibition on the agency competing with private tax preparation services.""
But the senator defended the full final package, saying it ""reduced the role of private debt collection on the most vulnerable Americans and made permanent a highly successful program for low-income taxpayers."""
9 shocking March stats from the ‘system-wide emergency’ at the border,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/9-shocking-facts-from-border-emergency,"If the February border numbers were unprecedented, the March border numbers appear to be unfathomable. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has published the March border numbers , which reflect a ""system-wide emergency"" in the view of top border officials.
""The impacts to legitimate trade and travel cannot be overstated,"" CBP Deputy Commissioner Robert E. Perez said in a statement. ""As this crisis continues to worsen, it undermines CBP's ability to perform its dual mission of protecting our borders and facilitating legitimate trade and travel.""
Image Source: Conservative Review screenshot of U.S. Customs & Border Protection
Here are nine shocking statistics from the March data and the cumulative numbers of illegal aliens and family units crossing this fiscal year:
103,492 : The total number of illegal aliens and inadmissible aliens apprehended at and between points of entry in the month of March. That is the highest monthly number since April 2007. But as former Border Patrol head Mark Morgan told the Senate Homeland Security Committee last week , last decade, ""1/3 of those apprehended were repeat offenders so the realistic number of migrant apprehensions was well below what's reflected."" As such, it's likely that this month is at or near an all-time record.
1.2 million : The number of illegal aliens and inadmissible aliens that will be apprehended in a year if March's pace continues. But Customs and Border Protection predicts that with the weather getting warmer over the next few months and the incentives for illegal immigration unaddressed, the numbers will grow larger. The first week of April seems to indicate this.
$168 billion-$180 billion : The lifetime cost of 1.2 million illegal aliens per year, using the input and methodology of the Center for Immigration Studies' Steven Camarota to calculate the cost of illegal aliens to the American taxpayer.
57,271 : A record number of family unit apprehensions (number of people apprehended with family members) in March. That beats the record we just set last month by a whopping 40 percent. That is more than three times as large as the first Central American wave at the peak of the 2014 migration during Obama's tenure. Even just the unaccompanied minors (who are often split off from family units for strategic reasons) totaled 9,398, which in its own right rivals all but the two busiest months of the 2014 UAC surge, which was without the family units.
189,584: The number of family unit apprehensions between points of entry for the first six months of fiscal year 2019. This far surpasses the numbers for any previous full year.
218,645: The number of family unit apprehensions between points of entry since Judge Dana Sabraw ruled last July that all parents or adults brought with children must be released with the children. During that last nine months, as many family units have been apprehended as in the previous 33 months.
4,647%: The percentage increase in monthly family unit apprehensions between points of entry since the low of the ""Trump effect"" in April 2017 through February 2019. There's been a 370 percent increase in family units for the first half of this fiscal year compared with the first half of FY 2018.
422,334 : The total number of illegal aliens and inadmissible immigrants, including single adults, who have been caught at our border. That is almost twice the rate of last year, which in itself was a dramatic increase from FY 2017.
104 : The number of large groups, defined as 100 or more, coming in at once to surrender to border agents and shutting down their resources. There were 13 such groups in FY 2018, mainly in the latter part of the year when this phenomenon began. It was almost unheard of in previous years.
One of the surprising data points from this month is the surge in single adults in addition to family units. While two-thirds of the illegal immigrants were family units or unaccompanied minors, the number of single adults increased in raw numbers by 30 percent over February. This is likely the result of the family units filling up the detention centers to such a point that even the single adults are being released for a lack of space. This has likely incentivized even those who can't find a child to use as a ticket into the country to make the trek and try their luck at the border.
On Tuesday, I presented 10 ways to disincentivize the border flow . But it is self-evident that unless the administration changes tactics, we have not reached rock bottom at the border yet."
Amazon admits to listening in on and analyzing private conversations and intimate moments through Alexa - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/amazon-admits-listening-in-on-conversations-via-alexa,"Amazon has admitted to employing thousands of people worldwide who are tasked with listening in on private conversations through its Echo line of speakers using the Alexa digital assistant, and the workers are revealing what they've heard.
What are the details? Bloomberg reported that Amazon has teams of folks around the world tasked with transcribing recordings pulled from Echo customers' homes and offices. In one shift, the analysts will listen in on as many as 1,000 clips, which the firm says is minuscule considering the tens of millions of people who own the systems.
A company spokesman explained, ""We only annotate an extremely small sample of Alexa voice recordings in order [to] improve the customer experience. For example, this information helps us train our speech recognition and natural language understanding system, so Alexa can better understand your requests, and ensure the service works well for everyone.""
But the revelation confirms the fears of those who have warned against trading privacy for convenience. Two Amazon workers speaking on the condition of anonymity told Bloomberg that users frequently ask Alexa questions like, ""Do you work for the NSA?"" or ""Is someone else listening to us?""
What else have they heard? The Daily Mail noted that ""concerns have been raised by some in the past that smart speaker systems could be used to [listen in on] user conversations, often with the aim of targeting users with advertising."" But the analysts are hearing much more than just costumers' interests.
According to the Mail, Amazon workers have admitted to listening in on people singing in the shower, discussing bank account details, and conducting other intimate exchanges. Staffers have also raised the alarm when overhearing distressing situations like a child calling out for help, and instances where a sexual assault might have occurred.
It's only a matter of time, experts say, before law enforcement is granted access to listen in on what Alexa hears, too.
Security consultant Robert Graham told Gizmodo a few years ago, ""It's likely that laws will be passed that will allow the police to remotely activate these devices and eavesdrop on suspects, pretty much as described in the book '1984.' """
"Deputy's son arrested, accused of setting fire to three historically black Louisiana churches",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/deputys-son-arrested-accused-of-setting-fire-to-three-historically-black-louisiana-ch,"The son of a Louisiana sheriff's deputy was arrested and brought up on arson charges Wednesday, accused of intentionally torching three historically black churches over a 10-day span.
What are the details? KATC-TV reported the 21-year-old suspect is Holden Matthews, the son of a St. Landry Parish Deputy. Authorities say Matthews is linked to the March 26 fire at St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, the April 2 fire at Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, and the April 4 fire at nearby Mount Pleasant Baptist Church.
Pastor Harry Richard of the Greater Union Baptist Church was happy to hear of the arrest, telling The Washington Post , ""I felt relieved knowing that our congregation didn't have to worry anymore. They are my main concern. I was reassured that law enforcement was on our side.""
State Fire Marshal H. ""Butch"" Browning told reporters physical evidence and video surveillance footage led investigators to believe the suspect set the fires intentionally, The Post reported. Browning noted that each of the three arson charges against Matthews carry a maximum prison sentence of 15 years.
According to the New York Post, ""the areas where the churches are located are predominately black,"" while Matthews is white. The NAACP released a statement saying the attacks were acts of racially motivated ""domestic terrorism.""
CBS News reported that authorities have not yet developed a motive.
Anything else? Previous rumors claimed Matthews' father, Deputy Roy Matthews, took his own son into custody in connection with the crimes. Authorities said that was not true, but that the elder Matthews did ""help facilitate"" in Holden's arrest by directing the suspect away from his home to an area where deputies could safely make their approach.
St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz said Deputy Matthews had no idea of his son's alleged involvement in the crimes prior to the sheriff informing him. The father reportedly ""broke down"" upon learning the news."
Texas SWAT team becomes first to use lasso-type device to take down suspects,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/texas-swat-lasso-type-device,"The Fort Worth Police Department's SWAT team has become the first in the country to use a new lasso-style device to take down suspects.
The nonlethal weapon, called a BolaWrap, is a remote device that features a bola-style rope that wraps itself around the suspect's body.
""There is no less-lethal option that is going to be perfect in every scenario,"" SWAT commander Lt. Todd Plowman told KXAS-TV during a demonstration. ""This is just more tools that we can use.""
Wrap Technologies, a Las Vegas-based company, created the gadget that's being marketed to police departments across the U.S.
How does it work? The BolaWrap cartridge contains an 8-foot kevlar tether that deploys at a rate of 640 feet per second, according to the company website .
Once it's fired, the rope wraps itself around the suspect one to three times at a range of 10 to 25 feet. A small hook attached to the end of the rope catches onto the person's clothing to secure it.
In less than a second, the suspect has been lassoed and restrained without harm.
Has the SWAT team used it on a suspect? SWAT officers used the device recently on an armed suspect following a stand-off.
The suspect, who had barricaded himself inside a home, was first forced outside by tear gas.
After the man came out of the house, officers feared he might try to run so they deployed the BolaWrap on him, allowing officers to take the man into custody without incident.
""And his immediate response was to grab it and by that time our take-down officers were on top of him, placed him on the ground safely and took him into custody,"" Officer Donald McCreery told the news station.
What else? The department may consider providing the weapon to all officers across the department in the future, according to Plowman.
""We're always looking for less lethal options and ways to de-escalate situations and to bring people into custody without injuring them if we can,"" Plowman told KXAS."

Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) defended Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from what she said is ""racist"" and unfair criticism of the Minnesota freshman lawmaker's recent remarks about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Omar attended a Muslim right's group in March where she said that the 9/11 attacks occurred because ""some people did something.""
On Thursday, the New York Post ran a scathing cover condemning Omar's attacks, and she also faced criticism from lawmakers and the public. The Post cover showed a devastating photo of the Twin Towers' destruction and wrote, ""Here's your something: 2,977 people dead by terrorism.""
What did Tlaib say? Tlaib said that Omar's remarks were taken wildly out of context.
During an MSNBC appearance, Tlaib was asked if Omar should have worded her remarks more carefully.
""They do that all the time, especially women of color, they take our words out of context because they're afraid because we speak truth, we speak truth to power,"" Tlaib said. ""This is just pure racist act.""
""My sister, Ilhan Omar, what she was talking about, was uplifting people by supporting their civil liberties and civil rights,"" Tlaib added. ""She has always, always condemned any strategy, especially of a person directly impacted by a refugee herself.""
Tlaib said that she was ""outraged"" by the criticism.
""The fact that people are taking [Omar's] words out of context and endangering the life of Rep. Omar is immoral, it's wrong, and it needs to be called out by many colleagues in saying they need to stop, stop targeting her this way,"" she insisted. ""It's absolutely putting her life in danger.""
What did AOC say? Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) also weighed in and defended Omar from the criticism.
In a Thursday tweet, Ocasio-Cortez wrote, ""I'm not going to Quote: : the NY Post's horrifying, hateful cover. Here's 1 fact. @IlhanMN is a cosponsor of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. She's done more for 9/11 families than the GOP who won't even support healthcare for 1st responders — yet are happy to weaponize her faith.""
What else? Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) was one lawmaker in particular who took offense to her remarks.
Omar singled out Crenshaw in a tweet and said that his opinion of her remarks was akin to inciting violence, and said that Crenshaw called her ""un-American.""
On Twitter, Crenshaw responded in a fiery tweet pointing out her fallacies.
""1. I never called you un-American. 2. I did not incite any violence against you. 3. You described an act of terrorism on American soil that killed thousands of innocent lives as 'some people did something,'"" he wrote. ""It's still unbelievable, as is your response here.""

Every House Democrat but one cosponsers bill intended to let biological male athletes compete against females in pubic schools,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-push-bill-intended-to-let-males-compete-in-womens-sports,"All the Democrats in the House of Representatives except one are cosponsoring a bill that's intended, in part, to allow biological male athletes who identify as females to compete against biological females in public schools.
The Equality Act would broadly amend civil rights legislation to outlaw discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing, public accommodations, jury service, education, federal programs and credit, NBC News reported . The bill's specific language prohibits discrimination based on peoples' ""sexual orientation and gender identity.""
But some cosponsors and supporters of the bill are looking at the bill as an avenue to allow transgender athletes in public schools to compete on teams that match their gender identities — which has become a contentious issue nationwide of late.
What do supporters and cosponsors say regarding transgender athletes? Democratic House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) offered the following in his opening statement last week about the Equality Act:
Many states have sexual orientation and gender identity nondiscrimination laws, and all of them still have women's sports. Arguments about transgender athletes participating in sports in accordance with their gender identity having competitive advantages have not been borne out. Sports have positive impacts on physical, social, and emotional well-being, and we should not be denying transgender athletes those opportunities simply because sometimes they may win. Nor should their occasional success be used as a roadblock to advancing civil rights legislation for LGBT people as a whole. Sarah Warbelow — director of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group — championed the Equality Act in written testimony to the House and echoed Nadler's words, saying it's a myth that transgender female athletes have unfair advantages over biological female athletes:
Opponents of equality in athletics for transgender athletes have argued that girls who are transgender have unfair physiological advantages over cisgender girls and as a result, will dominate women's competitive sports. Some have also suggested that girls who are transgender pose a threat to their cisgender teammates both on the field and in shared locker rooms. None of these arguments are rooted in fact. Existing evidence shows that denying opportunities and access to students based on their gender identity causes actual harm to those students, while there is no data to suggest that girls who are transgender are dominating athletics or posing a harm to their cisgender counterparts. The issue is particularly hot in Connecticut, where a pair of biological males who identify as females have been dominating sprinting competitions in high school track and field . And as you might expect, n ot every biological female opponent is happy about it .
What did one opponent of the bill have to say?
Julia Beck of the Women's Liberation Front testified to the House against the Equality Act, saying ""men will dominate female sports; girls who would have taken first place will be denied scholastic opportunity.""
Beck added that the bill is a ""human rights violation"" and that in the end ""every person in this country will lose our right to single-sex sports"" and ""we will no longer be able to distinguish between women and men.""
Who are the outlier House members? The only two Republican House members cosponsoring the Equality Act are John Katko of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. GOP Rep. Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico also cosponsored the bill, but she's not a voting member.
The Daily Caller noted that Illinois Rep. Dan Lipinski, ""the only pro-life Democrat left in the House, is also the only one in his party not co-sponsoring the Equality Act.""
Here's a look at the Connecticut high school transgender sprinters:

"New York City Mayor de Blasio bans plasticware in city agencies — including schools, jails, and hospitals",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-mayor-de-blasio-bans-plasticware,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has banned the purchase of single-use plasticware, such as utensils, bowls, plates, straws, and cups, by city agencies, including jails, schools, and hospitals.
What's the story? The mayor signed an executive order Thursday mandating the new guidelines. The ban has exceptions for people with disabilities and for medical use or use during emergency preparedness. Agencies will have 120 days to begin reducing their reliance on these items. The ban will go into full effect at the start of 2020.
In a speech announcing the ban, de Blasio described plasticware items as ""things we somehow got used to but we really don't need anymore."" He said the companies that make such products were ""the villain here.""
De Blasio said that this would cut the city's carbon emissions by 500 tons a year. WCBS-TV reported that the city buys 1.1 million pounds of plasticware every year. The city government admitted that alternative single-use utensils made out of material such as wood or bamboo would be more expensive, but said it was still taking bids to see what the actual cost would be.
""Big Oil has been pushing single-use plastics for too long — and it stops here,"" de Blasio said while announcing the new law. ""They litter our beaches and parks, jam our recycling machines, and contribute to climate change. Our actions today will help us build a fairer city for all New Yorkers.""
But wait, there's more
While the current ban applies only to government-run establishments, de Blasio is also trying to get legislation passed that would outlaw single use plastic products at private restaurants and stores, as well.
New York City has already banned single-use foam products. The entire state has a ban on single-use shopping bags, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said ""have blighted our environment and clogged our waterways."""
"Barcelona removes books like ‘Little Red Riding Hood’ and ‘Sleeping Beauty’ from elementary schools because they perpetuate sexist stereotypes, apparently",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/barcelona-removes-books-like-little-red-riding-hood-and-sleeping-beauty-from-elementary-schools-because-they-perpetuate-sexist-stereotypes-apparently,"An elementary school in Barcelona, Spain, removed more than 200 children's books from its library because they perpetuate sexist stereotypes, according to a new report from Spanish newspaper El Pais .
What are the details? Two books to receive the ax include ""Little Red Riding Hood"" and ""Sleeping Beauty.""
""[B]ooks for learning the alphabet, colors, and habits"" were also reportedly discovered to perpetuate sexist stereotypes.
The elementary school in question — The Tàber School — is governed by the Catalan government, and noted that other schools in the city are also taking inventory of potentially problematic books as well.
The newspaper reported that at least 30 percent of the books in The Tàber School's library were considered ""toxic,"" and 10 percent were written from a ""gender perspective.""
The report explained that 60 percent of the books had problems that were far less serious.
One mother involved in the book selections told the paper that they were not looking to ban specific books, and just wanted to address sexism on a broader scale.
""Society is changing and is more aware of the issue of gender, but this is not being reflected in stories,"" parent Anna Tutzo explained.
Tutzo said one of the recurring themes is toxic masculinity.
""In violent situations, even though they are just small pranks, it is the boy who acts against the girl. This sends a message about who can be violent and against whom,"" she said.
""Kids are like sponges and absorb everything around them,"" she added, ""which allows sexist stereotypes to be normalized.""
What else? According to the report, the schools are seeking to incorporate more ""gender-balanced"" books.
At another school in the area, the parent organization created a ""gender-equality commission"" to review the books.
""The type of books children read is very important because traditional books replicate gender stereotypes and it is good to have books that break these,"" Estel Clusella, head of the school's parents association, told the outlet.
""At the age of 5, children have already established gender roles, they know what it is to be a boy or a girl and what that means. So it's key to work with a gender perspective from the infancy stage,"" she added.

Instagram blocks Babylon Bee founder's cartoon comparing abortion to slavery — and calls it 'hate speech',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/instagram-calls-babylon-bee-founders-cartoon-comparing-abortion-to-slavery-hate-speech-and-blocks-it,"Adam Ford — founder of Christian satire site, The Babylon Bee — said Instagram yanked a cartoon he created that compares abortion to slavery. Instagram also labeled it ""hate speech,"" Ford said.
Ford — now editor of the Christian Daily Reporter — suggested to CDR readers that they should examine the ""entire comic and try to ponder how in the world it could be considered 'hate speech.'""
The cartoon was eventually reinstated, but Ford said Instagram told him ""nothing"" in the aftermath.
The cartoon begins with a conversation between two women in the time of U.S. slavery, with one saying slavery is wrong because black people are human beings while the other woman says they aren't; it ends with the start of a modern-day conversation between the ""same"" two women with one of them asking, ""Does abortion ever bother you?""
What else did Ford say? ""I am hardly the first person to espouse the belief (and hope) that one day society will look back on abortion with the same mortified disbelief we now have when we consider our country's history of institutionalized chattel slavery,"" he added to his CDR page. ""Millions and millions of pro-life Americans — of all races — see the heartbreaking similarities between abortion-on-demand and the forced enslavement of human beings.""
More from Ford:
""There is no way any human being could believe my comic is promoting slavery, since the two women talking are clearly identified as living 200 years ago, and the woman on the right is clearly the 'bad guy.'
""Does Instagram consider it 'hate speech' to contend for the humanity and personhood of the unborn?
""If I had published the exact same comic, but instead used it to promote abortion (i.e. 'without abortion rights, women cannot attain full equal personhood' — an argument used on the left), would it have been removed as 'hate speech'?
""I think we all know the answer to that."" What else? The Babylon Bee — which Ford sold in 2018 — hilariously caught the attention of Snopes fact-checkers last year as well due to a piece headlined, ""CNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication"" and labeled it ""false."" Duh.
""The custom-made device allows CNN reporters to load just the facts of a given issue, turn a dial to 'spin cycle,' and within five minutes, receive a nearly unrecognizable version of the story that's been spun to fit with the news station's agenda,"" the Bee piece noted, tongue firmly in cheek.
But that didn't stop Facebook from using the fact check to warn Ford that publishing more ""disputed info"" would result in demonetization and reduced viewership, the Daily Caller said .
Facebook soon apologized.
""There's a difference between false news and satire,"" Facebook said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. ""This was a mistake and should not have been rated false in our system. It's since been corrected and won't count against the domain in any way.""

College groundskeeper wears MAGA hat on the job — but the executive dean isn't having it,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-groundskeeper-wears-maga-hat-on-the-job-and-the-executive-dean-isnt-having-it,"A groundskeeper at Suffolk County Community College in New York said he was told that wearing his ""Make America Great Again"" hat — the symbol of President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign — is verboten while he's working on campus.
What happened? Salvatore Esposito — an Iraq War veteran who's worked the campus in Selden for 11 years — told News12 Long Island he wore his MAGA hat to work Sunday for the very first time, and then the following day was told to not wear it again while he's on the job.
Image source: News12 Long Island video screenshot
He added to the station that the school's executive dean sent his boss an email about it, which reads in part: ""While that hat doesn't have a political candidate's name nor a party or logo on it, it has nevertheless reached the level of being a clear political statement. Please reinforce to staff that political attire is not permissible during working hours.""
Indeed, the iconic red cap has become a lightning rod for a growing number of those on the left who say it's synonymous with racism, bigotry, and hatred .
'Plenty of Hillary hats'
Esposito told News12 he was surprised because it seemed the school always let staff promote progressive ideas and wear clothing with left-leaning messages. He added that he's seen staff members wearing ""plenty of Hillary hats.""
""I feel that the college is biased against me because of my political beliefs,"" Esposito, a registered Republican, told Newsday . ""They violated my First Amendment rights.""
What did the school have to say? The SCCC administration now is indicating the dean misspoke, and that the issue isn't about Esposito wearing a MAGA hat, the station said — but that he was wearing a hat, period.
But Esposito told Newsday he's worn hats on the job for years, from Yankees and Islander caps to one with the Army logo.
""They were never concerned about me wearing a hat before,"" he said.
The logical conclusion? Esposito told News12 he's sure the issue is about the MAGA hat and what it may represent to different people.
And not all of them at SCCC are liberal Democrats, he told the station.
""There are more Donald Trump supporters here than people realize,"" Esposito told News 12. ""They're just afraid to come forward because they don't want to be stigmatized the way I was.""
The college told the station that no disciplinary action was taken against Esposito, and that it's working with union leadership to order uniform hats for the grounds crew.

"Abortion clinic director mocks NC anti-infanticide bill, questions why newborns should be considered legal persons",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/abortion-clinic-director-mocks-anti-infanticide-bill,"An abortion clinic director mocked a piece of state-level pro-life legislation being considered in North Carolina, and questioned why the survivors of botched abortions should be considered legal persons under state law.
In the tweet published Wednesday afternoon, Calla Hayes mocked the pro-life bill, arguing that, because infants under 30 days old cannot be added to wills in North Carolina, they shouldn't qualify as legal persons under a proposed anti-infanticide law.
Hales is the director of an abortion clinic in the Tar Heel State and sits on the board of directors for NARAL Pro-Choice North Carolina.
She went on to call the contrast "" incredibly hypocritical ,"" before claiming that she was merely ""pointing out a legal inconsistency.""
North Carolina's bill, like the similar federal legislation that currently is the subject of a discharge petition in the House of Representatives, is titled the "" Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. ""
It would require that children who survive botched abortion attempts be given the same degree of lifesaving medical care ""as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.""
It would also make failure to do so a felony punishable with a fine of up to $250,000.
The bill is expected to hit the state Senate floor for a vote Monday, WRAL reports , while the House version passed committee Thursday on a party-line vote."
Meghan McCain rips co-host Sunny Hostin for spreading Julian Assange ‘propaganda’ on ‘The View’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/meghan-mccain-fights-sunny-hostin-over-julian-assange,"Meghan McCain got into a dust-up with one of her co-hosts on ""The View"" Thursday after the topic of WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's arrest came up.
Authorities arrested Assange on Thursday at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and indicted him on conspiracy charges related to 2010's WikiLeaks releases. You can read more about the arrest and his background here .
What happened on 'The View?' The segment kicked off after co-host Whoopi Goldberg brought up Assange's arrest.
""Did he break the law?"" Goldberg asked, positing the notion of free speech.
Co-host Joy Behar answered, ""[Assange] hacked into the Democrats' computers and basically helped Trump get elected by exposing [John] Podesta's emails. ... That's why Trump won!""
Co-host Abby Huntsman was quick to hit back at Behar's remarks, noting that the Trump administration prosecuted Assange — not the Obama administration.
Co-host Meghan McCain added, ""The politics of this have always been completely hypocritical, on both sides. ... This is something that a lot of people who put national security first ... have been warning about.""
""The only time the Democrats started caring is when it started affecting them politically,"" McCain insisted. ""I hope he rots in hell!""
Co-host Sunny Hostin interjected with an attempt to defend Assange by explaining that the U.S. Constitution ""does protect Julian Assange.""
Hostin pointed to the release of the Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, the Pentagon Papers, and the Panama Papers as evidence to back up her claim that anyone who had a ""problem with what [Assange] released"" must also have a problem with such other things.
""Those items released protected our democracy,"" Hostin explained.
""Freedom of the press is ... our most important amendment,"" she added. ""It's very clear that the Constitution protects information investigative journalism even if that information is gotten illegally. Even if that info is a matter of national security.""
McCain pushes back With an incredulous look on her face, McCain fired back, ""I've got to push back hard on this.""
""I think what you just said was straight propaganda, just so we're clear,"" she added.
Hostin fired back, ""Well if the law is propaganda, I'm sorry.""
""He is a cyberterrorist!"" McCain insisted.
Huntsman broke in and added, ""There is a difference ... between being a whistleblower and being a straight-up hacker!""

Debra Messing blasts US Army as ‘disgusting and irresponsible’ after DOD announces April 2019 contracts,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/debra-messing-blasts-us-army,"Actress Debra Messing blasted the Department of Defense and the U.S. Army after finding out that the Army awarded $976 million in contracts to support border wall construction.
She said what? In a Twitter response to the news that the Department of Defense awarded $976 million in contracts for border wall construction , Messing said, ""This is disgusting and irresponsible.""
The article revealed that the Department of Defense released $976 million from its counter-narcotics fund. According to Task & Purpose, a large part of the fund ""is made up of money that the Army did not spend for personnel costs because it failed to meet its recruiting goals, defense officials said.""
The DOD said in a release that border construction work will be performed in and around Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and Yuma, Arizona. Expected construction completion dates are October 2020 and September 2020, respectively.
Anything else? In March, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan authorized up to $1 billion to build a portion of border wall in the Yuma, Arizona, and El Paso, Texas, areas after President Donald Trump announced a declaration of national emergency in February.
At the time, the Department of Defense said , ""These funds will be used to support [the Homeland Security Department's] request to build 57 miles of 18-foot-high pedestrian fencing, constructing and improving roads, and installing lighting within the Yuma and El Paso Sectors of the border.""
A spokesman for the Department of Defense told The Hill that ""30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate"" would be constructed and installed in the Santa Teresa, New Mexico, contract. The spokesperson added that for the Yuma, Arizona, contract, ""18-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate"" would be constructed and installed.
President Trump previously threatened to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border to trade in an effort to persuade Mexico into cracking down on illegal immigration via U.S.-Mexico entry points."

""Welcome to Illinois, where you can get a safe, legal abortion,"" the billboard at Interstates 55 and 64 reads.
The Hope Clinic for Women said the message is an effort to fight back against Missouri's recent proposal to tighten its already strict abortion laws, Yahoo Lifestyle reported.
""There will be an avenue for access to abortion no matter what happens legislatively, and we just need to be more creative of getting our message out there to let our most vulnerable communities know that they still have choices,"" Alison Dreith, the clinic's communication manager, told Yahoo.
It posted the message last month following a February proposal by Missouri lawmakers that would ban most abortions.
The clinic, which sits just across the Illinois state line in Granite City, has performed abortions since 1974, according to its website .
What did Missouri lawmakers propose? In February, lawmakers proposed a measure that would ban abortions after six weeks gestation, except for medical emergencies.
""Today, let us make known to citizens of this great state and every state in the nation that Missouri stands for the unborn,"" state Rep. Nick Schroer (R), who is sponsoring the legislation, said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch .
There would be no exceptions in cases of rape or incest.
What are the state's current laws? Currently, women in Missouri can receive a medical abortion up to 22 weeks.
Women seeking an abortion must also obtain informed consent 72 hours prior to the procedure.
Consent from a parent or guardian for those 17 and younger is required for an abortion.
What else? Dreith told Yahoo that the clinic got the idea for the billboard from Progress Now Colorado, which placed a similar sign across from the border of Utah."
Michael Avenatti indicted on 36 federal charges,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/michael-avenatti-indicted-on-36-federal-charges,"Attorney and fallen media darling Michael Avenatti has been indicted by a federal grand jury, accused of 36 criminal violations including embezzlement, lying under oath, and tax evasion.
What are the details? Avenatti — who represented porn star Stormy Daniels in two failed lawsuits against President Donald Trump — allegedly stole millions of dollars from clients using ""a tangled web of shell companies and bank accounts to cover up the theft."" the Los Angeles Times reported.
According to prosecutors, the lawyer withheld settlement payments from five clients, spending the money on his own lavish expenses, including a private jet that was seized by authorities on Wednesday .
U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said in a statement that the complaints of bank fraud, lying in bankruptcy proceedings, stealing and failing to pay taxes ""alleged in the indictment are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in other sets — typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing.""
If Avenatti is convicted on all the counts brought by the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles, he's looking at spending up to 335 years in prison.
But the charges handed down Thursday are only part of Avenatti's troubles.
The lawyer also faces federal charges in New York for allegedly trying to extort millions from Nike. If he's found guilty of all charges related to that alleged scam, Avenatti could get another 47 years in the slammer. Also, the tough-talking litigator reportedly hasn't paid taxes in nearly a decade, and can't afford a defense attorney of his own.
Anything else? Avenatti is currently free on a $300,000 bond. Following his release on Thursday, he tweeted out that he's ""made many powerful enemies"" over the years and intends ""to fully fight all charges and plead not guilty.""
Avenatti became a household name thanks to the attention he received from representing Daniels (whose given name is Stephanie Clifford) against the president over hush money for an alleged affair. He also represented a woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct ahead of his confirmation.
The lawyer was even floated as a possible 2020 Democratic presidential contender, before he was accused of domestic violence last year."

Bosa — a 6-foot-4, 266-pound defensive end who runs a 4.79-second 40-yard dash — was called the draft's ""best prospect"" in the headline of an ESPN profile . But that same piece also took time to discuss Bosa's sociopolitical stances.
""Last year he seemed to delight in posting political takes, including his support for President Trump, on Twitter and needling dissenters,"" the article by Kevin Van Valkenburg said. ""(He also caused a minor social media stir by criticizing Beyoncé, Black Panther and Colin Kaepernick, all eventually deleted.) As the combine drew near, though, his online behavior grew increasingly bland.""
Van Valkenburg asked Bosa why. His reply? ""I had to. There is a chance I might end up in San Francisco,"" he said.
Sports Illustrated's mock draft projects the 49ers — Kaepernick's former team — will select Bosa as the second overall pick when the draft commences April 25. Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality against minorities during the 2016 season, which launched a movement among other players and may have been the reason that year was seemingly his last.
Image source: YouTube screenshot
What did Bosa tweet (and delete)? One of Bosa's deleted tweets shows a photo of Trump standing with former President Ronald Reagan back in the day, and Bosa added a one-word comment: ""Goats"" — a reference to the acronym for ""Greatest of all time"":
Bosa also deleted a tweet calling Kaepernick a ""clown"":
Bosa also deleted tweets calling the popular flick, ""Black Panther,"" the ""worst Marvel movie of all time"" and the music of Beyoncé ""complete trash.""
Football analyst Shannon Sharpe on Thursday's episode of ""Undisputed"" said Bosa is entitled to his politics but said being vocal about them can get ""sticky"" in the locker room. He added that Bosa deleting the tweets is akin to saying, ""I'm not sorry. But I just better remove [the tweets] because [the 49ers have] the second pick, and I don't want to give them any reason for them not to take me.""

Mike DeWine, who has promised to sign it into law.
What are the details? The bill passed the Ohio General Assembly 56-40, and the Ohio state Senate 30-18.
Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, vetoed similar legislation twice . Kasich did sign another bill, which banned abortions after 20 weeks, with an exception for the life of the mother.
Under this new law , doctors would be required to perform abdominal or transvaginal ultrasounds before performing an abortion. If they fail to do this, or perform an abortion even if a heartbeat is detected, they could face up to a year in prison and a $2,500 fine.
There is no legal penalty for women, and there is an exception for the health of the mother. It does not include exceptions for rape or incest.
According to Cleveland.com , in order to use this exception, women would have to sign a consent form that says: ""the unborn human individual that the pregnant woman is carrying has a fetal heartbeat and that the pregnant woman is aware of the statistical probability of bringing the unborn human individual that the pregnant woman is carrying to term.""
What else? ""This is not a Democratic or Republican issue,"" Ohio state Rep. Candice Keller said, according to Cleveland.com. Keller also runs a crisis pregnancy center. ""This is not a religious issue. This is an issue of humanity and morality.""
Critics of the bill protested that it would lead to back-alley abortions, and that some women may not know that they're pregnant before six weeks.
Democratic state Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan said that she was "" concerned that we will have companies that will choose not to locate here due to our oppressive laws"" and that doctors would leave the state.
According to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute , 22,730 abortions were performed in Ohio in 2014."

""Well, look, I worked very closely with Mayor Pete when I was governor of the state of Indiana,"" Pence said. ""We had a great working relationship. And he said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally, and he knows better. He knows me.
""But I get,"" Pence continued. ""You know, it's — look, they got 19 people running for president on that side, in a party that is sliding off to the left, and they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are than the other. So, I get that.""
Pence also pointed out that, despite his view that marriage should be defined as a union between a man and a woman, he did was he was required to do as governor in implementing gay marriage when the Supreme Court struck down all gay marriage bans in 2015.
""And when I was governor of Indiana, we fully implemented that decision in the law,"" Pence said when interviewer Joe Kernen asked him if he accepted the Supreme Court's decision as law. ""But, Joe, I have my Christian values. My family and I have a view of marriage that's informed by our faith. And we stand by that. But that doesn't mean that we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view.""

Deneen started out by noting Tuesday's congressional hearing, during which Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) attempted to discredit Candace Owens, the communications director for Turning Point USA who was invited by Republicans to speak on hate crimes and white nationalism.
Sitting before the House Judiciary Committee, Lieu played an audio clip on his smartphone on which Owens can be heard defending the word ""nationalism,"" and explaining that its meaning has been conflated with ""national socialism"" and Adolf Hitler.
Deneen applauded Owens for ""put[ting] the Democrats in their place,"" and spoke out in support of black conservatives who are afraid to be vocal about what they really think because of the harsh criticism they are likely to receive, even from the people who are closest to them.

"Study: Using marijuana and opioids together increases anxiety, depression, substance abuse",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/study-using-marijuana-and-opioids-together-increases-anxiety-depression-substance-abuse,"Using marijuana and opioids together to treat chronic pain is a bad idea, according to a recent study published Tuesday in MedPage Today.
Researchers at the University of Houston found that chronic pain sufferers who combined marijuana and opioids had higher instances of anxiety, depression, and abuse of alcohol and other substances than those who treated their pain with opioids alone.
The study also showed no difference in both groups of patients' pain levels.
""The things psychologists would be most worried about were worse, but the thing patients were using the cannabis to hopefully help with, namely pain, was no different,"" Andrew Rogers, the study's lead author told MedPage Today .
""Co-use of substances generally leads to worse outcomes. As you pour on more substances to regulate anxiety and depression, symptoms can go up,"" he said.
Rogers and his team presented the study's findings at the annual American Pain Society Scientific Meeting in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, last week.
What do experts say? Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said the study confirmed previous research and debunks the argument that marijuana legalization could be the answer to stopping the opioid addiction crisis.
""Once again, another study completely shreds the arguments perpetuated by marijuana lobbyists that legalization can help solve the opioid epidemic,"" Sabet said in a news release. ""Simply put, lawmakers must stop rushing ahead of the literature when it comes to expanding the use of this drug and possibly adding fuel to the addiction fire that is devastating our communities.""
Another recent study by researchers at Stanford University in California found that medical marijuana users are more likely to use and abuse prescription pain medication, tranquilizers, and stimulants.
""These results are not surprising and indeed replicate other studies showing that cannabis use by pain patients is associated with higher doses of opioids and no pain relief benefits,"" Keith Humphreys, one of the researchers involved in the Stanford study, told MedPage Today. ""This is one of many examples where claims about the benefits of medical cannabis are not supported by evidence,"" he added.
How was the study conducted? The study surveyed 450 adults who at the time of the study used opioids for chronic pain that persisted for at least three months.
Seventy-five percent of the study's participants were women with an average age of 39.
Nearly 40 percent reported using recreational marijuana in the past three months, along with opioids.
Limitations of the cross-sectional study included its reliance on self-reported data. Additionally, the frequency or quantity of the participants' cannabis or opioid use wasn't assessed."
Man rushes the stage during Jordan Peterson talk at Liberty University. What happens next is spectacular.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-rushes-stage-jordan-peterson-liberty-university-prayer,"Dr. Jordan Peterson, best-selling author, clinical psychologist, and quasi-cultural messiah, recently appeared at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, to deliver a convocation speech.
While many of Peterson's appearances are generally rife with notable moments, this one may stick in his head as more memorable than most as one audience member rushed the stage and proceeded to break down crying in a plea for help.
What happened? Peterson delivered his remarks in a panel-type discussion along with David Nasser, senior vice president of spiritual development for Liberty University; Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the university; and Gary Habermas, historian and apologetics professor at the school.
In the video, you can hear a commotion occurring on the side of the stage and a young man rushes up onto the platform where the four men are seated and begins shouting and crying.
""My name is David ... and I need help! I need help!"" he cries. ""I just wanted to meet you.
""I called 911,"" David wails. ""I want to be well. My God, I just want to know Him better.""
Instead of allowing security to escort the young man from the stage, Nasser immediately approaches David as the young man sinks to his knees and tells the young man that he is ""in the right place.""
Peterson follows suit and approaches David with comfort and open arms.
Nasser immediately launches into a prayer for David and his healing, asking that God would heal him, that the Holy Spirit would work in him and for him, and that David would get the help that he needs.
After the prayer, David allows himself to be escorted from the stage. Nasser tells David, ""Hey, buddy. We're for you.""
A teaching moment Clearly moved, Nasser goes on to use the incident as a teaching moment to spread the Gospel. Peterson — who is not a Christian — appears teary and red-faced, clearly moved by David's demeanor and desperation.
Nasser goes on to point out that it's not just David who feels the way David feels — many other people, including adults, feel the same way and need God in their lives.
Nasser lauds Peterson's best-selling book, ""12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos,"" and points out that it's important for people to have a roadmap to navigate the how-tos of life.
""I'll be the first to tell you, in front of our distinguished guest, that these rules work,"" he goes on to tell the audience. ""But they all stop short without the Ruler.""
What about Peterson? Despite not being a Christian, Peterson is visibly touched by the reception, the incident with young David, and the compassionate way the staff and students respect David and his troubles. In closing, Nasser goes on to ask Peterson how he could pray for the clinical psychologist.
Peterson, clearly overcome by emotion once more, responds, saying that he would pray to avoid paying undue prices for mistakes he will inevitably make in his life.
During the prayer, Nasser interjects another request, praying that Peterson would one day find God and make His kingdom his home.

Feds bust $1.2 billion Medicare scam; doctors and medical executives among those charged,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/feds-bust-huge-medicare-scam,"The Department of Justice on Tuesday announced federal charges against 24 defendants — including physicians and medical company executives — allegedly involved in a fraud scheme that bilked Medicare out of more than $1.2 billion.
What are the details? During the investigation — called Operation Brace Yourself — authorities discovered a widespread phone scam that involved luring elderly and disabled patients into getting medically unnecessary back, shoulder, wrist, and knee braces. Doctors, medical equipment firms, and telecommunication executives are accused of lining their pockets at the expense of taxpayers by orchestrating hundreds of thousands of fraudulent claims to Medicare.
CBS News reported the scam involved telemarketers in call centers based in the Philippines and throughout Latin America, who would reach out to Medicare patients offering ""free"" orthopedic braces. Interested parties were put in touch with physicians who were paid to write prescriptions (sight unseen) for the unneeded devices, which medical equipment firms billed to Medicare. As many as 130 companies were involved.
Officials caught on when complaints began rolling in from concerned patients and their loved ones. All told, $1.7 billion worth of claims were made under the scam, more than $900 million was paid out, and the loss to Medicare was calculated to be more than $1.2 billion.
""The defendants took advantage of unwitting patients who were simply trying to get relief from their health concerns,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a statement . ""Instead, the defendants preyed upon their weakened state and pushed millions of dollars' worth of unnecessary medical devices, which Medicare paid for, and then set up an elaborate system for laundering their ill-gotten proceeds.""
Prosecutors say the funds were funneled through international shell companies and used to purchase yachts, luxury cars and real estate.
Gary Cantrell, who oversees fraud investigations for the Health and Human Services inspector general's office, told NBC News , ""The taxpayers should be outraged by this. These are losses to the Medicare program that we all, as taxpayers, fund.""
Anything else? The investigation was conducted by the FBI in conjunction with the Department of Health and Human Services, and involved the IRS and 17 U.S. attorney's offices. Defendants in several states have been arrested, including New Jersey, Florida, Texas and California."
UK police arrest WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange after Ecuador pulls his asylum status,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/uk-police-arrest-julian-assange,"Police in England have arrested WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Thursday after Ecuador revoked his asylum status.
Here's what we know Assange was granted asylum by Ecuador in 2012, following an extradition request by Sweden where he was wanted on rape charges. This extradition request has since been rescinded, although Swedish prosecutors have not officially closed this case.
The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted Assange, according to a DOJ news release from Thursday.
""Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network (SIPRNet), a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications,"" the news release said.
London police have had a longstanding policy of arresting Assange if he ever left the embassy. After his asylum status was revoked, they were able to enter the embassy and arrest him.
The London Metropolitan Police said in a news release that Assange has been ""arrested on behalf of the United States.""
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said that during his time in the embassy, Assange had been ""discourteous and aggressive,"" had ""violated the norm of not intervening in the internal affairs of other states,"" had installed ""distortion equipment,"" and had ""mistreated guards.""
U.K. Home Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted that Assange was in custody, adding, ""No one is above the law.""
Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked classified data, decried Assange's arrest by ""the UK's secret police,"" calling it ""a dark moment for press freedom."" Of course, the police who arrested Snowden belonged not to some secretive outfit, but to the London Metropolitan Police.
Snowden himself is current living in Moscow where he has been granted asylum from the U.S. government, which wants to arrest him for leaking classified material.
Assange's WikiLeaks declared on Twitter , ""Ecuador has illigally [sic] terminated Assange political asylum in violation of international law."""
Breaking: City of Chicago makes good on threat against Jussie Smollett,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-sues-jussie-smollett,"The city of Chicago filed a lawsuit Thursday against ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett and made good on their threat to use legal means to secure the costs of the investigation into his racial attack claims.
Officials filed a civil complaint in Cook County Circuit Court despite a stunning dismissal of 16 felony charges that had been pressed against him.
The complaint said the city was ""seeking relief against Defendant for false statements he made to the City, and seeking recovery of the costs of necessary services provided by the City due to Defendant's violations...""
The city is suing for $130,000 to recoup their costs.
Smollett claimed that he was attacked by two men spouting Trump campaign slogans and that they hung a noose around his neck, doused him with bleach, and yelled racial and homophobic slurs.
""Defendants knew his attackers and orchestrated the purported attack himself,"" the filing claimed. ""Later, when police confronted him with evidence about his attackers, he still refused to disclose his involvement with planning the attack.""
Smollett has maintained his innocence of the charges, and appeared to escape unscathed after forfeiting a $10,000 bond and completing community service.
His lawyers excoriated the city for threatening to sue him and said he would defend himself vehemently against such a lawsuit.

"Kamala Harris, who supports abortion, slams ICE for immigrant women miscarrying while detained",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-who-supports-abortion-slams-ice-for-immigrant-women-miscarrying-while-detained,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) acknowledged the value of the lives of unborn children Tuesday in a tweet criticizing Immigration and Customs Enforcement for detaining pregnant women.
What did Harris say? "" Detaining pregnant women is dangerous. As many as 28 women have miscarried while in ICE custody over the past two years. I've called on this Administration to end this practice now,"" Harris wrote.
Why was she talking about this? Senate Democrats have petitioned President Donald Trump to reevaluate the policy that allows for pregnant illegal immigrants to be detained. They want the president to return to a policy of ""presumptive release"" for pregnant women, ""unless she is a threat to herself or others, or is a threat to public safety or national security.""
In February, a Honduran woman delivered a stillborn child after going into premature labor at an ICE detention center. According to NBC News, ICE has reported 18 miscarriages in fiscal 2018 and 10 in fiscal 2017.
What's the problem with Harris' statement? The government should certainly do everything in its power to provide good medical care to pregnant women who have been detained and to work toward reducing miscarriages, to the extent which it is in the power of ICE or Border Patrol to do so.
However, Harris' statement creates a dissonance with her stance on abortion , which she and other Democrats refer to as ""health care.""
If the lives of unborn children carried by women in immigration detention are worth protecting (which they are), then how can the lives of unborn children who are aborted be semantically dehumanized as ""fetuses"" or ""clumps of cells"" that can be eliminated by anyone for any reason?
Harris has expressed support for abortions even after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
""Senate GOP's proposed 20-week abortion ban is another example of politicians playing politics with health care. #NoAbortionBan,"" Harris wrote in 2017.

Democrats issue a serious demand to AG Barr about the Mueller report,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/democrats-demand-unredacted-mueller-report,"Democratic leaders signed a letter demanding an un-redacted version of the Mueller report from Attorney General William Barr on Thursday.
Barr is expected to release a version of the report with classified information redacted for various reasons, but Democrats are demanding a full version.
""As a matter of law,"" the letter said, ""Congress is entitled to the full report — without redactions — as well as the underlying evidence. We require that information in order to discharge our constitutional obligations: to develop and pass legislation and to conduct thorough oversight of the Executive Branch.""
Among those signing the letter were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).
Democrats also addressed the reasons for the redactions, adding, ""the Department of Justice has no legitimate reason for withholding these materials from Congress.""
They have been voicing disappointment and anger with Barr over his comments that there was ""spying"" on the Trump campaign in the 2016 election.
""I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016,"" he explained during testimony before Congress on Wednesday.
""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal, it's a big deal,"" he added. ""I think spying did occur.""

AOC attacks Rep. Dan Crenshaw—an Afghanistan war veteran—for not doing enough for 9/11 victims - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-attacks-rep-dan-crenshaw-an-afghanistan-war-veteran-for-not-doing-enough-for-9-11-victims,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came to Rep. Ilhan Omar's (D-Minn.) defense on Twitter on Thursday, and in the process she implied that Afghanistan war veteran Rep. Dan Crenshaw (D-Texas) hasn't done enough for 9/11 victims.
What's this about? Omar has been heavily criticized for comments about Islamophobia that referred to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as ""some people did something."" Even the New York Post took offense, devoting an entire cover to pushing back on her characterization of the tragedy.
Crenshaw didn't like Omar's comments either, and he said so on Twitter.
""First member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something.' Unbelievable,"" Crenshaw wrote.
Ocasio-Cortez jumps in: Ocasio-Cortez accused Crenshaw of taking Omar's remarks out of context, and then took a shot at him for not co-sponsoring a 9/11 victims fund bill and for not doing enough to stop white supremacist terrorism.
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote. ""In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost ALL US domestic terrorist killings. Why don't you go do something about that?""
The 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund is reportedly set to expire in December 2020 unless Congress reauthorizes it, according to The Hill .
What Crenshaw has done: Crenshaw is a retired Navy Lieutenant Commander who served as a Navy SEAL. He did tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan after joining the SEALs in 2006.
He lost his eye during his third deployment in 2012 in an IED blast In Afghanistan. Still he was deployed twice more before retiring, once to the Middle East and later to South Korea.
He has been awarded two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, and the Navy Commendation Medal with Valor."

""Clearly the foreign intelligence surveillance act was used against the Trump campaign,"" said Graham to CNN's Manu Raju.
""That's a form of surveillance,"" he explained. ""It is, surveillance is fine, but it's legal, it's authorized. Counter-intelligence investigation was opened up against the Trump campaign. That by its nature, surveillance is fine.""
""That's OK if it was legal,"" he added.
""I think what Mr. Barr is saying is that this didn't happen in the Clinton campaign, there was no counterintelligence investigation I know of against the Clinton campaign there was no FISA warrants opened up against her people,"" Graham said. ""The question is why did the government open up a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, and was the FISA warrant legit?""
""And those are issues that we need to find out about because the government did focus on the Trump campaign,"" he concluded.
The comment seemed to go against an earlier statement from the president, who seemed absolutely certain that the Obama administration had illegally spied on his presidential campaign.
""I think what he said was absolutely true, there was absolutely spying into my campaign,"" Trump said to the media.
""I'll go a step further,"" he added. ""In my opinion, there was illegal spying, unprecedented spying and something that should never be allowed to happen in our country again.""

""The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated,"" said Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
""Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable,"" she concluded.
Pelosi was identified as one of the targets of the unimplemented plan.
The plan was revealed in the Washington Post , which relied on anonymous sources in the administration, but it was confirmed by a statement from the White House.
""This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion,"" the White House responded in a statement.
The report says administration officials pressured the Department of Homeland Security to implement the plan twice in order to pressure political enemies of President Donald Trump, but they resisted.
The legal department of ICE also reportedly rejected the plan in February when the administration floated it again.
In addition to San Francisco, Chicago and New York were also considered as targets of the plan.

Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) tried to grill a group of CEOs of large banks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing, but ended up exposing a significant gap in her knowledge.
Waters cited the numbers showing sharp increases in student loan debt over the years, which in many cases has become truly unmanageable for the borrowers. She asked them what they planned to do about the problem.
""Who would like to answer first? Mr. Monahan, big bank?"" Waters said to Bank of America CEO.
""We stopped making student loans in 2007 or so,"" BoA CEO Brian Monahan replied.
So, Waters went down the line. ""Mr. Corbat?"" she said to Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat.
""We exited student lending in 2009,"" Corbat responded.
Waters still hadn't caught on, and asked J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon the same question. Dimon finally explained the situation to her.
""When the government took over student lending in 2010 or so, we stopped doing all student lending,"" Dimon told Waters.
Without missing a beat, Waters quickly pivoted to the topic of small business.
What Waters should have known: Before 2010, private banks issued federally-guaranteed student loans that were backed by the government (read: taxpayers) if they weren't repaid.
Starting in 2010, the Obama administration thought it best to cut out the middle man , so to speak, by having the federal government issue all loans directly.
This would've been useful knowledge for Waters to have going into a hearing with bank CEOs. Watch the exchange below:

General Electric agrees to pay $1.5B civil penalty over subprime mortgages - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ge-agrees-to-major-civil-penalty-over-subprime-mortgages,"General Electric has agreed to pay a $1.5 billion settlement for accounting violations related to a now-defunct business that handled subprime mortgages.
What's the story? According to a Friday news release from the Department of Justice, the money will be used to ""resolve claims involving subprime residential mortgage loans originated by WMC Mortgage (WMC), a GE subsidiary.
The DOJ explained that ""WMC, GE, and their affiliates allegedly misrepresented the quality of WMC's loans and the extent of WMC's internal quality and fraud controls in connection with the marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).""
The news release said that the situation with WMC subprime mortgages had gotten so bad at one point that ""In 2005, a WMC quality control manager described his department as a 'toothless tiger' with inadequate resources and no authority to prevent the approval or sale of loans his department had determined were fraudulent or otherwise defective.""
CNBC reported that shares of GE dropped by 0.6 percent after the announcement was made, adding that the reason the drop was so slight was that the settlement was ""largely expected.""
In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said ""As today's resolution demonstrates, the Department of Justice will continue to employ FIRREA [the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989] as a powerful tool for protecting our financial markets against fraud.""
""This settlement contains no admission of any allegations and concludes the FIRREA investigation of WMC,"" a GE spokesperson told CNBC.

NY Democrats block college tuition aid for Gold Star families — but approve $27 million in aid for illegal immigrants,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-block-aid-for-gold-star-kids-but-offer-aid-to-illegals,"Democrats in the New York Assembly blocked a college tuition bill that would expand aid to children in Gold Star families.
The move took place Tuesday, just a week after the Assembly's Higher Education Committee approved $27 million allocated from New York State's tax budget to assist illegal immigrants in receiving higher education.
What are the details? The committee voted 15 to 11 Tuesday to shelve the bill, according to Syracuse's Post-Standard .
Committee Chair Deborah Glick (D) said that that expanding aid to Gold Star families was not in the state budget.
According to the New York Post , the bill, had it passed, ""would have added funding to a program that provides free tuition, room and board at any SUNY or CUNY college to children, spouses and financial dependents of 'fallen soldiers' who died, became severely disabled or were classified as missing in action while serving in the military after 1990.""
""We will make every effort to ensure going forward, we have some additional resources allocated to the program so that as an entitlement, it is not falling short of the needs of our military families,"" Glick said.
The outlet reported that the existing program serves 145 students and costs just $2.7 million.
A week earlier, Speaker Carl Heastie (D) — along with Glick — revealed that $27 million from the state budget would be funneled into the Jose Peralta New York State DREAM Act , according to Newsweek .
Assembly member Carmen De La Rosa (D) said that the bill would help New York Dreamers achieve the ""American Dream.""
""With this budget, DREAMers in New York will finally be able to step out of the shadows and use higher education to live their American Dream,"" De La Rosa said in a release . ""By including the Jose Peralta New York State DREAM Act in the budget, we are sending a clear message to our immigrant population that we value their contributions to our state, and we are committed to helping them succeed.""
What else? Republican state Sen. Robert Ortt said that Glick should be ""ashamed"" over the decision to block the bill benefitting Gold Star families.
""Assemblywoman Glick should be ashamed of herself,"" Ortt said. ""We set aside $27 million dollars for college for people that are here illegally.""
He added, ""Apparently $2.7 million is all that the families of soldiers who are killed, get. If you're a child of a fallen soldier, you do not rank as high and you know that by the money."""
7-Eleven owner confronts shoplifting teen who says he and younger brother are hungry. The owner responds in an amazing way.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/7-eleven-owner-feeds-shoplifting-teen,"Last weekend, a clerk alerted Jitendra ""Jay"" Singh — owner of a 7-Eleven in Toledo, Ohio — that someone was pocketing items, so Singh checked out his video cameras and then confronted the teenage shoplifter, WTVG-TV reported .
""Do you want me to call the cops, or will you take it out?"" Singh told the station, recalling his question for the culprit.
But the kid's response was a game changer.
""He said, 'I'm stealing for myself. I'm hungry, and I'm doing it for my younger brother,'"" Singh noted to WTVG.
Amazing response
An employee had a 911 operator on the phone, CNN reported , but Singh told him to hang up.
""I said, 'Well, that's not food. You're stealing gum and candies. That's just something for munching,'"" Singh added to CNN. ""I said, 'If you're hungry, ask me. I'll give you food.'""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
So Singh sent the teen back to the aisles to grab pizza, sandwiches, and other food and let him have it all for free, WTVG said.
""It's not going to make any difference to me if I give him some food because we make a lot of food, we sell a lot of food,"" he added to WTVG. ""If he goes to jail then he's definitely not going to do anything good in life.""
'He has a great, big heart' ""He has a big heart,"" customer Cedric Bishop told the station. ""He has a great, big heart.""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
Bishop posted on Facebook about Singh's act of kindness, and the story is spreading.
&lt;br&gt; ""I thought that was just beautiful because the young man could have had a record,"" Bishop added to WTVG.
'I'm really proud of him' Singh's wife of nearly 30 years isn't surprised by the compassion he showed.
""I'm really proud of him, and it is the true self of himself,"" Neera Singh told WTVG. ""I know him; he's very kind.""
Image source: WTVG-TV video screenshot
She added to the station that her husband has always been caring person, and that they view helping others as part of their community duty.
""We are part of the community, and we have to help the community,"" Neera Singh added to WTVG. ""It is a part of our job.""
Jay Singh also told the station he'd be willing to hire the teen if he's old enough to work, and that he hopes at least the kid will be generous to someone else someday.

Gillette stirs up more controversy with ads aimed toward women,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/gillette-stirs-up-more-controversy-with-ads-aimed-toward-women,"Razor company Gillette is in the spotlight again. After taking heat for an advertisement urging men to stand up against "" toxic masculinity "" earlier this year, the firm is being ridiculed online over two separate plugs directed at women.
What are the details? Last week, Gillette released an ad for its Venus razor, which showed plus-sized Instagram model Anna O'Brien in a bikini with a caption telling women to ""go out there and slay the day.""
While the image was intended to encourage body positivity and acceptance, several Twitter users slammed it as a message embracing unhealthy lifestyle choices. The ad sparked plenty of online debate, causing Gillette to step in and defend their choice in models, saying, ""Venus is committed to representing beautiful women of all shapes, sizes and skin types because ALL types of beautiful skin deserve to be shown.""
According to an ""Inside Edition"" report on YouTube, O'Brien responded to her critics by telling ""Good Morning America,"" ""For a lot of people, all they see is fat. They don't see the joy. They don't see the happiness.""
Anything else? According to the Daily Mail , another Gillette ad aimed at females ""sparked outrage among 'disappointed' Twitter users"" by showing a woman shaving her arms.
Users accused the company of trying to sell more razors by depicting arm shaving as part of a ""normal"" routine, while others expressed concern that it gave women — especially teenagers — another reason to feel self-conscious about extra body hair.
Gillette responded to the backlash by issuing a statement saying, ""Many women have told us that they are not only shaving their legs or armpits as portrayed in advertising but other areas such as belly, arms or even toes! We used these examples in our advert to better depict women's realities.
""Our intent is not to put additional pressure on women but to help normalize the fact that hair grows in various areas of the body enabling a personal decision to be made on whether or not to shave it."""
Homeless man who participated in GoFundMe scam sentenced to 5 years' probation,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/homeless-man-who-participated-in-gofundme-scam-sentenced-to-5-years-probation,"A homeless Philadelphia man, who helped a New Jersey couple fabricate a heartwarming story on GoFundMe that drew in more than $400,000 in donations, was sentenced on Friday to five years of drug court probation, KYW-TV reported.
Johnny Bobbitt Jr. pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy to commit theft by deception in a New Jersey state court. As part of his plea deal, the 36-year-old was immediately transferred from the courtroom in Mount Holly, New Jersey, to an inpatient drug treatment facility following his sentencing. He's also expected to testify against Kate McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico, who were allegedly part of the scam.
If Bobbitt doesn't complete the program or if he violates probation, he will serve additional jail time, the judge said. He received 102 days credit for jail time served.
What's the backstory? McClure and D'Amico claimed that Bobbitt had given up his last $20 to help McClure when she ran out of gas on the side of Philadelphia freeway on Thanksgiving night in 2017.
They created a campaign that quickly went viral and donations poured in. The trio might have gotten away with the scam if Bobbitt hadn't filed a lawsuit last summer against the couple for allegedly cutting him off from his money.
As it turned out, McClure and D'Amico had met Bobbitt at a casino about a month earlier and together they concocted the ""fake feel-good story to compel donors to contribute to their cause,"" according to prosecutors.
The couple allegedly blew most of the money on lavish trips, expensive shopping trips, and a new BMW, among other things, according to prosecutors.
What happened to McClure and D'Amico? Last month, McClure pleaded guilty to one federal charge of conspiring to commit wire fraud. She's facing up to 20 years in prison for the charge, WCAU-TV reported.
McClure and D'Amico were each charged on the state level with theft and conspiracy.
D'Amico wasn't charged with a federal crime, and has denied any wrongdoing.
What else? Bobbitt also pleaded guilty last month to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in a federal court, according to WCAU. A sentencing date is not yet scheduled.
GoFundMe has since refunded all the money donated to the campaign."
Rep. Ilhan Omar claims famous George W. Bush quote is equivalent to her Sept. 11 comments,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rep-ilhan-omar-claims-famous-george-w-bush-quote-is-equivalent-to-her-sept-11-comments,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) defended her much-criticized description of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks as ""some people did something"" by referencing a famous quote from former President George W. Bush soon after the attacks had taken place.
Which Bush quote? On Sept. 14, 2001, Bush stood in the rubble of the World Trade Center, speaking to New Yorkers through a bullhorn. When someone in the crowd called out that they couldn't hear him, he gave what turned out to be one of his most memorable quotes:
""I can hear you! I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon.""
The crowd cheered and erupted in cheers of ""USA! USA! USA!""
What did Omar say?
During an event for a Muslim rights group in March, Omar said that the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR) ""was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.""
Omar faced backlash for this comment, which many say as dismissive of the terror attack. One of Omar's congressional colleagues, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), tweeted a video of her comments and added ""First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something'. Unbelievable.""
What happened now? In a tweet on Monday, Omar quoted Bush's speech in an attempt to defend her own comments: """"The people — and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!"" President George W. Bush Was Bush downplaying the terrorist attack? What if he was a Muslim.""
She ended her tweet with a thinking face emoji and a link to a ""Fact Checker"" Washington Post story by Glenn Kessler. In the piece, Kessler says that Omar's speech in its entirety reminded him of Bush's speech at Ground Zero, as well as a speech he gave three days later at the Islamic Center in Washington, D.C., where he cautioned Americans against blaming their American Muslim neighbors for the attacks.
Kessler did also note that CAIR was founded in 1994, not 2001, and that while not a terror group itself, it had been declared an 'unindicted co-conspirator' by a federal judge in a 2010 case related to a charity that funded terrorism."
"Principal says student's MAGA hat, shirt for America pride day violated dress code",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/principal-student-maga-hat-shirt-violated-dress-code,"Monday was a patriotic America pride day at New Hampshire's Epping High School, so freshman Ciretta MacKenzie put on her shirt and hat, both emblazoned with the phrase ""Make America Great Again"" — the slogan for President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign.
But not long after arriving on campus, Ciretta was called to Principal Brian Ernest's office, the Union Leader reported .
What happened? She told WFXT-TV that the principal said her MAGA hat and shirt violated dress code.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
According to Ciretta, Ernest also said Trump is a controversial president, and the principal added that he didn't want other students feeling uncomfortable or the day turning political, the paper added.
Ciretta, who turns 15 next week, told the principal she understood but, at the same time, Trump is still the president, the Union Leader reported.
When she asked what would happen if she couldn't find a different shirt, Ciretta told the paper she was informed that she might have to be separated from the other students.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
Ciretta told WFXT she borrowed a friend's sweatshirt and took off the hat but feels as though her First Amendment rights were violated.
The aftermath
Ciretta told the station she was ashamed after being asked to cover up and was upset by some classmates' comments.
""Some kids are making [me] feel like I'm uneducated and a bad kid for believing what I want to believe, and that's not right,"" she added to WFXT.
Ciretta also told the station there isn't language about political clothing in the student dress code: ""If it said 'no political gear,' I could understand why it was dress coded, but it didn't say that, so I feel like I'm obligated to have my own opinion and other people can have theirs. We don't have to agree; that's fine.""
School board chairman: 'I think it's very wrong' School Board Chairman Dave Mylott told the Union Leader he reviewed the dress code and doesn't believe it prohibits students from wearing shirts supporting Trump or any other political figure. He also told the paper he's concerned about the incident being viewed as a violation of a student's First Amendment rights.
""Personally, I think it's very wrong,"" he told the Union Leader. ""That's a personal opinion.""
Mylott added to the paper that if the concern centers on political intolerance among students and others in the school community, then perhaps the school needs better diversity training.
""I don't think it was maliciously intended,"" he noted to the Union Leader, ""but I think it sets a precedent that I don't think we want to have.""
Mylott also told the paper he'll address the issue at next Thursday's school board meeting.
What did the superintendent have to say? Epping School District Superintendent Valerie McKenney told WFXT that two students were asked to change their clothing but didn't mention what the students were wearing. She added to the station that an investigation has been ongoing since Tuesday and that ""we will take steps to remedy this situation for all parties involved and ensure that this type of situation never happens again in any Epping school.""
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
The MacKenzie family told the station they were planning on meeting with the principal Friday morning
What else did the student have to say? ""It's just a shirt, and it only says 'Trump Make America Great Again'; it doesn't say anything like 'Build a Wall,' so I don't get how it could be offensive, how it could be disrespectful,"" Ciretta added to WFXT.
She added to the Union Leader that it would've been better if the principal let her wear her clothing and made it clear that if anyone harassed her during the day that she should report it to administration so the problem could be addressed.
""I don't think I should have been told to cover it up,"" Ciretta told the paper.
What do her parents have to say? Ciretta's parents, Jason and Rose MacKenzie, told the Union Leader they were surprised by the principal's actions, adding that their daughter bought her MAGA shirt during her eighth-grade trip to Washington, D.C., last year.
Image source: WFXT-TV video screenshot
Rose MacKenzie told the paper she emailed Principal Ernest and questioned his decision.
The Union Leader said his response read, in part, that ""we need to separate political views from patriotism. In today's climate it is important to not mix church or state.""
She told the paper she believes Ernest was looking out for Ciretta in case others bothered her at school, and that it's sad he had to think twice about the clothing issue.
""I think it's a good time for people to stop and reflect: 'Am I teaching my child to be respectful of other people's opinions?' In my opinion the school shouldn't be put in that position,"" Rose MacKenzie added to the Union Leader.
She also told the paper that the ""real problem"" adults aren't practicing tolerance and respect — and so neither are children.
Jason MacKenzie told the Union Leader the decision was the ""easy way out"" and that it could have been more of a teachable moment for all students.
""Is censorship the answer or talking about it?"" he asked the paper. ""I thought it was the wrong way out.""
He also told WFXT that politics should be openly discussed at school.
""We don't want politics to be totally removed from school, it needs to be in school,"" Jason MacKenzie also told the station, adding that ""the way they went about it was remove everything; you don't want that."""
President Trump confirms he's considering shipping illegal immigrants to 'sanctuary cities',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-confirmer-considering-sending-illegals-to-sanctuary-cities,"President Donald Trump has said that he would be in support of immigration officials shipping illegal immigrants from the border and dropping them off in ""sanctuary cities ."" Sanctuary cities have laws in place to prevent cooperation between local officials and federal immigration authorities.
However, according to The Washington Post , senior attorneys working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement had already dismissed the idea as illegal, and the head of the agency had called it ""inappropriate.""
What's the story? On Thursday, the Post published a story saying that the Trump administration was considering releasing illegal immigrants into so-called sanctuary cities, in order to punish those who oppose the president's immigration policies.
According to the Post, one proposed drop off point for these immigrants was Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) district in San Francisco.
A spokeswoman for Pelosi denounced the ""administration's cynicism and cruelty"" and hopes of ""[u]sing human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.""
According to the report, ICE ""rejected the idea as inappropriate."" The person at ICE responsible for this was Matthew Albence, who is now the acting director of the agency. The Post also said that ""senior ICE attorneys told Albence and others that the plan was inappropriate and lacked a legal basis.""
MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff tweeted that a ""former DHS official"" from the Trump administration had also said that the plan was ""so illegal.""
An official from the Trump administration told the Post that the proposal was ""just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.""
What happened now? But on Friday, a day after the story ran, Trump seemed to have restarted that discussion.
Trump tweeted, ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only. The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy — so this should make them very happy!""
According to the Center for Immigration Studies , as of March 18 there were 33 sanctuary cities and 141 sanctuary counties in the United States. Eight state governments also have sanctuary laws: California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont."
Couple arrested after allegedly giving laxative-laced cookies to a group of striking school workers,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/couple-arrested-laxative-cookies-to-protesters,"An Iowa couple was thrown in jail on $1 million bonds earlier this week, after police were directed to a Facebook video showing the suspects allegedly committing multiple crimes — including crushing laxatives into batter for cookies that they later had delivered to protesters near their home.
What are the details? Bo Cosens, 29, and his girlfriend, Rachel Sharrock, 25, were reportedly bothered by vehicles honking in support of the on-strike employees protesting outside a nearby school. The couple voiced their frustrations on Facebook, explaining that they couldn't sleep due to all the commotion.
The duo allegedly cooked up laxative-laced sugar cookies and bragged about having them delivered to the workers, in a scheme to break up the picket line. CNN reported that while Cosens and Sharrack might have thought what they did was just a prank, police are taking the issue very seriously.
Law enforcement interviewed the protesters who confirmed receiving the baked goods, but no one had eaten them.
""They still had the plate of cookies, and I was able to confiscate them,"" Uhrichsville Police Sgt. Michael Hickman told the Canton Repository . ""We're currently looking for a lab to send the cookies in for testing to confirm that, in fact, that those have laxatives in them.""
One protester told WKYC-TV she was shocked after finding out what they assumed had been a ""goodwill offering"" from the couple was actually sent with malice. She expressed relief that none of the workers' children had stumbled across the cookies and gotten sick.
Anything else? The suspects did more than just show off their baking skills in the two-hour Facebook video. Police said Cosens threatened to get a gun and shoot the protesters during his rant, and also made an apparent drug deal in the footage posted to his social media account.
Cosens and Sharrock have each been charged with a felony for contaminating a substance for human consumption, and misdemeanors of complicity, disorderly conduct, and permitting drug abuse. Police are pursuing an additional felony against Cosens for trafficking drugs in a school zone."

What are the details? Johnson revealed the news in a March 22 Facebook post.
""K-LOVE has decided that they will not run any promos for my movie, Unplanned. So, a Christian radio network won't advertise for a pro-life movie,"" she wrote.

Activists pay for giant pro-life video in Times Square as a 'wake-up call' against NY's abortion extremism,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/giant-pro-life-video-in-times-square,"A giant video advertisement running in New York City's Times Square this week features powerful pro-life messages that Students for Life of America hope will grab New Yorkers' — including Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo's — attention.
""The extremism of New York's new abortion law is a wake-up call to pro-life Americans to get active,"" SFLA President Kristan Hawkins said in a news release . ""The Pro-Life Generation has arrived to vote out abortion.""
The ad, which started its three-day run Wednesday, coincided with the group's annual gala, ""Called to Bring Light to the Darkness,"" along with peaceful protests in Times Square.
What's the story?
The pro-life student organization is speaking out against the state's recently passed Reproductive Health Act, which allows a woman to abort her baby up to the point of birth.
""Late term abortion and infanticide for babies born during abortions are barbaric and represent the human rights issue of our day,"" Hawkins said. ""The Pro-life Generation will not forget the least of these among us, mothers and their pre-born infants, who deserve our help and support.""
Three women are featured holding pro-life messages in the 15-second video displayed on a 50-foot-tall screen. It runs about every three minutes in rotation with other ads.
""I reject abortion extremism,"" one sign reads, along with statistics that show only 7 percent of millennials support New York's new abortion laws.
""I don't trust Planned Parenthood,"" another sign reads. ""Today, Planned Parenthood will end the lives of 910 human beings.""
And, ""I am the Pro-Life generation,"" reads the third sign. ""The pro-life generation has arrived to vote out abortion extremism.""
Tens of thousands of visitors in Times Square are expected to see the video which will be played at least 720 times during its run.
Students for Life demonstrators stood along the sidewalk on Thursday holding 910 pink crosses. The crosses that were linked together symbolized the number of babies killed through abortion each day by Planned Parenthood.
""When I asked our supporters if they wanted to send a pro-life message in Times Square, the answer was a resounding YES,"" Hawkins said.
The group's demonstration was part of its Planned Parenthood Truth Tour across 130 college campuses. The organization hopes to bring attention to the ""abysmal standard of care that women endure in New York as a result of the Reproductive Health Act,"" according to the release.
What else?
SFLA said it had to fight to have its message featured in Times Square.
""We had to fight to have our message heard as twice companies pulled the plug on our custom-made ad after intensive negotiations,"" Hawkins said. ""But we don't give up on college campuses, even when facing threats of violence, and we didn't give up on sending a message to the vast majority of New Yorkers who reject infanticide and are horrified by the abortion extremism recently legalized in New York.""

Boston Globe op-ed suggests restaurant waitstaff ‘tamper’ with Republicans’ food,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boston-globe-op-ed-tamper-with-repubicans-food,"The Boston Globe is under fire after publishing an opinion piece suggesting that restaurant waitstaff tamper with Republicans' — particularly former President Trump staffers' — food.
What are the details of the article? Opinion writer Luke O'Neil wrote the article , which has since been deleted, titled ""Keep Kirstjen Nielsen unemployed and eating Grubhub over her sink.""
O'Neil seemed to suggest that Republicans and former President Donald Trump staffers should be punished for not being Democrats or liberals.
""As for the waiters out there, I'm not saying you should tamper with anyone's food, as that could get you into trouble,"" O'Neill wrote in his article. ""You might lose your serving job. But you'd be serving America. And you won't have any regrets years later.""
O'Neil also admitted that one of his life's ""biggest regrets"" is not urinating in conservative pundit Bill Kristol's food when O'Neil was a server.
""One of the biggest regrets of my life is not pissing in Bill Kristol's salmon,"" O'Neil wrote. ""I was waiting on the disgraced neoconservative pundit and chief Iraq War cheerleader about 10 years ago at a restaurant in Cambridge and to my eternal dismay, some combination of professionalism and pusillanimity prevented me from appropriately seasoning his entree.""
You can read the original article via web archive here .
What is being said now? Boston Globe editors apologized to readers in a note Thursday, and explained that O'Neil is not a staff writer for the publication.
""The Globe Opinion page has removed from its website an April 10 column by Luke O'Neil on former homeland security chief Kirstjen Nielsen because it did not receive sufficient editorial oversight and did not meet Globe standards,"" the statement read. ""The Globe regrets its lack of vigilance on the matter. O'Neil is not on staff.""
Before completely scrapping the article, the Globe attempted to salvage the mess.
""A version of this column as originally published did not meet Globe standards and has been changed,"" the statement read. ""The Globe regrets the previous tone of the piece.""
Has O'Neil said anything? O'Neil issued an apology in a brief and sarcastic statement.
""I am sorry for my commentary regarding the warden of the baby jail,"" O'Neil told The Wrap in a statement.
“In the famously left wing media, you can write op-eds advocating for turning Muslim weddings into bloodbaths forever but if you say human rights violators or war criminals deserve a pube on their salad it's over the line,"" he added.
O'Neil told The Washington Post that while he isn't necessarily an advocate for defiling conservatives' meals, he does believe that former Trump staffers should be harassed in public.
""I wasn't really advocating to piss in somebody's food, that's crazy,"" O'Neil said, adding to the outlet that he was a regular contributor at the Globe. ""But I do think these people should be made uncomfortable in public. I don't think that's a ... radical idea.""
He added, ""I do not apologize for it personally whatsoever.""
As for O'Neil's fate at the Globe — which the outlet has remained mum on — it doesn't even matter.
""They completely cut my throat on this,"" he told the Post. ""I will never write for them again."""
Lori Loughlin reportedly believes she did nothing that any other wealthy mom wouldn't do in college admissions scandal,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/lori-loughlin-believes-she-did-what-any-rich-mom-would-do,"Actress Lori Loughlin refused to accept a plea deal and believes she has done nothing that any other mother in her financial situation would do in the college admissions scandal, a source close to the actress reportedly told People magazine .
""From the beginning, she didn't want to take a deal, because she felt that she hadn't done anything that any mom wouldn't have done, if they had the means to do so,"" the unnamed source said, according to the report. ""To her, it wasn't egregious behavior. Was it entitled and perhaps selfish? Perhaps. But she didn't see it as being a legal violation.""
The ""Full House"" actress, along with her husband fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, allegedly paid about $500,000 in bribes to ensure their daughters, Isabella Rose Giannulli, 20, and Olivia Jade Giannulli, 19, were accepted to the University of Southern California, according to prosecutors. Coaches falsely recruited the girls as athletes to the university's crew team. Neither of the girls participated in the sport.
""It's just taking some time for it to sink in that what she was allegedly doing could be considered illegal,"" the source said, according to the magazine.
The couple is among some 50 wealthy people who were charged last month in the biggest college admissions cheating scandal ever prosecuted in the U.S.
What has happened since the charges?
Last week, Loughlin and her husband appeared for a brief hearing in a federal court in Boston.
The couple has rejected all plea deals that would result in jail time. Each faced 18 to 24 years behind bars if found guilty of their crimes.
""They weren't ready to accept that,"" the source, who is familiar with the legal discussions in the case, told People. ""They're really not seeing how serious this is.""
On Tuesday, federal prosecutors slapped Loughlin and her husband with additional charges of money laundering. Each additional indictment could land them in jail for up to an additional 20 years.
And the reality has begun to sink in.
""They were offered the carrot and the stick,"" the source told People . ""The carrot was that this can all go away and you can serve your time and put it behind you. Remember, they were facing 20 years, even before the latest charges. The stick was that [the prosecution] would and could pile on more serious charges.""
Now, they're trying to determine their next move.
""They decided to roll the dice, and it may have been a bad gamble. Now they're in worse shape than before,"" the source said.
But Loughlin's chances of negotiating a plea bargain with little jail time have likely faded.
""Obviously, the deal, if any, will be different than if she had taken a deal a week ago [before the latest charge],"" the source continued. ""She's a smart woman and she realizes that. But she is amenable to discussing how to put this behind everyone now. She's ready for this to go away.""
The couple remains free on bail.
What else? Actress Felicity Huffman, who was also charged, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud.
""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community,"" Huffman said in a statement. ""I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.""
The ""Desperate Wives"" actress faces up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and fines. She's expected to appear in court May 21."
Google blasted for labeling pro-life movie 'Unplanned' as 'propaganda',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/google-labled-unplanned-movie-propaganda,"The pro-life movie ""Unplanned"" has faced nothing if not an uphill battle ever since it readied to hit movie screens .
A big case in point was Twitter suspending the movie's account on its opening weekend while the film's Twitter followers inexplicably plunged to under 200 when it had amassed over 200,000 just hours after the suspension. Both the follower count and suspension were soon reversed, but the damage was done.
Now another tech giant has joined the fray.
What happened? Kelsey Bolar of the Daily Signal pointed out Thursday that Google labeled ""Unplanned"" as a ""drama/propaganda"":
""Who knew that 'propaganda' was a movie genre?"" she tweeted along with a screenshot of Google's search results. ""Google once again exposing its gross political bias."" Fox News said it verified the search results.
Another Twitter user compared Google search results of ""Unplanned"" with Google search results of left-leaning movies such as Vice"" — an unflattering look at former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney — and Michael Moore's documentaries, the network said, adding that Google didn't label the latter movies as propaganda.
Fox News also said it researched Google results of the ""God's Not Dead"" film series and documentaries by conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza — and again, none of them were labeled ""propaganda"" either.
What did Google have to say?
A Google spokesperson told Fox News that its ""Knowledge Graph"" analyzed web content on ""Unplanned"" and that a large volume of it described the movie as propaganda and created the label.
""When we're made aware of disputed facts in our Knowledge Graph, we work to fix the issues, as we've done in this case,"" the spokesperson told Fox News, which reported that Google updated its search results so that ""propaganda"" no longer appears.
Perhaps not coincidentally, feminist comic Samantha Bee called ""Unplanned"" an ""anti-choice propaganda movie"" during a recent ""Full Frontal"" episode.
Anything else? ""Unplanned"" also received an R-rating prior to its release for ""some disturbing/bloody images"" — which means that while a 15-year-old girl can get an abortion without parental consent, she can't enter a theater to watch ""Unplanned"" without a parent or guardian.
Glenn Beck last week sat down with Abby Johnson — the former Planned Parenthood clinic director who became a pro-life activist and is the subject of ""Unplanned."" Check out their conversation:

Protester rushes stage and throws 'bleach-like substance' at Daily Wire's Michael Knowles during a talk at a university,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/protester-rushes-stage-and-throws-bleach-like-substance-at-daily-wires-michael-knowles-during-a-talk-at-a-university,"A protester rushed the stage and threw a ""bleach-like substance"" at the Daily Wire's Michael Knowles during a speech he was giving at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, titled, ""Men are not women.""
Wait ... what happened? In a video posted by the Daily Wire, Knowles is giving his talk while hecklers try to shout him down.
""I didn't think I was this intimidating,"" he quipped.
""I believe that gentleman just threw paint on me,"" he commented, later noting that he didn't ""know what this substance is"" and speculating that it could be ""milk."" The Daily Wire described it as ""a bleach-like substance.""
He applauded security for taking the culprit down, before continuing his lecture.
""I think whatever sort of paint that guy tried to throw on me, I think it mostly landed on the lectern and on my speech. I've got a very glittery speech about how men are not women,"" he said with a laugh.
Periodically throughout the video, protesters can be seen at the door trying to force their way past security. Protesters were yelling slogans including ""trans rights are human rights,"" ""respect my existence,"" and ""hands up, don't shoot.""
After the incident, Knowles tweeted, ""A student tried to squirt bleach on me during my speech tonight. Lucky for me [h]e was a left-winger and couldn't even shoot a squirt gun!""
""These are the people conservatives on campus are up against,"" he remarked.
Knowles later clarified that authorities had informed him it was not bleach but an ""unknown odorous liquid."" He snarked that it ""appears the attacker was a hoaxer who was fine getting charged with assault but wanted to avoid a felony.""
What did the university say? In a tweet of its own, the university said, ""We have a responsibility to allow free speech, but we cannot condone physical disruptions of peaceful activities. We believe free speech can be exercised constructively in a way that doesn't put people at risk. We are gathering facts and will review campus policies & procedures."""
NYC Council passes bill to block employers from drug testing job applicants. Mayor de Blasio expected to sign.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyc-bill-blocks-employers-from-drug-testing-applicants,"The New York City Council approved this week a bill that would block many employers from forcing job applicants to undergo marijuana drug testing, the New Tork Times reported.
New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams sponsored the legislation that passed Tuesday in a 40-4 vote.
The legislation is the latest in a series of moves to ease marijuana restrictions in New York City while efforts to legalize marijuana have slowed at the state level.
""I'm proud that the city has taken action where the federal and the state government have stalled,"" Williams said, according to the Times.
Who would the bill affect? Both public and private employers in New York City would be affected by the law, as well as employers with headquarters outside the city.
Williams told the newspaper that it's not clear how many employers currently require drug testing.
The council also passed a bill that would prohibit marijuana testing for those on probation.
Olivia Lapeyrolerie, a spokeswoman for the mayor, told the Times that Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration fully supports the bills, which are headed to his desk for his signature.
The legislation would take effect one year after the bills are signed.
Are there any exemptions? The law would not apply to industries where safety is a factor, including law enforcement, construction workers, and those who supervise children.
It would not exempt federal and state employees who are subject to drug testing. The law would not change federal drug screening requirements mandated by the government on truck drivers and pilots, among others.
If someone on the job appears to be under the influence of drugs, the employer could have them tested.
What do supporters say? Dionna King, a policy manager at the Drug Policy Alliance, told the Times that she believes it's a positive move that could help remove the stigma attached to pot use.
""Through this legislation, there will still be a good number of folks who will no longer have to submit to testing just to get employment,"" King said.
What do opponents say? But some business leaders believe the bill is another example of government overreach by the City Council.
""This is another instance where City Council is interfering in the relationship between employees and employers,"" said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents business leaders."

He formally announced his bid for the Democratic nomination in a video released on social media .
This week on Glenn Beck's ""2020 Candidate Profile"" series, Glenn looked beyond former Vice President Joe Biden's troubles with touchiness, and did a deep-dive into the Democratic presidential candidate's alleged dirty dealings in the Ukraine.
After crediting journalists John Solomon and Peter Schweizer for their investigative fact-finding, Glenn launched into a detailed explanation of how Biden steered billions of dollars in aid to the Ukraine, while his son, Hunter Biden, raked in millions through a deal with a Ukrainian energy company.
""This blurs the ethical line so much that you can't even make out the line anymore. What Hunter Biden did may be technically legal, but it is grotesque. And the vice president should never have allowed this on his watch,"" Glenn said. ""This is as bad as anything the Clintons have done.""

"Crooks follow man home, pull gun on him outside door, demand entry. But victim refuses to back down.",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/crooks-follow-man-home-he-wont-back-down,"After a business owner closed up shop Thursday night in downtown Philadelphia, he returned home to a terrifying surprise.
He discovered two men had been following him, and as he got outside his northeast Philadelphia house, the two men confronted the 41-year-old victim with a gun and a crowbar and tried to rob him, police told WPVI-TV .
""A guy came behind him and then put a gun behind him and told him to open the door and let him in,"" the man's wife told the station off camera. ""He wanted to come to our house.""
No way But the homeowner refused to back down and began fighting with the crooks, WPVI said, pushing and kicking to keep them from getting into his house.
His wife explained to the station what happened next.
""I opened the door — not all the way — and my husband's right at the door. The guy's two steps down. He still tried to kick him while my husband sneaked in quickly. And we slammed the door shut,"" she told WPVI.
The couple locked the door and called 911, the station said.
One suspect caught Police arrived on the scene and spotted the two suspects in a backyard, WPVI noted.

""They chased the one male,"" Chief Inspector Scott Small told the station. ""That 38-year-old perpetrator was positively identified by the homeowner and his wife.""
Image source: WPVI-TV video screenshot
The suspect in custody will be charged with attempted robbery and other offenses, WPVI reported. The only description of the suspect who got away was that he was wearing dark clothing, the station added.
Nothing was taken from the home, and no one was injured, WPVI noted, and police found the crowbar they believe one of the suspects used.

'Things could've been a lot worse' The detective told the station it's a good thing the couple fought back.
""Great job done by the homeowner and his wife fighting off these two would-be robbers,"" Small told WPVI. ""Things could've been a lot worse. So it's a pretty good ending because we made one apprehension.""
Still, the homeowner's wife told the station they will likely move.

School suspends 2 students for sharing photos at gun range. Now the ACLU is helping the students sue the school.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/school-suspends-2-students-for-sharing-photos-at-gun-range-here-comes-the-lawsuit,"The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit on behalf of two high school students who received suspensions in 2018 for sharing personal photos of themselves at a firing range on social media.
What's the backstory? The suspension took place in March 2018 after the students — who have since graduated from the high school in question — shared the pictures in question on Snapchat.
One of the posts, according to Insider NJ, read ""hot stuff,"" and ""If there's ever a zombie apocalypse, you know where to go.""
Viewers of the posts apparently took issue with the teens at a legal shooting range with legal firearms and contacted the school to report the students.
As a result, school officials suspended the teens from school.
Much of the public did not react well to the school's decision, and parents flooded a 2018 school board meeting demanding that the policy — which they believed violated the teens' First and Second Amendment rights — be reversed.
What about the lawsuit? The ACLU of New Jersey filed the suit in federal district court on Wednesday along with law firm Pashman Stein Walder Hayden.
Alexander Shalom, a senior supervising attorney for the ACLU, said that the school had no right to suspend the students, or even discipline them as it pertained to the photos.
""There was no threat,"" Shalom said. ""No unlawful behavior whatsoever. That is classic speech. They communicated something to their friends off of school grounds, off of school property, off of school time, and the school simply doesn't have the authority to discipline then for what they're doing outside of school time.""
Shalom explained that school officials didn't even contact authorities to report any threat.
""One of [the teens] referenced the zombie apocalypse, so there could be nothing that could be perceived as an actual threat there,"" he added. ""I want schools to take threats seriously. What I don't want them to do is think they have the ability and the authority to discipline students for their lawful activities off of school grounds.""
The suit seeks to have the suspensions removed from the students' record, and an official note placed in the teens' academic records noting that the school violated the teens' rights. The suit also seeks a court injunction demanding that the school district not discipline students for protected speech when not on school grounds, and adjust corresponding school policies."
A fugitive in Pennsylvania mocked the sheriff's office on Facebook — and led police right to her,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fugitive-mocks-police-reveals-location-on-facebook,"A wanted woman in Pennsylvania mocked the police in the comments section of a Facebook post, and led police right to her .
What's the story? On March 27, the Greene County Sheriff's Office in Pennsylvania posted photos of their top 10 most wanted fugitives, including a woman named Chloe Jones who was wanted for failure to appear for plea court in a simple assault case.
Jones, under the name Chloe Tyler but using her own profile picture, commented on this post ""Do you guys do pick up or delivery?"" With four laughing emojis. She then proceeded to respond to people in the comments at least 30 different times.
But Jones made a crucial mistake while arguing with people in the comments section: She revealed her current location. As most people who are not Chloe Jones would probably expect, this led to her arrest.
After other commenters called her out and told her to turn herself in, Jones felt the need to inform them that she had only ignored her court appearance because she was at the trauma center at Ruby Memorial Hospital.
She also said that she had only been summoned to court for ""a simple assault case ... a plea deal for a fight I had in jail with another girl.""
Another commenter posted a screenshot from the Judicial System of Pennsylvania's website , showing 29 separate charges that had been filed against Jones since 2014, including driving without a license, driving an unregistered vehicle, reckless driving, theft, and harassment. According to judicial system records , she had been found guilty of eight of these charges and pleaded guilty to another 14.
How did the sheriff's office respond? On Monday, the sheriff's office posted on their Facebook that ""Ms. Chloe Jones and her witty comments are taking a hiatus from our Facebook comments section due to the jail not having internet for her to use."""
Georgetown students vote overwhelmingly in favor of paying a slavery reparations fee as part of their tuition,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/georgetown-students-vote-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-paying-reparations,"Georgetown University's undergraduate student body has overwhelmingly passed a referendum to add a reparations fee to their tuition. If approved by the school's board of directors, a fund would be set up for the descendants of 272 slaves sold by the Jesuit institution nearly 200 years ago.
What are the details? The New York Times reported that in 1838, the priests who ran the nation's premier Catholic institution of higher learning — known as Georgetown College back then — sold the slaves owned by the school in order to keep it afloat. After news of the sale surfaced in recent years, the university apologized, renamed two campus buildings in honor of individuals who had been sold, and implemented an admissions program giving favor to the descendants of any of the 272 slaves.
But many students say more should be done to try to right the wrongs of the past. Student leadership put forward a reparations proposal that would tack on an additional $27.20 tuition fee each semester, to go to the relatives of the slaves. The amount was selected to symbolize the number of slaves sold without placing too heavy a financial burden on students.
According to ABC News , not all students were on board . During a discussion ahead of the vote, some argued it wasn't their responsibility to pay to correct the actions of the institution from long ago — especially while working their way through college. Others expressed concern over how the funds would be spent.
On Thursday, the measure passed overwhelmingly with two-thirds of the vote. If Georgetown's board of directors give it a nod, the fund is expected to raise roughly $380,000 annually.
How did the university respond? In a statement to ABC, the university's media relations manager explained, ""Student referendums help to express important student perspectives but do not create university policy and are not binding.
""The university will carefully review the results of the referendum, and regardless of the outcome, will remain committed to engaging with students, Descendants, and the broader Georgetown community and addressing its historical relationship with slavery."""
