Climate change link to puffin deaths - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Helen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48447394,"Climate change link to puffin deaths By Helen Briggs BBC News 30 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The tufted puffin is common along the northern Pacific coast Climate change played a role in the deaths of thousands of puffins in Alaska, according to a study.
Scientists believe the birds starved to death when the fish they eat migrated north with rising sea temperatures.
The bodies of dead, emaciated puffins began washing up on beaches on Saint Paul Island in autumn 2016.
Up to 9,000 puffins and other seabirds died over the course of a few months, US scientists say.
And climate-driven shifts in fish populations, combined with the onset of moulting, may have caused this mass die-off.
""Mass mortality events are increasing in frequency and magnitude, potentially linked with ongoing climate change,"" researchers led by Timothy Jones of the University of Washington, Seattle, wrote in the journal Plos One .

The findings add to fears that rising temperatures are having unpredictable effects on birds, bats and other wildlife.
A recent study found birds nesting in the Arctic faced a bigger risk of having their nests raided by predators due to changes linked to climate change.

First Group to sell Greyhound buses in US - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48456840,"FirstGroup signalled it is considering breaking itself up by seeking a buyer for its Greyhound buses in the US.
The Aberdeen-based company, under fire from an activist investor, is also looking at spinning off its UK buses arm, First Bus.
Matthew Gregory, chief executive since November, indicated the group's train franchises could be reviewed and its focus now would be on North America.
The group's annual loss was £97.9m, narrower than £327m a year earlier.
The company is facing pressure from one of its investors to boost returns to shareholders in the business, which also operates the distinctive yellow school buses in the US.
Its shares jumped 12% as Mr Gregory announced the overhaul of the business which currently operates a fifth of all local bus services outside London.
The group also operates a number of rail franchises, including Great Western Railway, from more than 400 stations.
Is this Greyhound going to the dogs? FirstGroup boss departs after £327m loss He signalled that the First Rail business - which also operates the South Western Railway and TransPennine Express - was also under review, depending on future government strategy.
That rail division has generated £331m for the group over the last five years but the group now has ""concerns with the current balance of risk and reward being offered"".
The value of South Western Railway, which runs commuter trains out of London's Waterloo, is being written down by £100m.
Activist pressure Mr Gregory told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme this was a ""problematic franchise for us and more importantly for our passengers"".
That franchise - which it part owns - will not make any money for the group he confirmed to the BBC, pointing to industrial relations issues and ageing infrastructure.
The changes are being announced at a time when activist investor Coast Capital Management, which owns almost 10% of FirstGroup, wants to remove six of its 11 board directors and install seven of its own.
Image copyright FirstGroup Image caption FirstGroup operates school bus services in the US But Mr Gregory told the BBC that the review of the business had been under way before the pressure from the activist.
""We've been looking at our business for the last year,"" he said.
'Limited synergies' The focus will be North America, despite the decision to sell the Greyhound buses - which it bought in 2007.
""We have decided the future emphasis of our business is going to be our North American contract business. That's our First Student business - the yellow school bus that takes the kids to school - and the First Transit private transportation operator,"" he told the BBC.
Its UK-based First Bus arm - which, for instance, operates services in Glasgow, Manchester and Leicester - could also be sold or merged with other partners.
""We've identified that there are very limited hard synergies between our businesses, particularly between the UK and the US and we think now is the time,"" he said.
""We've put First Bus in a much better position. We've improved the customer offering, we've improved the margins and now is the time for us to look to separate that from the group,"" he told the BBC.
'More focused' Despite the jump in the shares after the overhaul was announced, at 120p they are lower than where they traded 20 years ago and well off their levels of around 800p when the Greyhound operations were bought.
The activist investor wants to boost returns and install new directors, including Steve Norris, the former Conservative transport minister, and Elizabeth Filkin, the former parliamentary standards commissioner.
The North America business generated 60% of operating profits in 2019 and includes its First Student business, which is the largest provider of student transportation in the area, twice the size of the next largest competitor, with a fleet of 42,500 yellow school buses.
First Student has an operating margin - a measure of profitability - of 9.4% while Greyhound's is 1.8% and First Bus' 7.5%.
""Our plans will create a more focused portfolio, with leading positions in our core North American contracting markets, and is the most appropriate means for us to deliver enhanced sustainable value for all our stakeholders,"" said Mr Gregory."

Neasamani: Who is he and why is the world praying for him? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Ayeshea Perera Bbc News,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48456790,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright BBC Tamil Image caption What happened to Neasamani? Who is Nesamani and why is seemingly everyone in the world praying for him on Twitter?
Many Indians were left wondering what was going on as #Pray_for_Neasamani and #Nesamani began trending first in India and then across the world.
And no-one seemed to know him - apart from those from the southern state of Tamil Nadu who began the trend.
Contractor Nesamani is actually a fictional character from a 2001 Tamil film played by an iconic comedian.
The ""plea"" to pray for him is based on a scene from the popular film Friends.
In the scene, Nesamani is a building contractor played by actor Vadivelu. He is trying to restore a historic building, but is struggling with his bumbling assistants who insist on taking everything he says literally.
Disaster soon strikes.
One of them, who is trying to fix a doorway at the top of a staircase, drops his hammer. It lands right on top of Nesamani's head, causing him to (very theatrically) fall down.
#Nesamani is still the number one trend in India on Twitter, and also the second trend worldwide. But why is this trending now?
According to Sowmya Rajendran, the film and features editor for the south Indian website The News Minute, it all began with a memes page in Pakistan on Wednesday.
Someone on the page, called Civil Engineering Learners, posted a picture of a hammer with the question ""what is the name of this tool in your country?"".
This prompted an alert Tamil Facebook user to comment that it was called Suthiyal in his language and then added, without any context whatsoever, that ""contractor Nesamani's head was broken... with it"". You may also like: "

5G mobile networks offer faster downloads, but customers will need a new handset to take advantage.
At first, the service will only be available in limited areas of Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London and Manchester.
Rival Vodafone plans to switch on its 5G service in the coming weeks.

On Thursday morning, BBC Breakfast had the UK's first live news broadcast over 5G. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Rory's first 5G live broadcast
Many news channels currently link several 4G connections together in order to stream video over mobile networks.
But using the 5G network, the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones was able to broadcast in high definition using just one Sim card.
5G is not just about faster internet speeds. It also offers lower latency than 4G connections: that means less of a delay between sending a request and getting a response.
For Rory, that meant a shorter delay between hearing a question in his earpiece and answering live on TV. Report
One technical hitch delayed Rory's broadcast. Test transmissions had ploughed through the data allowance on the Sim card, so it needed a top-up before Rory could go live on BBC Breakfast.
That makes EE's 10GB data cap on its cheapest price plan seem a little bit limiting - although EE says the data cap was reached after several days of test transmissions. Is 5G safe?
Analysis by BBC Reality Check
Some people have questioned whether there are health risks from 5G, but experts and regulators say there is no evidence of danger.
Similar fears were expressed around earlier mobile internet and wi-fi.
More than 200 scientists appealed to the EU to halt the roll out of 5G, saying that electromagnetic fields may be harmful to humans and the environment, and could increase cancer risks.
But the EU says exposure from 5G will be far below limits set by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
""There has been no evidence to suggest that electromagnetic waves from mobile phones and networks are bad for your health,"" says Prof Malcolm Sperrin, Director of the Department of Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust.
He says a causal link between mobile phone use and cancer in humans is unproven.

Conrad Black plans return to the Lords after Trump pardon - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48457490,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""I'm not bitter."" The former owner of the Daily Telegraph, Conrad Black, has said he plans to return to the UK House of Lords after the US president pardoned him for a fraud conviction.
Lord Black spent more than three years in a US jail and was released in 2012.
In May, Donald Trump pardoned Lord Black after he wrote a book praising the president.
But Lord Black, a long-time friend of Mr Trump, said the pardon was not a response to his writings.
Instead, the former media mogul said the executive clemency order - which the US Department of Justice says is an expression of a US president's forgiveness - was ""putting right an injustice"".
Conrad Black: 'I should never have been charged' Idea Trump would condone collusion 'insane', says Conrad Black Commenting on the effect of the pardon, Lord Black said: ""Officially in the United States, I've never been charged and I won in the end.""
""It was a war, there are casualties in wars,"" he told the BBC's Michelle Fleury in an interview at his Toronto home. ""I lost the time, I lost a lot of money, but as you can see my standard of living isn't bad.""
Now, Lord Black is planning a return to the House of Lords for the first time since he was convicted in 2007.
Lord Black said that he had already planned to retake his seat after being released from prison but the presidential pardon ""makes it easier"".
Good timing He said the ongoing Brexit debate made the timing of his return fortuitous.
""The truth is, these last 15 years, I haven't been as interested in British politics as I was before - in the Thatcher years.""
""It could be quite interesting again, in fact it is as of right now - its very interesting,"" he said. But the peer claimed that it was not just Brexit that attracted him back to the chamber.
""It's my good fortune that at a time when it is feasible, it happens - by happy coincidence - that it is a time of great fermentation in British public affairs.""
Lord Black said that he had, at first, assumed the president's call - confirming his pardon - was a prank by the Daily Mail newspaper in the UK.
Not bitter He described his mood as ""good"", adding: ""I'm not bitter"". He said: ""The one good thing about the legal problems is that I got to write a lot more.""
Last year he published the book Donald J Trump: A President Like No Other.
In the opening chapter of the book, he writes: ""Like the country he represents, Donald Trump possesses the optimism to persevere and succeed, the confidence to affront tradition and convention, a genius for spectacle, and a firm belief in common sense and the common man.""
Lord Black renounced his Canadian citizenship when he became a British peer in 2001 but moved back to Canada following his release from a Florida prison.
In 2014 Canada stripped him of its highest honour, the Order of Canada, which was awarded in 1990 for a lifetime of achievement.
In 2007 Lord Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders of $6.1m (£4.7m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper assets without the approval of the company's board.
He had been forced out of the company by shareholders in 2003.
After his conviction, he was sentenced to 78 months in prison. He then pursued a partially successful appeal, in which a judge cut his sentence down to 42 months.
""Lord Black's case has attracted broad support from many high-profile individuals who have vigorously vouched for his exceptional character,"" a White House statement announcing the pardon said.
It said he had made ""tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought"" and that, ""in light of these facts"", and he was ""entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency""."

Despite the lack of progress both sides said they wanted to continue the talks.

The opposition argues that Mr Maduro's is not the legitimate president of Venezuela because his re-election in 2018 was ""neither free nor fair"".
They are calling for a transition government to take over until fresh elections can be held. They are also demanding that the electoral council, which is largely controlled by the government, be reformed to guarantee its independence. What does the government want? Image copyright AFP Image caption President Maduro has retained the backing of most of the armed forces
President Maduro said on Wednesday that he wanted ""peace, dialogue, harmony, understanding"".
Earlier this month, he suggested bringing forward parliamentary elections , an offer dismissed as ""a farce"" by Mr Guaidó, who pointed out that the National Assembly was the only body controlled by the Venezuelan opposition. What happens next?
Mr Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets in new anti-government demonstrations to increase the pressure on President Maduro. ""There was no immediate agreement, so the chance that we have today is to remain in the streets,"" he told Fox Business Network.
He also again urged the armed forces to switch their allegiance to him.
Despite the willingness expressed by both sides to continue talks under Norway's auspices, it is not clear if and when another meeting will take place. How did it come to this?
Mr Guaidó has been recognised as interim leader by more than 50 nations, including the US and most in Latin America but Mr Maduro retains the loyalty of most of the military and important allies such as China and Russia.

While in Ireland, Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, will meet Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar.
The meeting is expected to take place in Shannon.
Image copyright PA Image caption Donald Trump bought the Doonbeg hotel and golf course in 2014 Mr Trump had been due to visit the Republic of Ireland last November, but the trip was postponed for scheduling reasons.
Speaking to RTÉ, the president said: ""We're going to be staying at Doonbeg in Ireland because it's convenient and a great place.
""We'll be meeting with a lot of the Irish officials.
""It'll be an overnight stay and I look forward to that.""
On Wednesday, the taoiseach told the Dáil (Irish parliament) that he was looking forward to discussing free trade with the president during his trip.
Mr Varadkar said, while Mr Trump's current focus is on China, he may turn to the EU later in the year and therefore it was important to be ready for that eventuality."

He said the man who led the inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election had ""wanted to be the FBI director, and I said 'no'"".
The president also also claimed the two had had a ""business dispute"".
On Wednesday, Mr Mueller reiterated that his inquiry did not exonerate Mr Trump of obstruction of justice.
The former FBI director said charging a sitting president with a crime was not an option.
Prominent US Democrats called for the impeachment of the Republican president following Mr Mueller's comments.
At the White House on Thursday morning, Mr Trump said impeachment was a ""dirty, filthy disgusting word"".
He said Mr Mueller was a ""true Never Trumper"", referring to his Republican critics during the 2016 White House race, and that his investigation was ""a giant presidential harassment"".

Israel's Netanyahu: Is 'King' Bibi's crown slipping? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Tom Bateman Bbc News,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-48457222,"Image caption If he stays in power, Netanyahu is poised to become Israel's longest-serving leader Benjamin Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for a decade.
His grip on power has been extraordinary, vacuuming up multiple government positions - at one stage a meeting between prime minister and ministers of defence, foreign affairs and health would have theoretically consisted of him talking to himself.
Supporters and opponents alike point to the leverage he has had over vast areas of life in Israel including business, security and parts of the media.
Not to mention how the US-educated articulate English speaker became the international face of Israel.
No wonder some people, using his nickname, call him ""King"" Bibi. What are the corruption allegations?
But on Wednesday night, the King sat ashen-faced in the centre of Israel's parliamentary chamber as the hands of a wooden clock outside moved towards midnight; his sense of control ebbing away with every tick.
That was the deadline for him to get enough political parties to sign up to a record fifth governing coalition, which he would lead as prime minister.
On paper this was a straightforward task. When he celebrated victory in the elections last month, the right wing and religious parties - usual coalition allies with his Likud party - could tot up 65 seats, well over the number needed for a majority in the 120 seat Knesset.
But no coalition agreement was reached and his new government collapsed before it had even began.
So what went wrong? Sticking point
The headline issue concerns a fracture that runs deep in Israeli society, between the religiously conservative ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, which is growing in number, and secular Jews whose lifestyles often align more closely with those in many Western nations.
On one side was Avigdor Lieberman, leader of a secular nationalist party. He supports a new bill forcing quotas onto ultra-Orthodox young men to serve in the army.
On the other side the ultra-Orthodox parties, which would make up a sizeable chunk of the coalition, object to national conscription for religious reasons.
Mr Netanyahu needed both groups in his right-wing coalition. But they clashed. The ultra-Orthodox parties said they went as far as they could to accommodate the military draft law; Mr Lieberman said not far enough.
Ultimately the Israeli PM could not break the deadlock, leading to the collapse of coalition talks. Cloud of suspicion
But beneath the row was a deeper political rivalry, and a sense among some observers that Mr Netanyahu's crown was slipping.
The Israeli leader and Mr Lieberman, a former defence minister, are old allies-turned-adversaries on the right wing of Israeli politics.
Mr Netanyahu is facing corruption charges and his loyalists reportedly want coalition partners to agree to immunity from prosecution while he is in office. Image copyright EPA Image caption One-time ally Lieberman could be Netanyahu's biggest threat
It has left him politically weakened, with a narrower range of options to choose from in building a coalition, and arguably more biddable to demands from potential partners.
His rivals, like Mr Lieberman, are likely to have sensed his growing political vulnerability.
They calculate that the Netanyahu era may soon be over, and are jockeying for position.
In addition the Israeli prime minister's pitch to the electorate has been as the sole guarantor of Israel's security.
He has tried to deflect international attention away from Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, and to move the issue down the agenda domestically.
It has added to the sense that no realistic political solution to the conflict is on the horizon. Tough talk
Mr Netanyahu's right-wing coalition partners tend to judge him by his performance on defence.
Last year, Mr Lieberman resigned as defence minister, portraying the prime minister as ineffective in his handling of militants in Gaza.
And in this atmosphere, a new political force rose to prominence at the April election - a centrist party led by a former Chief of Staff Benny Gantz, who also tried to outflank Mr Netanyahu arguing for a more muscular approach.
In the next election Mr Lieberman thinks he can win 18 seats (up from his current five), selling himself as tougher on security and a bulwark against what he sees as religious fanaticism governing Israel.
The Likud party accused Mr Lieberman of trying to ""eliminate"" the prime minister with a ""lust for power"".
As the left wing, Israeli Arab parties and the traditional ""peace"" camp decline in popularity, the second Israeli election in a year may again revolve around rhetoric over military prowess and national identity.
Mr Netanyahu will fiercely try to hold on to his crown. Related Topics "
Irish bank Permanent TSB fined €21m for tracker mortgage failures - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48458053,"Image copyright RTÉ Image caption The fine is part of an ongoing investigation into tracker mortgages One of Ireland's main banks has been fined €21m (£19m) for ""serious failings"" regarding thousands of its tracker mortgage customer accounts.
The fine is the biggest imposed by the Central Bank in Dublin under its sanctions procedure.
Permanent TSB has admitted to 42 separate regulatory breaches, involving 2,007 customer accounts.
The move is the first in a series of ongoing investigations into tracker mortgages.
Tracker mortgages are a type of variable rate mortgage.
'Unacceptable harm' What makes them different from other variable rate mortgages is that they follow - track - movements of another rate.
In a statement, the Central Bank said the fine ""reflects the gravity with which the Central Bank views PTSB's failings and the unacceptable harm PTSB caused to their tracker mortgage customers"".
""From extended periods of significant overcharging to the loss of 12 family homes and 19 buy to let properties,"" it said.
As well as the reprimand and fine, Permanent TSB has to date also been required to pay €54.3m in redress and compensation to affected customers.
The Central Bank's tracker mortgage investigation found that:
The bank failed to warn certain customers about the consequences of the decisions they might make relating to their mortgages; The bank did not have adequate systems and/or operational controls in place to enable them to meet their contractual and regulatory obligations; The bank denied certain customers their corrected tracker rates between 2009 and 2010; Made incorrect legal interpretations of contractual terms and conditions. The Central Bank's director of enforcement and anti-money laundering, Seána Cunningham, said Permanent TSB ""failed to put their customers first, with distressing and, in some instances, devastating consequences"".
""My message today is clear. Where firms fail to protect their customers' best interests, our response will be robust and the consequences will be serious."""

Google and Apple were among 47 firms to sign an open letter, saying it was a ""serious threat"" to trust and security.
The GCHQ plan would mean, in some circumstances, security services got copies of encrypted messages.
The technique resembled the way that GCHQ currently used wiretaps to listen to unencrypted chat, said the agency. Silent copy
The plan for a so-called ""ghost protocol"" was first floated by the UK National Cyber Security Centre's technical director Ian Levy and GCHQ's chief codebreaker Crispin Robinson in November 2018.
The proposal was intended to add to the debate about strongly encrypted messaging systems that security services have struggled to break.
Instead of asking for encryption systems to be weakened so they can be cracked, the plan would instead copy messages and send the duplicate on to a third recipient.
That other recipient would be able to read the message because they possessed a key corresponding to the one with which it was encrypted.
The ghosting system would only be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" to gather information about suspects, said the discussion paper about the technology."

Australia's 'new wave' of stereotype-shunning comedy - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-48306932,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hannah Gadsby, Josh Thomas and Tim Minchin have won fans internationally The comedy Australia exports to the global stage is evolving. And, as Gary Nunn reports from Sydney, experts say it's moving Australia away from past stereotypes and into thoroughly modern, woke humour.
The nation's comedy has long punched above its weight overseas, basking in the success of cult classics and ""ocker"" humour - brash, endearing tales of an unpretentious Australia.
More recently, that humour has occasionally drawn controversy or been criticised as dated. It has paved the way for new players to enter the scene.
""We're in a really interesting cultural moment where there's discontent for comedy that punches down [to the powerless] instead of up [to the powerful],"" says Dr Stayci Taylor, a screenwriting expert at RMIT university.
Whether the shift is in quantity, quality or tone, one thing seems clear: Australian humour is having a moment. 'Seriously formidable'
The new guard's most prominent member is Hannah Gadsby. Her stand-up show, Nanette, won international acclaim for pivoting away from self-deprecation and into serious testimony halfway through.
Nica Burns, director of the Edinburgh Comedy Awards, says Gadsby is part of a national influx: ""In the last decade, Aussie comics have grown in number, talent, confidence and ambition across every comedy genre.""
She cites recent Australian winners of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe best comedy award - Gadsby (2017) and Sam Simmons (2015) - as well as Tim Minchin, named best newcomer in 2005. Image copyright Ryan Lash / TED Image caption Hannah Gadbsy discusses the influence of her show, Nanette
""Given you're a small population, you're a seriously formidable group in comedy now,"" she tells the BBC.
In a recent TED talk on how she ""broke"" comedy , Gadsby said: ""I punched through [the punchline]... so the audience could hold my pain.""
Dr Taylor says: ""Gadsby started as an outlier but then it became very apparent she's leading an exciting new Australian wave which is subverting comedy.""
Audiences are more sophisticated and want to be taken further than before, she says: ""There's less tolerance for the dominance of the straight, white male position."" What worked previously
Early successful incarnations in Australia's modern comedy history include Barry Humphries' character Dame Edna Everage, which gained fame in the 1960s, and the film Crocodile Dundee (1986). Both played off what many regard as now-dated Australian female and male stereotypes. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Barry Humphries as Dame Edna
Then there was what Dr Stuart Richards calls ""the glitter cycle"", a trio of Australian cult comedy films: Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), Muriel's Wedding (1994) and Strictly Ballroom (1992).
""At heart they're still ocker comedies - quintessentially Australian in their endearing lower-middle-class humour which develops empathy,"" says Dr Richards, a screen studies expert from the University of South Australia.
Immediately preceding the newest wave of Australian comedy, and bookending the old school era, was a raft of exports which included Chris Lilley's Summer Heights High (2007) and Kath & Kim (2002-2007).
The former satirised Australian private v public school culture; the latter lampooned domestic suburbia. Both took aim at lower socio-economic classes. Image caption Chris Lilley's Ja'mie King became a cult figure for international audiences
Dr Ian Wilkie, lecturer in comedy writing at the University of Salford, says Kath & Kim joined with contemporary taste for ""shows with a more dangerous 'underclass' family and non-metropolitan vibe"".
Lilley's comedy won many fans, but some his characters and use of blackface caused controversy.
""It makes you wonder about comedy's often inevitable bluntness,"" Dr Wilkie says. ""Its need for a target is problematic in making gentler, inoffensive, satire."" Woke comedy
More recently, comedians such as Gadsby, Minchin, Adam Hills, Zoe Coombs Marr and Josh Thomas have directly tackled topics such as misogyny, homophobia and disability discrimination.
The theme tune to this new era could be Minchin's song Prejudice, which satirised opposition to political correctness with the lyrics ""only a ginger can call another ginger ginger"".

Hills, who was nominated for an Edinburgh Comedy Award, has his own UK show, The Last Leg, a pun on the fact he only has one.
It's popular with UK audiences, as Dr Karina Aveyard from the University of East Anglia explains: ""It's sensitive but also pushes the envelope - the disability of him and his co-stars gives him a platform to do a different type of comedy than if he'd been an able-bodied white male comedian."""

European elections 2019: Ireland South recount 'could take up to 28 days' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48464786,"Image caption Counting in the Republic of Ireland began on Sunday A full recount of Irish European Parliament constituency Ireland South is to begin on Tuesday.
The move follows a recheck of votes for the fifth and last seat.
It saw Sinn Féin's Liadh Ní Riada just over 300 votes behind the Greens' Senator, Grace O'Sullivan.
The returning officer at the count in Cork, Martin Harvey, said it could take up to 28 working days and cost more than a €1m (£883,180) before the result is known.
He said it may be difficult to get the necessary staff to carry out the recount.
Whoever gets the fifth seat will not become an MEP until if and when the UK leaves the European Union.
Image copyright RTE Image caption Liadh Ní Riada ran as Sinn Féin's MEP candidate for the Ireland South constituency Sinn Féin said the recount is justified because the gap between the two candidates is 0.04% of the votes cast.
The Green Party said it is disappointed that there will be a full recount, but understands why.
Two of the five seats had been filled.
The former president of the GAA and an outgoing MEP, Sean Kelly, was returned for Fine Gael with Fianna Fáil's Billy Kelleher taking the second seat.
The independent left wing candidate, Mick Wallace, and Fine Gael's outgoing MEP, Deirdre Clune, were set to take the third and fourth seats.
The recount means that it could be mid-July before all the members of the European Parliament are known.
On Wednesday night, counting in the Ireland Midlands-Northwest constituency ended with Fine Gael's Mairead McGuinness and Maria Walsh taking seats along with the independent left-winger Luke 'Ming' Flanagan ahead of Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy.
'Big questions' Speaking on RTE radio, Mr Carthy said the party's disappointing showing in the European and local elections means there are big questions for Sinn Féin to answer.
He added that it is clear that people who previously voted for Sinn Féin either did not vote for the party this time or did not bother to turn out to vote.
The media has, he said, magnified a number of localised disputes including allegations of a bullying culture in the party by former members which may have caused some problems.
And many people, he added, are frustrated by the failure of the Northern Ireland institutions to be re-established."

Muhammad Javed, 59, used a hammer and machete to kill Saeeda Hussain, 53, in the living room of their east London home in February last year.
The Old Bailey heard she had ""feared the shame"" if his violence towards her was reported to authorities.
Javed, of Staines Road, Ilford, will be sentenced on 21 June.
Prosecutor Julian Evans told the trial jury the couple's children were aware of Javed's ""violence and... mistreatment"" during their marriage of more than 30 years.
However, Mr Evans said Ms Hussain ""did not want them to report it to the police or to others outside the family"".
""She feared that the defendant would be deported.
""She also feared the shame that, in her mind, such revelations would bring.""
Image copyright Met Police Image caption Mother-of-five Saeeda Hussain was murdered at the home she shared with her husband Mr Evans told the court that Javed had suspected his wife was ""having an affair or was seeing other men behind his back"", suspicions the prosecutor claimed ""were entirely without merit"".
The court was told Javed had installed CCTV at their home to monitor the mother-of-five's behaviour and the couple slept in separate rooms.
A pathologist estimated that there were at least 46 separate impacts from the machete and at least seven blows from the hammer from the attack on 13 February.
'Very bad news' The court heard Javed then changed out of his blood-stained clothes, left the weapons near his wife's body, locked the living-room door, and left by a window.
He then contacted his daughter's father-in-law and told him: ""You are going to hear very bad news"".
At about 18:00 GMT he then went to the local police station and told an officer: ""I have just killed my wife"".
When police entered the house they found a discarded boiler suit covered in blood, which Det Insp John Marriott said was ""probably donned... to avoid getting his wife's blood on his clothes"".
He added: ""If ever a case shows the importance of contacting police if you are in, or aware of, an abusive relationship, then this is it."""

The main things households are doing to try to help include using fewer plastic bags, buying more energy-saving lightbulbs and reusing clothes and furniture.
Recycling rates are up, and at 48% are coming close to the stated target of 50% by 2020 for rubbish collected by local authorities.
But other statistics show more work is needed to address significant environmental issues.
Only a third of Northern Ireland's rivers are considered to be in good condition, and greenhouse gas emissions are up, with agriculture, transport and energy contributing the most.
Agriculture is also responsible for the bulk of ammonia emissions, which can have an impact on the biodiversity of sensitive protected sites such as peatlands. Image caption The burning of smoky coal is also causing problems for air quality in some urban centres

Jo Swinson confirms Liberal Democrat leadership bid - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48468251,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The party's deputy leader Jo Swinson said: ""I am the person to lead it"" Jo Swinson has announced she will run to become the next leader of the Liberal Democrats.
The party's deputy leader told the BBC the country was ""crying out"" for a movement ""to challenge the forces of nationalism and populism"".
She faces competition from former Energy Secretary Sir Ed Davey, who has declared his intention to stand.
Current leader Sir Vince Cable will step down on 23 July and nominations to replace him close on 7 June.
The pro-EU Lib Dems came second in the UK's European elections last week , taking 20.3% of the vote.
Ms Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire and a former equalities minister, was thought likely to stand when former leader Tim Farron quit in 2017 but ruled herself out and went for the deputy position instead.
Asked if she would be running this time, she told BBC Question Time: ""Yes, I am going to stand to be leader of the Liberal Democrats.
""I will set out my plans but I happen to think that this country is crying out for a liberal movement that will challenge the forces of nationalism and populism and the Liberal Democrats need to be at the heart of that movement and I'm the person to lead it.""
'Some mistakes' Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, she said she could not currently envisage taking the party into coalition with either of the main parties, adding that the Conservatives and Labour were ""both led by Brexiteers"".
""We're a party that wants to remain in the European Union because of the huge benefits that gives us"", she added.
Ms Swinson admitted that the Lib Dems had made ""some mistakes"" when they entered coalition with the Conservatives in 2010, but said the decision to enter government had been ""the right choice"" at the time.
The Lib Dems say 6,000 new members have joined the party since polls closed in last week's European Parliamentary elections, making it 11,000 new members this month. The party says its membership now stands at more than 100,000.

__ Meanwhile, a poll of 1,763 adults by YouGov for the Times, on which party they would back if a general election was held now, was topped by the Lib Dems on 24%, ahead of the Brexit Party on 22%.
The Conservatives and Labour were tied on 19% and the Greens on 8%. The poll, conducted on 28 and 29 May, also found that nearly 70% of voters believed Brexit was the most important issue facing the UK.
But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticised the poll because his party was grouped under ""others"", alongside the SNP, Plaid Cymru, UKIP, Greens and Change UK in the first question, rather than appearing more prominently:
He tweeted:
Skip Twitter post by @Nigel_Farage You Gov have released a poll showing the Lib Dems top in the country, with @brexitparty_uk second. They did not have the BP option on the list and we were hidden in ‘others’. Looks like an establishment attempt to suppress the truth. #FakePolling

YouGov's director of political and social research, Anthony Wells, said its main consideration when asking questions was ""what is most likely to produce the most accurate results, not what would help one party or another"".
Candidates for the Lib Dem leadership must be an MP supported by at least 200 members spread across at least 20 different local parties.
They must also have the backing of 10% of the parliamentary party - currently, the party has 11 MPs.
Lib Dem members will then have the final say on who becomes leader."

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said the two men had a ""cordial conversation"" about abortion laws in the US despite their difference of views.
Mr Trudeau has said he is concerned about the ""backsliding"" of women's rights south of the border.
The PM and the VP also discussed issues related to trade and China.
In the US, the contentious issue of abortion has been front-and-centre this year as nearly a dozen states have moved to pass new, stricter laws on abortion.
Critics have pointed at what they see as an orchestrated challenge to a decades-old US Supreme Court ruling that protected a woman's right to choose an abortion.
Mr Pence is known for his staunch opposition to abortion.
Mr Trudeau, on the other hand, is outspoken in support of reproductive rights.
The two were able to diplomatically sidestep any tensions when asked about that discussion by reporters on Thursday.
Mr Pence said the Trump administration ""will always stand for the right to life"".
""But those are debates within the United States and I know that Canada will deal with those issues in a manner that the people of Canada have determined most appropriate."""
Business lobby group CBI warns Tories over no-deal Brexit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/48465791," The Confederation of British Industry has warned Conservative leadership candidates over a no-deal Brexit.
Such a scenario would do ""severe"" damage to businesses, the body - which supported Remain - told all the MPs running to lead the party.
Director general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a no-deal Brexit should be an option ""that is not even considered"".
She was speaking after the CBI sent an open letter to candidates.
In its letter the CBI says: ""Firms large and small are clear that leaving the EU with a deal is the best way forward.""
""Short-term disruption and long-term damage to British competitiveness will be severe if we leave without one. The vast majority of firms can never be prepared for no-deal, particularly our [small and medium-sized] members who cannot afford complex and costly contingency plans.""
She told Today that businesses were not ready for a no-deal scenario and said ""this idea that we are ready is just not true"".
""How can you be prepared for £20bn of increased customs costs? How can be you prepared for tariffs rising overnight? 150,000 businesses with no systems in place to do deal with this.
""This is not a responsible strategy for a government to have.""

What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but Theresa May asked for an extension and the date was pushed back to 31 October.
The official race to succeed her gets under way after she stands down in early June, but jostling between Tory candidates has already begun.
'Long-term damage' Esther McVey, the first of the 12 confirmed contenders to stand in the Tory leadership race , said earlier this week in a column for the Daily Telegraph the UK needs to ""actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal"".
Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have said they would like to renegotiate the terms of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels, but would enforce the current October deadline.
Gerard Lyons, co-founder of Economists for Brexit, told Today: ""I don't think any of the leadership candidates are advocating no deal as their plan A.
""One has to have a plan B. No deal, whether we like it or not, has to be plan B.
""The CBI, remember, was amongst Project Fear three years ago and since the referendum we've seen one million jobs added the economy,"" he said.
Mr Lyons, a former advisor to Mr Johnson, told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would just be a ""stepping stone"" to a free trade agreement.
He said the challenges facing the UK would be ""better addressed outside"" the EU and that a focus needed to place on issues such as investment in infrastructure and investment to address ""imbalances"" in the economy."

Inmarsat lays big satellite order with Airbus,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48455168,"Inmarsat lays big satellite order with Airbus By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent 30 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption Artwork: The satellites benefit from R&D sponsored by the European, UK and French space agencies London-based Inmarsat, the UK's largest satellite operator, has announced a major expansion of its network.
The firm is buying three new spacecraft to augment its Global Xpress system, which provides connectivity to on-the-move and out-of-the-way users, such as those on ships, planes and oil rigs.
European aerospace giant Airbus will build the satellites.
Inmarsat says their novel technologies will make it easier and faster to react to market developments.
For example, rather than taking up a ""fixed"" position in the sky, as is the case with all the company's current platforms, these new spacecraft will be designed with the expectation that they might have to move around to match demand.
Their telecommunications payloads will also be fully reconfigurable through software updates - not something that is generally practised today. Handover for fully flexible satellite
Airbus aims to have the new satellites ready for launch in 2023 and says their compact and stackable design means they could conceivably go up on the same rocket.
Neither the manufacturer nor the operator are revealing a price. Inmarsat says merely that the cost will fit within its capital expenditure schedule.
It has a contract for three platforms but an option for more in the future.
Inmarsat made financial headlines earlier this month when its shareholders accepted a $3.3bn (£2.6bn) take-over by a group of buyers known as the Bidco consortium. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Inmarsat control room: The company is looking for a more lithe response to market demand What's different about these satellites?
The new telecommunications satellites are a brand new concept that Airbus calls ""OneSat"".
This incorporates R&D innovations that were sponsored by the European, UK and French space agencies.
The satellites are described as modular in design and are said to be much quicker to assemble than previous platforms.
They are also ""all electric"", meaning everything onboard is solar-powered, including their propulsion systems. These use highly efficient ion engines to control the movement of the spacecraft.
But more significant still is the adaptability of the design.
Traditional large satellites are configured on the ground for specific tasks. This might mean, for example, transmitting only on certain radio frequencies with shaped antennas to carve out the necessary ground ""footprint"".
The smaller OneSats, on the other hand, can have their coverage, capacity and frequency all altered through software amendments.
Their antennas can also be re-shaped electronically. Image copyright AIRBUS Image caption Artwork: It's possible the three compact satellites could be launched together, Airbus says Why is this approach so important for Inmarsat?
Inmarsat took a decision at the beginning of the decade to refocus much of its business on communications links that work in the Ka part of the radio spectrum.
These faster connections have been provided through a network the space company calls Global Xpress, or GX - and they've been very popular with customers.
The firm has already launched four large Ka satellites to service GX and has a fifth one on order.
The new trio will bring further additional capacity, but Inmarsat also intends to use the Airbus spacecraft in a different way.
They will not sit fixed over a specific region with a specific job for their entire lives like the current generation.
Rather, the company sees these latest GX spacecraft as a kind of rapid reaction force that can be shifted around the globe to overlay existing services and meet new market trends, wherever they arise.
""Our business can be very lumpy geographically,"" explained Inmarsat chief technical officer Peter Hadinger.
""Consider the straits where maritime traffic converges; likewise the major international airports of the world where flights go in and out. And our business is also lumpy in time because as we know airlines fly to a schedule that has 'flocks' of them going from one continent to another in roughly the same timeframe.
""We need to be able to adapt and move our capacity around to meet the demand where it's needed and at the time it's needed,"" he told BBC News. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The requirement for satellite telecommunications is lumpy in space and in time
In the past, Inmarsat has tended to purchase a set of big spacecraft on a generational basis every seven years or so. The flexible nature of the new ""production scale"" OneSats means more frequent, smaller orders will likely be made, to take advantage of the latest technological developments that keep the network as a whole as modern as it can be.
""These new satellites individually are much lower cost than our previous satellites,"" said Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce.
""That means we can take more calibrated risks, perhaps focusing on particular niche markets, or on particular regions or on a particular customer. A satellite just for the military, for example.
""It's about speed and agility, and that's what the future of this company is all about.""
Airbus will prepare the various modules that go into the production of the satellites at its centres across Europe, but the UK factories at Portsmouth and Stevenage are sure to have key roles.
Thursday's announcement will be very welcome news to those factories given how flat orders have been in the sector over the past few years. Related Topics"
The man who might have stopped Sri Lanka's Easter bombings - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-48435902,"The man who might have stopped Sri Lanka's Easter bombings 31 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Sri Lanka attacks Image caption Fatima, Mohammad Razak Taslim's wife, shows a photo of her husband on her mobile phone When bombs planted in churches and hotels killed more than 200 people in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, few had realised that the nation had a problem with Islamist militancy. One man who did, reports the BBC's Secunder Kermani, was Mohammad Razak Taslim.
Lying on a hospital bed, Mohammad Razak Taslim's face contorts with pain. The left side of his body is completely paralysed, but he reaches out with his right hand, trying to clutch at his wife and brother-in-law who stand anxiously over him.
His wife, Fatima, presses a handkerchief to his head. One side of his skull has caved in. It's where he was shot in the head in March. Ever since, he's been unable to speak, unable to walk.
Police believe Taslim was one of the first victims of the Sri Lankan extremist network, linked to the Islamic State group, that would go on to kill more than 250 people in a series of suicide bombings on churches and hotels on Easter Sunday in April.
According to officials he was shot on the orders of the ringleader of the attacks, Zahran Hashim.
Months before the bombings, Taslim, an earnest 37-year-old local politician from a Muslim-majority town in central Sri Lanka, had been at the forefront of efforts to investigate the extremists.
Taslim's story encapsulates both how the country's Muslim community actively tried to stop the emergence of radical elements in their midst, and how the authorities failed to recognise repeated warning signs ahead of the Easter attacks.
The town of Mawanella is just a few hours' drive east of the capital, Colombo. It's surrounded by a lush green landscape, and the area is dominated by Buddhist and Muslim communities.
In December last year, a number of Buddhist statues around the town were vandalised - an attempt, officials now believe, to inflame tensions and provoke communal rioting.
Taslim was a member of Mawanella's town council, and also worked as the co-ordinating secretary for a national cabinet minister.
I met his wife, three young children and extended family at their modest home in a village outside Mawanella. Coconuts crashed noisily onto the roof from the trees above as Fatima told me about her husband.
Taslim often volunteered to help others in the community, she said. He had played a prominent role in organising support for residents affected by floods and landslides in previous years. So, when the Buddhist statues were desecrated, it was natural that he stepped up to help investigate.
""He always used to say people of different races and religions should live together in unity.
""He said, 'What they did is wrong, our religion does not condone such acts…. We need to catch those responsible.'""
Police made a number of arrests, but the chief suspects, brothers Sadiq and Shaheed Abdul-Haq, disappeared. Find out more
What we know about the Easter bombings
The pair would be placed on a ""Most Wanted"" list after the Easter Sunday bombings and arrested. Their alleged role in the attacks isn't clear and they are yet to go on trial, but investigators believe Sadiq Abdul-Haq may have travelled to Syria in 2014 and met figures linked to the Islamic State group.
I met one young man in a village close to Mawanella who had been part of the brothers' inner circle. He wanted to remain anonymous, but claimed they would preach that Sri Lanka ""is the land of Allah, and no-one else can be worshipped... Non-Muslims have to convert or pay jizya (an Islamic tax).""
The brothers came from a deeply religious family, and their friend said they regularly talked about the obligations of jihad, both in a spiritual and a military sense. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A soldier guards a mosque in Colombo in 2018, at the time of anti-Muslim riots in Kandy
A relative of the brothers, who was a leading figure in an Muslim student organisation they were all part of, told me he had regularly argued with them, telling them that ""violent and aggressive behaviour is not accepted in Islam"". In 2015 the organisation expelled both brothers.
Their relative said the men had been deeply affected by communal riots around the nearby city of Kandy in 2018, when Buddhist mobs targeted Muslim-owned businesses and residents.
Sadiq Abdul Haq allegedly said: ""They are taking away our lives, our properties... We have to do something,"" the relative claimed.
After the Abdul-Haq brothers went on the run, Taslim was involved in efforts to track them down, and kept in touch with police investigating the case. At one point he walked with them deep into the jungle where it was thought the brothers were hiding.
In January detectives told him they had received new and startling information during the interrogation of some of those suspected of vandalising the Buddhist statues - a stash of explosives had been hidden in a remote piece of farmland about 100 miles away.
Taslim went with detectives to the site, a coconut grove in the north-west of the country. There police discovered nearly 100kg of explosives, detonators, tents and a camera.
Taslim's wife says when he returned home, he was worried. ""There must be more explosives out there,"" he told her. ""We must get together as a community, find those responsible and deal with them.""
The volume of explosives found should have alerted the authorities to the danger of a jihadist attack. But while four people were arrested, in a country where the security forces had long focused on the dangers posed by ethnic Tamil separatists, it seems the possibility of Islamist violence wasn't regarded as a high priority.
It has now been revealed that the explosives found on the farmland are linked to some of those directly involved in the suicide bombings, including the ringleader, Zahran Hashim.
Hashim was a preacher from the east of Sri Lanka. He too had been flagged as an extremist long before the attacks.
Over the years, he had repeatedly fallen out with mainstream Muslim groups, both in his home town, and in other places he visited, including a village close to Mawanella.
He became well-known for uploading fiery videos on social media. In one, the background is an image from the 9/11 attacks. Image caption One of Zahran Hashim's videos
Hilmy Ahamed, the vice-president of Sri Lanka's Muslim Council, says he and other members of the council were shocked by the level of hate in the online sermons and raised concerns with the intelligence services.
But the authorities couldn't manage to track Hashim down and prosecute him. Ahamed admitted he ""never dreamt"" that Hashim would go on to ""become a threat to the entire nation"".
But we now know Hashim was plotting to carry out a deadly attack in Sri Lanka, and after the discovery of the explosives, it seems he was worried Taslim was getting in the way of his plans.
A senior Sri Lankan police source told me that one of Hashim's close associates confessed that Hashim ordered Taslim be killed for acting as an ""informant"".
In March, just over a month before the Easter attacks, a gunman quietly entered Taslim's house in the early hours of the morning. He was lying in bed, next to his wife, and his youngest son. The gunman shot him once in the head.
""At first I thought the phone charger had exploded, but I looked and it was fine,"" Taslim's wife told me. ""Then I tried to wake him up, and I could smell gunpowder… I reached out to him and I realised he wasn't conscious. I thought he was dead.""
Taslim was rushed to hospital. He survived the attack, but it's not clear if he will ever fully recover.
Sri Lanka's army commander, Lt Gen Mahesh Senanayake, is now playing a leading role in the investigation into the Easter Bombings. He told me it had been confirmed that the ""same network"" was also responsible for the desecration of the Buddhist statues, the explosives hidden in the coconut grove, and the shooting of Taslim.
He admitted that the previous incidents should have made the authorities more alert to the dangers of a jihadist attack. Instead, warnings by the Indian security services in the days and hours leading up the bombings weren't followed up, due to what the army commander referred to as problems with ""intelligence sharing"" between different departments. Image caption Fatima is proud of her husband's sacrifice
Taslim's family say, despite his injuries, he is able to understand what they say to him, and occasionally, to scribble responses. When he learned of the Easter attacks, his wife says he wrote her a message and began to cry, ""I told you something like this could happen.""
In the aftermath of the bombings there have been episodes of anti-Muslim rioting in Sri Lanka, with shops attacked and at least one person killed. Claims that the community is harbouring terrorists have angered many Muslims, especially in light of the repeated attempts to help police or raise concerns with the authorities.
Taslim's wife is proud of his sacrifice. ""He would say to us, 'I've given you everything you need, so we should work on reaching paradise in the afterlife… We have to help those around us, that's what our religion teaches.'"" Related Topics"

Najafi, who served as Tehran's mayor from August 2017 to April 2018, is a veteran reformist politician who has held posts as prominent as education minister and at one point served as President Hassan Rouhani's economic adviser.
He was forced to resign as mayor of Tehran after being criticised for attending a dance recital by young girls.
How did his wife die? Mr Najafi told reporters that he had lived separately from Ms Ostad, and that he had unsuccessfully tried to get her consent for divorce.
After a quarrel with his spouse, Najafi said he took a loaded gun and a pillow and headed to the bathroom, where Ms Ostad was.
At the sight of the gun, the woman ""was scared and threw herself"" on him but this only caused a scuffle during which Najafi shot her, he said.
Mr Najafi said he had considered suicide after killing his wife, but ""later thought the best way would be through legal means"" and turned himself in.
Tehran's police chief told reporters that Mr Najafi's permit to own a gun had expired four years ago.
What reaction has there been? Ms Ostad's killing and Mr Najafi's subsequent treatment by police have led to heated debate on social media.
One comment asked whether ""power and connections"" would ""prevent the appropriate application of the law"".
© EPA Mr Najafi, a veteran politician, has also served as an economic advisor to President Hassan Rouhani Several people focused on Mr Najafi's consumption of tea at the police station, which they said appeared to have taken place before the evening Iftar meal, when Muslims break their fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
""So murder breaks your fast?"" one user asked.
What is Iran like? Another posted an image of police officers in an altercation with a man accused of breaking his Ramadan fast in public, writing: ""Comparing how the police treat murderers with how they treat those who break their fast in public.""
However Tehran Police Chief Hossein Rahimi later insisted that the beverage had been served after Iftar. ""We served tea to the case officer after Iftar and offered some to him as well, which is a humane gesture,"" he was Quote: : d as saying by ISNA news agency.

Why Californian wine will soon cost more in Beijing - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Karishma Vaswani Asia Business Correspondent,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48455253,"Why Californian wine will soon cost more in Beijing By Karishma Vaswani Asia business correspondent 31 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption American wine growers will be particularly hit by China's tariff hike China is set to hike tariffs on a range of US goods on Saturday, marking the latest strike in the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
Beijing will raise tariffs on $60bn (£47.6bn) worth of US products, which will hit more than 5,000 items.
The rates on products, including wine and meat, will rise from between 5 and 10% to as much as 25%.
China is targeting goods to hurt US producers and the Trump administration.
At the same time, heightened trade tensions have weighed on Chinese investment to America, stoking fresh uncertainty for the US economy. What products will be hit with tariff hikes?
Tariffs will be raised on a total of 5,140 products. They include:
• Meat: Fresh or cold boned sheep meat, smoked or salted beef, chopped meat
• Alcohol: Sparkling wine, regular wine, other fermented beverages, gin, tequila
• Oil seeds and fruits: Sunflower seeds, other oily seeds and fruits, plants mainly used as medicine
• Frozen foods: peas, corn, legumes, spinach, fruits and nuts Trade wars and protectionism explained Who do these tariffs hurt?
American farmers: The trade dispute has seen Beijing target US farmers, including those supplying agricultural products like meat, grains and soybeans.
Higher tariffs mean these goods will become more expensive for Chinese consumers, who have other options.
""Farmers need some relief from this ongoing trade war and we're getting hit from all sides between the economy, the weather and these retaliatory tariffs,"" said Dale Moore, executive vice president at The American Farm Bureau Federation .
""We've been holding on for a long time. For some of our farmers that time is about to run out,"" he said.
Mr Trump has promised $16bn in assistance to help farmers. These are politically sensitive states for the US president - the folks who got him elected - which is why Beijing has put so many agricultural products on the tariff list.
American vineyards: The US wine industry is also at risk and the cost of American wine in China is set to rise. Tariffs here are set to increase by an additional 15%.
It will mark the third time China has imposed tariffs on American wine in 14 months : The first was in April of last year, then September in retaliation to US tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods - and now this final round. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption American wine will become more expensive for Chinese customers
""With each additional round [of tariffs] it becomes more and more difficult to compete in the fastest growing wine market in the world,"" says Robert Koch, president of the Wine Institute.
According to the industry group, China will soon be second only to the US in the total value of wine sales.
Tariffs have already knocked the industry. The first set of duties imposed last year saw American wine exports to China fall 25%.
But it is not Chinese drinkers, but American producers that will pay the price.
The Chinese are still drinking good wine from places like Australia, New Zealand and Europe - countries that have seen their orders grow since tariffs on American wine were put in place. Will China still invest in the US?
Beijing's tariffs on American goods - while politically targeted to cause the most pain - aren't going to have much of an impact on US economic growth .
After all, China is only able to tax around $120bn worth of America's goods - that's how much it imported from the US last year.
Economists say at most, the US might see about one tenth of its gross domestic product shaved off by Beijing's tariffs.
But what could hurt the US is reduced Chinese investment.
Separately, a report by the US-China Investment Project found Chinese investment into the US plummeted by 60% in 2018 , partly because of the souring political climate.
And it is having an impact on future Chinese investment too, according to an April survey conducted by the US China Business Council.
""While most executives reported plans to maintain or accelerate investment in each other's markets in the next year, most who indicated they would be curtailing such investments were Chinese,"" said Anna Ashton, director of business advisory at the US China Business Council.
Of course, the trade war isn't the only factor at play. The Chinese had been cutting back on investment in the US for other reasons even before their trade fight began.
But it is likely to accelerate the pace of the pullout. Analysts say this could potentially be another drag on US economic growth, as foreign direct investment typically creates jobs and opportunities. What could happen next?
China is directly targeting the US where it hurts most.
Beijing could go even further, as I've said before , and in recent days it has even warned about curbing its rare earth exports to the US .
China is by far the largest producer of these raw materials, used in a range of products from electronics to renewable energy - and vital for many American industries. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is targeting the US in politically-sensitive sectors ahead of 2020 US elections
If it does curb rare earth exports to the US, it would be challenging for American companies to find alternative sources quickly.
Of course Beijing isn't immune to this pain, it has problems of its own.
You've heard this often enough by now to know that it's true - no one wins in a trade war - and China's gearing up for a long battle ahead.
But it doesn't have to worry about winning over voters in the next election. Related Topics "

Derek Rotondo said the bank denied him a parental leave benefit available to all employees who are ""primary caregivers"" of a newborn.
He filed a lawsuit against the firm in 2017, and a class action led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) followed.
The ACLU said the settlement was the first of its kind.
The organisation led the class action on behalf of male employees who claimed they were unlawfully denied access to paid parental leave on the same terms as mothers from 2011 to 2017.
In the complaint, Mr Rotondo said that when he sought to take 14 weeks of ""primary caregiver"" leave after his son was born, JP Morgan told him that fathers were only eligible for two weeks of paid parental leave unless they could show that their spouses or partners were incapacitated or had returned to work. Firms told to be clearer on parental leave
The Wall Street bank has agreed to create a $5m fund to compensate the class members, the ACLU said.
As part of the settlement, JP Morgan will maintain a gender neutral parental leave policy and train those administering the policy.
""I'm proud that since I filed my charge, [JP Morgan] has clarified its policy to ensure that both male and female employees who wish to be the primary parental caregiver have equal access to those benefits.""
Mr Rotondo's lawyers said the settlement is the highest recorded in a US parental leave discrimination case, according to reports.
""I love my children, and all I wanted was to spend time with them when they were born,"" said Mr Rotondo.
JP Morgan Associate General Counsel Reid Broda said the firm was ""pleased to have reached an agreement in this matter and look forward to more effectively communicating the policy so that all men and women employees are aware of their benefits"".
""We thank Mr Rotondo for bringing the matter to our attention.""
JP Morgan does not admit liability in the settlement, ACLU said. Related Topics "
Claus von Bülow: Socialite cleared of trying to murder his wife dies aged 92 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48469908,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prosecutors argued Claus von Bülow wanted to get rid of his wife to inherit her wealth Claus von Bülow, the Danish-born socialite who was convicted and later cleared of the attempted murder of his wealthy heiress wife, has died aged 92.
Von Bülow was found guilty of trying to kill Martha von Bülow with an insulin overdose in 1982.
But the verdict was overturned three years later at a second trial which was sensationalised by the media.
The events were turned into a 1990 Hollywood film, Reversal of Fortune, starring Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons.
Martha Von Bülow, also known as Sunny, was found unconscious at the couple's Rhode Island mansion in 1980 and spent 28 years in a coma before she died. Image copyright Getty Images
Von Bülow died at his home in London on Saturday, his son-in-law Riccardo Pavoncelli confirmed to the New York Times .
Prosecutors at Von Bülow's trial, in Newport, Rhode Island, said the Copenhagen-born socialite wanted to get rid of his wife in order to inherit her wealth and be free to marry a mistress.
But the defence depicted his wife, who suffered from low blood sugar, as an alcoholic and drug abuser who drank herself into a coma.
Von Bülow was convicted in 1982, before being cleared on appeal, then acquitted at a second trial in 1985. Image copyright Getty Images
Two years later, he agreed to divorce his wife and give up claims to her fortune of up to $40m (£32m), along with a $120,000-a-year trust fund she had set up for him.
The film, for which Irons won an Oscar, was based on a book by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who worked on Von Bülow's appeal and second trial. "

Pratap Chandra Sarangi was virtually unknown outside the state of Orissa (now Odisha), until he became a social media sensation this week.
A picture of the austerely-clad man leaving his bamboo hut to take the oath won him hearts in India, where rags to riches stories always strike a chord.
But despite his newfound popularity, Mr Sarangi has a chequered past.
He was the leader of the Bajrang Dal, a hardline rightwing group, when a Hindu mob brutally killed Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines and his two children in 1999.
Christian community leaders accused the Bajrang Dal of the killings, but an official inquiry found no evidence that any one group was behind the attack.
After a lengthy trial, Dara Singh, a man with links to the group, and 12 others were convicted in 2003. But the high court in Orissa commuted a death sentence for Singh two years later.
It also freed 11 others who were given life terms in prison, saying there was not enough evidence to support their convictions. Image copyright Biswaranjan Mishra
Orissa-based journalist Sandeep Sahu says that Mr Sarangi has given several interviews, including to him, in which he spoke passionately against what he called the ""evil designs"" of Christian missionaries who are ""bent on converting the whole of India""."

But it was Rishik Gandhasri, Saketh Sundar, Shruthika Padhy, Erin Howard, Sohum Sukhatankar, Abhijay Kodali, Christopher Serrao and Rohan Raja who took home the top title.
As the final eight stood strong in the 18th round, Jacques Bailly, the bee's pronouncer, told them: ""We're throwing the dictionary at you, and, so far, you are showing the dictionary who's boss!"" Image copyright EPA Image caption They had to spell words such as omphalopsychite and geeldikkop
Saketh, 13, told Associated Press: ""I don't know if I would've won if they kept going. I was super tired because it was like [midnight], and I was exhausted.""
Each will now receive a prize of $50,000 (£39,700), a $2,500 savings bond and reference books.
Among the words they spelled correctly were omphalopsychite, a person who stares at their navel to induce a mystical trance, and auftaktigkeit, a musical principle where all musical phrases begin on an upbeat.
There were quite a few tough medical terms in there too - including erysipelas, an infection that causes red rashes on the skin, and geeldikkop, a type of plant poisoning that can affect sheep. Related Topics "

At the company's annual general meeting on Thursday, shareholders had the opportunity to vote on Mr Zuckerberg's leadership.
Mr Zuckerberg is both Facebook's chief executive and the chairman of its board of directors.
He controls about 60% of the voting power and would only have lost if he voted against himself.
Some investors have called for him to step down as chairman as they believe this would help him focus on running the company.
One of those investors is Trillium Asset Management, which owns Facebook shares worth about $7m (£5.5m).
""If he can focus on being the CEO, and let somebody else focus on being independent board chair, that would be a much better situation,"" Jonas Kron, senior vice-president at Trillium, told the BBC ahead of the vote.
He said Mr Zuckerberg could take inspiration from Google's Larry Page and Microsoft's Bill Gates, who are company founders but not chairman of the board. Image copyright Reuters Image caption A small group of demonstrators gathered outside the AGM venue
Despite more than a year of privacy and data protection scandals, Facebook has exceeded estimates for revenue growth and continues to add new members.
At the annual general meeting, Mr Zuckerberg declined to answer a shareholder question about why he would not appoint an independent chairman of the board.
He repeated his view that regulators should set the rules around privacy and content for Facebook to follow.
A small number of demonstrators appeared outside the AGM, arguing that Facebook did not protect its users, particularly people from minority groups. Counter-demonstrators argued that Facebook ""censored conservative voices"".
According to the Reuters news agency, some shareholders at the AGM said Facebook was a ""hostile work environment"" for people with conservative views. Some have asked the company to produce a diversity report reflecting its public policy positions. 'Too much power'
Facebook's former security chief Alex Stamos has also called for Mr Zuckerberg to step down as chief executive.
""There's a legit[imate] argument that he has too much power,"" Mr Stamos told the Collision Conference in Canada in May.
Mr Zuckerberg previously defended his leadership of Facebook.
In April, he said: ""When you're building something like Facebook, which is unprecedented in the world, there are things that you're going to mess up.
""What I think people should hold us accountable for is if we are learning from our mistakes."" Related Topics "

""To do so would be an act of global importance for future generations, and a worthy legacy,"" they said.
The current target written into law is to reduce greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.
Their letter comes after the government's independent climate advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, urged ministers to set a new legal target for a 100% cut in all greenhouse gases by the middle of the century as soon as possible.
Meeting this target would mean stopping all emissions from electricity generation, transport and heating, while offsetting pollution from areas like aviation using measures to capture carbon, such as planting trees, the committee said.
A government spokesman said: ""We already lead the world in tackling climate change, being the first country to introduce long-term legally-binding carbon reduction targets and cutting emissions further than all other G20 countries.""
The spokesman said the government will respond to the Committee on Climate Change's zero-emissions recommendation ""in a timeframe which reflects the urgency of the issue""."

Lieutenant General Javed Iqbal (retired) will serve 14 years of ""rigorous imprisonment"" - a life term in Pakistan. It is rare for someone of such a senior rank to be convicted of spying in Pakistan, correspondents say.
Lt Gen Iqbal held key positions in the military during his active service, including director-general of military operations, which is responsible for planning and executing all operations inside and outside of Pakistan.
He also held the post of adjutant-general, who supervises discipline and accountability within the forces.
Brigadier Raja Rizwan (retired) was given a death sentence, as was Wasim Akram, a doctor who worked for a ""sensitive"" organisation which has not been named.
It is not clear if officers above the rank of brigadier have in the past been convicted of spying for another country, but some senior officials have been convicted either for planning military takeovers or for links to militant groups.

The body which manages the way electricity is generated said coal was last used at 15:12 on 17 May.
Fintan Slye, director of the National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), said the British record for solar power had also been broken this month.
Britain broke the record for a week of no coal earlier this month , which Mr Slye said would be a ""new normal"".
The government plans to phase out the UK's last coal-fired plants by 2025 to reduce carbon emissions and Mr Slye said there was ""still a lot of work to do"".

As coal plants take six hours to warm up, the ESO knows that it is on course to reach two weeks without coal after not using any since 17 May.
The longest period without coal before now ended on 9 May, when Britain lasted just over a week.
Before that, Britain had a coal-free period of 90 hours in April .
""As more and more renewables come on to the system, we're seeing things progress at an astonishing rate.,"" said Mr Slye.
""2018 was our greenest year to date, and so far, 2019 looks like it has the potential to beat it,"" he added.
On 14 May, Britain generated a quarter of its energy from the sun - the largest proportion yet.
When coal has not been used over the past fortnight, solar, wind, nuclear, gas and some hydro-generated power have been taking up the slack, the ESO said.
Chris Skidmore, energy and clean growth minister, said: ""The UK has the largest offshore wind capacity on the planet, can generate more than a quarter of our electricity needs from the sun and last year, more than half of our electricity came from low carbon sources."" Related Topics "

Nils Melzer urged Britain not to extradite the Wikileaks founder, warning that his human rights would be violated and that he is not fit to stand trial.
He also accused ""several democratic states"" of a ""concerted effort to break [Assange's] will"".
But the UK foreign secretary said Assange ""chose to hide"" from justice.
In a tweet Jeremy Hunt said Mr Melzer ""should allow British courts to make their judgements without his interference or inflammatory accusations"".
A justice ministry spokesperson also said the UK did not participate in torture, and that the government disagreed with a number of Mr Melzer's findings. Judges were independent of the government and anyone convicted had the right to appeal, the spokesman added.
But Mr Melzer responded to Mr Hunt's tweet, saying Assange was ""about as 'free to leave' as someone sitting on a rubberboat in a sharkpool"".
Assange, 47, is fighting extradition to the US over charges related to leaking government secrets.
He sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation he has repeatedly denied. He stayed until his arrest earlier this year.
Earlier this month, Swedish prosecutors reopened their investigation into rape allegations against Assange.
Mr Melzer, who met Assange earlier in May, told the Washington Post that he was initially reluctant to get involved in the case, as he is not a fan of Wikileaks and considered its founder to be a bad actor. What did Nils Melzer say?

Two political rivals have caused a stir on Twitter after they agreed to team up.
US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive millennial Democrat who has frequently attracted the ire of the Republicans, tweeted on Thursday that members of Congress should not be allowed to become lobbyists after their service.
Senator Ted Cruz - a conservative Tea Party Republican - wrote back: ""Here's something I don't say often: on this point, I AGREE... perhaps a chance for some bipartisan co-operation?""
A few more tweets later and both sides were agreeing to co-lead a bill banning members of Congress from becoming paid lobbyists - and other politicians were also chipping in to offer their support.
Although it has only amounted to a few tweets so far, US media have already described this common ground as remarkable, given how divided US politics currently is - and since the two are seen as political polar opposites.
However, strange partnerships - whether borne out of shared values, common goals or marriages of convenience - are nothing new in the world of politics.
Here are some of the world's counter-intuitive political bedfellows, what they achieved, and how things turned out for the parties involved. Malaysia: Mahathir Mohamad and Anwar Ibrahim (2018 - present) Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anwar Ibrahim (left) spent many years in jail after he challenged Mahathir Mohamad (right) for a leadership position
The partnership between the two men who toppled Malaysia's former prime minister has been described as a political drama worthy of Shakespeare.
Initially, the men were allies - Mr Anwar served in Dr Mahathir's government in 1982, and quickly rose up the ranks.
However, the relationship soured after Mr Anwar launched a leadership challenge against Dr Mahathir - and was jailed on corruption and sodomy charges - which Mr Anwar always said were politically motivated, in 1999.
Years later - in 2018 - the bitter rivals teamed up to form a coalition against then-Prime Minister Najib Razak - another protégée of Dr Mahathir's - and secured a shock election victory.
As part of the agreement, Dr Mahathir said he would secure a royal pardon for Mr Anwar - and would hand over power to him after two years.
How did it go?
The partnership is still in progress - Mr Anwar received a full royal pardon shortly after the election.
He won a parliamentary seat in October , paving the way for his return to front-line politics.
Dr Mahathir has promised to step down in 2020, although, as with all politics, nothing is considered a done deal until it's done. South Africa: Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk (1990-1996) Image copyright AFP Image caption Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk (right) jointly won the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize
In 1990, South African President FW de Klerk ordered the release of Nelson Mandela, who had spent 27 years in jail.
Mr de Klerk led the National Party, which sought to protect South Africa's white minority, while Mr Mandela led the African National Congress, which demanded majority black representation in government.
Nonetheless, they agreed to work together to end Apartheid - and received the Nobel Peace Prize jointly in 1993.
Following South Africa's first multiracial elections in 1994, Mr Mandela became president, while Mr de Klerk served as one of his deputy presidents.
How did it go?
The two men had a tense working relationship - and Mr de Klerk and his party withdrew from the government in 1996 as tied between the parties deteriorated. However, they also remained on friendly terms.
Mr de Klerk paid tribute to Mr Mandela following the ANC stalwart's death in 2013, adding in a statement: ""Although we were political opponents -­ and although our relationship was often stormy -­ we were always able to come together at critical moments.""

It was dubbed ""Britain's hot new bromance"" - as David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party, and Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats at the time, agreed to form a coalition government after the UK had its first hung parliament in decades.
Their joint press conference was dubbed a ""love-in"" in the ""rose garden"" - a contrast from the past, when Mr Cameron once responded to a question about what his favourite joke was with the answer ""Nick Clegg"".
The two parties differed on some pretty fundamental things - Europe, human rights and tuition fees - but argued that they were teaming up to provide a stable government to fix the economic deficit.
How did it go?
The coalition lasted the full five years - against many expectations - and delivered several policies, including pensions reform and same-sex marriage.
However, the Liberal Democrats were decimated as their supporters were angry at increased tuition fees, and austerity measures undertaken by the coalition government.
In the 2015 elections, they lost half their MPs, while the Conservatives secured a majority and stayed in government. Northern Ireland: Ian Paisley and Martin McGuiness (2007-2008)
The Troubles in Northern Ireland was one of the most intractable conflicts of the 20th Century. A lasting political solution to end the sectarian violence that marred the country for decades seemed implausible.
Against all odds, that calculus changed in the 1990s. Unionists and nationalists entered into peace talks, resulting in the landmark Good Friday Agreement.
Years later, Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein would head a power-sharing government in Stormont. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ian Paisley (L) and Martin McGuinness (R) served as first and deputy first minister
One was a former IRA commander; the other once denounced the Pope in the European Parliament as the Antichrist. Yet the pragmatic and genial working relationship that followed belied their differences.
In 2007, they assumed office as first and deputy first minister of the power-sharing executive, marking a new era of reconciliation between old enemies.
Often pictured laughing and joking together, their public friendship earned them the nickname ""The Chuckle Brothers"".
How did it go?
Their first months at the helm of the Stormont executive was said to have been cordial and civilised. Their joint leadership, however, did not last long.
Mr Paisley stood down as first minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly and leader of the DUP in 2008. He later claimed he was pushed out by senior DUP figures who were unhappy with his leadership, not least his cosy relationship with Mr McGuinness.
Nevertheless, their friendship continued, transcending politics. When Mr Paisley died in 2014, Mr McGuinness said ""the peace process and I have lost a friend"".
Paisley's widow Eileen said in 2015 that Mr McGuinness had been very supportive to the family during her husband's long illness.
""His friendship with Martin McGuinness had meant something very special to him,"" she said. What about friendships?
Given that compromise is part-and-parcel of politics, perhaps it's the genuine friendships across political lines that are even more remarkable. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's friendship even inspired an opera
Republican Senator John McCain was famously friends with many Democrats, including Joe Biden, despite them running on rival presidential tickets in 2008.
While giving an emotional eulogy at Mr McCain's funeral, Mr Biden said: ""We understood the same thing: All politics is personal. It's all about trust. I trust John with my life... and I think he would trust me with his.""
And one of the most surprising friendships was at the Supreme Court - between liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and conservative Justice Anthony Scalia.
The two fought on same sex marriage, the constitution and voting rights, and frequently wrote sharp critiques of each other's legal opinions.
Yet they were friends for decades, sharing New Year's Eve dinners, a love of opera and even once, famously, riding an elephant together in 1994."

The man, who has not been named, is suspected of being part of the group's financial structure and of sending money to fighters in Syria. The money raised in Europe reached the jihadists through an informal transfer system known as hawala, police said. Almost 6,000 fighters from Western Europe joined IS in Syria and Iraq. Spain's National Police said its investigation determined that fighters set up a structure in Syria to give financial support to foreign fighters wishing to return to Europe. "" This [police] operation is part of the fight against the new strategy of [IS] which, after its loss of territorial control, has urged its members to return to their places of origin,"" police said in a statement (in Spanish). After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? The suspect - reportedly 43 years old - used a ""number of security measures to hide his identity and communications on digital platforms,"" police added.

India no longer world's fastest-growing economy - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48460232,"Share this with Whatsapp Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Narendra Modi (L) has some worrying economic concerns as he starts a second term India's economy has grown at its slowest pace in almost five years, according to the latest data released by the government. The new numbers are a cause of concern for PM Narendra Modi, who started his second term on Thursday, writes the BBC's Sameer Hashmi. In the past financial year - April 2018 to March 2019 - the economy grew by 6.8%. And in the quarter between January and March, it expanded by just 5.8% - falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years. This means India is no longer the world's fastest-growing economy. And it will be a challenge for the new finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, only the second woman to hold the post after former PM Indira Gandhi. Ms Sitharaman has headed important ministries like commerce and defence during Mr Modi's first term. But she takes charge at a time when the economy is faltering. Where are the jobs? The immediate concern will be to help restore confidence in the economy. ""It's important to strike a balance between short-term and long-term priorities,"" economist Dharmakirti Joshi says. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was sworn in on Thursday One of the pressing challenges is job creation. The biggest criticism of Mr Modi during his first term was his government's failure to generate employment. According to a government report, unemployment touched a 45-year high between 2017 and 2018. Advertisement Mr Joshi believes the government should focus on labour-intensive sectors like construction and textiles to create more immediate jobs, but also give importance to industries like healthcare to generate employment in the long run. ""The government wants to scale-up its healthcare and welfare schemes, and apart from doctors and surgeons, you also need paramedics and nurses,"" he says. Weak exports have also been a stumbling block when it comes to creating jobs. The government is expected to prioritise policies that will make small- and medium-sized businesses more competitive. Spurring consumer demand The new GDP data make it clear that India is staring at an economic slowdown. Unlike China, India's economic growth has been driven by domestic consumption over the past 15 years. But data released over the past few months suggest that consumer spending is slowing. Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year low. Tractor, motorbike and scooter sales are down. Demand for bank credit has sputtered. Hindustan Unilever - India's leading maker of fast-moving consumer goods - has reported slower revenue growth in the past quarter. All of these are important benchmarks for measuring consumer appetite. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sales of cars and SUVs have slumped to a seven-year low Mr Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised that it would cut income tax to ensure greater purchasing power. Gaurang Shetty, vice-president of a brokerage firm, believes that the government should also consider slashing personal and corporate taxes in the next budget, which will be announced in July. ""It will act as a stimulus for the economy,"" he says. But India's 3.4% budget deficit - the gap between government expenditure and revenue - might restrict Mr Modi's options. Experts say that the widening fiscal deficit could hold back medium- and long-term growth. The agrarian crisis This was a constant challenge for Mr Modi in his first term. Farmers across the country regularly protest, demanding higher crop prices and loan waivers. The BJP has promised to extend a scheme that offers income support for small- and medium-sized farmers to include all farmers. ""Income support is a stop-gap arrangement but it is not a long-term solution,"" says Mr Joshi, adding that the agrarian sector is in need of structural changes. Currently, farmers sell their produce to state-owned agencies at a fixed price. Mr Joshi says he would like to see farmers given direct access to markets and sellers. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Farmers across the country regularly protest, demanding higher crop prices and loan waivers Fixing the country's agriculture sector has been a long-standing demand. More than half of India's population relies on farming, which makes farmers an important voting bloc. But experts hope that the BJP's thumping majority - the party's coalition won 354 of the 545 lower house seats - will allow it to enact reforms to transform agriculture into a modern industry. The push for privatisation One of the BJP's biggest pledges was to spend $1.44tn (£1.14tn) to build roads, railways and other infrastructure. But many observers say that the gargantuan sum will come from private industry. Mr Modi made little progress on his promise to sell government-owned enterprises, including the debt-ridden national carrier Air India. Gaurang Shetty expects Mr Modi to pursue privatisation more aggressively this time. ""The Indian stock markets have been euphoric and the rally is likely to continue for a while. It's the ideal time to sell stakes in loss-making companies,"" he says. Experts also reckon that embracing bolder policies could entice more foreign investment. Video caption As unemployment climbs in India, job creation is top of the agenda this election season. Private investment has been lagging for the past few years, and India's impressive economic growth in the past decade has largely been driven by government expenditure. During Mr Modi's first term, his government reduced red tape, helping move India to 77th spot in the World Bank's 2019 Doing Business ranking - a vast improvement from its earlier rank of 134. But experts say more needs to be done to attract private and foreign investment - and they say that it has to happen quickly. ""The first two years is the time to bite the bullet. The results will take time to show but it would make a huge difference to India's overall growth story, "" Mr Joshi says. More on this story "

Official data showed the economy grew 5.8%, which is slower than the 6.4% growth registered by China, and down from 6.6% in the previous quarter.
It was the first set of figures since Narendra Modi secured a second election victory this month.
During his first term, India became the world's fastest-growing economy.
But the latest figures, which show the slowest growth rate in 17 quarters, mean India's growth rate has fallen behind China for the first time in nearly two years.
Economists had been expecting the economy to grow 6.3% in the first quarter.
The figures will put pressure on Prime Minister Modi's government and the central bank to provide stimulus to the economy through fiscal measures. How will Modi handle India's economy?
Unlike China, India's economic growth has been driven by domestic consumption over the last 15 years and the latest data showed weaker consumer demand.
There was also a slower growth in investment, which fell to 3.6% from 10.6% in the previous quarter.
Finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said that the next quarter - the three months of April to June - could also be ""relatively slower"".
But, it should start to turnaround in the third quarter, he said. 'Jobs crisis'
The Reserve Bank of India is now expected to cut interest rates next month.
Unemployment data, that has been repeatedly delayed, was also issued on Friday and showed a rate of 6.1% in the 2017/18 fiscal year.
""It shows the jobs crisis is still there: there are not many new ones being created,"" said NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.
There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several year and chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters ""it would be unfair to compare it with the past."" Related Topics "

Andrés Manuel López Obrador described Mr Trump's slogan ""America First"" as a fallacy and said universal justice was more important than borders.
Stock markets saw sharp losses following Mr Trump's announcement.
Mr Trump declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border in February.
He said it was necessary in order to tackle what he claimed was a crisis with thousands of undocumented migrants crossing the US southern frontier. Trump's border wall - in seven charts
Mr Trump's latest statement came a day after US border authorities in El Paso, Texas, detained a group of more than 1,000 migrants - the largest single group agents had ever encountered.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday that Mexico could have done more to stop the group - and others - as they travelled through the country.
""They could have easily broken up this group, arrested them or sent them back home, and they didn't do anything,"" she told reporters.

In tweets later on Friday, President Trump said the tariffs were also to encourage Mexico to ""take back"" the country from drugs cartels. What did Mr López Obrador say?
The president said he had ordered his foreign minister to travel to Washington on Friday.
""I want to insist that we are not going to fall into any provocations, that we are going to act prudently with respect to the authorities of the United States [and] with respect to President Donald Trump,"" he said.
In a letter to his US counterpart, Mr López Obrador said Mexico was complying with its responsibility to avoid ""as far as possible and without violating human rights, the passage [of migrants] through our country"". Image copyright Reuters Image caption Andrés Manuel López Obrador said social problems could not be resolved with tariffs
""President Trump: Social problems are not resolved with tariffs or coercive measures,"" he added.
""With all due respect, although you have the sovereign right to express this, the slogan 'United States [America] First' is a fallacy because, until the end of time, and even over and above national frontiers, universal justice and fraternity will prevail.""
Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard later announced on Twitter that he would lead a delegation to Washington, adding: ""The treatment of Mexico is unfair and does not make economic sense to anyone."" How has US business reacted?
The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents three million businesses in the US, condemned Mr Trump's plan. Chief policy officer Neil Bradley said the tariffs would ""be paid by American families and businesses without doing a thing to solve the very real problems at the border"".

The US president has long accused Mexico of not doing enough to stem the flow of people. Migrants, most of whom say they are fleeing violence in Central American countries, travel through Mexico on their way to the US, where they hope to claim asylum.
In a White House statement, Mr Trump said the tariffs would rise by five percentage points each month until 1 October, when the rate would reach 25%.
The tariffs would stay at that level ""unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory"", he said.
""For years, Mexico has not treated us fairly - but we are now asserting our rights as a sovereign nation,"" the statement said. Report
The president also took aim at his Democratic opponents, accusing them of a ""total dereliction of duty"" over border security.

Loughinisland: Police told to return journalists' papers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-48478328,"Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The attack in Loughinisland took place in June 1994 at the Heights Bar
The award-winning investigative journalists were involved in the documentary film, No Stone Unturned, which examined the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) handling of the Loughinisland atrocity.
Six Catholic men were killed when Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) gunmen opened fire in a village pub as their victims watched a World Cup football match in 1994.
The journalists were detained in August last year, questioned and later released during an operation undertaken by detectives from Durham Constabulary, supported by Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers.
Search warrants were obtained as part of an investigation into the suspected theft of confidential documents from the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman's office.
Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey had mounted a legal challenge against the police raids carried out at their homes and office.
Judicial review proceedings were brought in a bid to have the warrants declared unlawful.
The judges stopped short of issuing an order on the issue until the terms had been finalised. Another hearing will take place at 15:30 BST on Monday.
During Friday's hearing, Lord Chief Justice Morgan said the High Court had heard nothing to indicate the journalists had done anything wrong.
He said the court had seen nothing to indicate that the journalists had ""acted in anything other than a perfectly proper manner with a view to protecting their sources in a lawful way"".
Chief Constable Mike Barton, from Durham Constabulary, said it had followed ""due process when applying for the search warrants"".
""A detailed application was presented to a County Court judge who granted the warrants,"" he added.
""We respect the outcome of today's hearing and the judge's decision, and we will consider its implications.""
The Northern Ireland Policing Board said Friday's ruling ""raises some serious questions around the circumstances and handling of this investigation"".
It said the PSNI chief constable has been asked to report to the board next week ""on its implications and he will be accompanied by the chief constable of Durham Constabulary"".
Niall Murphy, Mr Birney's solicitor, told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme on Friday that he ""would encourage both chief constables to reflect on the precise words that were uttered in the court this week, and to stand back and stop"".
The judges said that although the material should be returned to the journalists, they should give an undertaking not to destroy it for a limited period of time.
The raids were described in court this week by Mr Birney's lawyer as the type of operation that only happens in a ""police state"". Image caption Former Brexit secretary David Davis was at court to support the two journalists
The High Court judicial review was heard by Lord Chief Justice Morgan, Lord Justice Treacy and Mrs Justice Keegan.
Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey attended the hearing throughout, along with a number of supporters, including fellow journalists.
The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) welcomed the ruling on Friday.
NUJ Assistant General Secretary Séamus Dooley described it as ""a victory for Trevor and Barry, for the NUJ and for press freedom"".
Conservative MP and former Brexit Secretary David Davis was among those at the court supporting the two journalists on Friday.
He was also at an earlier hearing.
Simon Byrne was appointed as the new chief constable of the PSNI earlier this month, and will take up his position some time after George Hamilton retires next month.

President Trump has taken an interest in Chief Gallagher's case, tweeting about him in a sympathetic manner and hinting that he may grant him a pardon if he is found guilty.
The president's remarks about Gallagher's case have had an impact: Mr Trump tweeted about the conditions of Chief Gallagher's confinement in March, and Chief Gallagher was transferred from a brig to a military hospital.
Being in the hospital - instead of a military jail - made it easier for him to receive visitors and speak with his lawyers.
Overall the president's interest in the case has helped to ensure that Chief Gallagher has a high profile, access to well-connected lawyers (one of them, Marc Mukasey, also works for the Trump Organization) and the tantalising possibility (at least for Chief Gallagher) that even if the jury finds him guilty, a pardon could await.

Mrs Gallagher has called the trial ""an atrocity committed against America's service members"" and frequently posts updates on the Free Eddie Gallagher Facebook page.
Chief Gallagher was held in pre-trial confinement after prosecutors accused him of contacting witnesses.
His case has drawn widespread attention, including from President Trump.
At the end of March, Mr Trump personally intervened in the case, demanding that Chief Gallagher be moved from a military prison to a less-restrictive facility."

GEBCO-NF Alumni robots win ocean-mapping XPRIZE,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48473701,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A new wave of robots is needed to map the ocean floor
""The global scientific community has come together to try to meet this challenge, but if we're going to achieve it then we will need new technologies,"" said Dr Jyotika Virmani, the executive director of the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE.
""Through this competition, I think some of those technologies are now ready. Some are more robust than others but with a little more R&D I believe we will have a slew of different approaches, which is the way we've got to do this,"" she told BBC News.
The GEBCO-NF (Nippon Foundation) Alumni team was always a strong favourite to win the $7m (£5.5m) Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE . Its members all had extensive experience in the relevant fields.
The group triumphed by packaging an existing, state-of-the-art solution with a novel twist.
So, while its HUGIN autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is an established industry tool for echo-sounding the depths, its uncrewed surface vessel (USV) that deployed and recovered the sub was developed specially for the competition.
This boat, called Sea-Kit Maxlimer, was designed in Essex, UK.
It actually made headlines in another setting three weeks ago by carrying oysters and beer between Belgium and England - the first ever commercial cargo run across the North Sea by a water-going robot. Image copyright SHELL OCEAN DISCOVERY XPRIZE Image caption A number of teams also competed to track a simulated pollutant in the water
All the teams that made it to the Mediterranean final were asked to despatch their un-piloted vehicles to a competition box some 15 nautical miles (28km) from the Greek port of Kalamata.
On arrival, the chosen technologies had just 24 hours to make an extensive, high-resolution (5m or better) bathymetric (depth) map; and take multiple pictures of the seabed.
The GEBCO-NF Alumni team covered 278 sq km in its allotted time, returning more than 10 images of identifiable geological features.
At a gala ceremony in Monaco on Friday, the group was presented with the Grand Prize winner trophy and $4M. The runner-up, the Kuroshio team from Japan , was awarded $1m.
Dr Rochelle Wigley, the project coordinator for the Alumni, said the prize money would be reinvested into the development of future ocean-mapping initiatives.
""We want to test our system in different environments, in other deep oceans. We're looking to do an off-shore mapping project around the UK in the next six months, and then hopefully do a transatlantic crossing with Sea-Kit within a year,"" she told BBC News. Image copyright SHELL OCEAN DISCOVERY XPRIZE Image caption Team Tao likes to think of its BEMs as the ""cubesats of the oceans""
As part of the competition, the XPRIZE also ran a separate trial in collaboration with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
This got teams to ""sniff out"" a simulated pollutant in waters off Puerto Rico and track it to its source.
The prize was split between junior high school team Ocean Quest from California, claiming $800,000 as the winner, and Tampa Deep Sea Xplorers , from Florida, taking $200,000 as runner-up.
Both managed to lock on to the pollutant (in reality just a harmless dye), but neither quite managed to trace its origin in the time permitted. Image caption Some of the deepest waters in the Mediterranean are off the Greek coast
The XPRIZE organisers sprang something of a surprise at their Monaco gala by announcing an additional ""Moonshot Award"" worth $200,000.
This went to the British-based Team Tao , which was set up by Tyneside-based subsea engineering specialist Soil Machine Dynamics Ltd (SMD) and Newcastle University.
Team Tao did not meet the minimum criteria for success in the Mediterranean final, but the judges believed its highly innovative approach should nonetheless be marked out for special praise.
The group has developed ""Bathypelagic Excursion Modules"" (BEMs) - or as team-members like to call them: ""the cubesats of the ocean"". It's a reference to the miniaturised technology now emerging in the realm of space exploration
Deployed from a USV, these are compact, low-cost, torpedo-like devices that descend and ascend in the water, using their echo-sounders to map the seafloor as they move across a grid. But their up and down manoeuvres enable the modules to also sample the water column.
Team Tao envisages equipping the BEMs with multiple sensors. Image copyright Scripps Institution of Oceanography Image caption Most of what we know is the result of low-resolution satellite mapping
Better seafloor maps are needed for a host of reasons.
They are essential for navigation, of course, and for laying underwater cables and pipelines.
They are also important for fisheries management and conservation, because it is around the underwater mountains that wildlife tends to congregate. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.
In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water.
This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a critical role in moving heat around the planet.

UK satellite 'sets sail' for return to Earth - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48473698,"UK satellite 'sets sail' for return to Earth By Jonathan Amos BBC Science Correspondent 31 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright SSTL A British satellite in space has just ""set sail"" to return to Earth.
TechDemoSat-1 was launched in 2014 to trial a number of new in-orbit technologies but has now reached the end of its operational life.
To bring it out of the sky faster than would ordinarily be the case, it has deployed a ""drag sail"".
This large membrane will catch residual air molecules at its altitude of 635km and pull TDS-1 quickly into Earth's atmosphere where it will burn up.
There is a lot of interest currently in ""clean space"" technologies.
The orbital highways above the planet are set to become congested with thousands of spacecraft in the coming years, and serious efforts need to be made to tidy away redundant hardware and other space junk if collisions are to be avoided. US firm picks UK for weather satellites
TechDemoSat was built by SSTL of Guildford, and its 6.7-sq-m Kapton drag sail, called Icarus-1, was developed by Cranfield University.
""It is fantastic to see an image of TechDemoSat's deployed drag sail captured by the onboard inspection camera,"" said SSTL's managing director, Sarah Parker.
""This in-orbit image of a deployed drag sail on one of our satellites is a first for us and is a fitting culmination of mission operations for this highly innovative small satellite.""
Already, the Icarus design is starting to appear on other satellites as well.
TechDemoSat was part-funded by Innovate UK and was jointly operated by SSTL and by the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell.
It had eight payloads, including one that was developed by students to measure high-energy particles in space. Image copyright SSTL Image caption Artwork: TDS-1 was launched in 2014
One of TechDemoSat's really big successes, however, was its Sea State experiment.
This used a GPS receiver, rather like a radar, to monitor how signals from the Global Positioning System were reflected off the ocean surface.
This gave scientists a powerful tool to assess the roughness of the sea surface, and from that to gauge the strength of the winds.
The lessons learned with this reflectometry experiment on TDS-1 were incorporated into the instruments that were later flown on the US space agency's CYGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) mission.
CYGNSS was put up specifically to peer through hurricanes to help forecast the strength of the winds when the storms make landfall.
The Innovate UK agency, along with the Harwell Catapult, have continued the concept of in-orbit demonstration (IOD) satellites.
They have just supported the launch of a small spacecraft that will test a compact microwave radiometer.
US-based Orbital Micro Systems expects to use a network of these instruments to make rapid weather forecasting updates.

MacKenzie Bezos: Novelist and Amazon shareholder - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Helier Cheung Bbc News,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48462030,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos were married for 25 years MacKenzie Bezos, 48, made headlines this week when she announced she was joining the Giving Pledge - donating half her wealth to charity.
The US novelist, who has a 4% stake in the online retail giant Amazon, is estimated to be worth at least $35.6bn, making her the third-richest woman in the world.
Unlike her high-profile former husband, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Ms Bezos is an extremely private person.
She rarely gives interviews, and has generally sought to stay out of the limelight - her Twitter account only has a single tweet.
So what do we know about her?
Ms Bezos, who was born MacKenzie Tuttle, has said she wanted to be a writer from a young age.
""I wrote my first book when I was six... every day after school I'd write a little bit and by the end of the year I had a 142 page book called 'The Book Worm',"" she said in an interview with TV journalist Charlie Rose back in 2013.
This love of writing stayed with her - after going to Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, she studied English and creative writing at Princeton University. Is 'big philanthrophy' a charade?
Ms Bezos says she applied to Princeton specifically so she could study under Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, who ended up becoming her thesis adviser and an important advocate for her work.
In addition to calling her ""one of the best students I've ever had in my creative-writing classes"", Morrison introduced her to her literary agent, Amanda Urban. 'Love at first listen'
However - as many authors have found - writing the first novel was a long, difficult process, with a number of detours.
After graduating with the highest honours in 1992, Ms Bezos went to New York.
She told Charlie Rose she had intended to ""wait tables and... use my extra hours to write my book"".
However, she struggled - both with progressing with her book, and financially.
To pay the bills, she ended up applying for a job at hedge fund D E Shaw - where she was interviewed by Jeff Bezos.
While he offered her a job, she ended up working in another department - but her office was next to his.
""Through the walls I would hear him laughing that giant laugh... it was totally love at first listen,"" she said. Image caption Toni Morrison provided a blurb for Ms Bezos' first novel
She told Vogue Magazine she pursued him by suggesting they have lunch - after three months of dating they were engaged, and got married shortly after that.
A year later, Mr Bezos had the idea for Amazon - what he called "" this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work "".
By most accounts, Ms Bezos was a key part of the start up - driving Mr Bezos to Seattle while he worked on the business plan, and becoming the company's first accountant.
In the years that followed Amazon took off and the couple also became parents to four children.
Ms Bezos' novel-writing ambitions eventually also came to fruition, and her first book, The Testing of Luther Albright, was published in 2005. 'Literary-credentials'
She says the book took her ""eight years of daily work"", and a fair amount of tears, to complete.
In words that many writers can undoubtedly relate to, she told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer : ""Fear and shame made me want to finish. 'Aspiring novelist' is not a job title that does a lot for your ego.""
Her first reading was at the Elliot Bay Book Company - an independent book store with a cafe that Mr Bezos had also used for business meetings in the early days of Amazon.
Ms Bezos said that, as a self-described introvert, she ""had that feeling of stage fright before a firing squad"" before her first reading.
However, Rick Simonson, a senior buyer at the bookshop, recalls that Ms Bezos ""carried it off fine"" and came across as ""well accomplished"".
The reading, like many book launches, was ""not hugely attended, but there was enthusiasm and warmth"" from the audience, he told the BBC. Image copyright Elliott Bay Book Company Image caption The Elliott Bay Book Company has hosted authors including Haruki Murakami and Salman Rushdie
In the end, while her debut novel, about an emotionally repressed civil engineer and father, did not make the bestseller lists, it was praised by many critics.
The book was shortlisted for the Washington State Book Award, and also won an award from the Before Columbus Foundation.
She also gained the respect of many in Seattle's literary scene.
""My impression was that she was serious about her work... I admired the fact that she kept at it, given everything else she had going on,"" Mary Ann Gwinn, who was Seattle Times book editor when Ms Bezos' books were published, told the BBC.
Meanwhile, Paul Constant, co-founder of the Seattle Review of Books, says: ""I think the thing that was most remarkable about her first book was how competent it was - she could have been published without the Amazon connection.""
Ms Bezos' second book, Traps, was published in 2013 by Knopf, a leading publishing house - although many critics considered The Testing of Luther Albright a stronger novel. One-star review
Ms Bezos has long maintained a low profile on the Amazon website.
Her author profile mentions she ""worked a wide variety of jobs, including dishwasher, waitress, clothing salesperson, deli cashier, restaurant hostess, library monitor, data entry clerk, tutor, nanny, and research assistant to Toni Morrison"" - but has nothing about her work at Amazon or her marriage to Mr Bezos.
When her first book was published, she told Seattle Post-Intelligencer: ""I did not want any influence over buyers on Amazon. People there should treat my book as if they don't know me.""
However, she made headlines in 2013 after she posted a one-star review of The Everything Store - a book about Amazon by journalist Brad Stone.
In a 900-word post titled ""I wanted to like this book"", she accused the book of multiple inaccuracies and said it was lopsided and misleading.
Mr Stone has said that he interviewed more than 300 employees or former employees of Amazon, while his publisher has called the book ""scrupulously sourced and reported"". The Amazon association
Despite her efforts to dissociate her writing from her ex-husband's profile - and her decision to be published by Fourth Estate and Knopf, rather than Amazon - you could argue that much of her work has still been eclipsed by the interest in her marriage to the world's richest man.
Mr Constant describes her as a ""competent midlist novelist"" but adds ""I don't think anyone around town really thinks of her as a novelist"", given how famous her former spouse is.
Many have also pointed out the acrimonious relationship between Amazon and many bookstores, due to the online retail giant's role in driving book prices down.
The Elliott Bay Book Company hosted a reading of Ms Bezos' second novel in 2013 - and Mr Simonson recalls some people questioning why an independent book shop would want to host a book associated with Amazon.
However, he says: ""I felt you can invite the other side in - and she's a legitimate writer who deserved a fair reading"". Image copyright Getty Images Image caption When announcing their divorce, the couple said: ""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again""
In January, Mr and Ms Bezos announced they would divorce, saying: ""We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other.""
In April they agreed a record-breaking divorce settlement of at least $35bn, and a month later, Ms Bezos joined the Giving Pledge , a public promise to give half her fortune to charity.
Her writing background came through in her pledge, as she quoted an excerpt from Annie Dillard's The Writing Life: ""Do not hoard what seems good for a later place in the book... the impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now.""
Ms Bezos wrote: ""I have no doubt that tremendous value comes when people act quickly on the impulse to give... we each come by the gifts we have to offer by an infinite series of influences and lucky breaks we can never fully understand.
""In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share.""
Several Seattle literary figures have expressed hope that she will decide to spend some of that money locally.
""Everyone in the literary community would be thrilled if her personal passion for literature translated into philanthropic giving priorities,"" says Tree Swenson of Hugo House, a non-profit community writing centre.
There is also speculation over whether Ms Bezos will continue book-writing - and now fully establish her own identity as an author.
As she wrote in her lone tweet in April: ""Excited about my own plans. Grateful for the past as I look forward to what comes next."" Related Topics"
Sayyida Salme: The tragic life of Zanzibar's rebel princess - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Naima Mohamud Bbc News,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47556607,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Courtesy of Michael Bauer Ruete Growing up in Zanzibar, as one of the sultan's 36 children, Sayyida Salme had everything except her freedom.
But at the age of 22, the princess fell pregnant by a German merchant out of wedlock. It caused a scandal and - fearing for her life - she fled Zanzibar for a foreign land.
Her tragic, colourful, story inspired her to write a book - but the tale has remained largely unknown.
""Salme broke the tradition of female education by teaching herself to write,"" Said el-Gheithy, founder and manager of the Princess Salme Museum in Zanzibar, tells the BBC.
She is often credited as being the first East African woman to write an autobiographical book.
Multilingual, she spoke Swahili, Arabic, Turkish and German.
""Even in Germany [where she eventually fled] she challenged the popular perception of East Africa and the Orient,"" Mr El-Gheithy adds. ""She was a pioneer in terms of cross-cultural commentary and was the first woman to record her observations about the way of life in Germany and Zanzibar.""
""She was particularly concerned about young children suffering from cold and hunger in Europe, which at the time she had tried to alleviate."" Early life in Zanzibar
Born in 1844 in Zanzibar, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean now part of Tanzania, to Sultan Said Ibn Sultan Al Bu-Said and a Circassian [part of present-day Russia] courtesan, Salme was a rebel from the start.
As a child she would copy the Arabic alphabet onto the bleached shoulder blade of a camel for the purpose of teaching herself to write.
Her older brother - Majid - inherited the throne after their father died in 1856. But a palace revolution broke out between Majid and her other brother, Barghash.
Like most of her siblings, Salme sided with Barghash and became his general secretary. At the age of 15, she was writing letters to chiefs who had decided to follow her rebel brother.
But Barghash's insurrection was crushed sooner than anyone had expected.
Salme surrendered to sultan Majid and lost the support of the majority of her 36 siblings. Hanging out with the Europeans
Abandoned by her siblings and feeling increasingly alone, she began to feel drawn to other outsiders. Specifically, the Europeans in Zanzibar.
Salme's new house in Stone Town was situated next to that of a young German merchant by the name of Rudolph Heinrich Ruete.
Before long, the pair fell in love. Image copyright Michael Bauer Ruete Image caption Sayyida Salme, her husband Rudolph Ruete and their two children
""Their affair sent shockwaves both to the royal family and the foreign trading company in Zanzibar,"" Mr El-Gheithy says.
""Foreign traders thought he was risking the lives of Europeans who were reliant on the goodwill of the sultan.""
The couple would occasionally leave Stone Town but were still visible enough to be seen. Several sightings of them were reported to the sultan by German companies.
""The Germans perceived Rudolph as irresponsible and the locals saw him as a corrupting influence on the princess,"" Mr El-Gheithy explains. Fleeing Zanzibar
When Sultan Majid heard about the rumours surrounding his sister and the German, he sent for Salme and had his executioner at the ready. The sultan was reportedly only calmed down by his stepmother who insisted that they wait and see if the rumours were true.
But - when Salme's pregnancy began to show - the sultan ordered her to travel to Saudi Arabia.
""Sayyida was a smart girl, she had heard of stories of girls in similar conditions who were sent on voyages but who only reached the bottom of the ocean,"" Mr El-Gheity says.
So she fled to Aden, a port city in Yemen, where she gave birth to, and tragically lost, a child.
When her German lover joined her several month later, they married, moved to Germany and had three other children.
Salme changed her name to Emily Ruete once she arrived in the country.
But tragedy struck once more when, shortly after the birth of their youngest child, Rudolph was killed in a tram accident. ""She was inconsolable,"" Mr El-Gheity says.
Salme found herself in a strange land, penniless and alone with three small children.
She soon felt compelled to write a book about her tragic and colourful life.
Salme died in 1924 and was buried with a small bag of sand from a beach in Zanzibar, which she reportedly always carried with her. Five things about Freddie Mercury's Zanzibari roots American descendants
""I went down to the beach where Princess Salme was last seen when she left Zanzibar,"" Michael Bauer Ruete, the great-great grandson of Salme, tells the BBC. ""I took a bottle and filled it up with sand from the beach.""

Mr Bauer Ruete's grandmother, Olga Ruete, was the granddaughter of Salme.
""Growing up, I didn't know much about our family history,"" he says.
""My grandmother always kept it a secret but after she died, I found all kinds of items from Zanzibar; documents from the Zanzibar royal family, old photos, chests full of items I had never seen before."" Image copyright Michael Bauer Ruete Image caption Salme's granddaughter Olga
Olga, who grew up in England, fell in love with an American diplomat and moved to the US and had Anne - Michael's mother.
""A few years ago I learnt of our Zanzibar... relatives. We flew to England to meet [them] including the last sultan of Zanzibar, His Majesty Jamshid Khalifa,"" Mr Bauer Ruete says. ""A whole new life opened up for us.""
Despite the tragedy, Mr Bauer Ruete sees a positive side to Salme's life.
He says: ""Although her life was not easy, [she] is still remembered and celebrated because of her strong character [and] the difficult decisions and sacrifices she had to make."" Related Topics "
UK's Chagos Islands descendants feel like 'lost nation' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48426031,"UK's Chagos Islands descendants feel like 'lost nation' By Rosie Blunt BBC News 1 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image caption First generation Chagossian exiles visiting the island from which they were exiled decades earlier More than 50 years ago, Britain claimed sovereignty over the Chagos Islands and evicted its entire population to make way for a joint US military airbase. Decades later, Chagossian families in Britain say they are now being torn apart by UK immigration law.
Daniel Bernard was 10 years old when he was moved to Mauritius from the Chagos Islands.
He remembers a ""quiet and peaceful"" life on the Chagos Islands, an Indian Ocean archipelago. There was no formal currency, he says, as people would grow their own food and catch fish from the sea.
Now aged 74, he lives in Crawley, West Sussex, along with the vast majority of the UK's 3,000-strong Chagossian population.
Daniel returned to Diego Garcia, the island on which he was born, a few years ago, when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office started to organise trips for first-generation Chagossian exiles to visit their homeland. 'Impossible to go back'
""It hurt me to leave and it hurt me even more when I went back,"" he says.
An imposing military airbase had been built and the small town where Daniel grew up had been flooded by rising sea levels.
""I would love for my children and grandchildren to go back but it's impossible,"" he says. Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Diego Garcia, the largest of the Chagos Islands, where there is now a UK/US military airbase
It is just over half a century since the UK purchased the Chagos Islands from Mauritius for £3m.
Between 1968 and 1974, Britain forcibly removed thousands of Chagossians from their homelands and sent them more than 1,000 miles away to Mauritius and the Seychelles, where they faced extreme poverty and discrimination.
Mauritius says it was forced to give up the islands in 1965 in exchange for independence.
Last week, the UN passed a resolution demanding that the UK hands back control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.
The ruling came only three months after the UN's high court advised the UK should leave the islands ""as rapidly as possible"". 'Sad reality'
For Emmanuel Ally, 21, a third-generation Chagossian exile, the UN vote was ""nothing to celebrate"".
""The only good thing about it is the recognition that it was wrong for the Chagossians to be removed,"" he says.
""If you go back now, it's going to be completely different to 60 years ago,"" says his friend Didier Bertrand, 29.
""That's the sad reality.""
So what would they like to happen to the islands?
""Nobody has come up with a plan if it does go to Mauritius,"" says Didier. ""Me personally, I don't want the Mauritian government to have it as I worry they would give it to China or India.""
""We would at least like the choice,"" says Emmanuel. ""Nobody has asked us.""
""Some Chagossians just want to go there to die,"" says Didier. ""That should be their choice. It's their country.""
For young Chagossians, the issues currently facing their community in Britain are far more pressing than sovereignty.
""Help the community here,"" says Emmanuel. ""That's the one thing we are asking for."" Image caption Emmanuel Ally says focus should be on helping the Chagossian community, which is mainly settled in Crawley, near Gatwick Airport
In 2002, the British Overseas Territories (BOTs) Act granted British citizenship to resettled Chagossians born between 1969 and 1982.
Many had taken the opportunity to move to the UK in the hope of a better life, having faced hardship in Mauritius.
Shirley-Anne Bontemps is a Mauritian who volunteers in the Chagossian community, and says they now deal with similar issues in Britain.
""It's struggle after struggle,"" she says, explaining that Chagossians face racism on a daily basis, working minimum wage jobs to afford their visa fees.
""When you talk about sovereignty, this is not improving the Chagossian lives. Nothing has been done to help them. The British government has a duty of care for these people."" 'A better life'
The 2002 act's 13-year window for those eligible for British citizenship has left some families divided.
Born in 1968, Jean-Paul Delacroix is one year too old to meet the criteria of the BOTs Act.
The eldest of his siblings, he was the only member of his family not to qualify for British citizenship, but he and his wife Anne decided to follow the rest of his family to the UK, apply for citizenship and hope for the best."

Sir Elton John has criticised a Russian film company's decision to cut gay sex scenes from his new biopic Rocketman.
The local film distributor told state news agency Tass it cut scenes from the film to comply with Russian laws.
The British singer and the makers of Rocketman issued a statement saying they rejected the censorship ""in the strongest possible terms"".
Sir Elton has previously spoken out against Russian laws banning ""gay propaganda"". Russian jails drop yoga ban
In a statement shared on his Twitter page late on Friday, he described the censorship of Rocketman as a ""sad reflection of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people.""
""We believe in building bridges and open dialogue, and will continue to push for the breaking down of barriers until all people are heard equally across the world,"" the statement said. End of Twitter post by @eltonofficial Another example of LGBT censorship
Analysis by Ben Hunte, BBC News, LGBT correspondent
We have seen all of this before. The same discussions were had around Bohemian Rhapsody, which was released last year. The film was accused of employing ""straight washing"" and ""queer-erasure"" for international marketability, as Rami Malek's Freddie Mercury portrayal was not out-and-proud about his sexuality.
It also happened with Disney's Beauty and the Beast, which almost had a gay moment removed for release in certain markets. Even Eurovision was dragged into the discussion last year, when a Chinese broadcaster censored LGBT elements of the competition.
LGBT censorship is happening all over the world.
Elton John has long been a gay icon and he is easily one of the world's most well-known activists. Ultimately, this is a film about his life, and people know who he is and what he stands for. Even with some of the most revealing gay scenes being removed from the movie, for many people, his story being told globally in biopic form will still be seen as groundbreaking.
Rocketman tells the story of the popular musician's rise to fame.
It includes a male sex scene and a photograph in the closing credits of Sir Elton, 72, and his real-life husband. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rocketman is a musical film about Sir Elton John's career and how he broke into the industry

India had been the largest beneficiary of a scheme that allows some goods to enter the US duty-free.
However that status will end on Wednesday, Mr Trump said.
In March he announced that it would be revoked because India had failed to provide adequate access to its markets, but Mr Trump gave no date.
On Friday he said: ""It is appropriate to terminate India's designation as a beneficiary developing country.""

Until now, preferential trade treatment for India under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme allowed $5.6bn (£4.3bn) worth of exports to enter the US duty free.
The move is the latest push by the Trump administration to redress what it considers to be unfair trading relationships with other countries.
Last month the US ended Turkey's preferential status under the scheme.
Mr Trump has also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from countries around the world. Last year, India retaliated against those tariff hikes by raising import duties on a range of goods.
Separately, the US is involved in an escalating trade war with China, and recently threatened tariffs on Mexican goods over illegal migration. Related Topics "

Ali, who was an authority on World War One, spent more than 25 years reporting for the corporation, mostly with BBC Radio Manchester.
Major stories he covered included investigations into child sexual abuse in Rochdale, and the aftermath of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.
He died at the city's Christie Hospital on Thursday. Image caption Ali reported on a fire at Christie Hospital while receiving treatment there
Ali was undergoing treatment for cancer when a fire broke out at the hospital in 2017, and voluntarily reported live from the scene for BBC radio and television.
BBC Radio Manchester's managing editor Kate Squire said he was ""an outstanding journalist"", who was ""absolutely passionate about local broadcasting and Greater Manchester"" and whose reporting ""changed things and had a real impact on people"".
""He was hard-working, enthusiastic and intelligent and a kind, loving and funny friend,"" she said.
""We will miss him terribly and our thoughts are with his family.""
Tributes have been paid on social media to Ali, including messages from Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Greater Manchester Police.

Ali attended Bury Grammar School and his teenage years included an appearance on the ITV game show Blockbusters.
He studied at Oxford University and joined the BBC as a reporter, initially at BBC Radio Leicester before moving to what is now BBC Radio Manchester in 1993. Image caption Jonathan Ali (left) worked with Sophie Raworth and Dan Snow on coverage of the WW1 centenary
He reported on many of Greater Manchester's biggest stories over the last three decades, including the IRA bombing of 1996, Manchester United's famous 1999 treble, the Oldham race riots in 2001 and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.
His keen interest in World War One saw him write a book about the soldiers from his home village of Hawkshaw near Bury, and led him to be involved in the BBC's coverage of the conflict's centenary and work with Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle on his Pages of the Sea beach portraits .
'He knew everyone' - Richard Stead, BBC Radio Manchester
Jonathan - or Jali to everyone who knew him - was one of those larger-than-life characters who knew everyone.
His engaging demeanour meant local councillors and MPs would call him first if they had a story, while his encyclopaedic knowledge of World War One saw him join the BBC's coverage of the centenary.
But if there was one story that really made a difference, it was his reporting on child sexual abuse.
He headed investigations into grooming gangs in Rochdale and into abuse at two children's homes, work which led to the poet Lemn Sissay receiving an apology from Wigan Council for the abuse he had suffered as a child.
That was journalism at its best. Related Topics"

"Football's new laws: Backpasses, penalties, handballs and subs - BBC Sport",www.bbc.com,,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48382254,"Read more about sharing. Referees including Mike Dean will be implementing a few new laws from the beginning of June Goalkeepers picking up backpasses (sort of), uncontested drop balls and more handball decisions - football's laws are changing again.
From 1 June (although not for that day's Champions League final) there are 12 changes from the International Football Association Board (Ifab) to get your head around for next season.
Some are quite trivial but several could make a big difference to the game. Drop balls
Drop balls can no longer be contested, but the change is more positive than it sounds.
If play is stopped, the ball will be dropped to a player on the team that last touched the ball - and where they touched it. All other players must be 4.5 yards (4m) away.
What that means is if a team's attack is stopped, they will get the ball back in that position - instead of the opponents booting the ball down the field.
However, any play stopped in a penalty area will be returned to the goalkeeper, even if the attacking team had the ball.
Another big change now sees a drop ball awarded if the ball hits the referee and goes to the other team as a result, or if the referee accidentally scores a goal (as happened in the Dutch fourth division a week before the law change). Handballs Fernando Llorente's goal against Manchester City in the Champions League would not stand under the new laws which say you cannot score with your arm, regardless of intent
The law remains that deliberate handball is an offence. But accidental handball will also be a free-kick if... the ball goes into the goal off an attacker a player gets the ball using his arm or hand and then scores, or creates a goalscoring opportunity a player's hand or arm has made their body ""unnaturally bigger"" the player's arm or hand is above their shoulder (unless the player has controlled the ball onto his own arm or hand)
But a handball will not be a free-kick if... the ball is knocked on to a hand by the player in question or a nearby player the arm or hand is close to their body and ""has not made their body unnaturally bigger"" if a player is falling and the ball touches their hand or arm when it is between their body and the ground to support the body - but not extended to make the body bigger
Another change to the handball rule relates to the goalkeeper.
If the goalkeeper attempts to clear (""release into play"") a throw-in or backpass and their clearance fails, then they can handle the ball.
Ifab says this is because ""when the goalkeeper clearly kicks or tries to kick the ball into play, this shows no intention to handle the ball"". Goal-kicks Alisson will have more options to go short with his goal-kicks next season
Another change involving goalkeepers is to goal-kicks, which can now be played to a team-mate who is inside the penalty area.
The law now says the ball is considered in play once the kick is taken. Until now a goal-kick had to be retaken if it did not leave the box.
It could make a big difference to teams like Liverpool and Manchester City, whose defenders could drop into the box to receive a goal-kick from Alisson or Ederson.
Opponents must still remain outside the penalty area until the kick is taken. Free-kicks This would be an indirect free-kick to Brighton (in yellow) if it happened next season
When a defending team has three or more players in a wall, the attacking team can no longer place a player in or next to it.
If an attacker is standing within one yard (1m) of the wall when the kick is taken, they will be penalised with an indirect free-kick.
Another change means - similar to the goal-kick change above - if a defending team takes a free-kick in their own area, the ball is considered in play immediately and does not have to leave the box before another player touches it. Again, opponents must remain outside the box. Quick free-kicks
If the referee is about to show a yellow or red card but the non-offending team takes a quick free-kick and creates a scoring chance, the official can come back and show the card when the ball goes out of play.
Before now, the card would have to be shown before the free-kick could be taken.
However, if the referee had distracted the offending team by starting to show the card, the quick free-kick is not allowed.
Also if the offence was going to be a red card for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity, but the opposition take a quick free-kick, then the player will only be booked because the other team are considered to have restarted their attack. Penalties
The laws have changed concerning what goalkeepers can do for penalties.
The penalty kick cannot be taken while the goalkeeper is touching the woodwork or nets - or if the net or posts are still moving after being touched.
The goalkeeper must have one of his feet partly on the goalline (or above it if jumping) when the kick is taken. He cannot stand behind or in front of the line.
The other change to penalties means an attacker can take a penalty if he needed treatment (as long as the treatment is quick).
Before now, a player would have to go off the field until after the kick was taken if he needed medical help. Substitutions We will be seeing less of this in the future, because subs will not always be coming off where the replacement is coming on
A player who is being substituted must leave the pitch by the nearest point on the touchline or byeline - unless the referee says he can leave quickly at the halfway line - or elsewhere for safety or injury reasons.
This change is to stop players time-wasting. Any player who ""infringes the spirit of this law"" will be booked for unsporting behaviour. Cards for coaches
A team official guilty of misconduct can be shown a yellow card or red card. If the offender cannot be identified, the senior coach in the technical area at the time will receive the card.
That new system was trialled in the EFL during the 2018-19 season and is now being introduced worldwide. The other changes
A player can now be booked for celebrating - for removing his shirt or celebrating with the fans - even if the goal is disallowed.
The team that wins the pre-match coin toss can now choose whether to take the kick-off or which goal to attack - previously they could only choose which goal to attack.
There is now a difference between cooling breaks (90 seconds to three minutes) and drinks breaks (maximum of one minute) in certain competitions played in high humidity and temperatures.
Multi-coloured or patterned undershirts are allowed if they are the same as the sleeve of the main shirt. Share this page "

But Primavera Sound in Barcelona, one of Europe's biggest festivals, has already achieved it in 2019 - becoming the first major festival to do so.

Why some countries are shipping back plastic waste - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Reality Check Team Bbc News,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-48444874,"Why some countries are shipping back plastic waste By Reality Check team BBC News 2 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images A growing number of countries are taking a stand and demanding that nations take back their waste.
Many wealthy countries send their recyclable waste overseas because it's cheap, helps meet recycling targets and reduces domestic landfill.
For developing countries taking in the rubbish, it's a valuable source of income.
But contaminated plastic and rubbish that cannot be recycled often gets mixed in and ends up in illegal processing centres.
So where is this happening and why is action being taken now? Image copyright Getty Images
The European Union is the largest exporter of plastic waste, with the US leading as the top exporter for a single country.
But only a tiny fraction of all plastics ever produced has been recycled.
Often, materials that can't be recycled end up being burned illegally, dumped in landfills or waterways, creating risks to the environment and public health.
Worries about receiving such waste has forced countries to act.
The Philippines has just shipped back tonnes of rubbish to Canada that it said was falsely labelled as plastic recycling in 2013 and 2014.
This month Malaysia sent back five containers of plastic waste to Spain after it was found to be contaminated. Malaysia's global plastic waste imports Source: Malaysia External Trade Statistics
Malaysia says up to 3,000 tonnes of rubbish will soon be returned to the UK, US, Japan, China, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Bangladesh, Norway and France.
To understand why these countries were swamped with so much waste, you need to look to China.
Until January 2018, China imported most of the world's plastic waste.
But due to concerns about contamination and pollution, it declared it would no longer buy recycled plastic scrap that was not 99.5% pure. Image copyright Getty Images The impact of China's ban
Global plastic waste exports fell - dipping by almost half by the end of 2018, compared with 2016 levels, according to Greenpeace analysis.
There were reports of plastic waste ready for export piling up, and some was diverted to other countries.
Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea, Turkey, India and Poland all took up the slack.
Malaysia took a major share - the plastic waste it imported from 10 countries in just the first six months of 2018 was nearly as much as the total it received in 2016 and 2017.
But the rubbish arriving in these countries wasn't sufficiently recyclable, and it has caused problems.
The UK has been singled out by the Malaysian government.
""What the citizens of the UK believe they send for recycling is actually dumped in our country,"" said Malaysian Minister Yeo Bee Yin. UK plastic waste in China and Malaysia Exports in tonnes Source: Environment Agency Packaging Database Countries taking action
Importing countries have found the surge of waste difficult to manage and this has led to new controls in some countries.
Poland, in May last year, announced tougher rules after multiple fires at waste dumps, and linked the rise in illegal rubbish imports to the China ban.
Thailand has temporarily prohibited plastic waste imports and says it will implement a full ban by 2021.
Malaysia has revoked import permits and has been clamping down on illegal processing plants.
Vietnam is no longer issuing new licences and will bar all imports of plastic scrap by 2025.
In October, Taiwan said it will only import single source plastic waste.
India expanded its ban on solid plastic waste imports this March. Report
However, there is still an overwhelming demand for locations to send plastic and other waste to for recycling, and the challenge of how to dispose of it remains.
There are indications that after some initial success of the import restrictions, these countries are starting to take in larger volumes of waste again.

'Life is wonderful' being pain-free after 40 years - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Frances Cronin Health Reporter,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48472388,"Image copyright University Hospital Southampton Image caption Alison Cameron can't stop smiling now she's pain-free Alison Cameron, from Dorset, was 17 when she had appendicitis and went into hospital.
""I had my appendix out and I remember I came round out of the anaesthetic screaming, the pain was something else.""
It was the start of a ""horrendous"" three years of investigation before ""they came to the conclusion through a process of elimination, it was nerve damage"".
Over the next 30 years, Alison had more than 50 injections, known as cryoblocks, to freeze the site of her abdominal pain, but none of them stopped the pain for more than six months.
This left her needing high doses of painkillers which left her unable to eat or drink - and she ended up on a feeding tube which led to her losing weight, and her health deteriorating.

""No matter how bad things have been, I've always been able to find a positive at the end of the day. That isn't saying that I didn't have some very, very low moments.
""I miscarried seven times - six of which were definitely down to the pain. So not only have I paid the price - but also those potential lives.""
She managed to have two children in the gaps between treatment, and now has three grandchildren.
The eldest burst into tears the first time she saw Alison without an eating tube, ""as that, for her, wasn't normal granny"".
The woman who doesn't feel pain Hospital pain therapy 'life changing' How I've learned to live in constant pain Five years ago, a cryoblock caused a collapsed lung, and Alison was referred to consultant neurosurgeon Girish Vajramani at the University Hospital Southampton.
""Alison is one of the most challenging patients I have ever known,"" he says.
""She had undergone 50 cryoblocks over 30 years, which is unprecedented, and resulted in her referral to me when this proved too dangerous.""
Image copyright University Hospital Southampton Image caption Alison Cameron says Mr Girish Vajramani never gave up on her The team at Southampton fitted her with a stimulation implant along her spinal nerve, but it only reduced her pain by 50%.
Alison went on to have 20 procedures to implant further electrodes, as well as correcting leads which had moved out of place.
She also had to wear a body brace for two years to try to keep the leads in position.
With hyper-mobile joints, her body didn't make the right type of scar tissue to keep the electrodes in place.
Trying to cuddle her new twin granddaughters while wearing the body brace was one of her lowest points, she says.
After the medical team had exhausted all options available, they sought opinions from around the world, but the options were limited.
In a last-ditch attempt to get rid of her pain, Mr Vajramani inserted a paddle implant, combined with a spinal cord stimulator, to create a hybrid model.
Image copyright University Hospital Southampton Image caption The procedure involved placing four paddle-shaped electrodes across small collections of nerves in the spinal nerve known as the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), combined with a standard spinal cord stimulator They were implanted in two operations in December 2018.
""When they turned on the devices and they all worked, I don't know who had the biggest grin on their face - them or me,"" Alison says.
Within five weeks she was off all her pain medication.
""I can't quite believe it and I can't believe what they did to get everything sorted,"" she says
""I still can't stop grinning. I'm going around with a permanent Cheshire cat grin on my face because I just cannot believe it.
""Because I was a 17-year-old, and now I'm a granny.""
Image copyright Alison Cameron Image caption Alison Cameron in 2017 Now 56, she says ""life is wonderful"" being pain-free, as she is finally ""able to eat and drink and enjoy the social side of life"".
And she hopes her story can ""give hope to others that no matter how long you face adversity, things can get better"".
She has a low-level buzz in her body and has to charge herself up twice a week by holding two different discs to parts of her body.
""It's a standing joke that granny has to charge herself and there have been jokes about bionic granny,"" she says.
After the procedures she was able to have her first Christmas dinner in five years: ""It was just a little one, but this Christmas I'm going to have an enormous one,"" she says, laughing."
Donald Trump's UK visit: Five potential diplomatic flashpoints - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48472822,"Image copyright AFP Donald Trump is making a much-delayed state visit to Britain this week.
Over three days the US president will be hosted by royalty and politicians. He will also take part in commemorations to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.
But behind the pageantry lie policy differences that divide Britain and the United States.
Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know Trump's UK visit: What’s he bringing? Trump says Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader Royalty State visits are primarily royal affairs, with the emphasis as much on ceremony as politics. But even so, the potential for slip-ups is huge.
Donald Trump made a mistake last year when he turned his back on the Queen and walked in front of her while inspecting the guard at Windsor Castle.
This time there will be the tricky moment when he gives a speech at the state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Will he address the Queen correctly? Recently the White House mistakenly referred to her as ""Her Royal Majesty"". (Those who deal regularly with royalty would know that it should just be ""Her Majesty"").
Will Mr Trump continue speaking during the National Anthem, as President Obama did in 2011?
When Mr Trump has tea with the Prince of Wales at Clarence House, will they manage to avoid airing their rather different views on climate change?
Image copyright AFP Image caption Mr Trump met the Queen when he visited the UK last year The president has no incentive to mess things up - he clearly likes the pomp and pageantry of royalty and will want the pictures to look good back home ahead of his re-election campaign. But there remains the question of how much advice he will take from his protocol team.
The biggest potential flashpoint - in theory - could be the Duchess of Sussex who, in her past, pre-regal life, expressed opposition to Mr Trump's views. The US president told The Sun newspaper he was surprised Meghan had been so ""nasty"" about him.
Perhaps fortuitously, the Duchess is still on maternity leave and will play no part in the visit.
But it will not have gone unnoticed that an American citizen who only recently married into the British royal family - and thus epitomizes the close relationship between both countries - will not be part of the team welcoming her president to these shores.
Brexit Mr Trump's visit comes at a tricky time politically for Britain. He will be visiting the lamest of lame duck prime ministers in the form of Theresa May who is standing down as Conservative leader at the end of the week.
Britain is still gripped by the dread hand of the Brexit debate. In his Sun interview, the president criticised Mrs May for allowing the EU ""to have all the cards"" in the negotiations.
And, in an interview published a day later, he told the Sunday Times the government should bring in Nigel Farage - an arch critic of Mrs May - to help the Brexit negotiations.
Image copyright AFP Image caption This week's visit is scheduled to include a joint news conference with Theresa May, something the pair did when he came to the UK last July Mr Trump had already expressed his support for Nigel Farage , saying the leader of the newly-formed Brexit Party was his friend, a ""big power"" in the UK and someone for whom he had a lot of respect. Will Mr Trump find time to meet Mr Farage?
Downing Street has rejected the idea of there being an official meeting between the two, but might there be time for a quick cup of tea at Winfield House, the London residence of the US ambassador? Neither side are ruling it out.
One minister told me this would be seen as both disappointing and rude. But Mr Trump rarely misses a chance to associate with like-minded politicians, if nothing else to emphasise what he sees as the growing success of his kind of politics.
He will not mind that the two main opposition party leaders - Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Vince Cable - have refused their invitations to dine with him at the state banquet.
Conservative leadership Mr Trump also arrives in the middle of the Conservative leadership contest that will determine the next prime minister of the United Kingdom.
He has already backed one candidate, the front-runner, Boris Johnson. The president told The Sun the former foreign secretary would be an excellent prime minister who would do ""a very good job"".
On one hand, there will be some Conservative MPs and party members who will be impressed by this, welcoming the idea that a potential future prime minister already has a good relationship with a close ally.
On the other, there may be some MPs who believe the unofficial endorsement from an unpopular US president might not endear Mr Johnson to the wider British electorate, which has more mixed feelings about Mr Trump.
 Trump: I like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Remember that Mr Trump has already backed Mr Johnson, saying when he was in the UK last year that Mr Johnson - a former US citizen - would make ""a great prime minister"".
Equally interesting would be any remarks Mr Trump chooses to make about the Labour leader, Mr Corbyn, who could one day be the person he meets for lunch in Downing Street, a leader who has made no secret of his hostility towards many US policies.
Mr Trump told The Sun he was ""not offended"" by Mr Corbyn's refusal to attend the state banquet, saying: ""He is probably making a mistake because I think he would want to get along with the United States.""
Middle East In a visit focused on ceremony and talks with an outgoing prime minister, the opportunity to discuss substantive policy will be, by necessity, constrained.
But there will be much to disagree about in a trip that is supposed to emphasise unity.
Take, for example, the Middle East. The British and US disagree about how best to change Iran's behaviour - the UK still supports the agreement designed to curb Tehran's nuclear programme, the US does not and is ready to sanction any British firm or bank that trades with Iran.
The US has deployed a carrier strike force and B52 bombers to the region, something some British diplomats fear could provoke escalation, even war.
Are these differences something Mr Trump will wish to raise in public?
Is the United States heading for war with Iran? Trump: War would mean 'end of Iran' The president will also bring with him his adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is expected soon to announce the US so-called ""deal of the century"" to try to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The British government is concerned about any attempt to impose a unilateral plan that disposes of the two-state solution and seeks to buy off the Palestinians with hard cash.
The Americans have already made it clear they are willing to press ahead without European support, just so long as they have the backing of one or two Arab states.
Will any tough talking in Downing Street spill over into the news conference that follows?
China Let us not forget China. The growing confrontation between the US and China is worrying British policymakers, not just because of the potential impact on global economic growth.
But there is also the not so minor matter of Huawei. The US is already angry at the decision - yet to be finalised - by British ministers to consider allowing the Chinese telecoms giant to build part of the UK's 5G mobile network .
They fear this would potentially give the Chinese state access - via Huawei - to British and thus American secrets.
Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Beijing defends Huawei amid 5G row US officials are warning that Mr Trump will not only raise this during the state visit but may even threaten to limit sharing intelligence with the UK as a result.
Just consider what that might mean: the so-called ""special relationship"" has always had as a central core the sharing of intelligence - a relationship between security professionals that is supposed to be eternal, outside the squalls of political disagreement.
So it would be hard for the president to praise UK-US relations while at the same time threatening to withhold intelligence.
US officials say they are reassured that the UK decision on Huawei is not final and on hold until a new prime minister is elected. But they cannot rule out strong words on the subject from their president.
Mr Trump, of course, once suggested that UK intelligence agencies were involved in a plot against his election - something they dismissed publicly as ridiculous nonsense."
Brexit 'made me want to become an Irish citizen' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Eimear Flanagan Bbc News Ni,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48460125,"Image copyright Laurie Kearon Image caption Laurie Kearon and her Irish husband at the most recent citizenship ceremony last month The last three years have seen a ""steady rise"" in the number of British people seeking Irish citizenship since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016.
Among Ireland's new citizens are ""Lancashire lass"" Stephanie McCorkell and Welsh ex-pat Laurie Kearon and both have a similar story to tell.
Both have lived in the Republic of Ireland for decades, retaining their British identity, but fears over Brexit prompted them to seek Irish citizenship.
Stephanie's story
Image copyright Irish Times Image caption Stephanie McCorkell and her husband set up their family home in County Meath in 1981 Just a few months short of her 70th birthday, Stephanie McCorkell has spent almost all her adult life on the island of Ireland.
Born and bred in Liverpool, she left the city 46 years ago but still speaks with a soft, but distinct, Liverpudlian lilt.
""If anybody asks me what I am, I say 'I'm Irish... with an English accent',"" she laughs.
Her husband is from County Tyrone and they met during his student days in Liverpool.
They began married life in England, where their first two children were born.
In 1973, Prof McCorkell got a teaching job in his native Northern Ireland and the family set up home outside Belfast, during the height of the Troubles.
They spent the next eight years north of the Irish border, where they had two more children.
Image copyright Stephanie McCorkell Image caption The eldest of Stephanie McCorkell's children, pictured in Belfast in 1979 By 1981, Prof McCorkell got a post in the Republic of Ireland and the family moved to Ashbourne, County Meath.
Their youngest child was born in Dublin and they raised their five children as Irish citizens.
Six months after the Brexit vote, and more than four decades after moving across the Irish Sea, Mrs McCorkell felt compelled to apply for Irish citizenship.
""I didn't want to be classified as British, with the nationalism that seems to be creeping in,"" she said.
Born to a mother of Dutch descent and a father with Irish heritage, immigration is in her blood.
""I've considered myself European since I was a child"", she said, but her nuanced sense of identity means she also described herself as an Irishwoman and a ""Lancashire lass"".
Her wish to remain an EU citizen partly motivated her application.
The pensioner worried she could lose her European Health Insurance Card or be separated from family at airports.
""My husband travels on an Irish passport,"" she said. ""I thought I don't want to be waiting, or going through another gate.""
Image copyright Stephanie McCorkell Image caption Stephanie McCorkell got her first Irish passport when she was in her late 60s But her travel itinerary threatened to scupper her chances of an Irish passport.
Citizenship rules state an applicant must not leave the jurisdiction for more than six weeks in the year before applying.
Two short trips to France meant more to the officials than the four decades she spent in Ireland.
For Stephanie, it felt like her lifelong contribution to Irish society was worthless.
""I've worked, I have a full Irish pension and I'm not dependent on my husband's pension,"" she pointed out.
""I cried, and then I got mad, and then I calmed down and just thought well, I'll try again.""
Her case was raised in the Dáil (Irish Parliament) and reported by the Irish Times . When she reapplied in 2018, she was granted citizenship.
Laurie's story
Image copyright Laurie Kearon Image caption Laurie Kearon celebrating a GAA victory for Wicklow with her Irish-born teenage son Laurie Kearon was born in England 56 years ago, but she grew up in the Welsh seaside village of Saundersfoot.
She moved to Ireland in 1995 with her three children after the break up of her first marriage.
They settled in County Wicklow and, a few years later, she married a Dubliner and had two more children.
Laurie first applied for Irish citizenship in 2008, but did not complete the process at that time because of the expense.
""It was about €950 (£840) to do the completion and at the time I didn't really have enough money. With raising five children it was a lot of money to find, and I let it lapse.
""When Brexit was announced three years ago, I decided to reactivate it.""
Last month, she was one of 2,400 people who attended citizenship ceremonies in County Kerry, where participants took an oath of fidelity to the nation.
Image copyright Laurie Kearon Image caption Laurie met Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan during the citizenship ceremony The Republic of Ireland allows its people to hold dual citizenship, meaning Mrs Kearon did not have to give up her British citizenship.
But the ceremony had great personal significance for her.
""I love Ireland, it was my saviour really. I really love Wicklow, it reminded me of home. I used to be quite homesick but I'm not anymore.
""I love this country and I love its people.""
She admitted she was partially motivated by concerns she could lose rights after Brexit.
""I can't comprehend it to be honest, and a small part of wanting to be an Irish citizen is because I still want to remain a European.""
Mrs Kearon has fully embraced her Irishness. She is heavily involved in the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and local politics, with ambitions to run for election.
But she also spends much of her time breeding Welsh ponies, and still has a strong sporting allegiance to her childhood home.
Image copyright Laurie Kearon Image caption Laurie Kearon is a successful breeder of Welsh ponies and runs a stud farm in Wicklow ""I hold on a little bit to my Welshness,"" she said.
""It's difficult when rugby games are played between Ireland and Wales because I sort of have to sit on the fence... but generally I would support both teams because I've supported Wales for so long.""
But she added: ""Ireland is now my country and I'm very, very happy to be an Irish citizen."""
Brexit 'causing' more British nationals to become Irish - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Eimear Flanagan Bbc News Ni,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48435872,"Brexit 'causing' more British nationals to become Irish By Eimear Flanagan BBC News NI 2 June 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Brexit Image copyright Irish Department of Justice Image caption At a citizenship ceremony last month, 2,400 new Irish citizens stood up for the national anthem The number of British nationals applying for Irish citizenship has risen significantly since the Brexit referendum almost three years ago.
Irish citizenship ceremonies were first introduced in 2011, and for the first four years applications from Britons averaged about 60 a year.
In 2016, the year of the Brexit vote, there were 568 British applicants.
The number grew to 860 in 2017 and last year more than 1,200 Britons applied to become Irish citizens. Irish citizenship applications from British nationals Year (1 Jan - 30 May) 2019 607 Source: Irish Department of Justice
The upward trend appears to be continuing this year.
More than 600 applications had been received by the end of May. That figure is expected to rise during the latter half of 2019.
The figures mirror the flood of applications for Irish passports.
In the year before the Brexit vote, there were more than 46,000 applications from Great Britain, but last year that more than doubled to over 98,500.
The current minimum waiting time for a first-time passport application from Great Britain is 72 working days - nearly three and a half months. Irish passport applications from Great Britain Year 37,258 Source: Irish Department of Foreign Affairs
Applying for Irish citizenship is a separate and distinct process from applying for an Irish passport, but in order to get an Irish passport, you must first be an Irish citizen.
Irish citizenship can be acquired in a number of ways - through place of birth; Irish descent; marriage, adoption or naturalisation (the length of time an applicant has been resident in Ireland).
Citizenship is automatic for many people, such as those born on the island of Ireland before 2005 or those with a parent who is an Irish-born citizen.
Others must apply to the Department of Justice for citizenship.
While attending the most recent citizenship ceremony in April, Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan remarked on the ""significant numbers"" of applicants originating from the UK.
Just over 300 British nationals were among the 2,400 new Irish citizens congratulated by the minister. Image copyright Irish Department of Justice Image caption Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan addressed the citizenship ceremony in Killarney
BBC News NI asked the department if it was linking the recent rise in British applications to the UK's decision to leave the EU.
A department spokesman agreed the figures showed an increasing pattern since the referendum in June 2016.
""It is reasonable to attribute this steady rise in applications from British nationals over the last three years to concerns around the outcome of the Brexit process,"" the spokesman added.
Among Ireland's new citizens are Welsh ex-pat Laurie Kearon and ""Lancashire lass"" Stephanie McCorkell.
Both women have a similar story to tell. Image copyright Laurie Kearon Image caption Laurie Kearon and her Irish husband at the most recent citizenship ceremony last month

British nationals are the second biggest group of non-Irish residents in the Republic of Ireland.
The most recent Irish census, carried out in April 2016, found there were just over 103,000 residents who described themselves as British.
In immigration terms, they were outnumbered only by Polish citizens who totalled more than 122,500 in April 2016. Top 10 non-Irish nationalities living in Ireland 1 11,531 Source: Irish Census 2016
Up until the year after Brexit, British nationals made up just a tiny minority of those seeking a declaration of Irish citizenship.
In 2012 for example, the Dublin government issued more than 25,000 certificates of Irish nationality to people from around the world, but just 85 of those documents (0.3%) were granted to Britons.
In 2013, when more than 24,000 certificates were issued, just 55 (0.2%) were given to British people.
But between 2016 and 2017, the number of successful British applicants rocketed by more than 400%, increasing from 98 certificate recipients to 526.
The number increased again last year, when 687 British people received certificates of nationality from the Irish government.

So far this year, the Irish Department of Justice has issued 312 certificates of Irish nationality to British applicants, and we're not yet half way through 2019.
It used to be the case that anyone born on the island of Ireland, including Northern Ireland, was automatically entitled to Irish citizenship and therefore EU citizenship.
The 1998 Good Friday Agreement, an international peace treaty, gave those from Northern Ireland the right to identify as Irish or British or both.
But by 2004, the Irish government said the law was being exploited by ""citizenship tourism"", claiming that foreign women were travelling to Ireland in late pregnancy in order to get an EU passport for their babies.
It called a referendum, in which Irish voters overwhelmingly backed the tightening of the rules, with 79% voting to end the automatic citizenship right for all babies born in Ireland .
