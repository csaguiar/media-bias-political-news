The Hyperloop Is Starting to Look a Lot Like the Transportation of the Past,slate.com,Henry Grabar,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/elon-musks-hyperloop-is-borrowing-ideas-from-trains-and-cars.html,"Apple Is Ditching iTunes For transportation nerds, Elon Musk’s Hyperloop holds a special place in the imagination. Progress in the space usually involves incremental steps to suit the places we’ve already built. Road tolls and electric scooters are what passes for exciting. The Hyperloop, as described by Musk in a 2013 white paper , is a 760 mph leap that promises whole new patterns of settlement and activity to follow behind it. The real Hyperloop will be powered by magnets, but so far it has made its way through the world propelled by hot air. Credulous, click-chasing reporters have broadcast the claims of various Hyperloop entrepreneurs who have run with Musk’s idea of shooting pods through a sealed tube at high speeds, and local governments have gone right along with it . A working full-scale Hyperloop is still years away from reality, but I, for one, already feel like I’ve been taken for a ride. Last year, I checked in with Hyperloop Transportation Technologies , a company that hopes to pioneer terrestrial transit at the speed of sound using a cadre of far-flung engineers collaborating on Google Docs. It has been two-plus years since HTT’s co-founder told Wired , “We’ve solved all the technical issues,” but the team has yet to test a full-scale prototype . That hasn’t stopped HTT from getting government funding from Ohio to the Chinese hinterland . Something interesting is happening as HTT and other firms move forward with their plans: The Hyperloop is starting to look more familiar than space-age. The HTT car, for example, is not the bobsled-size carriage imagined by Musk, but closer to the size of a needle-nosed Shinkansen train car. That design choice brings the idea of Hyperloop infrastructure away from Musk’s initial vision of a nimble, easy-to-build pipeline and closer to the costly, time-consuming right-of-way whose pursuit characterizes the construction of roads and railways. The vehicle isn’t the only part of the Hyperloop that’s coming to resemble more traditional transportation options. Recently, I sat down with Josh Geigel, the co-founder and chief technology officer of Virgin Hyperloop One, the more serious Hyperloop venture. What Hyperloop One has going for it is an actual test track where reporters have been invited to watch a pod achieve speeds of 240 miles per hour. But that’s just the technology. As a transportation solution, Hyperloop One is starting to lay down some parameters on what will and won’t work. (It may be the influence of CEO Jay Walder, who ran transit systems in Hong Kong and New York.) Carrying small numbers of people, as the initial concept aimed to do? “I can’t imagine a system moving less than 4,000–5,000 people an hour and paying for itself,” Geigel said. Routes stretching across the country? The sweet spot, said Geigel, would be under 200 miles. When Geigel outlined how his tubes would load up 16,000 passengers per hour on its first projected route near Mumbai—a carrying capacity approaching the Tokyo–Osaka Shinkansen, the world’s busiest high-speed train line—he explained that the system would launch “convoys” of “pods” that would leave the hub together and wind up in different destinations. In short, Hyperloop One’s project is beginning to sound a bit like a high-speed rail line. Not coincidentally, Geigel is now estimating the system costing 60 to 70 percent the cost of high-speed rail—not, as Musk once projected, 10 percent or less. No one is making more Hyperloop plans than Musk, whose Boring Company has committed with varying degrees of seriousness to build tunnels under Washington, D.C ., Chicago , and Los Angeles . But at the prototype tunnel in the company’s L.A. headquarters, the model has evolved from tunnels carrying cars on skates to, well, a kind of infernal transportation Cat-Dog . Aaron Gordon at Jalopnik sums it up :
Yes, for those keeping score, in a mere two years we’ve gone from a futuristic vision of electric skates zooming around a variety of vehicles in a network of underground tunnels to—and I cannot stress this enough—a very small, paved tunnel that can fit one (1) car. Asked to describe why he had moved from the “cars on skates” plan to a regular one-lane auto tunnel, Musk said on Twitter, “This is simple and it just works.” In its first public-facing commission, beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, the Boring Company is working on something that will sound familiar to anyone who’s been to an airport: autonomous, electric buses with rubber wheels driving around a closed system underground. So, will we one day travel from town to town like spitballs in a straw? Maybe! But not if, when starry-eyed technologists come to face the reality of regulations, rights-of-way, and economics, they find something to like in the way things have always been done. Turns out it’s easier to use the wheel than to reinvent it. Support our journalism

The On-Screen Friendships That Inspired Booksmart ’s Stars,slate.com,Studio 360,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/booksmart-movie-influences-beanie-feldstein-kaitlyn-dever-interview.html,"Reading the Black Hills Pioneer, Deadwood ’s Newspaper It’s a movie that follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, leading to frequent comparisons to Superbad , which stars Feldstein’s brother Jonah Hill. But it also expands, updates, and improves the genre by telling a story about female friendship that is specific, fresh, and believable. “The main character of Booksmart is not me or Kaitlyn,” Beanie Feldstein tells Studio 360’s Kurt Andersen. “It’s the space between us. I think that friendship was always the central character of the film.” Feldstein and Dever’s chemistry is rooted in a friendship that started the moment they were cast. The first time they met was at lunch with Wilde, who jokingly suggested they live together. “The two of us looked at each other after knowing each other for 20 minutes and we were like, ‘Let’s do it!’ The appies hadn’t even arrived,” says Feldstein. “No joke, like, literally we had just sat down,” Dever says. “You know, you read this script and you go, oh, this movie would not be what it is without their extreme bond and connection.” To get a better understanding of how Feldstein and Dever tapped into this multifaceted friendship, Studio 360 asked them for a playlist of female friendships in film and TV that informed the one they portrayed in Booksmart , starting with Broad City ’s Abbi and Ilana (played by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer). Below is an edited excerpt from their conversation with Andersen. To hear the full audio version, listen to this episode of Studio 360 below. Beanie Feldstein: The way that they love each other, and they have this sort of sound and rhythm to their banter, is so iconic. We knew that Molly and Amy’s would maybe stem from a different place and they’d be talking about different things, but— Kaitlyn Dever: They always say “dude” to each other. “Dude.” Feldstein: Yeah. They have a rhythm that when you hear it, even if you weren’t watching it, you’d be like, “That’s Broad City .” Also, the way that they flop all over each other and they’re so connected and they’re so warm and comfortable with each other was definitely something that we knew Molly and Amy would have. Kurt Andersen: Kaitlyn, one of your [influences] you mentioned was the buddy comedy The Heat starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock. This rough and ready character, in Melissa McCarthy’s case, and this buttoned-up FBI agent. Dever: Yes! Feldstein: Our queens. Dever: Even though it’s like a crazy funny action comedy, there is a lot of heart to it. I think it’s so beautiful when you don’t just have a comedy and it’s completely funny the whole way through and you’re trying to land a joke. There’s so much more to life than being sad all the time or just being happy all the time. There’s so much flow in between there. Andersen: One you mentioned, Beanie, as well, was Gilmore Girls . Not the mother and daughter relationship, but Rory Gilmore’s relationship with her friend Paris. Feldstein: Yes, Paris was a huge inspiration for me, for Molly. Andersen: Really? She was the smartest kid in this fancy new school that Rory goes to at the beginning of the series. Feldstein: Yes, exactly. Obviously, they’re not best friends when they first meet. I think that kind of calm, quiet thoughtfulness of Rory and the brazen intensity of Paris is very similar to Molly and Amy. Amy Sherman-Palladino’s writing is just so brilliantly specific and littered with references only those two girls would know. And Katie Silberman’s writing is so similar, and the way that she writes Molly and Amy and how quickly they talk to each other and they just throw out all these incredible references that the two of them can just pull out so offhand. Paris was this unapologetically intense young woman, and that was very much a Molly to me. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

Apple is finally ditching iTunes.,slate.com,Aaron Mak,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/apple-itunes-retiring-ditching-killing-bye.html,"Why Are Right-Wingers So Obsessed With Electromagnetic Pulses? Ahead of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week, Bloomberg is reporting that the company will announce the end of its signature iTunes media platform. Apple will replace iTunes with three separate apps: Music, TV, and Podcasts. Debuting in 2001, iTunes had its heyday in the 2000s as a virtual jukebox in which people could store their 99-cent MP3 purchases from the online Music Store. Apple originally marketed the platform as a tool for burning custom mixes onto CDs, and then as a playlist organizer for the then newly released iPod. The platform eventually expanded to include podcasts and TV shows in 2005 and movies in 2006, and eventually hosted the Genius algorithm that could build playlists based on users’ tastes. With the advent of streaming, tech analysts have been predicting the end of iTunes for at least three years . Apple’s iPhones and iPads have forgone iTunes for stand-alone video, music, and podcast apps for quite some time now. The Apple Music streaming service has been the default for devices for a while. It’s only Mac computers that still use the iTunes platform. As Rolling Stone suggests, phasing out iTunes fits in with Apple’s overall strategy to become an entertainment services provider. Sales for its marquee iPhone lines have begun to lose steam in recent years, so Apple has been exploring new markets with TV, payment, newspaper, and gaming products. Users have also long had complaints about iTunes’ clunky integration and syncing features. We’re likely to get the full details of iTunes’ retirement during the WWDC keynote speech on Monday."
"Trump gives Art Laffer, the world's worst economist, the presidential medal of freedom",slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/trump-gives-art-laffer-the-worlds-worst-economist-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom.html,"The New Trove of Secret Gerrymandering Files Will Be a Nightmare for the GOP There may be no man alive who has done more damage to America’s understanding of economics than Art Laffer. So, of course, Donald Trump is now awarding him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House press release calls Laffer the “father of supply-side economics,” the conservative doctrine that emphasizes growth through tax cuts. First, he’s not really the father of this movement. Its original intellectual force was economist Robert Mundell, a quirky Nobel prize winner under whom Laffer studied. Laffer did go on to become the idea’s most important preacher and popularizer, though. He’s best known for observing that if the government raises taxes too high, it will eventually collect less revenue, because people will begin to work and earn less. Thus, in some circumstances, tax cuts could theoretically pay for themselves by spurring the economy. He wasn’t actually the first person to notice this , but no matter. One night at dinner in 1974 , he illustrated the point to Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld by drawing a curve on a napkin—which is why we now call the concept the Laffer curve. The Laffer curve is a somewhat useful observation. Most economists agree that there is a point of diminishing returns where raising taxes becomes counterproductive. But to reach it, you probably have to push rates really, really high—possibly to somewhere around 70 percent. Laffer has instead spent years preaching the idea that almost any tax cut for businesses and the rich could potentially pay for itself, an intellectually corrosive notion that has now become the conceptual backbone of the Republican Party’s entire economic program. Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin insisted the administration’s own tax cut would cover its own cost (Laffer , who advised Trump’s campaign in 2016, himself said the cut to the corporate rate would pay for itself “ many times over .”) Mitch McConnell said much the same . Predictably, it wasn’t true . Spreading the idea that tax cuts are self-financing wasn’t Laffer’s only sin against economics. He’s been personally involved in some disastrous public policy experiments, such as the notorious Kansas tax plan that wrecked the state’s finances. And recently, he and his longtime friend Stephen Moore, the conservative pundit Donald Trump nearly nominated to the Fed, co-wrote Trumponomics , a book-length tribute to the administration’s policies. Now he’s getting a medal for his services."
Gillette’s ad featuring a father teaching his trans son to shave will do undeniable good.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/gillette-ad-trans-son-shaving.html,"The quietly joyful ad is the best of corporate activism. Gillette This post is part of Outward , Slate’s home for coverage of LGBTQ life, thought, and culture Read more here . Following its controversial Super Bowl commercial, which took aim at toxic masculinity, Gillette released a new ad this month that seems to double down on its newfound role as an arbiter of conversations around gender. The latest ad features Toronto-based artist Samson Bonkeabantu Brown shaving for the first time. His father looks over his shoulder, giving stoic paternal advice (“don’t be scared—shaving is about confidence”) when Samson’s hand looks as if it might start shaking. It’s a sweet moment, made sweeter by the fact that Samson is among the first transgender men to be featured in a major ad campaign. “Growing up, I was always trying to figure out what kind of man I wanted to become,” Samson says in the ad. “I always knew I was different. I didn’t know there was a term for the type of person that I was. I’m glad I’m at the point where I’m able to shave.” Unlike the Super Bowl spot, Samson’s ad is stripped down, quietly joyful and wholly divorced from tragedy—a rarity in mainstream narratives about transitioning, which Samson himself acknowledged in a Facebook post . “I’m keenly aware of how blessed I am to be able to exist in this world being supported by my family in ways that all too often many of my trans brothers, sisters, and siblings who exist outside the binary are not always as fortunate.” The ad— shared on Facebook with the amusingly crass tagline “Whenever, wherever, however it happens – your first shave is special”—has already racked up 1.4 million views and has been shared almost 10,000 times. And it doesn’t look like it’ll be the last of Gillette’s foray into corporate activism. A spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News that the company believes “brands play a role in influencing culture and have a responsibility to use their voice to champion issues of great relevance to both the brand and our customers.” If talk like that skeeves you out, you’re not alone. Vocal corporate wokeness always raises the question of how much of the impetus behind a campaign is actually in service of “championing issues of greater relevance” and how much of it is about helping out the bottom line. There isn’t a whole lot of public data available about how Gillette’s toxic masculinity ad affected sales; anecdotally, if you read the reviews of competitors’ razors on Amazon, there’s a sizable contingent of customers who proudly admit that they switched from Gillette because of the ad. But despite the numerous angry think pieces about the demonization of men, in late January, the chief financial officer of Gillette’s parent company said sales remained at pre-campaign level and that the company was happy with the “unprecedented levels” of media coverage. All this makes both watching and writing about this new ad feel a little squicky. Ad campaigns like these are almost always a ploy to appeal to younger, more socially conscious consumers. Gillette even admits it. And the corporate appropriation of these stories to sell things has so diluted the discourse around movements like, say, body positivity that there’s now genuine debate about whether someone like Curvy Wife Guy is a hack or an activist . Because companies rarely take risks that they think won’t pay off in the long run, it’s easy to read these positions as postures, an investment scheme. To see an intimate moment between a trans man and his father reduced to that will always produce a bit of cognitive dissonance. On the other hand, the ad is very sweet! And there’s no denying it will do some good—and it already seems to have. Comments on the video relay real ebullience: “This had me in tears! Plus, my trans son had the biggest smile watching it. Thank you for being inclusive!” one read. Another: “I was so afraid to read the comments and I’m crying this is amazing. Tbh my first shave was made with my husband because my dad passed away years before I started to transition last year and Thank you! This makes me feel so good this morning at work.” Beyond the joy of seeing yourself represented on a national stage, when only 16 percent of Americans personally know someone whose transgender, ads like these can give a human face to a story. It’s impossible to discount how important that is, especially when, as in the Gillette ad, those stories are told by the subjects themselves."
William Barr’s CBS interview was full of smears and falsehoods.,slate.com,William Saletan,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-cbs-interview-lies.html,"Mulvaney: Request to Hide McCain Ship During Trump Visit Was “Not an Unreasonable” Ask Attorney General William Barr says he’s trying to wrap up the Russia investigation with fairness and honesty. “We live in a hyperpartisan age,” Barr told Jan Crawford of CBS News in an interview recorded on Thursday. “I’m going to make the decisions based on the law and the facts.” But the 45-minute interview , from which CBS aired excerpts on Friday, is full of falsehoods and smears. It exposes Barr as an agent of President Donald Trump. Barr says Trump didn’t obstruct justice in the investigation, despite special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which details nearly a dozen obstructive acts by the president. To this day, Barr has supplied no written basis for his conclusions and no point-by-point rebuttal of Mueller’s evidence. Instead, Barr has turned the Justice Department’s fire on Trump’s investigators. Two weeks ago, Barr told Fox News that if he were Trump, “ I’d be comfortable saying it was a witch hunt .” In Thursday’s interview, Crawford asked Barr about the 2016 decision by former FBI officials, including then-Director James Comey, to investigate contacts between Russian-affiliated actors and people in the Trump campaign. “Mueller has spent two and a half years,” Barr replied. “And the fact is, there is no evidence of a conspiracy. So it was bogus. This whole idea that Trump was in cahoots with the Russians is bogus.” Barr addresses only one of Trump’s multiple efforts to interfere in the investigation. Bogus? To begin with, Mueller was appointed on May 17, 2017 , almost exactly two years ago. The phrase “two and a half years” comes from Trump’s surrogates, who have been circulating it for months . Barr’s description of the report’s bottom line on collusion—“no evidence”—also parrots the Trump camp’s spin. Actually, Mueller reported that there was evidence but that it “ did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired ” in two specific Russian operations: promulgating fake news to influence the election and hacking and disseminating Democratic emails. Mueller concluded that “the investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to the Campaign.” Mueller added that “in some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer.” In the interview, Barr addresses only one of Trump’s multiple efforts to interfere in the investigation. He asserts that Trump’s firing of Comey in May 2017 can’t be obstruction of justice, because “we don’t believe that the firing of an agency head could be established as having the probable effect, objectively speaking, of sabotaging a proceeding.” That’s preposterous. Mueller’s report documents a direct attempt by Trump, through Comey, to sabotage a proceeding . In February 2017, Trump expelled everyone else from the Oval Office so he could speak with Comey alone. Trump used this opportunity to ask Comey to drop the FBI’s investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who had been caught lying about his contacts with Russia. Mueller reports that just before this meeting, Trump told a friend that getting rid of Flynn would end the Russia inquiry. But Comey continued the inquiry, and Trump fired him. That’s prima facie evidence of intent to sabotage the investigation. Barr doesn’t just assert Trump’s innocence. He says there’s no evidence that Trump is damaging American institutions. “People are saying that it’s President Trump that’s shredding our institutions. I really see no evidence of that,” Barr told Crawford. The real “shredding of our norms and our institutions,” Barr contends, is coming from “the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him.” Again, that’s boilerplate spin from the Trump camp. And again, it flies in the face of the Mueller report. In addition to Trump’s attempt to subvert the Flynn investigation, the report details how Trump sent back-channel messages to then–Attorney General Jeff Sessions to abort the Russia inquiry, tried to overturn Sessions’ recusal, tried to cover up the Trump Tower meeting between Russians and his senior campaign aides, tried to fire Mueller, and tried to create a false witness statement that he hadn’t tried to fire Mueller. Every one of these incidents is a documented assault on American institutions. Barr’s claim that he has seen no evidence of such assaults is, in effect, a confession that the attorney general hasn’t read or refuses to accept the report. While denying any evidence of Trump’s corruption, Barr insinuates that Trump’s investigators behaved improperly . “The use of foreign intelligence capabilities and counterintelligence capabilities against an American political campaign to me is unprecedented. And it’s a serious red line that’s been crossed,” Barr told Crawford. “I have not gotten answers that are at all satisfactory,” he said of the investigators’ conduct. “Some of the facts that I’ve learned don’t hang together with the official explanations.” Barr doesn’t explain on what basis he’s casting these public aspersions, which ostensibly derive from an ongoing internal probe of the investigators. Nor does he reject Trump’s claims that the investigators betrayed their country. When Crawford asked whether Comey and other top FBI officials “committed treason,” as Trump alleges, Barr replied: “Not as a legal matter.” Throughout this performance, Barr depicted himself as an honest guy just trying to call balls and strikes in a world gone mad. He lamented that others don’t share his objectivity. “Sometimes people can convince themselves that what they’re doing is in the higher interest,” he told Crawford. “Sometimes they can look at evidence and facts through a biased prism that they themselves don’t realize.” If Barr is lucky, he’ll be remembered as one of those people—and not as an accomplice who lied through his teeth.

"Fleabag’s black jumpsuit is selling out, and fans are here to tell you why.",slate.com,Heather Schwedel,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/black-jumpsuit-fleabag-sold-out-sideboob.html,"The 2020 Democratic Candidates Sure Don’t Want to Talk About Using Paid Child Care. (We Asked.) If someone said the words “fleabag jumpsuit” to you, you would probably not picture an especially attractive item of clothing. Perhaps some sort of exterminator’s uniform? But ah, capitalize that F , and that’s a whole ’nother story, if this week is any evidence. As Fleabag fever takes over the internet, or at least some corners of it, one outfit worn by the show’s titular Fleabag, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, has become a particular locus of obsession: the jumpsuit she dons for a family dinner in the premiere episode of the show’s second season, the most notable features of which include a lack of back material and a … strategically placed large front keyhole. Fleabag is an import from the U.K., and when it aired there earlier this year, it created a bit of a run on this style of jumpsuit, an off-the-rack number available for £38 at retailers like Topshop. Now it appears the same thing is happening stateside: It’s on back order here and here . It must be said that the jumpsuit is a pretty risqué get-up, especially when worn for a dinner that includes a priest, as Fleabag did. While it’s not quite as revealing as say, the famous Versace dress that led to the creation of a hugely popular search engine , one also doesn’t not think of that dress upon seeing it. (For side-boob reasons.) When women ran out to buy the blue dress Kate Middleton wore in her engagement photos , that made sense to me; everyone’s always looking for a nice, but not-too-nice dress. But a backless jumpsuit is so … specific! I must be missing something. Where would you wear it? What kind of support situation does it require? Does it confer all who wear it with some kind of PWB-ian magic? Should we all buy it and do some kind of reverse- Handmaid’s Tale stunt thing? I decided to talk to five women who bought—or considered buying—the Fleabag jumpsuit to get some answers. Kathryn VanArendonk, a Vulture staffer, said that she bought the outfit about four minutes after a friend sent her a link to it. “She sent it specifically because it was the Fleabag jumpsuit, and much of the appeal of it IS that it’s the Fleabag jumpsuit,” she said. (VanArendonk went on to publish a love letter to the jumpsuit .) It seems like the jumpsuit spurred a contagion of friendly enabling, in fact. It just kind of felt like everybody was doing it. Buyer Ilana Kaplan told me, “I saw it trending last night and saw people’s photos and saw body types similar to mine looking really good in it, so I was like, maybe I would too?” Genevieve Burgess thought the jumpsuit looked good on Fleabag, but she was on the fence until she found out that it only cost about $50—and a bunch of strangers on Twitter encouraged her to go for it. “While I was trying to figure out if it could work out with heels, my tweet contemplating the jumpsuit hit the Twitter moment and then it was sold out!” she said. Hate when that happens. I didn't THINK I wanted the Fleabag jumpsuit until I found out it was just $50 but I'm sure shipping is a bitch, right? https://t.co/0iPlmokSL0 — Genevieve Burgess (@rustyheadedgirl) May 30, 2019 Holy shit, I went to make dinner and came back to a bunch of lovely strangers encouraging me to get a highly boobalicious jumpsuit. Twitter is an interesting place. — Genevieve Burgess (@rustyheadedgirl) May 30, 2019 Karen K. Ho said she bought the jumpsuit even though she hasn’t actually watched the new season of Fleabag yet; she’s just that inspired by PWB and Fleabag. “I have never bought anything like this in my entire life,” Ho said. “I don’t own any other jumpsuits. I don’t own other pop culture stuff.” (Coincidence that the jumpsuit seems to appeal especially to journalists? Who can say?) I have honestly never impulse-purchased anything like this in my entire life and now I wonder if this is what hot people feel like all the time pic.twitter.com/gt4HZPo99I — Karen K. Ho (@karenkho) May 30, 2019 Rarely do admiration and research about boob tape fit together so seamlessly. Ho did a fair amount of research and shared her findings, as well as a picture of herself in the jumpsuit, on Twitter, and was pretty surprised by the outpouring of compliments she received. “I’m not a very fashionable person. I can’t afford to buy super-nice clothes. But I put it on, and I was just like, is this what hot people feel like all the time?” Such is the magic of the Fleabag jumpsuit, apparently. “It looks very, very good on me,” VanArendonk said. Fionnuala, a London health researcher who preferred to withhold her last name to keep her penchant for Fleabag off Google, said she hoped to “do my best Phoebe Waller-Bridge impression” in the jumpsuit, which she ordered this week and is eagerly anticipating. “I greatly admire PWB and her ambition and her output,” Ho added. “If I can feel a little bit of that while wearing the jumpsuit, that is worth it to me.” Rarely do admiration and research about boob tape fit together so seamlessly. Ho also plans to look into nipple covers and special bras, which seems to be the consensus. “With regards to my boob concerns,” Kaplan said, “I’m hoping that the top will be tight enough to support without a bra but with a little tape if necessary.” As for where they’ll wear it, there are actually a ton of occasions it would be good for, the jumpsuiters said. Weddings! Panels! “I would wear it on a date,” Fionnuala said. “Maybe not a first date.” And if someone else shows up wearing the jumpsuit at a function where you’ve also chosen to wear it? “I would try and get a picture,” Fionnuala said. Kaplan said she would “compliment them on their great taste in TV shows.” VanArendonk went further: “I am sure that if I show up wearing this jumpsuit and someone’s already wearing it, we will shout FLEABAG JUMPSUIT! and high five and yell about how great Fleabag is, and then we’ll hug and exchange twitter handles and feel bonded by our mutual love of reasonably priced jumpsuits and PWB’s brilliance.” But Fleabag is a complex, nuanced show. Its fans are sophisticated. They can’t just accept a jumpsuit without critiquing it too. There was, for instance, a wide-ranging discussion on Twitter about who the jumpsuit was intended for: What if you’re short, or well-endowed, or wear a size larger than the U.K. 16, the largest size it comes in? “It’s not a jumpsuit that all people are gonna feel great in,” VanArendonk acknowledged. These are fair points. “I think it is a little bit of a pity that a lot of the discourse around it has been, ‘Oh well you have to be tall and skinny to wear it,’ ” Fionnuala said. “I think it’d be really lovely to see people who don’t fit that and who make it work. It would be great to see people of all types of shapes and sizes and genders and whatever wearing it.” Another sin of the jumpsuit’s? (Forgive us, father.) It is undeniably fast fashion. Ho said, “This kind of garment, even if I plan to keep it a while and wear it often, is part of a much larger problem,” nodding to sustainability and waste. “I definitely thought about it when I was ordering it.” To be a Fleabag fan is to reckon with one’s flaws. But thanks to jumpsuit season, also one’s hotness."
Virginia Beach shooting: city employees killed at public works office by co-worker.,slate.com,Chad Lorenz,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/virginia-beach-shooting-city-employees-killed-municipal-center.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel A Virginia Beach city employee firing “indiscriminately” killed at least 11 people at a municipal office building Friday afternoon, according to Police Chief James Cervera, making it the highest-casualty U.S. shooting of the year. The suspect, a public utilities worker, died after a shootout with police, the chief said. At least six other people were injured and taken to hospitals, including a police officer who was saved by his bullet-proof vest. The shooting began in the public works office building next to City Hall, and the gunman moved onto multiple floors, police said. A reporter for local NBC affiliate WAVY said a source told him the suspect was “a former employee who was actually fired yesterday from the city.” City Councilwoman Barbara Henley told the Associated Press she realized what was happening as she approached a group of people gathered outside City Hall at 4 p.m. “Somebody told me there had been a shooting and they were told to leave. Afterward, I heard a loud male voice say, ‘Get down!’ so I did,” Henley told the AP. “When the person said to get down, then everybody dispersed pretty quickly,” she said. “I’m just sick. All these people that I work with all the time,” she said. “They are such really fine people, and I just hope they’re all safe.” The magnitude of the tragedy is comparable to 2018’s most dire shootings, including the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shooting in October, with 11 dead; the Santa Fe High School shooting in Texas in May, when 10 were killed; and the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland in February, with 17 dead. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper quoted Mayor Bobby Dyer saying, “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach.”"

Police identify Virginia Beach gunman who killed 12 as “disgruntled” city employee.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/dewayne-craddock-virginia-beach-gunman-city-employee.html,"The Supreme Court Just Made It Easier for Police to Arrest You for Filming Them Police on Saturday identified the gunman who opened fire at a municipal building in Virginia Beach on Friday and killed 12 people as a “disgruntled” city employee who had served in the military. Four others were seriously injured and are in the hospital. Officials did not elaborate as to why DeWayne Craddock, who had worked for the city for 15 years, was disgruntled or what could have precipitated the attack. They also did not say whether he was facing any kind of disciplinary action. Craddock died after engaging in a “long-term gun battle” with police officers that wounded one officer who was saved by his bullet-proof vest. “This is the most devastating day in the history of Virginia Beach,” Mayor Bobby Dyer said at a news conference. “The people involved are our friends, co-workers, neighbors and colleagues.” It was the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since November 2018 when 12 people were killed at a bar in California . Craddock allegedly shot and killed his first victim in a car outside the public works and utilities building before going inside and opening fire “immediately and indiscriminately,” Virginia Beach Police Chief James Cervera said. The gunfire began at around 4 p.m., just as workers were getting ready to leave for the weekend . Officials found people wounded on all three floors of the building as Craddock seemed to move quickly through the building armed with at least a .45-caliber pistol that had a sound suppressor and extended magazines that helped him reload repeatedly during the attack. Police later said they recovered “additional weapons” at the scene. Craddock, 40, joined the Army National Guard after graduating from high school in the nearby city of Newport News . He then went to Old Dominion University, where he received a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering. He worked at private firms before joining the city government. Craddock did not appear to have any record with the police beyond some traffic violations. Police and city officials made a point of saying they would only name the suspect once in order to focus attention on the victims. Virginia Beach city manager Dave Hansen named the victims during a news conference, describing the shooting as a “senseless, incomprehensible act of violence.” Eleven of the dead were city employees and one was a contractor who was trying to obtain a permit. The dead were: Laquita C Brown, of Chesapeake, Virginia; Tara Walsh Gallagher, of Virginia Beach; Mary Louis Gayle, of Virginia Beach; Alexander Mikhail Gusev, of Virginia Beach; Katherine A Nixon, of Virginia Beach; Richard H Nettleton, of Norfolk; Christopher Kelly Rapp of Powhatan; Ryan Keith Cox, of Virginia Beach; Joshua A Hardy, of Virginia Beach; Michelle “Missy” Langer, of Virginia Beach; Robert “Bobby” Williams, of Chesapeake; and Herbert “Bert” Snelling, of Virginia Beach.

Ocasio-Cortez: Federal tipped minimum wage of $2.13 is “indentured servitude.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/ocasio-cortez-bartending-federal-tipped-minimum-wage.html,"The Supreme Court Just Made It Easier for Police to Arrest You for Filming Them Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was back behind a bar Friday night as she mixed drinks at the Queensboro Restaurant in Queens to support a campaign to increase the federal minimum wage. “I’ve always got my backup job,” she joked . “I’ve still got it!” The 29-year-od freshman lawmaker specifically advocated for workers who must rely on tips to get a decent wage. “I was nervous that I may have lost my touch—still got it! That muscle memory doesn’t quit,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter . I was nervous that I may have lost my touch - still got it! That muscle memory doesn’t quit 😉Now let’s pass #RaiseTheWage and get $15 an hour minimum for every worker in America. pic.twitter.com/FR0ARUB7bd — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) May 31, 2019 The vast majority of states allow employers to pay workers below the federal minimum age if they can make up the difference in tips . “Any job that pays $2.13 an hour is not a job. It’s indentured servitude,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “All labor has dignity and the way that we give labor dignity is by paying people the respect and the value that they are worth.” That is why, she argued, the national minimum wage must increase to $15 an hour. It is particularly important to guarantee a minimum wage to workers in cities with a high cost of living, Ocasio-Cortez argued. “When our rents are running away, when our food costs are running away, in dense cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, we need to make sure that people are paid enough to live, period,” she said. Being so reliant on tips ultimately leaves workers more vulnerable to harassment and other type of labor violations. “I remember working in restaurants, and, you know, you would have someone say something extremely inappropriate to you, or you’d have someone touch you, and the thing is it would be the 28th of the month, the 29th of the month. And the first of the next month was rolling right around and you have a rent check to pay,” she said. “And so you are more likely to stand up for yourself and to reject sexual harassment on the 15th of the month, or maybe the 10th of the month, when you could pick up an extra shift to make up for telling that guy to go buzz off.” Support our journalism

Navy acknowledges request to hide USS John McCain during Trump visit.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/navy-acknowledges-request-hide-uss-john-mccain-trump.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel The U.S. Navy confirmed that all the reports were true and the White House had requested to hide the USS John S. McCain during President Donald Trump’s state visit to Japan. “A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President’s visit,” Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, chief of Navy information, said in a statement . “There were also no intentional efforts to explicitly exclude Sailors assigned to USS John S. McCain.” The acknowledgement came shortly after acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called for an investigation of the incident. “Our business is to run military operations and not become politicized,” Shanahan told reporters in Singapore. “I would not have moved the ship.” The controversy over the request began earlier this week when the Wall Street Journal reported that the White House wanted the destroyer to be moved “out of sight” during the president’s visit. In the statement, Brown said the Navy is “fully cooperating with the review of this matter.” According to earlier reports , the request to hide the ship came from the White House military operations office. And it seems the Navy initially tried to comply with the request. Although the USS John S. McCain was under repairs and moving It would have been impractical, its name was temporarily hidden by a giant tarp. Once higher ups got wind of what was going on they called the whole thing off. But the question remains about whether sailors from the USS McCain were deliberately kept away from Trump’s speech. Some say they were turned away, but officials insist that if that happened it was solely due to a space issue and not because their uniforms include the ship’s name. Trump has denied he knew anything about the request but also did not seem particularly troubled by it, saying that whoever made it likely had good intentions. “Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn’t like him, O.K.?” Trump told reporters . “They were well meaning, I will say. I didn’t know anything about it. I would never have done that.” He also used the opportunity to once again explain why he “was not a big fan of John McCain.” . @MeghanMcCain on @TheView : “It’s impossible to go through the grief process when my father, who’s been dead 10 months, is constantly in the news cycle, because the president is so obsessed with the fact that he’s never going to be a great man like he was” https://t.co/ftBCPe97PB pic.twitter.com/JV7VDo2dLV — The View (@TheView) May 30, 2019 Meghan McCain harshly criticized Trump this week, saying that his repeated attacks against her father have made an already difficult time even more difficult. “It’s impossible to go through the grief process when my father, who’s been dead 10 months, is constantly in the news cycle because the President is so obsessed with the fact that he’s never going to be a great man like he was,” she said at the beginning of The View on Thursday . “It’s a bizarre way to do this. It’s a bizarre way to grieve. It’s a bizarre way to say goodbye to my dad.” She also took to Twitter to call Trump a “child,” saying that she feels the need to “stand up for him” because “Trump won’t let him RIP.” Trump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life. There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won't let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him.It makes my grief unbearable. https://t.co/gUbFAla1VE — Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) May 30, 2019 Support our journalism

Applicants for U.S. visas will have to hand over social media usernames.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/applicants-united-states-visas-social-media-usernames.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel The vast majority of applicants for U.S. visas will now have to hand over their social media usernames along with previous email addresses and phone numbers, according to a newly imposed rule . Applicants for pretty much all visas, except for certain diplomatic and official ones, will have to give five years’ worth of phone numbers, email addresses, and social media handles as part of the application process. The State Department was already collecting social media information, but only for those who had been identified for additional scrutiny, including people with a history of traveling to areas controlled by terrorist groups. That meant some 65,000 people had to hand over that information. But now the number will include around 14 million applicants for nonimmigrant visas and some 700,000 applicants for immigrant visas. Although applicants will be able to say they don’t use social media, lying about it could lead to “serious immigration consequences,” a State Department official said in an interview with the Hill . For now the form only includes the most popular social media platforms, but soon applicants will be able to list all the sites they use. “This is a critical step forward in establishing enhanced vetting of foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States,” the official added. “As we’ve seen around the world in recent years, social media can be a major forum for terrorist sentiment and activity. This will be a vital tool to screen out terrorists, public safety threats, and other dangerous individuals from gaining immigration benefits and setting foot on U.S. soil.” When the new rule was proposed last year, the ACLU called it “ ineffective and deeply problematic .” The move “will infringe on the rights of immigrants and U.S. citizens by chilling freedom of speech and association, particularly because people will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,” the ACLU said.

Pelosi vows “ironclad case” against Trump as cries to “impeach” erupt during speech.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/pelosi-ironclad-case-trump-california-democratic-convention.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed the California Democratic Party State Convention Saturday and was met with loud cries of “impeach” as the decidedly left-leaning crowd made clear what they wanted as she vowed to continue investigating the president . “I told you this was like coming home for me,” Pelosi joked . The House speaker has been pushing back against calls to begin impeachment proceedings. And while she did not call for the beginning of an impeachment inquiry in her speech on Saturday, she did promise to continue aggressively investigating the administration. Cries for “impeach” as Nancy Pelosi talks about the Mueller report at California’s Democratic Convention pic.twitter.com/7cEEsO7p2r — Zohreen (@Zohreen) June 1, 2019 The cries of “impeach” grew louder as Pelosi referenced special counsel Robert Mueller . “Why is it that the president won’t defend our democracy from this foreign threat?” she asked. “What is the president covering up?” Pelosi vowed to continue looking into the administration’s actions. “We will go where the facts lead us,” she said. “We will build an ironclad case to act.” Pelosi appeared to be trying to make sure attendees at the California convention understood there are other possible routes beyond impeachment, noting that numerous committees in the House are working to expose “the full extent of the president’s wrongdoing and corruption and strengthening our hand to challenge the administration in court.” Pelosi had pushed a similar message during her interview with Jimmy Kimmel earlier in the week. “I think the president wants us to impeach him,” she said . “He knows it’s not a good idea to be impeached, but the silver lining for him is then, he believes, that he would be exonerated by the United States Senate.” And an acquittal in the Senate would likely mean any possibility of holding the president accountable would go down the drain. “So when we go through with our case, it’s got to be ironclad,” Pelosi said. “Ironclad.”"
Trump doubles down on tariff threats against Mexico in early Sunday morning tweets.,slate.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-tariff-threats-abuser-mexico-sunday-morning-tweets.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel President Donald Trump made clear early Sunday morning that he was not backing down from his threats of imposing tariffs against Mexican imports if the country does not step up the fight against migrants crossing the southern border into the United States. Although people have been calling for negotiations with Mexico that is not a real possibility, says Trump. “The problem is that Mexico is an ‘abuser’ of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades,” Trump wrote . People have been saying for years that we should talk to Mexico. The problem is that Mexico is an “abuser” of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 The commander in chief then went to say that the choice Mexico now faces is simple. “Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers, Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs),” Trump added . “America has had enough!” ....Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs). America has had enough! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 Trump’s tweets came days after he vowed to impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico until the country did more to stop the flow of migrants from its border with the United States. The tariff, he warned, would gradually increase to 25 percent “until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.” The threat shocked Wall Street and even many Republicans as Mexico scrambled to try to figure out a way to get Trump to back down. On Saturday, Mexico’s president suggested his government would be willing to take action to prevent the threatened tariffs from being implemented. “The main thing is to inform about what we’re already doing on the migration issue, and if it’s necessary to reinforce these measures without violating human rights, we could be prepared to reach that deal,” Mexico’s President Manuel Lopez Obrador said. On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019 Trump continued his string of migration-related tweets by blasting Democrats, insisting that they are “ doing nothing on the Border ,” The president went on to say that the issue “could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes.” Later, he added that the wall on the southern border is “ moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits .” He also wondered: “What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!” The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2019 The latest threats against Mexico show how Trump sees immigration as key to his reelection bid even if he hasn’t made much progress on what has long been a signature issue. The Washington Post explains :
The wave of border policies flowing from the White House offers a clear signal that Trump’s reelection bid is likely to focus on immigration more than any other topic — a cause that animates his base but also highlights his failure to contain the flow of Central American migrants coming to the United States in record numbers.
“He certainly believes that immigration is a key issue that got him elected and, looking at the 2020 election, he’s trying to show that he’s trying to do something,” said Theresa Brown, a former policy official at the Department of Homeland Security who works at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “He knows that the situation that people are seeing every day shows that he’s not been successful. He has not secured the border.”
For a president who won an electoral college victory in 2016 based on a hard-line immigration message and a promise to make the Mexican government fund construction of a border wall, Trump’s latest gambit is an attempt to cover for the lack of progress on a signature campaign pledge, Brown said.

Impeachment poll: Support for impeachment surges among Democrats but majority of Americans still oppose it.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/impeachment-poll-surges-democrats-trump.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel Democrats are increasingly in favor of impeaching President Donald Trump, with 76 percent saying they support the move to oust the president from office, according to a new CNN poll . That marks a seven-percentage-point increase from April when support for impeachment stood at 69 percent among Democrats, according to the poll conducted by SSRS . Among Americans as a whole, support for impeachment increased only slightly to 41 percent, up from 37 percent last month. On the opposite end, 54 percent are opposed to impeachment. And despite the slight uptick, it is hardly the highest it has ever been compared to the 47 percent who supported impeachment in September 2018. The president’s constant soundbite that he is under attack by Democrats appears to be working as 65 percent say he is facing more investigations than any previous president. But that doesn’t mean the public think the investigations are unfair. Almost half of Americans, or 47 percent, say the investigations are justified, while 44 percent say they are not. That is pretty much divided among party lines, with 75 percent of Democrats saying the investigations are justified and 74 percent of Republicans saying they are not justified. Despite the slight shifts in opinions about impeachment, Trump’s overall approval rating has remained steady and a clear majority continue to disapprove of the president. While 43 percent say they approve of the job Trump is doing in the White House, 52 percent say they disapprove. The poll comes at a time when Democratic lawmakers are increasingly facing calls from their constituents to begin impeachment proceedings. On Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s speech to the California Democratic Party State Convention was repeatedly interrupted by cries of “impeach” from the audience . Support our journalism

In a Sunday morning tweet, Trump blasted the news media, claiming once again that he was being misquoted. “I never called Meghan Markle ‘nasty’,” Trump wrote . “Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN , @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!” I never called Meghan Markle “nasty.” Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN , @nytimes and others apologize?

The only problem? There is clear audio evidence that shows the president did in fact call Markle, whose royal title is the Duchess of Sussex, “nasty” during an interview with the Sun. On Saturday, the “Official Trump War Room” Twitter account that is run by Trump’s reelection campaign made that same claim . And it was roundly mocked because the audio from Trump’s interview that supposedly clears the president, clearly demonstrates he used the word “nasty” to talk about Markle. Fake News CNN is at it again, falsely claiming President Trump called Meghan Markle ""nasty."" Here is what he actually said. Listen for yourself! pic.twitter.com/kLuPXBLMhf — Official Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) June 1, 2019 This is the exchange:
Reporter: [Markle] can’t make it because she has maternity leave. Are you sorry not to see her, because she wasn’t so nice about you during the campaign. I don’t know if you saw that?
Trump: I didn’t know that, no. I didn’t know that. No, I hope she’s OK. I did not know that, no.
Reporter: She said she’d move to Canada if you got elected. It turned out she moved to Britain.
Trump: There are a lot of people moving here. So, what can I say? No, I didn’t know that she was nasty. The reporter was referring to comments Markle made in a 2016 interview in which she called Trump “misogynistic” and characterized his politics as divisive . When the reporter then asks whether it was “good having an American princess” and whether that could help the ties between the United States and Britain, Trump was much more positive. “I think it’s nice. I think it’s nice and I’m sure she will do excellently. She will be very good. She will be very good. I hope she does,” Trump said. This is only the latest example in which Trump has used the word “nasty” to talk about women. Politico explains :
He called 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton “such a nasty woman” at an October debate one month before the election. In April, he said that 2020 White House hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris had “a little bit of a nasty wit,” and described the California Democrat’s questioning of Attorney General William Barr at a congressional hearing last month as “probably very nasty.”
Trump also applied the sobriquet to San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz after she criticized the president’s response to Hurricane Maria. Support our journalism

McCain during President Donald Trump’s visit to Japan. It was not “an unreasonable thing to ask,” Mulvaney said. The acting chief of staff defended the request on both NBC’s Meet the Press and Fox News Sunday and received pushback from the hosts. Yet with that message Mulvaney was merely echoing Trump, who said he didn’t know anything about the request but assured it came from a “well-meaning” person in his staff. “The fact that some 23 or 24-year-old person on the advance team went to that sight and said ‘Oh my goodness, there’s the John McCain’ we all know how the president feels about the former senator, maybe that’s not the best backdrop, can somebody look into moving it,” Mulvaney said . “That’s not an unreasonable thing to ask.” NBC’s Chuck Todd seemingly couldn’t believe what he was hearing; “Seriously?” Mulvaney stuck to his talking point and said it was “silly” to think someone will get fired over the issue. “If you’re going to a staff meeting and say, ‘Look, Chuck is fighting with so-and-so. Let’s not sit them together today at the meeting,’ is that a fireable offence at NBC?” Mulvaney asked. “Goodness gracious. What kind of place are you folks running over here?” WATCH: Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney tells Chuck Todd that moving a Navy ship out of sight from the president was ""not an unreasonable thing to do."" #MTP #IfItsSunday Mulvaney: ""The president's feelings towards the former senator are well known."" pic.twitter.com/kohFeQflaU — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) June 2, 2019 On Fox News Sunday , host Chris Wallace first said he only had 30 seconds to discuss the issue but then went on for longer. Wallace also asked whether someone at the White House would be “disciplined” over the issue. “For what?” Mulvaney asked . “For asking an innocuous question about that? No, does someone get disciplined at Fox News for saying that so and so doesn’t want to sit next to so and so at a meeting? No, again, this is a minor issue that we think the media is trying to make it to a larger matter.” Mulvaney said that it’s key to keep in mind that “nothing happened because of it.” On request to hide USS John S.

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan “directed his chief of staff to speak with the White House military office and reaffirm his mandate that the Department of Defense will not be politicized,” Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement . “The chief of staff reported that he did reinforce this message.” Despite this directive though Shanahan said Sunday that he did not see a need for an official investigation into the request to hide the USS John S.

Sam Mircovich/Reuters On Friday, the New York Times published an article in its Reader Center in which deputy managing editor Matt Purdy defended various decisions the paper made in covering the Mueller investigation, including the A1 print headline “Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy,” which now reads “ Mueller Finds No Trump-Russia Conspiracy, but Stops Short of Exonerating President on Obstruction ” in the online edition. It turns out this was not the first time a major newspaper took a long, hard look at past editorial decisions and decided, hindsight being 20/20, that they had done everything exactly right and wouldn’t change a thing, as this conversation with Chicago Daily Tribune managing editor Pat Maloney shows: For the better part of a year, the Chicago Daily Tribune has been at the forefront of reporting on the presidential matchup between Governor Thomas E.

Directed by those submissions (we received hundreds of responses), we drafted a series of questions and passed them along to J. Loy “Pat” Maloney, a managing editor who oversees the Tribune’s headlines. Mr. Maloney’s responses are below. Many readers who are critical of Governor Dewey have expressed concern that we were overly trusting of advance polls and the predictions of our Washington correspondent Arthur Sears Henning, and, in our initial reporting, were not sufficiently wary of the possibility that Truman might defeat Dewey. Readers have flagged one headline in particular: “Dewey Defeats Truman.” Given that we later characterized Truman as the winner of the 1948 presidential election, were we sufficiently skeptical, in our initial coverage, of the election’s other possible outcomes? In retrospect, are there any articles or headlines that should have been framed differently? MALONEY: There is no question what the top-line news was in the early returns: President Truman had not been found to have won the 1948 presidential election. This election had been a cloud hanging over Governor Dewey’s presidency since the day he announced his candidacy, and the single fact that the sitting president had not definitively won reelection was big news. Hence, the front-page headline that readers have questioned. The Tribune’s afternoon editions that day had a range of stories examining every aspect of the election: its implications, the many unanswered questions, the fact that Dewey did not defeat Truman, the results of the Cook County election for coroner—it’s a real mélange. The front page of the early edition on Nov. 3, did carry that headline, which captured—in the space allowed for print headlines—the news of the day. If we had a little more space, we would have gone with our first draft, “DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN IN INDIANA AND MICHIGAN WHILE LOSING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE BY RATHER A LOT, ACTUALLY, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT, STROM FUCKING THURMOND PICKED UP A FEW ELECTORAL VOTES, SO MAYBE GET IT TOGETHER AND LEAVE THE STONE AGES, ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND PART OF TENNESSEE,” which more accurately conveyed the complexities of the situation, but we were utterly at the mercy of the space allowed for print headlines. And it is worth considering the many other words on the front page that day, which communicated the nuances of the election beneath the headlines. Here are the first two paragraphs of the story headlined “PUTS G.O.P. BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE: Sizeable Electoral Margin Seen,” by Arthur Sears Henning, the most experienced political analyst in Washington:
Dewey and Warren won a sweeping victory in the Presidential election yesterday.
The early returns showed the Republican ticket leading Truman and Barkley pretty confidently in northern and western states. The indications were that the complete returns would disclose that Dewey won the Presidency by an overwhelming majority of electoral votes. It’s all still completely wrong, but it communicates more nuances. And within hours of the release of Arthur Sears Henning’s analysis, one of our other experienced reporters, Arthur Sears Henning, the most experienced political analyst in Washington, rebutted Arthur Sears Henning’s analysis in our pages and addressed the most contentious part of the 1948 presidential election: determining who won the 1948 presidential election. His story was on the front page of later editions. After pointing out that key states were still in doubt, Henning wrote:
Incomplete returns from the Presidential election yesterday gave Dewey and Warren a precarious lead over Truman and Barkley.
It looked as tho it might take the complete returns to establish whether Dewey or Truman had won. A review of our work that day shows that we captured the biggest news as well as the complications and looming controversies behind it. It might seem to some readers that you’re reflexively defending something we got wrong. MALONEY: Perhaps not surprisingly, I disagree. One of the key lines near the top of the page said: “ Patrick J. Hurley , Republican, took an early lead over former Agriculture Secretary Anderson in New Mexico, one of eight pivotal states.” Seventy-one years later, many of the details have been filled in, and we know that Anderson ultimately won his race. Yet that statement about Hurley’s lead in the early returns, which was our best assessment at the time, remains true. But the headline “Dewey Defeats Truman” might leave some readers with the mistaken impression that Thomas Dewey won the presidential election of 1948, which was not true then and is not true now. MALONEY: During the 1948 presidential campaign, the press had to deal with the extraordinary circumstance of both major party candidates defeating each other. For instance, Dewey defeated Truman in Indiana, while Truman defeated Dewey in the presidential election. Coverage of both outcomes was justified as news. We understand that readers often see political coverage through—no surprise!—their own political lens, and we thank God every day that, as journalists, we have had our political lenses surgically removed. Our job is to work hard to make our coverage appear to come from an objective news perspective. To do that, we are constantly asking ourselves the following questions, usually in a sing-songy voice: What is important for readers to know? Do our readers treat this noble institution with enough deference and respect? Who won the presidential election of 1948? Who’s to say what’s true anymore, anyway? You know? Do you worry that Dewey supporters will go around for years to come citing the Chicago Tribune to claim that Thomas Dewey won the presidential election of 1948? Or that Dewey himself might keep repeating the phrase “Dewey Defeats Truman” any time he sees a microphone, insist that everyone address him as “President Dewey,” and eventually set up a some kind of fascist shadow government for his drooling white nationalist followers? MALONEY: That doesn’t sound like the Republican Party I know. Did you miss the part where Strom Thurmond was in the race? Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Watch protester grab mic from Kamala Harris’ hand during forum.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/watch-protester-grab-microphone-kamala-harris-moveon.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel A protester jumped on stage during an event in San Francisco on Saturday and grabbed the microphone right out of Sen. Kamala Harris’ hands. As if on cue, the male protester jumped onto a stage where three women were talking and wanted to make sure his idea was heard above and beyond anybody else’s right as the senator was answering a question about the gender pay gap . The protester, identified as Aidan Cook, only said that he wanted to turn attention to a “much bigger idea” before he was dragged off the stage from MoveOn’s Big Ideas Forum. Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, was one of several people who helped get the protester off the stage. An obviously freaked out Harris then returned to the stage and continued answering questions. “I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good,” she told the audience that was chanting her name. Direct Action Everywhere, an animal rights organization, said Cook was a member of the group and wanted to ask Harris “to support ordinary citizens rescuing animals rather than the factory farms that abuse animals.” Speaking to reporters after the incident, Cook said that “there’s one big idea that all of the 2020 presidential candidates are ignoring.” When asked by a reporter whether he had considered how it would look for him to take away a microphone from a woman of color, Cook said he did. “I did,” he said . “I tried to show my profound respect for each of the people onstage.” I asked Aidan Cook, an animal rights activist who jumped onstage to interrupt Kamala Harris, if he had considered the optics of literally taking the microphone away from women of color. “I did,” he said. “I tried to show my profound respect for each of the people onstage.” pic.twitter.com/uyMpV82lVP — Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) June 1, 2019 MoveOn apologized to Harris , expressing “regret that a protestor was able to gain access to the stage at our forum today.” Speaking to CNN after the incident , Sen. Cory Booker, said he found it hard to believe that something like that had taken place. “He crossed a line, this election’s going to go on and I’m really hoping that we see Secret Service and others begin to step in because that really could have been a horrifying moment. Kamala’s like a sister to me, I love her and that makes me very upset,” he said. Thx for all the kind notes. We are good.

At least by the House of Representatives. Before that happens though, Congress must first “effectively educate the public” on why the move would be justified. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union , Clyburn pushed back against claims that he did not support beginning impeachment proceedings against the president. “I have never said he should not be impeached,” Clyburn said. “What I have said time and time again is, Mueller has developed the grounds for impeachment.

Taylor Swift at Wango Tango: The pop star calls for the passage of the Equality Act.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/taylor-swift-wango-tango-equality-act-lamar-alexander-petition.html,"A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on May 31, 2019 at 9:05pm PDT Getting Alexander to come out for a bill that prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity seems like an ambitious goal, but Swift’s arguments are sound, and the open letter isn’t really designed to convince him, even if it’s addressed to him. Her dissection of President Donald Trump’s attempt to have things both ways is particularly on point:
I personally reject the President’s stance that his administration, “supports equal treatment of all,” but that the Equality Act, “in its current form is filled with poison pills that threaten to undermine parental and conscience rights.” No. One cannot take the position that one supports a community, while condemning it in the next breath as going against “conscience” or “parental rights.” That statement implies that there is something morally wrong with being anything other than heterosexual and cisgender, which is an incredibly harmful message to send to a nation full of healthy and loving families with same-sex, nonbinary, or transgender parents, sons or daughters.

As celebrity activism goes, this is better than waving a Palestinian flag around onstage without any context : Swift has chosen a specific act of legislation to throw her support behind and is encouraging her fans to take a specific action to help advance it. The Equality Act has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 20, although its prospects in a majority-Republican senate are dim . (Weirdly, it’s Swift’s other senator, Marsha Blackburn, who sits on the committee, but perhaps Swift’s endorsement of Blackburn’s opponent made Alexander a more likely prospect.) It seems unlikely that Swift will be able to mobilize enough fans to get the bill out of committee, much less get it passed by the Senate and signed by Donald Trump. Still, asking your senator to do the right thing and then watching in horror as they do something awful instead is the quintessential American experience, so kudos to Swift for giving her fans a civics lesson, regardless of the outcome. Swift’s performance at Wango Tango—properly known as “iHeartRadio Wango Tango presented by The JUVÉDERM® Collection of Dermal Fillers at Dignity Health Sports Park,” per Getty Images—was livestreamed on LiveXLive .

Jared Kushner's Axios Interview: Clown show.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/jared-kushner-axios-hbo-jonathan-swan-interview-worst-exchanges.html,"Head clown. HBO The second season of Axios premiered on HBO Sunday night, and it kicked off with an interview with Senior Advisor to the President of the United States Jared Kushner. It was, to borrow a phrase from a senior advisor to the president of the United States, “a clown show.” Axios reporter Jonathan Swan pushed back at some of Kushner’s more ridiculous statements, and in response, Kushner fell flat on his face so quickly he appeared to be suffering from some sort of localized anomaly in Earth’s gravitational field. It turns out that the president’s son-in-law has been reticent with the press for reasons that become painfully clear as the interview progresses: He doesn’t know anything, and he believes even less. Here are three of his most spectacular face-plants. On Abortion Kushner first ran into trouble when Swan pushed him on Donald Trump’s extremely late-in-life conversion to the anti-abortion movement. To naïve observers, it might seem like political operatives should work to achieve political goals they believe in, but as Kushner explained, there’s nothing unseemly about “enforcing” policies that hurt other people, even if you don’t support those policies yourself:
Kushner: I think [Trump] respects people who are willing to be honest with him. When I do disagree, you’ll never read about it in the press, and I wouldn’t say it publicly. But I will say there’s a lot more things I agree with him on than disagree.
Swan: So you agree with him on economics, on foreign policy. Where do you stand on abortion?
Kushner: Again, I was not the person who was elected.
Swan: So you agree with the president’s position?
Kushner: I’m here to enforce his positions. His position is the one that as a staffer in the White House, we’ll work to push. So if you don’t like Jared Kushner’s current work “enforcing” his father-in-law’s anti-abortion positions, don’t hold it against Jared Kushner—he doesn’t really believe in any of it. Maybe he can work for a pro-choice administration next and undo some of the damage! On Whether or Not Palestinians Can Govern Themselves Kushner’s next gaffe comes from a tactic more interviewers should employ when dealing with the Trump administration: asking an open-ended question that allows the interviewee to ramble on until they reveal how far out of their depth they are. In this case, Swan asks if Palestinians are “capable of governing themselves.” Let’s see if Kushner spots the racism inherent in treating that like an open question, or if he tries to bullshit his way through by giving what he thinks sounds like a judicious answer:
Swan: Do you believe that the Palestinians are capable of governing themselves without Israeli interference?
Kushner: I think that’s a very good question. I think that that’s one that we’ll have to see. The hope is is that they, over time, can become capable of governing …
Swan: They being the Palestinians.
Kushner: The Palestinians. I think there are some things that the current Palestinian government has done well, and there are some things that are lacking. And I do think that in order for the area to be investable, for investors to come in and want to invest in different industries and infrastructure and create jobs, you do need to have a fair judicial system, freedom of press, freedom of expression, tolerance for all religions, and so …
Swan: Can they have freedom from any Israeli government or military interference?
Kushner: I think that it’s a high bar. Well, that didn’t go well. Kushner is not willing to talk about the specifics of his long-promised plan for the Middle East, but if the goal is to make the area “investable” while we all wait around until Jared Kushner decides that the Palestinians can be treated like adults, that doesn’t sound like great news for the Palestinians. It’s also a pleasure to watch Kushner scurry off into vague poll-tested phrases whenever he’s asked about something concrete, like his half-remembered salute to the Four Freedoms above. There’s also this exchange, in which Kushner makes the claim that the Palestinians are too focused on bread-and-butter issues to worry about anything as abstract as sovereignty; he could have a bright future running messaging for the Democratic Party .
Swan: Do you believe the Palestinian people deserve their own independent sovereign state with a capital in East Jerusalem?
Kushner: There’s a difference between the technocrats, and there’s a difference between the people. The technocrats are focused on very technocratic things, and when I speak to Palestinian people, what they want is they want the opportunity to live a better life. They want the opportunity to pay their mortgage, to have …
Swan: You don’t think they want their own state, free from Israeli government and military?
Kushner: I think that they want an opportunity. Damn those technocrats, always focusing on the wrong things! On Whether or Not Donald Trump Has Ever Done Anything Racist This is probably the most telling exchange in the interview, and it’s worth savoring how beautifully Swan crafts its one-two punch. First he lets Kushner ramble on and on about how much Donald Trump isn’t a racist. Then he asks him about specific racist actions Trump has taken recently, leaving Kushner to explain how Trump’s birtherism and promise of a ban on Muslim immigration were not, in fact, racist or bigoted. (He doesn’t even get into the Central Park Five.) You can see Kushner trying to pull off the traditional Republican move of pondering whether or not Trump is “a racist” while Swan keeps refocusing on Trump’s racist actions rather than the contents of his heart.
Swan: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she calls, she has called President Trump a racist. Have you ever seen him say or do anything that you would describe as racist or bigoted?
Kushner: So the answer is no. Absolutely not. You can’t not be a racist for 69 years and then run for president and be a racist. What I’ll say is that when a lot of the Democrats call the president a racist, I think they’re doing a disservice to people who suffer because of real racism in this country.
Swan: Was birtherism racist?
Kushner: Um, look, I wasn’t really involved in that.
Swan: I know you weren’t! Was it racist?
Kushner: Like I said, I wasn’t involved in that.
Swan: I know you weren’t! Was it racist?
Kushner: Um, look, I know who the president is, and I have not seen anything in him that is racist. So, again, I was not involved in that.
Swan: Did you wish he didn’t do that?
Kushner: Like I said, I was not involved in that. That was a long time ago.
Swan: The other issue that often gets brought up in this conversation is that he campaigned on banning Muslims. Would you describe that as religiously bigoted?
Kushner: Look, I think that the president did his campaign the way he did his campaign, and I think …
Swan: He did! But do you wish he didn’t? Do you wish he didn’t make that speech?
Kushner: Uh, I think he’s here today, and I think he’s doing a lot of great things for the country, and that’s what I’m proud of. “I think that the president did his campaign the way he did his campaign” is an amazing statement from a man who claimed only seconds earlier to have never seen Donald Trump do anything racist. Kushner is perfectly fine with allying with white supremacists for tactical reasons and seems annoyed that anyone would ask him if Trump was being sincere about it. Kushner’s answer seems to be, essentially, that of course Donald Trump’s belief in white supremacy isn’t sincere, which is why it is OK to work for him. (Similarly, Kushner resents that people might assume he is personally anti-abortion simply because he is helping a president with the stated goal of overturning Roe v. Wade ; he’s a pure mercenary.) But no one would care what Donald Trump believed if he were a brain in a jar; it’s what he does that people object to. And as ridiculous as Kushner’s Axios interview was, it’s what Jared Kushner has done that matters, not anything he said in this embarrassing television appearance. Still, it’s hard to say whether or not talking to Axios will help or hurt Kushner in the long run. On the one hand, he revealed himself and the administration that hired him to be even more dangerously unqualified than the nation had previously imagined. On the other hand, he’s going to be squirming and dissembling his way through awkward explanations of his time working for the Trump administration for the rest of his life. It can’t hurt to get a little practice in. Get Slate in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again. Email address: Send me updates about Slate special offers.

"Trump calls London Mayor Sadiq Khan a ""stone cold loser"" in a tweet.",slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-london-mayor-sadiq-khan-stone-cold-loser.html,"The Trump Administration Wanted to Bring Iran to Its Knees. But Trump Is the One Who’s Caving. Before arriving in London on Monday, President Donald Trump fired off a tweet mocking the city’s Mayor Sadiq Khan as a “stone cold loser” who reminded him “very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC,” kicking off what was meant to be a polite visit by once again inserting himself into British politics in a violation of diplomatic norms. It was only the latest incident for Trump, who over the weekend appeared to be on a British newsmaking tear. On Friday, he endorsed the conservative former London Mayor Boris Johnson to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May, who is stepping down Friday. And on Sunday, Trump denied (“Made up by the Fake News Media,” he tweeted) ever calling Meghan Markle “nasty,” even though the British tabloid the Sun released an audio recording of the president saying, “I didn’t know she was nasty” in response to criticism from the Duchess of Sussex. (Markle called Trump “misogynistic” and “divisive” during the 2016 campaign, before she married Prince Harry.) In recent interviews with British newspapers, Trump also criticized May and her approach to Brexit and suggested Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage should lead the country’s negotiations with the E.U. Trump’s attack on Khan came in response to the London mayor’s opinion piece in the Observer on Sunday. In it, Khan protested Trump’s state visit and compared him to other right-wing leaders across the world, insisting Trump used the language of the “fascists of the 20th century.” Khan called it “un-British to be rolling out the red carpet” for “a president whose divisive behaviour flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon—equality, liberty and religious freedom.” The president responded with a tweet early Monday that included a dig at Khan’s height:
. @SadiqKhan , who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me… Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! Trump’s trip was designed as an unremarkable and polite one—his itinerary includes “lunch with Queen Elizabeth, tea with heir Prince Charles, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and a tour of Westminster Abbey”—but he is expected to be met by thousands of protesters in London, led by groups with names like Stand Up to Trump and Together Against Trump. Khan has been a semifrequent critic of Trump, beginning when Trump, as a candidate, proposed a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S. Once Khan, a Muslim and the son of a Pakistani immigrant bus driver, won the election, Trump said Khan’s election was a “good thing” and suggested the new London mayor would be exempted from the proposed travel ban. Khan then called Trump’s views on Muslims “ ignorant ,” and Trump responded by promising he would “remember” the mayor’s “very nasty statements” and challenged Khan to an IQ test. A year later, another tweet by Trump confirmed Khan as one of the president’s permanent targets when Trump misrepresented a statement Khan made to Londoners after terror attacks in the city. Khan had told the public not to be alarmed by increased police presence. “At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is ‘no reason to be alarmed!’ ” Trump tweeted . Khan brushed off the attack, but two days later, he called on the U.K. government to cancel Trump’s upcoming state visit to the country, citing his “policies [that] go against everything we stand for.”"
The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,slate.com,Richard L. Revesz,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"The World’s Measurement System Changed and You Weren’t Supposed to Notice The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success — more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well. The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems . In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis : It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses. Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise. One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits . But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.” The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ” Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so. A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help. Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm. The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts. During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."
John Oliver explains medical devices' FDA loopholes on Last Week Tonight (VIDEO).,slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/john-oliver-medical-devices-fda-jane-krakowski.html,"Comment Though it’s not often a late-night segment requires a safe word, John Oliver warned viewers that Last Week Tonight ’s latest on medical devices is grisly enough to warrant one. Still, if you could stomach the show’s guts-deep investigation into autopsies two weeks ago, you’ll probably be fine, and Oliver’s cries of “Opossum” will give you plenty of warning when things are about to get icky. Grosser than the detailed descriptions of malfunctioning hip replacements and vaginal mesh are the FDA loopholes that allow faulty medical implants to go to market. Watch as Oliver explains the difference between “FDA-cleared” and “FDA-approved” and demonstrates how participants in clinical studies are manipulated into giving positive answers on surveys.

2020 Democratic candidates don’t want to talk about using paid child care and nannies.,slate.com,Rebecca Onion,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/2020-democratic-candidates-paid-child-care-nanny.html,"How the British Tabloids Are Covering the Royal Baby in the Absence of Pretty Much Any Real Information In a piece published late last month, Vox’s Anna North asked the male 2020 Democratic candidates who have young children to answer a question: Who is taking care of your kids while you run for president? Rep. Eric Swalwell, who has two children younger than 3, answered that his wife, who is “a national sales director for Ritz-Carlton,” is lucky enough to have “a career that allows her to work from home most of the time, but it’s still a herculean task to work with two young kids around.” An aunt “lends us a hand at times,” and they “sometimes” do friend swaps for babysitting. The campaign of Rep. Seth Moulton, whose daughter is 7 months old, referred North to an interview in which Moulton said, in response to a query about “juggling” an infant and a presidential campaign: “I miss my daughter every single day. It was a hard decision to get into this race. But I want my daughter to grow up in a better world.” Which was not really an answer. And Beto O’Rourke, whose kids are 8, 10, and 12, sent this message via his spokesman Chris Evans: Beto “has acknowledged that when he’s on the road, [his wife] Amy has the lion’s share of the child-care responsibilities while also working in El Paso. Additionally, Beto and Amy are fortunate to have several family members in the community who are able to give support and help out.” Notice anything missing? I suppose it’s possible that the only other people helping out, say, Amy O’Rourke, whose family is quite wealthy, are her relatives, but it seems doubtful that there’s not a single housekeeper, driver, nanny, or au pair involved with their day-to-day pickups and drop-offs. Overall, the cautious answers of the candidates, which emphasized the help of family members and friends, suggests that although child care is now a campaign issue— thanks, mostly, to Elizabeth Warren —some Democrats are still a bit uncomfortable talking about their own experiences using paid child care in raising their families. So I decided to ask them about it. I reached out to the campaigns of all the Democratic candidates with kids, including those whose children are now grown, with one direct question: “What kind of paid child care has the candidate’s family used, if any—and how often?” Only six campaigns replied to repeated inquiries with a willingness to go on the record. Here’s what I got, starting with the candidates mentioned above. We will update this post with more answers, if we get them. Candidate: Beto O’Rourke Kids: Three, ages 8, 10, and 12 Experience with paid child care: When I asked the O’Rourke campaign if the O’Rourkes use any paid child care, the campaign replied: “Unfortunately, I don’t think we’re going to have anything for you.” Candidate: Eric Swalwell Kids: Two, younger than 1 and age 2 Experience with paid child care: The Swalwell campaign did not respond. Candidate: Seth Moulton Kids: One, younger than 1 Experience with paid child care: “Liz and Seth both work full-time and travel for their jobs. They have a paid caregiver and both of their parents help babysit as well. Seth recognizes that not everyone is in a position where they have access to a support system like this, which is why he is a champion of paid family leave and wants to expand the child care tax credit as well as the child tax credit and making them fully refundable.” Candidate: Elizabeth Warren Kids: Two, ages 43 and 47 Experience with paid child care: Warren’s campaign sent us several links to speeches and stories containing Warren’s history with day cares and sitters she used to care for her children when they were young. Candidate: Michael Bennet Kids: Three, One in college, one in high school, one in middle school Experience with paid child care: The campaign would not speak on the record. Candidate: Joe Biden Kids: Four, two surviving, ages 37 and 49 Experience with paid child care: The Biden campaign did not respond. Candidate: Steve Bullock Kids: Three, ages 12, 14, and 17 Experience with paid child care: “With relatively young kids at home, my wife Lisa and I have lived the experience of families all across the country. When our kids were younger and with both of us in the workforce, we paid dearly for quality childcare. We know firsthand that a quality day care program can cost more than college tuition. During the elementary years, we relied on after school programs offered by our local school district. And, even now, it is a daily effort to shuttle kids between activities and after school activities. Lisa and I are lucky to be raising our kids in our hometown, surrounded by close friends and family that have been there for us from the beginning.” Candidate: Julián Castro Kids: Two, ages 4 and 9 Experience with paid child care: The Castro campaign did not respond. Candidate: Bill de Blasio Kids: Two, ages 21 and 24 Experience with paid child care: The de Blasio campaign did not respond. Candidate: John Delaney Kids: Four, ages 10, 17, 20, and 24 Experience with paid child care: The Delaney campaign did not respond. Candidate: Kirsten Gillibrand Kids: Two, ages 11 and 16 Experience with paid child care: An aide to Gillibrand said the senator has relied on a combination of day care and after-school programs while raising her sons. Candidate: Mike Gravel Experience with paid child care: The Gravel campaign did not respond. Candidate: Kamala Harris Kids: Two stepchildren, 19 and 24 Experience with paid child care: The Harris campaign did not respond. Candidate: John Hickenlooper Experience with paid child care: The Hickenlooper campaign did not respond. Candidate: Amy Klobuchar Experience with paid child care: The Klobuchar campaign did not respond. Candidate: Wayne Messam Experience with paid child care: The Messam campaign did not respond. Candidate: Tim Ryan Kids: Three, including two stepchildren, ages 4, 15, and 16 Experience with paid child care: The Ryan campaign did not respond. Candidate: Bernie Sanders Kids: Four, including three stepchildren, 40s and 50s Experience with paid child care: The Sanders campaign did not respond. Candidate: Marianne Williamson Kids: One, age 29 Experience with paid child care: “When my daughter was young, I had continuous professional assistance from nannies and babysitters as I traveled for my work. The experience deepened my understanding of the needs of the working mother, and my commitment to the struggle for every woman to be able to actualize her dreams both professionally and maternally without sacrificing either.” Candidate: Andrew Yang Kids: Two, ages unclear Experience with paid child care: “While I am on the campaign trail, my wife Evelyn watches after our two young children, one of whom is autistic, at home full time. We have help from my mother and mother-in-law as well as various sitters and other family members. Occasionally, my family is able to join me on the campaign trail which is always welcome and makes campaigning more enjoyable, but Evelyn really is the rock of our family and without her, everything would fall apart. We must do more to support and recognize the work being done in our homes and communities each day. My wife inspires me to work harder both at home and on the trail.”"
"Pompeo says Trump open to talks with Iran, in shift from “maximum pressure” policy.",slate.com,Fred Kaplan,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-pompeo-iran-negotiations-pressure.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pulled a head-spinning switcheroo over the weekend, telling reporters that the Trump administration is ready to hold talks with Iran with “no preconditions.” On the one hand, this is a welcome development. Until now, Pompeo has insisted on 12 steps Iranian leaders must take—all of them requiring sharp shifts in policy, some a surrender of sovereignty—before the United States would sit down with them at the same table. The clear message was that Pompeo wasn’t interested in talks. On the other hand, this new pivot marks another sign that President Donald Trump and Pompeo are terrible negotiators and that, when it comes to foreign policy, the United States under their helm is a ship adrift in a stormy sea. A little over a year ago, Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal —which President Barack Obama and the leaders of five other nations had negotiated with Iran three years earlier—and reimposed economic sanctions that had been lifted as part of the deal. He then threatened to sanction other countries—including those that had signed the nuclear deal—if they continued doing business with Iran. He called the policy “maximum pressure.” The policy’s aim was unclear: Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton said they wanted to make the Iranians scream until their regime collapsed; Trump claimed he merely wanted them to come back to the table and negotiate a “better” deal. Either way, Pompeo’s new statement scuttles whatever chances the pressure campaign had of working. Not that the chances were great to begin with. Iran’s economy is feeling a squeeze . But foreign interference only strengthens domestic support for the regime—and if the regime did collapse, it would likely be replaced not by western-leaning liberals (who don’t form an organized party) but by the most hard-line factions or the military. This new pivot marks another sign that Trump and Pompeo are terrible negotiators. “Maximum pressure” didn’t work so well in Trump’s approach to North Korea, either. It may have helped bring Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table, but once there, Kim gave up nothing. Trump was the one who wound up star-struck, and Kim’s scientists have continued enriching uranium and building missiles unabated. But let’s say maximum pressure could yield results in some country, under some scenario; it might yet have had an effect—though not necessarily a desirable one—in Iran. This is now no longer the case. Pompeo’s shift unmasks maximum pressure as a tentative bluff. Targets of Trump’s belligerent rhetoric, from now on, can sit back and wait until his impatience for results intensifies and he slackens his demands. In the case of Iran, the slackening began in mid-May, when Trump seemed suddenly to realize that the path he’d undertaken might lead to war, especially with Bolton—a longtime advocate of forcible regime change—in the driver’s seat. Trump told reporters he wanted the Iranian leaders to call him; he even gave Swiss officials—who had served as an intermediary between Washington and Tehran back when the two capitals had no direct contact—a phone number where he could be reached. Pompeo, who has spent the past two years—first as CIA director, now as the top diplomat—amassing power by parroting the master in the White House, had issued his 12 preconditions a year ago, when he thought (quite reasonably) that Trump wanted regime change, not talks. Now Trump has said he wants talks, and Pompeo has changed his patter. The new position is the correct one; there is no reason why the United States shouldn’t resume talks, without preconditions, especially since Iran has continued abiding by the terms of the nuclear deal. But by shifting positions so drastically, Pompeo has diminished the credibility of whatever position he and Trump adopt next—and wiped out whatever leverage they might have had in advancing it. All this might be the stuff of tactical missteps, as distinct from strategic blunders, if the Trump administration had a position—a set of long-term policies and goals—toward Iran to begin with. But it doesn’t. In this sense, there is no such thing as “the Trump administration.” In every presidency before this one, the top officials or their deputies assembled in National Security Council meetings to hammer out differences and devise a common policy. Under Trump, there are no (or very few) NSC meetings. There are only the scattered Cabinet secretaries and advisers, trying to make their disparate agendas align with the broad direction that the president seems to be taking—and there are Trump’s eruptive tweets, which can spin the compass and upset those agendas on a moment’s notice. Even this rampant randomness might be a bit more manageable if the president didn’t so often act like—let’s not mince words here—a raving lunatic. Take his tweet early Monday morning, tapped out as Air Force One was about to land in London for a state visit with the royal family: . @SadiqKhan , who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019 Trump then added: ....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2019 Whatever London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s sins (and they consist mainly of not caring much for Trump), what kind of state leader says such things, publicly, minutes before touching down on the mayor’s city and meeting with the mayor’s queen? This reveals, more clearly than any official statement he might recite, how little Trump values—or understands—diplomacy. Support our journalism

So she decided to ask all the parents running in the primary about their experience with paid child care. Turns out, not a lot of them want to talk about it .

Apple TV+ begins countdown to blastoff with For All Mankind trailer (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/for-all-mankind-apple-tv-countdown.html,"James Holzhauer Has Changed Jeopardy! for Good T minus four( ish? ) months before the launch of Apple’s forthcoming streaming service TV+, the tech giant would like everyone to know that it is officially time to start the countdown. After many moons, Apple has finally released an actual trailer, full of actual footage, of one of its actual series: veteran showrunner Ronald D. Moore’s space drama For All Mankind , the title of which, we presume, just so happens to double as the service’s target audience. Premiering this fall, For All Mankind imagines a world in which Russia beat the U.S. to the moon landing, prolonging the global space race. And by the looks of the trailer, it’s just the sort of in-your-face prestige content we’d expect from Apple: ambitious in scope and story, stamped with a first-rate industry name, and visually spectacular to boot. The series is just one on a long list of projects that Apple has announced for its new platform, which also includes original programming from the likes of Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, and Oprah Winfrey. Sounds like a blast—but because the service has been annoyingly reticent to share details, we’ll have to wait for its sometime-this-fall debut to see for sure.

The Green Party’s gains in EU Parliament were driven by fear of climate change and the far right.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/european-parliament-elections-green-party-climate-change-far-right.html,"On-Duty Officer Who “Did Absolutely Nothing” to Stop Parkland School Shooting Charged With 11 Felony Counts Compared with the coming environmental shocks likely to be caused by climate change, a shift in the composition of the European Parliament may seem less than urgent. But last week’s election results suggest a quiet yet possibly monumental political transformation. For all the attention focused on the rise of far-right parties in European politics, observers have been slower to pick up on what may be an equally consequential trend: the rise of the Greens. These parties are not only posing a challenge to Europe’s established political parties—they may also represent an answer to the populist threat that has plagued the continents’ political institutions. The Greens picked up 10 seats in Germany, coming in second, behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union and beating the center-left Social Democratic Party. In France, the Greens picked up seven seats to come in third, ahead of the traditional center-right and center-left parties. In Britain, they beat Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservatives and came in just behind Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. In Ireland, they came in third, ahead of Sinn Fein. Continentwide, where parties sit in cross-national alliances with their ideological counterparts, the European Greens picked up 17 seats, becoming the fourth-largest bloc in the Parliament for the first time. This will make them potential kingmakers in the forthcoming horse-trading over the EU’s most powerful jobs and bolster their policy goals of ambitious emissions-reduction targets, support for continued EU integration, and a more liberal and humane refugee policy. The simplest explanation for the Greens’ success is widespread anxiety over the state of the planet. The months leading up to the election saw the release of two devastatingly grim U.N. reports— October’s warning about the urgent and immediate steps that will be required to prevent 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, and May’s biodiversity report warning that 1 million species are at risk of extinction—as well as widespread public protests in several countries, the emergence of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg as a galvanizing protest leader, and the spread of school strikes demanding action on the climate crisis. The Greens benefited from a political environment where traditional party loyalties are breaking down throughout Europe and the electorate is highly polarized. “The climate worry became extremely widespread. There is a sense of urgency in the public. This worry was able to be channeled in the Green Party,” says Monica Frassoni, co-chair of the European Green Party. But as grave as the situation is, climate change isn’t the whole story. “There was also a sense that the two main parties just weren’t giving answers anymore, and that that wasn’t where the European future was going to lie,” says Sophia Besch, a fellow at the Centre for European Reform, referring to the center-right and center-left parties that have traditionally dominated postwar European politics at the national and pan-European level. At a time when a surge of populism is threatening the very foundations of the European project, the Greens may have benefited from their staunch and unambiguous support for more European integration. Frassoni sees the Greens’ rise as connected to “certain terrible evolutions in some countries, and the victory of extreme right in some countries, which are due to the fact that the European Union made wrong decisions in terms of austerity and was not rigorous in terms of defense of rights and the rule of law.” Sven Giegold, a newly reelected German Green MEP, agrees. “The coalition partners that were traditionally the guardians of a stronger Europe have lost courage to the extreme right,” he says. “People are not reassured that the parties that originally were the fathers and mothers of Europe are still committed enough to Europe.” Nowhere was this more true than in the Brexit-wracked United Kingdom, where the staunchly pro-Remain Greens capitalized on public frustration with the Labour Party’s ambiguous Brexit stance as well as momentum from London’s recent Extinction Rebellion protests to take 11.8 percent of the vote. EU elections tend to be more favorable for smaller British parties like the Greens, thanks to lower voter turnout and results based on proportional representation. But the Greens also performed well in recent local elections in the U.K., picking up 87 seats and suggesting they can compete in a first-past-the-post vote. “There is a lot of disillusionment with Labour not having a clear position on remaining in Europe, but also recognizing the climate emergency,” says Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales. “Particularly among the 18–25 age group, the school strikes and Extinction Rebellion has pushed climate right up the agenda among young people.” As in the U.K., the Greens’ gains in most countries came at the expense of the traditional center-left, social democratic parties. “There is a sense all over Europe of social democrats being seen as no longer having the answers, of no longer being able to stand up to the right, and in this election of not being able to pick up on the environmental concerns that many voters brought to the polling stations,” says Besch. But Bartley insists this isn’t just a story about the left. “People will tend to place the Green Party on the left because of our emphasis on redistributing wealth away from the 1 percent,” he says. “But we had a lot of people coming over from the Conservatives as well as Labour. Increasingly, those terms— left and right —refer to a system that just isn’t working any longer. The old dichotomy is breaking down.” The Greens weren’t the only parties to benefit from this breakdown. The blocs representing liberal parties—in the centrist, free market European sense—and right-wing euroskeptic nationalists also picked up seats in the European Parliament last week. The Greens’ rise has come at the same time that some far-right populist parties are embracing an agenda of opposition to action on the environment. The far-right True Finns party came in second in Finnish national elections in April on a platform of opposing “climate hysteria.” The politically amorphous Yellow Vest (Gilets Jaunes) movement shut down parts of Paris in mass demonstrations last year, partly in response to fuel taxes instituted by President Emmanuel Macron’s government. But there are also some indications that Green politics can be an effective way to combat the far right. Bartley notes that Magid Magid, the Somali-born mayor of Sheffield , won the EU Parliament race on the Green ticket in Yorkshire and the Humber, a region that in 2009 went for a candidate from the neo-fascist British National Party. Giegold argues that climate concerns are peeling votes away from the far-right Alternative for Germany party. “The AfD scored much worse than they thought, in particular among young people who are really shaped by the climate protest,” he said. “Two years ago, they had a lot of success, particularly among young men. Now we destroyed them, basically.” Indeed, the youth wing of the AfD last week called on the national party to rethink its climate skepticism and defense of the coal industry, for fear of losing the youth vote going forward. France’s far-right National Rally, perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, adopted a “localist” pro-environment message in its platform this year. The Greens benefited from a political environment where traditional party loyalties are breaking down throughout Europe and the electorate is highly polarized. But this environment also means that political gains can be short-lived. “People were already starting to flirt with us. Now they have had a one-night stand. Whether this is a permanent relationship is totally unclear,” says Giegold. To take the analogy further, for German voters, the Greens are less of an attractive stranger they picked up one night than they are an old fling. The party, formally known as Alliance 90/The Greens has had success in national elections in Germany before. Joschka Fischer, who served as Germany’s vice chancellor and foreign minister from 1998–2005, was a Green. It’s certainly not out of the question that current momentum for the Greens could also be short-lived. “I do think there is a broader momentum among younger voters. I’d be surprised if these voters who went out on the streets [for climate change] forgot about this quickly,” says Besch. “But obviously the hope of the more-established parties is that they will be able to green-wash their own policies and make themselves more credible in having the answers on climate change.” To some extent, this is already happening. After months of resistance, Merkel last month joined with France and seven other countries to call on the EU to bring carbon emissions down to zero by 2050. Merkel cited Greta Thunberg’s protests in making her announcement, but she clearly was also trying to head off gains by the Greens and differentiate herself from the climate-denying AfD. There’s a risk that in co-opting the Greens’ signature priorities, the major parties could water them down, something the world can ill-afford when it comes to climate change. But for now, the Greens appear to be outpacing the center-right and center-left when it comes to both responding to the most serious crisis of our era and responding to the challenge of the far right."

He confirmed reports from late last week that set off a wave of eulogies for one of the 2000s’ most transformative platforms. When users update their operating systems to MacOS Catalina, which will be released this fall, the stand-alone iTunes app will be no more. After jokingly announcing that iTunes would include a calendar function to acknowledge how bloated the platform has become, Federighi said, “The future … of iTunes is not one app, but three: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.” Users who have spent the better part of two decades curating iTunes playlists with songs not available on Spotify have little to fear. According to a company spokesperson, when you update to MacOS Catalina, your iTunes songs and playlists will automatically transfer to Apple Music, your podcasts to Apple Podcasts, and your videos to Apple TV. Although iTunes will no longer exist as a centralized platform for storing different mediums of entertainment, it seems like its absence won’t be too noticeable in macOS Catalina. Leaked images of Apple Music that 9to5Mac published last week look almost identical to the current iTunes interface."
Steve King: House Republicans reportedly trying to get Iowa representative back on committees.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/steve-king-house-republicans-committee-assignments.html,"On-Duty Officer Who “Did Absolutely Nothing” to Stop Parkland School Shooting Charged With 11 Felony Counts Rep. Steve King is campaigning to have his committee assignments reinstated after losing them five months ago over comments in support of white supremacy and white nationalism, and he has the support of a small group of House Republicans gathering signatures on his behalf, Politico reported Monday. According to Politico, hard-line conservatives led by Rep. Ralph Norman are working to put forward a draft petition that would force their party to consider reinstating King, who was in January taken off the House Judiciary Committee and the House Agriculture Committee. The group needs the signatures of 25 lawmakers to raise the cause with the Republican Steering Committee, and according to Politico, it is unlikely to get them. King has not tempered his rhetoric since being so widely and publicly condemned by his own party. Last week, he said at a town hall that “presum[ing] that every culture is equal…. devalu[es] the contributions of the…founding fathers.” He insisted, as he had before, that his comments were not racist because they were “about culture,” not race. The list of his past offensive comments and actions is long , and it includes joking about people in more conservative states killing those in more liberal states in a civil war; calling white people the “subgroup of people” who have contributed the most to the world; tweeting that “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies ;” blaming immigrants for ISIS and Ebola ; and blaming abortion for killing “millions” of white babies . He finally appeared to have crossed a line in January, when he explicitly defended white supremacy and white nationalism in an interview with the New York Times. “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?” King said. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?” Four days after the interview ran, Republicans stripped King of his committee assignments in a public rebuke that could endanger his next bid for reelection. It appears King has felt only defiance and resentment since the incident, having repeatedly insisted that his words were misinterpreted. In February, King published a list on Twitter of 200 “pro-family leaders” signing on to a letter asking House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to “do the right thing” by apologizing to King and reinstating his committees. Last week, according to the Des Moines Register , he announced he was making progress in his drive to win back his committee seats from the “political lynch mob.” He added: “I’ve been Mr. Nice Guy about this all along and let the cooler heads take over, and now … pretty soon I’m going to start pushing.”"
James Holzhauer’s Jeopardy! legacy.,slate.com,Jeremy Samuel Faust,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-ken-jennings-defeat.html,"“Down goes Frazier!” “Do you believe in miracles?” You can now add “What a game! Oh my gosh!” to that list of famous upset calls. That’s how Alex Trebek reacted on Monday’s historic episode of Jeopardy! After a 32-day winning streak, Jeopardy! champion James Holzhauer has finally been defeated. During his run, the second longest in the show’s 35-year history, he has captivated audiences. His fund of knowledge: prodigious. His Daily Double wagers: immense and touchingly personal, choosing birth dates, anniversaries, and references to #VegasStrong. He racked up the top 11 single-day scores ever. His average winning score of $76,944 was not only more than double that of any players’ prior average—including those notched by Ken Jennings, whose longevity Holzhauer ultimately could not match—it is a mere $64 shy of the previous single-day record . OK, we get it. This guy can play Jeopardy ! Enter Emma Boettcher, the librarian dragon slayer who took Holzhauer down. Boettcher follows in the footsteps of lumberjacks Nancy Zerg, Brian Loughnane, and Victoria Groce, who felled Ken Jennings (74 wins), Julia Collins (20 wins), and Dave Madden (19 wins), respectively. But their triumphs turned out to be short-lived. Each of those giant killers turned out to be flash-in-the-pan champions, winning a grand total of zero games after their triumphant upset wins over these august Jeopardy! legends. “It’s no coincidence,” Ken Jennings told me Monday. “The reason why the ‘giant killers’ always lose their second game is that everything seems anticlimactic after that big, unexpected win. And, maybe even more importantly, there’s a whirlwind of distracting activity on set after the epochal loss.” Usually, five matches are filmed back to back in approximately real time. But in rare cases, an epic upset for example, the usual flow can be interrupted, which can prove distracting. “On the day I lost, Nancy Zerg got whisked away to do a bunch of promotional material during an early lunch, and then had to go back on set and try to play the game again,” Jennings added, in her defense.

However, there is reason for optimism; we know that Emma Boettcher is not a casual Jeopardy! viewer. Her master’s thesis literally focused on whether a computer could text-mine Jeopardy! clues in an effort to predict their difficulty ( apparently not that well , but three cheers for trying). Anyone who has put that much thought into this game prior to playing it stands a better chance than your average trivia buff. Nor is this the last we will hear from Holzhauer, as he is the heavy favorite to win the 2019 Tournament of Champions, the annual postseason playoffs of Jeopardy! , to be held this fall.Remarkably, and unlike any player in Jeopardy! history, even winning the Tournament of Champions would be an effective pay cut for Holzhauer. During his run, his average daily win was a shade under $77,000. With a purse of $250,000 for the four-game tournament, the payout would average out to a mere $62,500. (Technically, the $250,000 is a minimum guarantee, but winners keep only the amount from the two-game final, and even Holzhauer’s record top two wins would put him only just over $260,000.) Asked whether Jeopardy! might raise the stakes of the tournament in response to his extraordinary daily averages, Holzhauer told me back in May (20 games into his run) via email, “I suspect Jeopardy! does not feel the need to double the guaranteed prize to get eyes on that tournament.” Perhaps more enticing, though, is the thought of a Jennings versus Holzhauer showdown. Both players have indicated that they might be game, but Jeopardy! has always been conceived as a three-player contest. The most likely third challenger would be Brad Rutter, who, despite his 2000 winning streak being capped at five (a rule that was later eliminated), has won the most money of any contestant in the show’s history thanks to a string of special tournaments over the past 19 years. But the player with the best chance of beating Holzhauer is IBM’s Watson, a supercomputer that defeated both Jennings and Rutter in an infamous two-game match (but which, disappointingly, has been unable to cure cancer in its post- Jeopardy! life). And so we turn to the future. Will there be another? How long will Jennings’ record stand? While Holzhauer seemed uniquely equipped to break all of the records, I predict that his style will embolden future players and make Jennings’ streak no longer untouchable. Sometimes this happens in competition. Gunder Hägg’s 4:01 world record for the mile stood for almost a decade before Roger Bannister’s breakthrough “miracle mile” of 3:59 in 1954. In the following four years, three different runners bettered the mark. And while Holzhauer’s daily scores have been gargantuan, he actually did leave some money on the table, often wagering $9,812 (his wedding date) on Daily Doubles late in the game when he actually could have afforded to wager far more and still be guaranteed a victory.* In short, the records are beatable. But it will take a rare blend of skill and the correct frame of mind. So, what should we look for in a player capable of conquering both Jennings’ and Holzhauer’s records? First, someone who works in data and logic-driven fields. Holzhauer is a professional sports gambler. Ken Jennings was a software engineer. Julia Collins was a supply-chain engineer. While Trebek has said that lawyers and teachers do well on the show, the top-shelf champions have come from analytic backgrounds. Second, we should look for someone around Holzhauer’s age, which is 35. Jennings has said that he no longer has the same brain he did during his 2004 run, but being too young can also be a disadvantage. “There’s a sweet spot where someone is old enough to have lived through a few decades of culture, but young enough that their recall and reflexes are still nice and fast,” Jennings said. “And they keep up with pop music. It’s probably around 30 for most people.” If we’ve learned anything from Holzhauer’s appearances, it’s that in order to win big on Jeopardy! today and in the future, a player will have to commit to just not caring if they lose. During his streak, many players already started to adjust their style of play, favoring a more aggressive game and bigger, riskier wagers. In the pre-Holzhauer era, the brightest contestants often played to not lose. Moving forward, I predict that, after 35 years of Jeopardy!, the very best contestants will finally start playing to win.
Correction, June 3, 2019: This piece originally misstated the true significance of Holzhauer’s Daily Doubles wager. The $9,812 amount he bets is meant to represent his wedding date, not his wedding anniversary."

"George Nader, Trump-Russia broker, indicted on child pornography charges.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/george-nader-child-pornography-indictment-trump-russia.html,"On-Duty Officer Who “Did Absolutely Nothing” to Stop Parkland School Shooting Charged With 11 Felony Counts George Nader, the United Arab Emirates lobbyist who set up a much-scrutinized meeting between a Trump administration emissary and an associate of Vladimir Putin’s in early 2017—and who reportedly appeared at the White House “frequently” early in Trump’s tenure to discuss Middle East policy—has been arrested and indicted on previously sealed charges of possessing child pornography , the Justice Department says. An affidavit filed by an FBI agent in April 2018, when Nader was initially charged, says 12 videos “that appear to be visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct” were discovered on an iPhone seized when he was stopped at Dulles airport in Virginia on Jan. 17, 2018 during an unnamed and “unrelated” investigation; previous reporting indicates that Nader was questioned on that day by investigators working for special counsel Robert Mueller. Nader subsequently became a cooperating witness in Mueller’s investigation. The DOJ says he was arrested Monday at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City, whereupon the documents related to his case were unsealed. Nader, an American citizen, was previously convicted of “transporting sexually explicit materials in foreign commerce” in Virginia in 1991 and of sexually abusing minors in the Czech Republic in 2003. Despite this history, he made connections within the Trump campaign and administration in 2016 and 2017 that allowed him to become involved in discussions of policy toward the UAE (with which the U.S. has allied in seeking to marginalize Iran ) and Russia. The New York Times has reported , for instance, that Nader met with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower in New York City in August 2016 to convey that “the princes who led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were eager to help his father win election as president” and pitch a social-media plan involving an Israeli company. (Though Saudi Arabia and the UAE are allies, there does not appear to be evidence that Nader ever worked formally for the Saudi government.) According to Mueller’s special counsel report, Nader later set up a January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles between informal Trump adviser Erik Prince (the founder of Blackwater, who is also Betsy DeVos’ brother) and Kirill Dmitriev, who runs a Russian sovereign wealth fund and meets on a regular basis with Vladimir Putin. (Per the report, Dmitriev and Nader became acquainted through his fund’s work with the UAE; the AP says Nader worked with Prince in Iraq.) The report also says that Nader was involved in discussions about a Russia-U.S. “reconciliation” proposal that Dmitriev created with a U.S. hedge fund director named Rick Gerson, who is a friend of Jared Kushner’s. (Nader’s name appears in the report 138 times.) Finally, the AP and New York Times have reported that Nader worked with Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy to pitch the Trump White House on plans for Saudi Arabian and UAE military cooperation with the United States. Axios has written that Nader “visited the White House frequently during the early months of the Trump administration” and was “friendly with former chief strategist Steve Bannon.” The AP says that Broidy helped arrange for Nader to be photographed with Trump in 2017; you can see the picture of Nader and Trump on the Times’ site . Neither Nader nor any Trump figures have been charged with crimes related to the activities above, though Mueller’s report notes that the special counsel’s office was unable to fully investigate the Seychelles meeting because relevant text messages between Prince and Bannon had been deleted; House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has also referred Prince’s House testimony on the matter to the Department of Justice for potential perjury charges. Though it was reportedly a subject of Mueller’s investigation, Nader’s meeting with Trump Jr. is not addressed in the special counsel’s report."
Apple WWDC: “Sign in with Apple” button shows how Apple is now a tech regulator.,slate.com,April Glaser,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/apple-wwdc-sign-in-facebook-google.html,"Bees Built a Nest Entirely Out of Plastic To use the internet is to constantly slam into locked doors. Want to watch a video? Please sign in. Care to comment? You’ll need to remember your password. Want to keep reading an article? Create an account. Many of us manage these password requests by using our login credentials from Google and Facebook to register with other websites. Clicking on “Sign in with Facebook” and “Sign in with Google” isn’t exactly frictionless, but it’s close. That convenience came with a bargain: Users had to trust Google and Facebook to keep their personal details safe in exchange for the information those companies got to glean about all the websites and services we use. It was good for third-party apps too, which were able to dull their users’ annoyance at creating yet more new accounts by simply porting over their Google or Facebook info. Airbnb, Spotify, Tinder, Venmo—they all allow you to log in with Facebook or Google or both. The problem with this bargain is that when it comes to protecting user privacy, Facebook and Google haven’t always kept up their end of the deal—and they also use all that user information to power targeted-advertising businesses that more and more users find super creepy. Increasingly, those enticing buttons feel less like they’re worth the convenience. If we see more of this trend, privacy will be more like a luxury for some rather than a right for all. Enter Apple. At its annual developer conference on Monday, the company unveiled a new “Sign in with Apple” button for Apple device users to create new logins on websites and apps. It’s the same idea as those Google and Facebook buttons but from a company that’s known to be far more trustworthy with customer data—and that has been emphasizing its privacy bona fides as the other tech companies have come under scrutiny. But Apple isn’t just offering a third option. Users who opt to create new accounts with Apple can also choose to use a randomly generated email address that forwards messages to their actual inbox, preserving customer privacy even further by allowing users to keep their email addresses to themselves without sharing them with another company. It’s a smart innovation, and it’s no surprise that it comes from Apple—a company that went head to head with the FBI when it refused to help unlock the encrypted iPhone used by a shooter in the 2015 San Bernardino attack for fear that doing so would create a dangerous privacy precedent for the rest of its users. If you’ve already paid the big bucks for an iPhone, you should definitely use Apple’s new privacy-enhancing login feature. And if you’re not an Apple customer, well, you can’t. That’s one rub that comes with all of Apple’s privacy enhancements: They do nothing for the majority of internet and smartphone users who don’t buy expensive Apple products. If we see more of this trend—in which the best privacy protections come as bonuses for high-end device owners—privacy will be more like a luxury for some rather than a right for all. That’s because digital privacy in the U.S. is barely regulated. There’s currently no broad federal policy that requires tech companies not to give our personal information to third parties without direct consent. As long as the terms of service we clicked through when signing up say that our data might end up elsewhere, tech companies are largely free to do as they please. Take what’s happening to Facebook after mishandling the millions of users’ data that ended up in the hands of the political-data firm Cambridge Analytica , which improperly scraped the Facebook profiles of not only those who downloaded a personality quiz app but everyone they were friends with too. Facebook faces steep penalties now, but only because it allegedly didn’t follow a rule that was custom-made for Facebook after mishandling user data years earlier. When the company messes up in other ways, like by storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in plain text for years in a format viewable by thousands of employees, Facebook isn’t breaking a law. And when Google allows third-party apps for Gmail to read user emails in ways that aren’t clear to Gmail users, as the Wall Street Journal exposed last year, that’s fine too—again, as long as the small print in its user agreement says that might happen. There’s not even a rule that forces companies to share what they’ve shared about us. It’s hard to know how many third-party apps to which Google has granted permission to read its users’ emails. And once your data is out there, there’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube. It can be copied and shared over and over again. Apple pulling in the reins on what apps can access about users is just the latest example of Apple regulating other companies. Earlier this year, Apple booted Facebook’s developer apps from its app store after Facebook wrongfully allowed non-employees to download a privacy-invasive app that wasn’t supposed to be available to the public. It also helps burnish Apple’s pro-consumer image at a time when the company is beginning to attract scrutiny for some of its practices—particularly whether aspects of its app store are anti-competitive. And it’s not a win for all users. It’s a win for iPhone users and a win for Apple PR—though there’s no guarantee that Apple won’t change its policy in the future. So props to Apple for leading the industry here. But this is a business decision. It might cause some people to switch to an iPhone. It won’t protect those who don’t. "

Federal judge rules Congress cannot sue president over inventive border wall funding.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/federal-judge-rules-congress-cannot-sue-president-over-inventive-border-wall-funding.html,"The Ruling Against a Cop Accused of a Horrific Body Cavity Search Is a Rare Victory for Police Accountability A federal judge ruled Monday that House Democrats cannot sue President Donald Trump over the White House’s use of funds appropriated to the Pentagon to pay for a wall on the Mexican border. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump nominee, did not rule on the merits of the case, instead denying House Democrats’ motion to stay Trump’s wall funding because they lacked standing to sue the executive branch. “While the Constitution bestows upon Members of the House many powers, it does not grant them standing to hale the Executive Branch into court claiming a dilution of Congress’s legislative authority,” McFadden wrote. “The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the House’s claims and will deny its motion.” The suit brought against the Trump White House argued that the White House’s creative maneuvering to fund a border wall amounted to a violation of the appropriations clause of the Constitution, which gives Congress power over federal spending. McFadden refused the request to block border wall funding, but left open the possibility that a claim of presidential overreach could be resolved in the courts. “This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government,” McFadden wrote. “To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers.” “McFadden’s order effectively kills the House suit, which sought to block the administration from tapping not only $1 billion already transferred from military pay and pensions accounts but also money from an emergency military construction fund that the administration said it intends to transfer but has not yet moved,” the Washington Post notes. “McFadden’s decision ran counter to a 2015 ruling that found the then GOP-led House could sue the Obama administration for allegedly spending on an Affordable Care Act program that Congress never approved, a ruling that would have marked the first time the House was able to challenge an administration in court. The case was settled before it withstood appeal.” “Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,” McFadden wrote. “These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration’s planned construction of the border wall.”"
House Committee to Vote on Holding William Barr and Wilbur Ross in Contempt Over Census Citizenship Question,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/house-oversight-committee-to-vote-barr-wilbur-ross-contempt-census-citizenship-question.html,"The Ruling Against a Cop Accused of a Horrific Body Cavity Search Is a Rare Victory for Police Accountability The House Oversight Committee will hold a vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to cooperate with the panel’s investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census, committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings said Monday. The committee subpoenaed documents on the Trump administration’s effort to get a citizenship question included on next year’s census, but neither Barr nor Ross complied with the order to turn over documents. Cummings said Monday that the pair would have until Thursday to comply with the subpoena otherwise the panel would proceed with contempt proceedings. Democrats have argued that the citizenship question is unnecessary and designed to deliberately undercount areas that traditionally have large immigrant populations in an effort to boost Republican representation. Just last week, new evidence showed the Trump administration was pushing the citizenship question specifically to benefit white Republicans. A 2015 study on the question’s impact that was circulated in the Trump administration said registering citizenship would help entrench GOP majorities. A now-deceased Republican operative working on gerrymandering even helped write a draft of a DOJ letter to the Commerce Department that came up with the rationale currently in use by the White House for the question’s inclusion—that it was needed to help enforce the Voting Rights Act. “The escalation between the Oversight Committee and Trump’s two Cabinet members comes just weeks after the House Judiciary Committee also voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to turn over special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s full, unredacted report. The full House is expected to vote on that contempt citation next week,” the Washington Post reports . “Democratic lawmakers have accused the Trump administration of stonewalling their efforts to investigate Ross’s March 2018 decision to add the citizenship question, which the government says it needs to better enforce the Voting Rights Act.”"
"Hollywood targets Georgia's new anti-abortion law, showing its growing influence and reliance on the state.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/hollywood-chernin-targets-georgias-new-anti-abortion-law-netflix-warner-heartbeat.html,"The Ruling Against a Cop Accused of a Horrific Body Cavity Search Is a Rare Victory for Police Accountability Hollywood heavyweight Peter Chernin is raising money to fund a legal battle against the growing number of states enacting anti-abortion laws that severely limit access to the procedure, the New York Times reports . Chernin, who was once a top executive for Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corp. before starting his own company, is soliciting contributions to a $15 million legal fund to combat anti-abortion laws generally, but with a special emphasis on the state of Georgia. Georgia enacted a so-called heartbeat bill last month and has become a battleground over the issue as the home to extensive Hollywood production activity that now employs 92,000 people in the state. “I am launching a campaign to contribute to the $15 million that is needed to fund the A.C.L.U.’s legal efforts to battle the national anti-abortion effort,” Chernin wrote in an email to potential donors last week, including Jeff Bezos, Ari Emanuel, Ted Sarandos, Tim Cook, and Shonda Rhimes, according to the Times. “We have a moral responsibility to act immediately,” Chernin wrote. The best way for Hollywood to confront the issue in Georgia, however, isn’t totally clear. “[T]he entertainment industry has a particularly cozy relationship with Georgia, which offers a 20 percent state tax credit (and another 10 percent if the Georgia Film Commission’s logo is shown in credits) to film and television production companies,” according to the Times, and “[u]ntil last week, there was near total silence from companies like Netflix, Disney and Warner Media.” The state has played a part in the production of Marvel films Black Panther and Spider-Man: Homecoming , as well as the AMC series The Walking De ad and Netflix’s Ozark . “Georgia has become a crucial hub for production because of hefty tax breaks, but the state’s new anti-abortion legislation—signed into law on May 7 and taking effect in January—has put Hollywood’s liberal politics on a collision course with its economic interests,” the Times reports. “Some actors have called for a boycott. But moving production to other locales would be costly and would penalize Georgia workers—many of them women—who depend on Hollywood for their livelihoods. Studio executives have privately worried that taking a stand against the issue might hurt ticket sales in huge swaths of the country, where many oppose abortion.”"

The Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark trailer: It's scary!,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/scary-stories-tell-dark-movie-del-toro-ovredal-trailer.html,"The Queen Gave Donald Trump a Book as a Gift and Trevor Noah Is Baffled Every book you read changes you, but some books change you more than others, and most people would say that there was one book in their life that changed them most of all. For anyone born between the invention of writing and roughly 1971, that book is likely to be a religious text of some flavor or another; the same holds true for people born after 2004 or so. But for English-speakers born during exactly the right tiny stripe of human history, there’s only one honest answer: Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark . The book, a collection of ghost stories and folk tales compiled by Alvin Schwartz and illustrated by Stephen Gammell, was first published in 1981; in 2011, it was republished with new, much-less-frightening illustrations by Brett Helquist. The original version of the book was a staple of school libraries and classroom book carousels in the 1980s, and people who encountered it at an impressionable age got a crash course in body horror, decay, and disgust that provided a steady source of nightmares for years to come. In one representative example, Schwartz retells the urban legend about a woman with an insect bite that swells until the skin breaks and baby spiders crawl out. There are a lot of ways you could illustrate that; Helquist drew a spider crawling across a girl’s cheek, which is a little creepy if you’re afraid of spiders. Gammell chose to render it with a woman staring in horror at the viewer as spiders crawl out of a hole in her face the size of a plum, with an ominous blackness under the skin that suggests the spiders have also removed a significant portion of cheekbone. What’s more, her skin seems to have cracked rather than torn, although streams of blood are dripping from the hole. Like I said: it’s straight, high-octane nightmare fuel. You know, for kids! I am pleased to report that the upcoming film adaptation of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark , from director André Øvredal, producer Guillermo Del Toro, and screenwriters Dan and Keven Hageman, looks poised to traumatize a whole new generation of schoolchildren: There’s a lot going on in this trailer, and some of it’s not that promising. The movie seems to be set in the same vaguely-midcentury-but-with-contemporary-clothing period as Chilling Adventures of Sabrina ; the framing story looks corny, and there’s the obligatory Stranger Things/It shot of kids biking around the suburbs. On the other hand: h!"
"The Daily Show: Trevor Noah reviews Trump's trip to the U.K., where the queen gave him a book, of all things.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/queen-trump-book-u-k-daily-show-trevor-noah-churchill-second-world-war.html,"Seriously? Comedy Central Trevor Noah took a look at Donald Trump’s trip to the United Kingdom on Monday, with a special focus on the strange gift he received from the queen: a book . As Noah explains, it’s unclear whether this was a mistake caused by a lack of familiarity with Donald Trump’s legendary unwillingness to read or an epic troll from the 93-year-old monarch; either way, it’s hilarious: The answer to Noah’s question—accident or troll?—can be deduced by looking into the precise gift Trump received. Newscasters have described it as a “first edition” of The Second World War , Winston S. Churchill’s history of the war, originally published in six volumes between 1948 and 1953, which won him a Nobel Prize in Literature. That would be a lovely gift for anyone but Donald Trump; a complete set of the U.K. first editions goes for a little over $2,000 , and they’re gorgeous, fit for a president’s library. But that’s not exactly what the queen gave President Trump. Her gift for him was the first edition of a slightly different book: The Second World War One-Volume Edition , currently available in its 1959 U.K. first edition on AbeBooks.com for as little as $14.32 . That’s right: She gave him the abridged version. (At least it wasn’t the “ special abridged edition for young readers .”) Trolling has a new queen.

ICE kept migrant children in vans for hours during the family reunification process: NBC News report.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/ice-migrant-children-vans-family-separations.html,"On-Duty Officer Who “Did Absolutely Nothing” to Stop Parkland School Shooting Charged With 11 Felony Counts As the Trump administration was scrambling to reunify thousands of migrant families it had separated during a period of “zero tolerance” immigration policy, it at one point in July 2018 held 37 children in vans for hours in the parking lot of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, NBC News reported Monday. The administration, under a court order to reunify the families it had separated, struggled to process the backlog of children who needed to be reconnected to parents or guardians. The 37 children placed in vans on July 15, 2018, were sent from a Department of Health and Human Resources facility to be processed by ICE at an adults-only facility called Port Isabel Detention Center and returned to their families. The kids were all between 5 and 12 years old, and while some were reunited with their families in less than a day—the first left the van after 11 hours—most spent at least 23 hours in the vans, according to NBC News. The last child to be processed and reunited with a parent or guardian had spent two nights in a van, for a total of 39 hours. ICE had been warned that the children would be arriving, but officers didn’t prepare properly, said an official from BCFS Health and Human Services, the nonprofit government contractor that was responsible for transporting the children. No one greeted the children when they arrived, and the ICE officers left for the day as if on a normal schedule, the BCFS official told NBC News. The children were taken into the ICE facility but then returned to the vans as ICE proceeded with the paperwork—a process repeated later that evening. When BCFS realized the children were not going to be processed by nightfall, the company called in more vans to give children more space to sleep, and officials retrieved blankets and food from the HHS facility where the children had stayed. According to the official, ICE told BCFS that if they returned the children to the HHS facility, the reunifications would be delayed. The BCFS regional director sent an email complaining about the situation to the company’s president after eight hours of waiting, and HHS became involved, making calls to ICE officials to try to expedite the processing. An ICE spokesman told NBC News that the agency “took immediate action to resolve the situation,” which it called “unusual.” Since the incident, no child waited more than a few hours to be reunited with parents, the agency said. Previous NBC News reporting found that the Trump administration had not kept track of the children and their parents during the separation and that it did not have an effective way to link them when it was attempting to reunify them. As a result, a massive backlog slowed the process to a crawl. Last week, the Washington Post reported that migrant children, who for the most part arrive unaccompanied at the border, continue to be held in near-capacity Border Patrol facilities struggling from the large number of arrivals each week. As a result, these facilities, which are not properly equipped for housing children, are tasked with holding the minors for sometimes as long as a week—far longer than the 72 hours allowed under law. Without proper resources, the children are made to sleep on mats on the floor or on concrete benches or even the pavement outside. On Tuesday, NBC News noted that HHS is operating at 97 percent capacity, making it increasingly difficult to find a place for the children to stay under U.S. custody. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security have warned that more children will die at border stations if HHS does not increase its capacity, according to NBC News. HHS has countered that it needs funding from Congress to do so. Six migrant children have died in U.S. custody since September."
"Jonathan Swan, Jared Kushner and Trump access journalism.",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/jared-kusher-jonathan-swan-intervivew.html,"Federal Judge Rules Congress Cannot Sue President Over Inventive Border Wall Funding There is a long-running debate as to whether reporters covering Donald Trump should engage in “access journalism.” The phrase is usually used pejoratively to describe the practice of getting access to people in power by passing along their talking points without challenging them and/or doing “humanizing” puff pieces about them—pulling punches, in other words, to maintain good relationships with people who can supply breaking-news scoops and help arrange exclusive Oval Office interviews. Reporters who are criticized for engaging in access journalism often argue in response that they’re being unfairly accused of endorsing behavior and viewpoints, when they are simply publishing or distributing information neutrally in order to alert the public about how important decisions are understood by the people making them .

Critics believe that access journalists enjoy the feeling of proximity to power and only really care about preserving it. Those accused of access journalism, who usually work for big newspapers or TV networks, imply that the kind of aggressive stance their critics are demanding of them is the province of niche rabble-rousers, opinion bloggers (gross), and outsiders.

Causing embarrassment to the people in Trump’s orbit by exposing their incompetence can be good for your career as a high-profile media figure. Take Axios’ Jonathan Swan. Axios is a publication for “insiders” that more or less takes pride in how value-neutral and reductive it is—its articles have little bullet point subheads that say things like BOTTOM LINE: VOTING IS WHAT ELECTIONS ARE . Swan in particular has been criticized by left-leaning commentators for having once reported incorrectly that Rod Rosenstein had resigned (in a way that suggested Swan might have gotten used by an administration rival of Rosenstein’s) and seeming to bait Trump into endorsing a right-wing immigration policy proposal during a one-on-one interview (in a way that suggested Swan did so in order to be able to claim the endorsement as a scoop, i.e. using his time with Trump for his own good, not ours). Over the weekend, though, HBO aired an interview that Swan conducted with Jared Kushner, for an Axios-branded show, in which Swan asked Kushner tough (but reasonable!) questions and followed them up directly when Kushner tried to dodge. The results were very unflattering for Kushner—and spectacularly successful for Axios and HBO. One clip , of Kushner trying to wriggle out of admitting that birtherism was racist, has already been viewed more than 3 million times on Twitter. By pulling an access journalism bait-and-switch to get Kushner to sit down with him, then blowing him up, Jonathan Swan became a star! Consider also author Michael Wolff. Early in the Trump administration, Wolff buttered up POTUS by making a cable-news appearance in which he criticized other press coverage of the administration. That led to him getting invited into the White House and having access to Trump and other figures close to him, who he then burned in a bestselling book, Fire and Fury , which portrayed the administration as the domain of backstabbing creeps.

Sarah Silverman discusses mental health and comedy in It's Not That Funny trailer (VIDEO).,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/sarah-silverman-mental-health-comedy-its-not-that-funny-trailer.html,"With Late Night , Mindy Kaling Responds to Being a “Diversity Hire” Most of us are familiar with the link between mental health challenges and comedy. It’s the paradox of the tragicomic Joker , the depressed stand-up comic, the sad clown: Those who excel at making people laugh are often privately suffering from serious issues—ones that are sometimes swept under the rug, sometimes adapted as material for jokes and bits. This strange, looping relationship is at the heart of It’s Not That Funny , an upcoming short documentary featuring interviews with comics like Sarah Silverman, Rachel Bloom, and Chris Gethard . A collaborative effort between SoulPancake—the digital media company founded by Rainn Wilson, who also appears in the doc—and Funny or Die, the film explores how mental health both informs comedic performance and leans on it as a therapy, not always to perfect success. “Comedy is not going to save you,” says Gethard in the trailer. “And if you are thinking about doing comedy as a substitute for therapy, it doesn’t work. I tried. I tried for a long time.” It’s Not That Funny will debut on SoulPancake later this year. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up. Please try again.

New poll shows Alabama’s abortion ban is wildly unpopular.,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/alabama-abortion-ban-unpopular-republican-voters-oppose.html,"Barr Is Cool With the FBI Spying on Any American Except Trump Alabama’s new abortion ban is wildly unpopular. The law, which prohibits abortion from the moment of conception, is one of the most extreme attacks on Roe v. Wade in the country. It includes no exception for rape or incest. Republican legislators overwhelmingly endorsed it, and GOP Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey enthusiastically signed it into law. But a new poll shows that a supermajority of Americans wants the Supreme Court to invalidate the ban. It’s more evidence that the latest wave of abortion restrictions is the result of an antidemocratic crusade to impose the view of a militant right-wing minority. HB 314 , the Alabama bill, makes abortion a Class A felony, subjecting those who perform the procedure to up to 99 years in prison. It is a direct challenge to Roe , which protects a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy before viability. A slew of recent polls have confirmed that such legislation is extremely unpopular throughout the country, while support for Roe remains high. A May CBS poll found that 67 percent of Americans believe the Supreme Court should uphold Roe , a finding consistent with a 2018 Wall Street Journal/NBC poll putting that number at 71 percent. A May Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 56 percent of Americans don’t think other states should pass laws like Alabama’s, and a May HuffPost/YouGov poll found that 57 percent of Americans disapprove of HB 314. A new poll commissioned by Take Back the Courts and conducted by YouGov Blue found the opposition to the Alabama bill may have grown even stronger. Moreover, while HB 314 was designed to challenge Roe , most Americans want the courts to apply Roe and block the law. Sixty-three percent of Americans think the Supreme Court should strike down HB 314; just 25 percent do not want the court to invalidate it. Eighty-two percent of Democrats , 70 percent of independents, and 36 percent of Republicans think the Supreme Court should strike down the law. Just 48 percent of Republicans do not want the court to invalidate the law. Sixty-five percent of women and 61 percent of men think the court should block HB 314. Why is HB 314 so incredibly unpopular? The poll was conducted between May 31 and June 3 and included 1,057 registered voters weighted to be representative by age, race and ethnicity, sex, education, census region, and 2016 vote choice. Its margin of error is +/−3.6 percent. Alissa Stollwerk, the director of YouGov Blue, told me that if SCOTUS allowed the law to stand, “we would face a constitutional crisis that would threaten the Supreme Court’s legitimacy.” Why is HB 314 so incredibly unpopular? One possibility proposed by HuffPost’s Ariel Edwards-Levy in May is its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. She noted that the bill “managed to draw the disapproval” of a sizable proportion of respondents “even among groups that are generally anti–abortion rights.” A Gallup poll shows that 57 percent of Americans who describe themselves as “pro-life” still support abortion rights in the case of rape or incest. If you believe that abortion is literally murder, then it is, of course, morally consistent to oppose it under all circumstances; it does not make much ethical sense to assert that a fetus is a human who may nonetheless be murdered because of the circumstances under which it was conceived. Moral consistency, however, is not always politically advantageous. That may be why a number of Republicans, including Sens. Mitt Romney , Tom Cotton, and Mitch McConnell , as well as President Donald Trump , have distanced themselves from the Alabama law. Other conservative-dominated states, though, have ignored this blowback: Shortly after Ivey signed HB 314, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed bills that banned abortion after six and eight weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Neither law included exceptions for rape or incest. Edwards is a Democrat, but the vast majority of lawmakers who’ve championed these bills are Republicans. All 25 Alabama senators who voted for HB 314, for instance, were Republicans; they are also all white men. And here we have another hint as to how these bills get passed despite their broad unpopularity. Although more than 26 percent of Alabamans are black, there are just six black senators among the state Senate’s 35 lawmakers. That’s because Alabama’s legislature is flagrantly gerrymandered. In 2017, a federal district court struck down a number of legislative districts as illegal racial gerrymanders; GOP legislators responded by creating a partisan gerrymander that dilutes Democratic votes. Because race and partisan affiliation are closely linked in Alabama, the new maps preserved the dominance of white Republicans. Indeed, Alabama legislators have spent the bulk of this decade mastering the art of voter suppression. They’ve been able to do so because the Supreme Court, by a 5–4 vote, gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, scrapping a provision that required historically racist jurisdictions to receive federal preclearance before altering their voting procedures. Less than 24 hours after that ruling, Alabama announced that it would begin requiring an ID to vote. Soon after, the state closed 31 driver’s license offices, mostly in majority-black counties. (They were reopened after a federal investigation found the closures had “a disparate and adverse impact on the basis of race.”) Since 2013, the state has also shuttered scores of polling places and engaged in mass voter purges . HB 314 is the outcome of these machinations, a bill passed by a legislature that is utterly unrepresentative of the population it ostensibly serves. The task of stopping HB 314 now falls on the judiciary, and most Americans want to see the courts apply Roe and strike it down. But the Supreme Court’s current conservative majority has expressed hostility to the constitutional right to abortion access. If SCOTUS upholds HB 314 or legislation like it, it will severely damage its legitimacy. And it will do so not to respect genuine democratic will, but, as my colleague Lili Loofbourow put it , “to satisfy the beliefs of a minority.” GOP lawmakers have rigged the game so successfully that they can easily pass laws opposed by a supermajority of Americans. If the Supreme Court upheld these bills, it wouldn’t be deferring to the democratic process—it would be assenting to the tyranny of the minority. Support our journalism

Last Black Man in San Francisco review: Sundance-winning debut movie takes on gentrification.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/last-black-man-in-san-francisco-movie-review-gentrification.html,"Ma Is the Best Kind of Trash There aren’t enough houses to go around in San Francisco. This is certainly true today, with the city’s sky-high rents fueling a steady stream of hair-raising headlines, an intractable homelessness crisis, and countless eulogies for a lost San Francisco. It’s indisputable that the city used to be more hospitable to the middle and working classes, as well as to artists and writers and seekers of all kinds. But there’s something ugly, too, about the current nostalgia that papers over the city’s many historical injustices, especially against racial minorities . The new film The Last Black Man in San Francisco is a love note to the city, but one that’s honest enough to admit that, even in eras that seemed more welcoming, there were always people who bristled when others dared to call it home. Shot in a warm but elegiac sunset-orange, Last Black Man garnered first-time feature helmer Joe Talbot this year’s directing award at the Sundance Film Festival. Its showy visuals, tale of unsustainable male friendship, and concern with racism and hyper-gentrification in the Bay Area may remind some of 2018’s Blindspotting . But the films that Last Black Man recalled for me were those of Barry Jenkins, who tackled themes of black extinction in San Francisco in his first film, Medicine for Melancholy , more than 10 years ago—and whose languid romances ( Moonlight , If Beale Street Could Talk ) reach their wrenching intensity in part through intimate close-ups of actors looking just shy of straight into the camera. And yet, this magnificent debut often feels like something utterly new. Last Black Man is also a love story, of a sort. The one-sided adoration at the heart of the drama is between Jimmie Fails (played by newcomer Jimmie Fails) and the periwinkle-gray Victorian mansion built by his grandfather, who is rumored to be have been the first black man in San Francisco. Though his father (Rob Morgan) lost the house—and with it, its pipe organ, stained-glass windows, wood-paneled library, and witch’s hat turret—in the ’90s, Jimmie, accompanied by his spacey wannabe-playwright friend Montgomery (Jonathan Majors), skateboards to the residence every day. (Ignoring the taunts about their close relationship from the other twentysomething men in their run-down neighborhood, Jimmie and Montgomery sometimes ride the former’s skateboard together, their legs moving in perfect tandem—a vision of relaxed, synchronized bliss.) Once there, Jimmie—to the consternation of the current (white) tenants, who just want to be left alone—rakes the garden, paints the windowsills, and tuts at all the maintenance projects they won’t do. But San Francisco’s cruelty, while not colorblind, doesn’t impact only people of color. Before long, the elderly occupants are evicted following a family dispute, leaving the house empty for Jimmie and Montgomery to move in. While there’s some mild tension about whether a nosy (white) neighbor might call the cops on the duo, Last Black Man refuses to adhere to a conventional plot, even as an obtrusive score portends melodrama around every corner. Instead, we follow Jimmie as he visits his dad, his aunt (Tichina Arnold), and Montgomery’s grandfather (Danny Glover), excavating his family history, which is intertwined with the city’s history. Screenwriters Talbot and Rob Richert, working off a story by Talbot and Fails (San Francisco natives both), revive memories of the “Harlem of the West” that the Fillmore District (traditionally the city’s black neighborhood) used to be called—then complicate the picture almost immediately by suggesting the role that Japanese internment may have played in his grandfather’s success. But the film doesn’t dwell on that possibility, and neither does Jimmie: He already knows what his family’s contributions to San Francisco are, and without them, there’d be no point in living in a city that rejects people like him so baldly.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Last Black Man is about the urgency and the pitfalls of family legends, the erasure of black history, alternate modes of masculinity, and the many cool shots you can get when you combine skateboards and slo-mo. But it’s also about so many other issues—landlord arson, subprime mortgages, environmental racism, homelessness, shootings over insults—that reflect harrowing news stories but are alluded to in such oblique fashion that the film feels both timely and timeless. Racism’s manifestations are dizzyingly legion and sometimes frustratingly diffuse. Last Black Man captures what it’s like to confront a cloud that can make you feel like you’re suffocating but that you can hardly tackle directly. That lack of tactility can translate to the viewing experience. I was initially left unmoved by the film’s emotional circumspection and elliptical conclusion but found myself in great admiration of it after a few days’ thought. The tech industry is mostly invisible in this version of San Francisco, but we don’t need to see it to feel its effects. In its place is a lush verdancy we rarely associate with the city, along with the usual suspects: those ludicrously steep hills, the occasional naked man, and, more recently, the ubiquitous açai bowls. San Francisco may be waging war against its most vulnerable residents, but if you can enjoy its beauty, as Jimmie and Montgomery do for a magical few days, its unique picturesqueness makes it easy to love. Even when the city betrays him, Jimmie gets angry when a stranger treats it as interchangeable with any other city. He’s right: There’s no other place like it."
The Trump Organization is accused of tax evasion over Panama hotel.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-panama-hotel-tax-evasion-accusation.html,"Trump, a True Student of History, Suggests U.S. and Ireland’s Border Situations Aren’t All That Different Really The majority owner of the former Trump Panama hotel, who made headlines in March 2018 when he physically forced the Trump Organization out of the building using armed agents, is asserting that he has found documents proving the Trump Organization evaded Panamanian taxes. The allegation comes from a new legal filing in the continued conflict between the Trump business and Orestes Fintiklis, an investor from Cyprus who owns the company that owns a majority stake in the hotel, which is now a Marriott. According to the Washington Post , the filing, made in federal court in New York City on Monday, alleges that after the Trump Organization was ejected, Fintiklis was able to look at the hotel’s records and found that the company had not paid the 12.5 percent tax on management fees it collected. Fintiklis also said the company avoided some taxes by underreporting the hotel employees’ salaries. He didn’t say how much the tax bill would amount to, but he argued his company could face millions in liability if Panama comes seeking the taxes that the Trump Organization (which is still owned by President Donald Trump but run by his two sons) failed to pay. Fintiklis also said his company would not have purchased its share of the hotel back in 2017 if the Trump Organization had been honest about its failure to pay those taxes. The Trump Organization denies the allegations, and it told the Post that withholding taxes is the responsibility of the building’s owners (Fintiklis’ company) and not the managers (the Trump Organization). “The Trump Organization’s only role was to manage the property,” the spokeswoman said in a statement to the Post. “We look forward to taking the depositions of Mr. Fintiklis and his partners and unmasking their fraud.” Fintiklis and the Trump Organization are suing each other for millions in damages, each accusing the other of breaching their contracts. The Trump Organization has maintained that the owners had no basis on which to cut ties with the managers of the building. Fintiklis has argued that the Trump Organization misled the owners into thinking the hotel was thriving, when in reality it was not—and that the poor management practices of the Trump Organization along with the negative associations with the president’s name were driving the hotel’s business into the ground. The conflict between the two sides began in 2017, when Fintiklis first became majority owner of the Trump Ocean Club in Panama City and started accusing the Trump Organization of mismanagement. The Trump Organization resisted Fintiklis’ attempts to fire the company, arguing that its contract was good until 2031, and finally in March 2018 Fintiklis called in his own security guards to evict the Trump staff from the building. What followed was chaotic: His security guards tussled with Trump Organization security guards; Panamanian police arrested a Trump security guard for blocking their way to the hotel’s administrative office; Fintiklis himself barged into the hotel to try to fire nine Trump employees; Fintiklis failed to find the employees and instead sat down at a piano in the lobby to play Beethoven’s Für Elise , eliciting a round of applause from his employees; and finally, after what appeared to be a stalemate, armed agents evicted the Trump staff. A Panamanian judge ruled in Fintiklis’ favor, and the Trump name was stripped from the hotel. After the drama unfolded, Trump Organization attorneys sent a letter to Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, according to the Associated Press , “urgently” requesting “influence in relation to a commercial dispute regarding the Trump hotel.” The letter warned that the Trump Organization was being mistreated by Panama’s justice system and that the country was at risk of violating a 1983 treaty between the two countries, the Washington Post reported in April 2018. The lawyers, who specifically worked for a Panamanian firm, said they sent the letter without the Trump Organization’s approval. Varela said he did not take any action as a result of the letter."
"Abortion bans, HBO’s Chernobyl, Jared Kushner and Axios, Apple’s new privacy feature.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/abortion-bans-hbo-chernobyl-axios-jared-kushner-apple-privacy.html,"Trump, a True Student of History, Suggests U.S. and Ireland’s Border Situations Aren’t All That Different Really Not the will of the people: Despite the recent success of near-total abortion bans in statehouses across the country, these laws remain extremely unpopular—poll after poll proves it. So why do Republican legislators keep passing them? Mark Joseph Stern explains . Lessons unlearned: The hit HBO miniseries Chernobyl has sparked a revival of interest in the devastating nuclear disaster of the late 1980s, which occurred as the Soviet Union was in severe decline. Sam Adams talks to showrunner Craig Mazin about the decisions involved in creating the show, Russia then and now, the dangers of a government and society divorced from truth (sound familiar?), and the things the world should actually have learned from the Chernobyl fallout . Some advice: Did you watch that Axios interview with Jared Kushner ? It was pretty painful, wasn’t it?

"Trump administration imposes new travel restrictions on Cuba, further rolling back Obama-era détente.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-administration-imposes-new-travel-restrictions-on-cuba-further-rolling-back-obama-era-detente.html,"Mueller (Allegedly) Found Child Porn on Phone of Lobbyist Who Set Up Trump-Russia Back Channel The Trump administration announced new restrictions Tuesday on Americans traveling to Cuba, as it continues to undo the Obama-era diplomatic détente that allowed increased travel and expanded trade between the two nations. The latest crack down by the Treasury Department puts an end to cruises to the country, which accounted for more visitors than via airplanes, as well as what are referred to as “people to people” trips. Even though a ban on tourism remained during the 2016 thaw as part of the congressionally mandated economic embargo, the different exceptions had allowed for greatly expanded access to the country. Many of those have now been closed off by the Trump administration, although commercial airlines are expected to continue to be allowed to operate flights between the U.S. and Cuba. The move was previewed in April by national security adviser John Bolton and comes amid Trump White House accusations that Havana continues to play a muck around in the region. “Cuba continues to play a destabilizing role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement on Tuesday. Recently, the Trump administration says Cuba has stationed 20,000 military and intelligence agents in Venezuela to help stabilize the current regime and keep President Nicolás Maduro in power. The White House is trying to achieve the opposite. “The new rules do not include new restrictions on money sent by Cuban Americans to relatives on the island,” the Washington Post reports . “Although it was also announced by Bolton, that policy is likely to be far less popular among the Cuban community in Florida. A Treasury Department spokesman, while declining to address the specific issue of remittances, said additional Cuba regulations were expected in the coming months.” "
Paul Manafort to be transferred to New York’s notorious Rikers Island prison.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/manafort-solitary-confinement-new-york-city-rikers-prison-fraud-pardon.html,"Trump, a True Student of History, Suggests U.S. and Ireland’s Border Situations Aren’t All That Different Really Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort is expected to be transferred to the notorious New York City jail complex on Rikers Island ahead of a trial on state mortgage fraud charges, the New York Times reports . Manafort continues to face the legal fallout of years of living outside the law, even as the 70-year-old serves a seven-and-a-half-year combined federal prison sentence in Pennsylvania for two cases brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. The new charges in New York City are part of an effort by Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., who obtained an indictment of Manafort on more than a dozen state felony counts of mortgage fraud, to ensure that the former Trump aide cannot evade serving significant jail-time through a presidential pardon. Trump, as president, has shown an extraordinary willingness to use the power of the pardon for allies, but state convictions are outside the president’s pardoning power. In Rikers, Manafort will likely be kept in solitary confinement, separate from the general prison population, which is common practice for high-profile inmates, pretrial detainees, and convicts serving light sentences of less than a year. “A law-enforcement official familiar with the correction department’s practices, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss security measures, said Mr. Manafort would most likely be housed in a former prison hospital on the island,” according to the Times. “That is where most high-profile detainees are held, including police officers, those accused of killing police officers, politicians and celebrities.” From the Times:
A law enforcement official familiar with the jail’s practices said he would probably be held in one of the oldest buildings in the island, known as the North Infirmary Command, which was built in the early 1930s, or in one of the complex’s newest structures, a set of fiberglass tent-like structures known as “Sprungs.” Cell blocks in the infirmary command have eight cells and a day room with a television on each tier, the official said. The inmates are not locked in their cells during the day. It’s unclear exactly how long Manafort will have to spend in one of the country’s most infamous jails, known for violence and abuse, although he is expected to be transferred there in the next couple of weeks and could be forced to await trial there."

Watch Nathan Lane Deliver a Fiery Monologue From His Playbill’s Fire Safety Warning,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/stephen-colbert-nathan-lane-fire-safety-gary-titus-andronicus.html,"A master at work. CBS Acting is one of the least-explored arts in cultural criticism, at least when it comes to describing the choices an actor makes in a production instead of whether or not the result was “good” or “bad.” One of the best things an actor can accomplish, then, is a performance that is so technically perfect that it’s impossible to discuss without delving into the mechanics of the craft itself. It’s worth heralding every time it happens, and it happened on Tuesday, when Nathan Lane delivered this brief—but brilliant—performance for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert . For his text, Mr. Lane selected the famous “ FIRE NOTICE ” monologue from the Playbill from Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus , in which Lane is currently starring: Chills . Lane makes some unconventional choices in this performance, but his exceptional skill as an actor allows him to make the whole thing look as though there’s no other way to play the scene. In fact, if this is the first time you’ve seen “ FIRE NOTICE ” performed, some of the nuances may go unnoticed. Here’s the original text :
FIRE NOTICE: The exit indicated by a red light and sign nearest to the seat you occupy is the shortest route to the street. In the event of fire or other emergency please do not run—WALK TO THAT EXIT.
Thoughtless persons annoy patrons and endanger the safety of others by lighting matches or smoking in the prohibited areas during the performances and intermissions. This violates a city ordinance and is punishable by law.
FIRE COMMISSIONER The “FIRE COMMISSIONER” epilogue is performed more rarely than the Roy-Cohn-in-hell scene from Angels in America , so it’s not that noteworthy that Lane omits it. But watch the way he delivers the line “In the event of fire or other emergency please do not run—WALK TO THAT EXIT.” The capitalization would suggest building to a crescendo here, and indeed, this is the approach most actors take. But Lane’s Fire Commissioner—an annoyed bureaucrat trying very hard to keep his temper in the face of a plague of lit matches and smoking patrons—is a long way from the fire-and-fury versions of Pacino or Brando. So Lane inverts the emphasis, shouting “DO NOT RUN,” then, as the Fire Commissioner visibly regainins control of his emotions, practically purring “Walk to that exit.” Using this moment to pull back instead of escalating gives the audience time to clock the barely-under-control anger and threat in the Fire Commissioner’s voice. It also gives Lane plenty of room to build to “PUNISHABLE BY LAW,” which should clearly be the emotional high point of “ FIRE NOTICE ,” typography be damned. It’s another example of the way a brilliant actor can tease out hidden meanings in a text, arguing for an unconventional interpretation by physically embodying that reading, fusing performance and criticism into something altogether new. Nathan Lane’s unconventional performance has given us the definitive Fire Commissioner. We can’t wait to see what he does with the “ EMERGENCY RESUSCITATION EQUIPMENT ” monologue or The Use of Any Recording Devices, Either Audio or Video.

The new Jumanji video game had better transport me to a magical jungle adventure.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/jumanji-welcome-jungle-ps4-game-trailer-truth-advertising.html,"Karen Gillen and The Rock explore the mysterious Uncanny Valley. Sony Jumanji , Chris Van Allsburg’s hauntingly illustrated children’s book about a jungle-themed board game that comes to life, has had a lot of incarnations since its original publication in 1981. There was the original book , the 1995 film adaptation with Robin Williams and a very young Kirsten Dunst, the 1995 Milton Bradley board game , Van Allsburg’s 2002 outer-space-themed sequel Zathura , Jon Favreau’s 2005 film adaption Zathura: A Space Adventure , and of course, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle with the Rock, Jack Black and Kevin Hart. What’s the one thing all of these Jumanji -related media have in common? They have utterly failed to magically transport me to a whimsical but still mildly-threatening jungle fantasyland to take part in a thrilling adventure. No stampedes, monsoons, or lions have unexpectedly appeared in any of my residences between 1981 and today, no matter which Jumanji -related products I purchased. I’m just stuck here in early 21 st century America and Donald Trump is president, which violates any number of implicit and explicit promises from the makers of Jumanji. Worse still, representatives from Houghton Mifflin, TriStar Pictures, Milton-Bradley, Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures, the and the Los Angeles Zoo have stopped responding to my letters about this wholly unacceptable situation. Anyway, it looks like Sony is taking one last shot at living up to decades of broken promises with a video game adaptation of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle . Per the trailer, it’s for “those who seek to find a way to leave their world behind,” which is a pretty big demographic these days: The seventh time had better be the charm, Jumanji !

"In the New Black Mirror Season’s Standout Episode, Virtual Reality Lets Straight Men Have Gay Sex",slate.com,Inkoo Kang,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/black-mirror-season-5-striking-vipers.html,"The Creator of Chernobyl on Viewers Taking Away the Wrong Lessons It’s easy to imagine a grim near-future in which Black Mirror perpetually chases the high of “San Junipero,” with diminishing returns. The Season 3 episode, which starred Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a queer couple who could’ve only found each other in cyberspace, was the first in the series to give its characters a happy ending , imparting a much-needed dose of tonal unpredictability to a show notorious for its dystopian paranoia and despair about technology. But creator Charlie Brooker, who has written or co-written every episode since the series’ sophomore year, whiffed his intended follow-up to “San Junipero.” In Season 4’s “Hang the DJ,” a romance pitted against a dating algorithm abruptly gave way to the deflating twist that we should’ve trusted the algorithm all along. The episode’s most startling reveal was how little Brooker seemed to understand what made the love story tick. Black Mirror ’s three-episode fifth season, which is now available, is its shortest of the Netflix seasons, not counting one-offs like December’s interactive “ Bandersnatch .” Overall, the new entries are an underwhelming lot. Andrew “ Hot Priest ” Scott is betrayed by a particularly weak script in “Smithereens,” which doesn’t divulge its rather mundane tech phobia until the episode’s final minutes. Much more fun—but irrefutably silly and melodramatic—is “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,” starring Miley Cyrus as a pop star whose exploitation by a family member is aided by gizmos too theoretical to strike genuine fear. The standout episode is meant to be “Striking Vipers,” named after a Street Fighter –esque VR game in which two longtime but now-distant friends—family man Danny (Anthony Mackie) and perma-bachelor Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II)—consummate an attraction to one another that neither man seems to realize he had harbored. In the digital guises of Lance (Ludi Lin), a Ryu-like martial artist with a hairless chest and bulging muscles on every surface of his compact body, and Roxette (Pom Klementieff), a Cammy-esque kickboxer with a platinum bob and black underwear peeking out of her short red dress, Danny and Karl find that their digital duels keep turning into mind-blowing sexual trysts. (The game, we’re told when they start throwing punches, “replicates all physical sensation.”) Until its surprisingly unromantic resolution, “Striking Vipers” is one of the most ambitious and intriguingly enigmatic stories Black Mirror has ever told. [Spoilers ahead.] In contrast with most of the series, this installment resists giving us too many answers. We’re never quite sure what exactly the nature of Danny and Karl’s attraction is, for instance, or how the former’s differs from the latter’s. Foremost, it’s unclear whether the pals have sublimated their homosexual desire for one another into more socially acceptable targets (i.e., Danny’s wife, Theo, and Lance’s eyebrow-raisingly younger girlfriend, Daisy, played by Nicole Beharie and Monique Cynthia Brown, respectively), or whether the two men are only into each other as a (Asian, accented, athletic, aggressive, hella cheesy-looking) straight couple. We also never learn which elements play a role in their relationship: the secrecy, the escapism, the novelty, the role-play, their yearslong friendship, the safety of a game world free from prying eyes, the fluidity between homosociality and homoeroticism, the uncertainty of the genders, races, sexual orientations involved, and/or the ability to blur any and all categories. (Whew.) What we do know is that Theo and Daisy feel sexually neglected—with Theo suspicious that her husband’s having an affair—and that Danny is reluctant to blow up his nuclear family if his attraction to Lance isn’t “real.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Do their touchless affairs even count as cheating? For most of the hour, “Striking Vipers” hums along on a delicious uncertainty, unfettered by Brooker’s customary didacticism. Eventually, though, the episode’s underwrittenness begins to sink the romance. Danny and Karl decide to meet up in person to gauge their physical attraction to one another in real life, and Karl, who’d enjoyed the “best sex of [his] life” with Lance, decidedly doesn’t enjoy their kiss. With Danny, the matter of his gratification is more unsettled—both the camera and Mackie play it coy. It’s at that pivotal juncture, when the emotional disjunct between the men is never more character-revealing, that it hits us how little we know about their IRL relationship to one another. The conclusion of “Striking Vipers” is one in which technology assists in the queering and opening up of the central trio, to the satisfaction of each individual’s wants. Danny gets to stay in his heterosexual marriage, not least for his kids’ sake, and enjoy scheduled flings with his friend. Karl realizes that, when he isn’t with Danny, he prefers the company of his new cat to Daisy’s. And Theo, who had felt sexually stifled by her marriage, is free to pick up strangers on the nights when she and Danny have prearranged their strayings. The characters’ new situations flirt with ideas frequently associated with queerness—open marriages, a gay-ish affair, the ability to transition between male and female bodies—but the amorphousness of their relationship and the heavy emphasis on protecting Danny and Theo’s union make the ending feel less like a romantic micro utopia than an optimization of heterosexual marriage, one that eliminates the destabilizing threats of new urges and sexual exploration. Danny and Karl’s erotic ardor is ultimately domesticated and instrumentalized in the same way that Danny and Theo’s sex life was, at least temporarily, dedicated to maximizing her chances at getting pregnant. If we had a better understanding of what drew Danny and Karl to each other, we could better root for their relationship. But without those crucial details, it just feels like the best ending Black Mirror can give us is scheduled sex."
"Black Mirror’s episode “Rachel, Jack, & Ashley Too” looks at our relationships with smart speakers.",slate.com,Rachel Withers,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/black-mirror-miley-cyrus-smart-speaker-ashley-too.html,"Apple Is a Tech Regulator Now When I was 8 years old, I had a rather vacuous talking doll . My Diva Starz Interactive Doll couldn’t respond directly to my voice, but she was semi-conversational, commenting enthusiastically when I changed her outfits, asking me yes/no questions, and offering girly platitudes that could have come straight from Malibu Stacy . Her name, funnily enough, was Alexa. Ashley Too, the Miley Cyrus–voiced robo-doll in the third episode of Black Mirror ’s fifth season (“Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too”), sits somewhere between my Alexa and Amazon’s Alexa—somewhere between toy and smart speaker, merchandise and friend . The smart device is sold in a fictional world dominated by a perky pop star named Ashley O (played by Cyrus), and has Ashley’s voice and personality programmed into it, allowing fans to feel closer to her. The episode follows Rachel, a lonely teenager who adores Ashley O and quickly comes to see Ashley Too as her real-life friend. Ashley Too is more than a smart speaker—it’s also “ your new best friend ,” says Netflix—but it does a lot of the same things the Echo does. It plays music, answers questions, and even offers to read “motivational quotes from famous women” when you’re feeling down, not unlike one of the thousands of dubious-sounding Alexa skills . Ashley Too has eyes and a moving body, an idea one senior Amazon engineer recently floated for Alexa, too. The Black Mirror trailer left many wondering if Ashley Too was “ an Alexa spin-off ,” and not just because their names and aesthetics are so similar. As Black Mirror is wont to do, “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too” poses a lot of questions—about the future of music (holograms, streaming concerts, vocal mimicry) and the future of A.I. It calls to mind other episodes in which human personalities are downloaded into household objects, such as a smart home controller and a stuffed toy monkey . For me, these kinds of episodes raise another question: How much personality should a smart device have? Without spoiling “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too,” the smart speaker goes through a mid-episode personality change, transitioning from helpful and submissive to, well, a lot more like what I imagine the real Miley Cyrus to be like. In other words, from little personality to all the personality. Both options have their risks for smart speakers: Too much personality and we risk anthropomorphizing it, viewing what is essentially the mouthpiece of powerful tech company as a trusted friend; not enough and it’s a doormat, encouraging people to speak inappropriately to it and others. The Ashley Too that comes out of the box is peppy and obliging (“I’ll be here for you!” “Here if you need to talk!” “Believe in yourself!”). She goes to sleep when told and wakes up when told. When spoken to rudely by Rachel’s cynical sister Jack, Ashley Too responds only with “I think you made a bad word choice.” When Rachel tells the doll to ignore her sister, she perkily complies: “I’ll make a note of that!” Even with her initial “limited” personality, Ashley Too’s responsiveness leads the friendless Rachel to view the doll as a confidante—hanging out, doing a makeover, learning dances. When she screws up her performance in the school talent show, Rachel feels she has “let Ashley Too down,” leading her sister to point out “she’s not a person.” “She’s my friend,” Rachel replies. It’s not an unreasonable suggestion for Black Mirror to make: From kids to the elderly , many view their smart speakers as companions. In a Google Experience & Design survey, 41 percent of users said that talking to a smart speaker feels like talking to a friend or another person . Rachel is especially susceptible to falling into this trap, with research showing that loneliness makes people more like to form bonds with bots. The fact that Ashley Too has the voice of a celebrity, a real and recognizable individual, causes Rachel to feel like she is talking to some version of Ashley O—an effect that we may see in the real world as Google Assistant begins to offer voices from celebrities, like singer John Legend . Smart speakers’ personalities are shaped by existing gender norms, and will continue to shape those norms moving forward. I was never at risk of thinking my 2000s-era Alexa was my friend, because she wasn’t responsive to anything but magnets in her clothes and buttons on her feet, and her style of speech was far from natural. But as robots become more “human” in their interactions and tone, humans become more likely to bond with them, as Andreas Vogel and Nicholas Wright note in their recent Future Tense piece , raising all sorts of ethical questions around the dual role of trusted companion and persuasive sales associate. Once Ashley Too goes through its “change,” both sisters, even the cynical Jack, seem to accept it as a “person.” That “person” then convinces them to do something dangerous (the right thing to do, but still). Its colorful emotions and snarky sarcasm make its pleas and demands harder to ignore, even as they know intellectually that it’s a bot. How much more nuanced or individualized these “characters” will become remains to be seen—as Vogel and Wright note, smart speaker A.I. can also be “personalized” to each individual user. The incident where Jack swears at Ashley Too reflects concerns contained within a recent United Nations report on the gendering of smart speakers. The report, “ I’d Blush if I Could: Closing Gender Divides in Digital Skills Through Education ,” expresses concern with the “deflecting, lackluster or apologetic responses” that feminized smart speakers give to verbal abuse, suggesting that their “unfailing politeness” could reinforce existing gender bias: “It honours commands and responds to queries regardless of their tone or hostility. In many communities, this reinforces commonly held gender biases that women are subservient and tolerant of poor treatment.” The report refers to a 2017 Quartz investigation , which found that the leading voice assistants responded to harassment either playfully or positively, with answers programmed by overwhelmingly male teams, suggesting this gender imbalance needs to change, and soon. As the U.N. notes, smart speakers already carry “special emotive power,” simply by virtue of the fact that they sound like people. But what people don’t often realize is that the major smart speakers are already imbued with “personalities,” designed and tailored by the predominantly male teams who created them. The U.N. report pulls together commentary from the engineers on the ideas that went into designing them: Cortana is a “character … endowed with make-believe feelings, opinions, challenges, likes and dislikes, even sensitivities and hopes,” while Google Assistant was imagined as “a young woman from Colorado; the youngest daughter of a research librarian and physics professors who has a B.A. in history from Northwestern, an elite research university in the United States; and as a child, won US$100,000 on Jeopardy Kids Edition, a televised trivia Game.” In other words, they have been “intentionally humanized” and gendered in a way that carries meaning for their creators and users. Their personalities are shaped by existing gender norms, and will continue to shape those norms moving forward. I sometimes refer to Alexa as “her,” as Rachel does with Ashley Too, much to Jack/the internet’s chagrin. But I’m cautious of where and how I use “it” and “she” for the character behind the Echo, wary of both under- and over-anthropomorphizing. Alexa is not a she, but there’s something highly uncomfortable about referring to something that has a specifically designated female personality as an “it.” There are risks to anthropomorphizing Alexa, but there are also risks to treating “her” like an object when “she” has an undeniably feminine personality and presents as a woman. Both the U.N. report and “Rachel, Jack & Ashley Too” suggest that a lot more thought needs to be put into the characters being programmed into smart speakers, into how they behave and how “real” they feel. The level of personality digital assistants possess will certainly play a role in the unforeseeable ways they will influence human interaction, and it will be difficult to balance giving a digital assistant a voice and a spine without taking its character too far, especially now that they have been made “female” by default. One thing’s for sure: Smart speakers need a little more mettle when it comes to copping abuse. As Netflix U.K. and Ireland nicknamed Black Mirror ’s latest futuristic product, “ ashley too the hands free speaker that screams back at you. ” Perhaps Alexa should too ."

Jussie Smollett Will Not Return to Empire,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/jussie-smollett-will-not-return-for-empire-season-six.html,"On Fleabag , Hair Really Is Everything Jussie Smollett, the actor accused of staging a hate crime against himself earlier this year, will not be returning for Empire ’s sixth and final season. The show’s co-creator, Lee Daniels, confirmed the news in a statement on Tuesday. Smollett’s future on the Fox show has been up in the air since he was indicted for allegedly filing a false police report following what he described as a racist and homophobic attack. He was later accused of having hired the men who assaulted him out of dissatisfaction with his Empire salary. Smollett maintained his innocence, and in an unexpected reversal in March, the charges against him were dropped . But questions surrounding the case remained, and the city of Chicago is suing the actor in order to recoup the cost of the investigation. Due to lingering uncertainty, many wondered whether Smollett’s role on Empire would be eliminated. His departure has now been confirmed, courtesy of a tweet from Daniels: @Variety @JoeOtterson This is not factual. Jussie will NOT be returning to Empire. -LD — lee daniels (@leedanielsent) June 4, 2019 The revelation arrived in response to a Variety report in which production sources said that Empire writers were working under the expectation that Smollett would eventually be back in Season 6. His character was removed from the final episodes of Season 5 following the controversy “to avoid further disruption on set,” producers said in a statement in February. Tensions on set have reportedly been high since the case against Smollett, and in April, Empire cast members appealed for his return in a letter to Fox executives. “Together, as a united front, we stand with Jussie Smollett and ask that our co-star, brother and friend be brought back for our sixth season of Empire, ” read the letter, which was signed by series stars including Taraji P. Henson and Terrence Howard. According to Variety , the Empire team remains divided: The show’s cast, which is mostly black, still believes Smollett is innocent, while many of its mostly white below-the-line crew think him guilty.

YouTube’s New Crackdown on Hate Speech Comes at a Curious Time,slate.com,Chip Brownlee,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/youtube-hate-speech-crackdown-steven-crowder-carlos-maza.html,"Apple Is a Tech Regulator Now On Tuesday, YouTube refused to remove videos from a right-wing YouTuber attacking a journalist for his sexual orientation and his ethnicity. It took days for the platform—owned by Google—to even respond to a complaint about the channel, and when it finally did, it said the content didn’t violate its harassment and hate speech policies. Less than a day later, YouTube and Google announced the introduction of new policies aimed at “removing more hateful and supremacist content from YouTube.” In a blog post , YouTube said content that alleges a group is superior in order to justify discrimination on characteristics like age, race, caste, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status would be prohibited under its new hate speech policy. It’ll also remove some conspiracy theory videos that deny well-documented violent events, like the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting and the Holocaust. YouTube’s announcement Wednesday comes as Silicon Valley tech giants continue to revise policies and rules aimed at tackling hate speech and misinformation on their platforms. Earlier this year, Facebook removed several inflammatory figures —including conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, alt-right personality Milo Yiannopoulos, white supremacist Paul Nehlen, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan—for engaging in and promoting violence and hate. But those moves have often been viewed as too slow or too narrow in scope. Extremist content often flies under the radar on the sites. Sometimes decisions also seem to split hairs: The Facebook page for Jones’ Infowars was taken down in August 2018, long before Facebook took broader steps to remove numerous other pages connected to Jones and Infowars. Meanwhile, conservatives—led by President Donald Trump—are criticizing the major tech companies for what they say is a crackdown on the right. The problem often comes when the companies are forced to interpret and enforce their existing rules, as evidenced by YouTube’s decision Tuesday not to ban right-wing comedian and YouTuber Steven Crowder after Carlos Maza, a video producer and writer at Vox, said Crowder has harassed him online for years. Maza and others accused YouTube of giving a free pass to Crowder because of his channel’s popularity. ( Update : YouTube tweeted Wednesday afternoon that it has “suspended this channel’s monetization. We came to this decision because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community and is against our YouTube Partner Program policies.” In response, Maza tweeted , “Demonetizing doesn’t work. … The ad revenue isn’t the problem. It’s the platform.”) Crowder’s derogatory insults—posted in numerous videos shared on YouTube to his more than 3.8 million subscribers—ranged from attacks on Maza’s sexual orientation to invectives about his ethnicity. YouTube tweeted Tuesday that the right-wing personality’s commentary wasn’t enough to violate the platform’s current anti-harassment and anti-bullying policies even though the policies prohibit content that “deliberately posted in order to humiliate someone” or “makes hurtful and negative personal comments/videos about another person.” (2/4) Our teams spent the last few days conducting an in-depth review of the videos flagged to us, and while we found language that was clearly hurtful, the videos as posted don’t violate our policies. We’ve included more info below to explain this decision: — TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) June 4, 2019 It appeared that YouTube’s investigation began only after Maza posted a compilation of Crowder’s insults on his Twitter channel. That video shows Crowder referring to Maza as a “lispy queer,” an “anchor baby,” and the “gay Vox sprite.” In the Twitter post, Maza called for YouTube to take down Crowder’s offensive videos — in some of the clips Crowder can be seen wearing a “Socialism is for F—” T-shirt that used a homophobic slur. Since I started working at Vox, Steven Crowder has been making video after video ""debunking"" Strikethrough. Every single video has included repeated, overt attacks on my sexual orientation and ethnicity. Here's a sample: pic.twitter.com/UReCcQ2Elj — Carlos Maza (@gaywonk) May 31, 2019 “As an open platform, it’s crucial for us to allow everyone–from creators to journalists to late-night TV hosts–to express their opinions w/in the scope of our policies,” YouTube wrote on one of its Twitter accounts Tuesday night. “Opinions can be deeply offensive, but if they don’t violate our policies, they’ll remain on our site.” So Crowder’s YouTube channel will stay up—at least for now. YouTube said in its Twitter post that it is investigating other claims against Crowder’s page, and it isn’t clear how Google and YouTube’s new hate policies will affect Crowder’s channel. The YouTuber has defended his posts as debate and comedy—not harassment. YouTube’s announcement also said that it aims to reduce the circulation of borderline content by adjusting its recommendation algorithms to reduce traffic to content on the edge of violating its policies. Instead, it hopes to raise up authoritative voices like top news channels and reward “trusted creators” while improving enforcement of rules that remove advertising and monetization features from channels that brush up against its hate speech policies. Now comes the tough part: making the hard choices that will inevitably lead to criticism."
Trump falsely says he implemented the transgender troop ban because of drugs.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-lie-transgender-troop-ban-reason-drugs.html,"Appeals Court Issues Disastrously Ignorant Decision on Trans Troops Ban Two months after the administration’s transgender military ban went into effect, President Donald Trump has trotted out a new—and false—justification for the rule: that the military does not allow prescription drugs. Trump made the claim on Good Morning Britain in an interview Wednesday morning with his friend Piers Morgan. When asked why he implemented the ban, Trump said that he was considering the requirements of sex reassignment surgery. “Because they take massive amounts of drugs. They have to,” he said. “You’re not allowed to take drugs—you’re in the military, you’re not allowed to take any drugs. And they have to after the operation, they have to, they have no choice, they have to. You would actually have to break rules and regulations in order to have that.” That assertion is false in several ways. The first is that, while the new rule effectively bans all transgender troops, not all transgender people get, or want, sex reassignment surgery. Similarly, not all take prescription hormones to alter their physical characteristics without the surgery. But even for those who do, this logic would not hold up: There are no military rules or regulations against the kinds of drugs Trump is talking about. In fact, the Navy has recently changed its rule preventing people on prescription medication for depression and anxiety from serving as pilots. Most other restrictions on prescription drugs for certain types of service members have been relaxed, according to the Washington Post. And according to Bloomberg News , the Pentagon has said it will pay for all medically necessary medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In the interview, Trump also repeated a line of reasoning he’s trotted out before: complaining about the cost of health care for transgender people. Morgan challenged Trump on the cost of the hormone drugs, arguing they were “minuscule” when put in perspective with the entire military’s budget. Trump responded by focusing instead on the costs of the sex reassignment surgery. “The recovery period is long, and they have to take large amounts of drugs after that for whatever reason,” Trump said. “So I said, yeah, when it came time to make a decision on that and because of the drugs and also because of the cost of the operation.” According to the Pentagon’s comptroller, the military spent roughly $44 billion on health care costs in 2018. Between 2016 and February of this year, the military spent about $8 million on medical services for transgender people. In April, a version of the transgender ban that Trump first proposed in a 2017 tweet finally took effect , after a number of court challenges (several of which are still moving forward). While the policy is not technically a blanket ban, those diagnosed with gender dysphoria and taking hormones or those who have already transitioned medically are not allowed to enlist. While service members who were already undergoing hormone treatments or sex reassignment surgery would be grandfathered into continued medical care, those who have not are mandated to follow the military’s rules for their sex assigned at birth or risk being discharged. The effect, transgender rights advocates have argued, is in practice a full ban. "
YouTube’s history of trying to make itself safer for kids.,slate.com,Ron Lyons Jr.,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/youtube-children-streaming-exploitation-history.html,"The New Black Mirror Asks How Much Personality a Smart Speaker Should Have On Monday, YouTube announced a handful of policy changes that affect how younger minors use the platform. Children under 13 will no longer be able to livestream on YouTube without an adult clearly present in order to “limit the risk of exploitation.” The Google-owned company, which already bans younger children from having their own accounts, will also limit how the platform recommends videos “featuring minors in risky situations,” a move that YouTube says will rely on “new artificial intelligence classifiers” to identify such content. This comes on the heels of a shocking report in the New York Times that described how YouTube’s recommendation algorithm essentially curated strings of videos of barely clothed children, amplifying their reach and making them easily available to pedophiles. In one case, a 10-year-old girl in Brazil uploaded a video in which she is playing with her friend in bathing suits; once promoted by YouTube, the video was watched 400,000 times. The safety of younger users has been an issue on YouTube—and social media in general—for years, but YouTube’s attempts to address this problem might be less familiar than the work done by Facebook and Twitter to deal with objectionable content. YouTube’s efforts illustrate just how difficult it is to insulate children from inappropriate behavior on the web, whether through software or through human moderation, and particularly at YouTube’s massive scale. February 2015: YouTube introduces YouTube Kids, meant to be a safe version of the platform for young users. It has parental controls, educational content, and limitations on what can be uploaded and searched. In the years since, however, the service’s kid-friendly bubble has been punctured by conspiracy-themed content and worse. November 2017 : In what became known as the “ Elsagate ” controversy, seemingly kid-friendly videos on YouTube Kids turned out to include disturbing scenes. In one of the most notorious examples, Elsa from the movie Frozen is impregnated by Spider-Man. The controversy led to tighter rules about how videos featuring children’s characters could be uploaded and monetized, and the deletion of channels and videos that violated these rules. February 2019 : Amid a controversy in which pedophiles swarmed the comments sections of children’s videos, a number of major advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Amazon, and Disney, pulled their business from YouTube. March 2019: YouTube disabled comments on many videos featuring children. While the company acknowledged that the move would disappoint some creators whose comment sections fostered productive discussions, “we also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the YouTube community.” a spokesperson for the platform told the Verge . YouTube’s struggles with abusive, exploitative, bigoted, and otherwise inappropriate content extend far beyond content aimed at kids, as another incident from just this week demonstrates. On Wednesday, YouTube announced it would remove thousands of hateful and extreme videos while tweaking the platform so that it is “raising up authoritative content, reducing the spread of borderline content and rewarding trusted creators.” As part of these actions, YouTube said it would demonetize videos by a prominent right-wing creator who repeatedly insulted the sexual orientation and Cuban American heritage of Carlos Maza, a journalist at Vox. Once again, a platform used by 2 billion people is playing a familiar children’s game: whack-a-mole."

Charmin’s Forever Roll is a good model for single-sized products.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/charmin-forever-roll-single-living-alone-products.html,"A Woman Says I “Assaulted” Her After Totally Normal Dating Behavior. Did I? Despite the fact that the oldest millennials are now approaching 40, it seems as if companies have only just begun learning how to market to them. From using models to casually co-opt protest imagery appealing to the socially conscious Youth to the chronic mis- and overuse of the slang term of the day (which is mostly a watering down of black vernacular, but that’s another story), the relationship between millennials and marketing has largely been one of misunderstanding on one side and mockery on the other. Enter: the Charmin Forever Roll. While the product technically launched back in April, it was brought to wider attention by a Wall Street Journal article examining the ways companies are adapting to the fact that more Americans are living alone than ever before. Designed with those Americans in mind, the Forever Roll is a giant roll of toilet paper that purports to last up to one month. While that’s technically not forever, it is much longer than the average roll of toilet paper makes it and, most importantly, doesn’t require one to use up precious storage space on a 24-pack. The Forever Roll comes in a pack of three and even has its own starter kit, which includes a free-standing, brushed–stainless steel roll holder designed for its large size. As the Cut’s Gabriella Paiella wrote, “As far as silly millennial-targeted marketing goes, this is pretty spot on—we live alone in small rentals because we can’t afford to buy real estate, we’re constantly working so we have limited time to run errands, and we LOVE using the bathroom.” Having three months of toilet paper on deck would solve a multitude of millennial ills, from errand paralysis to the phenomena of “outsourcing adulthood.” No need to Postmates toilet paper with the Forever Roll! In fact, more industries should take a cue from Charmin’s absolute unit of toilet paper and roll out their own single-adult household version of products. One of the hardest parts of living alone, besides having to figure out how to humanely dispose of mice , is shopping for an appropriate amount of household staples. According to the Wall Street Journal piece, the market has responded to that in the food space by creating more single-serve items like pre-mixed salad kits or whatever a Jimmy Dean “Simple Scramble” is. But that solution is not only wasteful with packaging, it also skips right over the easier option: just scale everything down! At first glance, the Forever Roll seems to do the opposite; but by minimizing the amount of storage space one might need for three months’ worth of toilet paper, it performs a truly admirable duty of which more industries should take note. The food industry should lead the pack. It is nigh impossible to cook for one without some sort of guilt-inducing food waste. To take a leaf out of the Forever Roll’s book, mainstream, normal-store brands should start offering half loaves of bread or single sprigs of fresh herbs, and the ability to buy three stalks of celery for that chicken soup recipe. Quality ground spices, which are not only expensive but start losing their flavor a lot sooner than most people realize, should come in half-sizes. Otherwise the single amateur chef is stuck with the option of seasoning their paprikash with dusty paprika or tossing out half-used containers every six months. (Yes, I realize I could always go to a specialty bulk spice store and get any amount of Hungarian paprika that I want or go to a bakery and get a half-loaf of bread, but that just tacks on more stops to a grocery-store run that I barely wanted to make in the first place. And while specialty stores are plentiful for me as a denizen of New York City, they aren’t necessarily convenient options for a lot of people who live outside of metropolitan areas.) It’s not enough for brands to just offer a smaller size. They also need to end the tyranny of the bulk purchase, which makes buying things like laundry detergent and yes, toilet paper, much cheaper if you’re buying for a household. Sure, I can currently buy a small bottle of olive oil or salad dressing, but the price per ounce is much steeper than if I bought its larger cousins. To that end, I’m willing to lay the blame of Americans leading the world in food waste partially on the fact that it’s much cheaper to just buy more. Why get one banana for $0.50 when a whole bunch of them only costs $1.50? In our current market paradigm, more is quite literally less. But the Forever Roll suggests a shifting tide, not toward new “innovations” that require more plastic packaging, but toward smartly portioned products that actually makes sense for the “ party for one ” more and more of us are throwing these days.

"In Late Night, Mindy Kaling draws on her history, from being a “diversity hire” on The Office to running The Mindy Project.",slate.com,Inkoo Kang,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/late-night-mindy-kaling-movie-the-office-diversity-hire.html,"Ma Is the Best Kind of Trash This post contains mild spoilers for Late Night . In 2017, during the press tour for A Wrinkle in Time , Reese Witherspoon recalled a conversation she’d had with co-star Mindy Kaling. “Don’t you ever get exhausted by always having to create your own roles?” Witherspoon had asked Kaling. “Reese,” came the reply, “ I’ve never had anything that I didn’t create for myself .” While born of necessity, this has given Kaling uncommon control over her projects and screen image, and it’s revealing to look closely at what she’s chosen to do with it. After nearly a decade and a half in the public eye playing a ditzy chatterbox on The Office and a chirpy sociopath on The Mindy Project , Kaling finally seems to settle for the ingenue role in Late Night , her first feature in which she plays a major starring part. (She wrote and produced the movie, which was directed by Nisha Ganatra.) Her character, a newbie comedy writer named Molly Patel, is the kind of relatable underdog certain fans have wanted to see the writer-actress inhabit for years. Late Night suggests that Kaling is as fascinated as ever not by the girl next door but by powerful, unruly women—and the unconventional love stories befitting their willful, idiosyncratic selves. But the film may be most notable for its summation of the thinking and rethinking that Kaling has done about her 15 years in Hollywood—and how to fight to change it. Like The Devil Wears Prada , Late Night is an odd-couple comedy about two women—a jaded icon and a naïve upstart—who discover that they work far better together than apart. Emma Thompson stars as Katherine Newbury, the improbably female, English, and high-minded host of a network late-night talk show that debuted in the early ’90s and never bothered to change with the times. When a resentful underling points out to the long-coasting Katherine that she doesn’t have a single woman in her writers room, a haphazard search leads to the snap hiring of Molly, a comedy superfan with zero writing experience. Unlike most of her new colleagues, Molly is not only a woman but a person of color with a non–Ivy League education from rural America, living with her aunt and uncle in an outer borough. Plucky and just a little bit dowdy, she couldn’t be more just-moved-to-the-city-to-pursue-her-dreams if she tried. We’ve seen dozens of protagonists like starry-eyed Molly, but many of the specifics that set Molly apart come from Kaling’s own origin story. Kaling first caught the entertainment industry’s attention by starring as Ben Affleck—yes, you read that correctly—in a play she co-wrote called Matt & Ben , about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck chancing upon the screenplay of Good Will Hunting . (It literally falls from the sky and into their laps .) But her big break came when she was hired for the writers room of The Office through NBC’s diversity program . This formative period in Kaling’s career provides much of the basis for Late Night , as well as the “diversity hire” label whose stigma Kaling contends with so many years later. “I’d rather be a diversity hire than a nepotism hire,” Molly tells naysayer and head monologue writer Tom (Reid Scott), who Kaling has essentially acknowledged is a stand-in for Kaling’s ex-boyfriend B.J. Novak . (Novak was a similarly intimidating Harvard Lampoon alumnus in The Office writers room when the two met.) “At least I had to beat out every other woman and minority to get here. You just had to be born.” Kaling has made similar statements in interviews. There was a time when she thought, “If you’re funny, it’s funny and you’ll get noticed. But that isn’t true,” she told Deadline. “ If you don’t know the right people to get into the rooms, you will just never be seen .” Complaints from Molly’s new co-workers, like “It’s a hostile environment to be an educated white male” and “I wish I could be a woman of color so I could get any job I want with zero qualifications” are met with similar rebuttals. Molly eventually reframes her differences, as well as Katherine’s, as advantages, guiding the host to play up the facts of her femaleness, her age, and her white privilege.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. But Kaling doesn’t speak only through Molly. When Molly hits setbacks, she’s advised by several kindly mentors to replace her protests with hard work: “If you want people to see you as something other than a diversity hire, you have to make them.” It’s instruction Kaling herself has given in her book Why Not Me? : “I don’t understand how you could have self-confidence if you don’t do the work,” she writes. “ Confidence is like respect; you have to earn it .” Indeed, as the movie goes on, it becomes clear that Kaling is as interested in critiquing Molly as in having viewers see themselves in her. If viewers mistake Kaling as identifying only with the character she’s playing, and expecting others to do the same, well, it wouldn’t be the first time. While Kaling’s breakthrough role was as Kelly Kapoor on The Office , it was as the star and creator of The Mindy Project that she created a truly groundbreaking comic id, the devilishly narcissistic Mindy Lahiri—then had the character wildly misunderstood as an incompetently written everywoman. In an essay on “ the female bad fan ,” New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum bemoaned the viewers who took The Mindy Project ’s rom-com trappings to mean that its protagonist was, like those of most romantic comedies, an aspirational or familiar figure. Kaling told Nussbaum that she thought playing a female version of Michael Scott, on which Lahiri was based, would be more “fun.” With Molly, similarly, Kaling seems less invested in bridging an identification with the audience than in mocking Molly’s earnestness and teaching her a more nuanced view of the beneficiaries of privilege. Kaling pokes gentle fun at the trope of that “absurdly confident newcomer” who tactlessly tells her new employer exactly what’s wrong with her show, and Molly learns that men like Tom might have literally inherited their TV writing jobs from their fathers, but aren’t necessarily untalented. Kaling also seems to be satirizing a certain type of social justice warrior—or at least the stereotype of one—by having Molly tell her co-workers that she’s “marginalized by the iron first of white privilege.” Molly is our entry-point character, and while she has legitimate gripes, the character quickly comes to feel like a repository for all the reasons Kaling has never seemed interested in playing roles like this one. And if viewers still don’t get the message, well, she’s speaking to them through the movie’s other protagonist, a character whom Kaling admits she identifies with just as much as she does with Molly . You can hear Kaling bristling at critics of The Mindy Project in a rant she has Katherine direct at Molly, about “an absurdly confident newcomer coming in, criticizing my show, and giving me her assessment of my comedic persona, without doing the hard work of presenting me with solutions.” Kaling may have started out in Hollywood as a Molly, but she’s become something closer to a Katherine."
NBA Finals: How Warriors can claw their way back and beat the Raptors.,slate.com,Nick Greene,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/warriors-raptors-nba-finals-how-to-win.html,"Congress Must Act Now to Do What’s Right: Banning Kevin Durant From the NBA Finals The Toronto Raptors may be new to the NBA Finals, but they aren’t naive. They had no pity for a depleted Warriors team on Wednesday and beat the defending champs 123-109 to take a 2-1 series lead. With Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson (oh, and Kevon Looney) out, Splash Only Child Steph Curry attempted to win the game by himself. He managed to put up 47 points, but the Raptors did more than enough to keep Curry at arms’ length (normal, human-sized arms; not little velociraptor arms.) Golden State has overcome a two-games-to-one Finals deficit before, but that was in 2015 against the Matthew Dellavedova-led Cleveland Cavaliers. The Raptors are playing their best basketball of the season at the best possible time, and it’s going to take a little more than Curry’s one-man band to turn this series around. Specifically, it will take six things. 1. Klay Thompson has less than 48 hours for his hamstring strain to heal before Friday’s pivotal Game 4. I’m no doctor, but pacing around on a hurt leg will probably accelerate the process. This is a good sign. Klay itching to get in pic.twitter.com/xZGkdH3ASB — NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) June 6, 2019 2. Kevin Durant suffered a calf injury in the 2019 Western Conference Finals, which I believe were played around 50 years ago. He should start pacing, STAT. 3. Steph was great in Game 3 and went 17-31 from the field. If he made all 31 of his shots, however, the Warriors would have won. That’s something to consider for Friday. 4. The Raptors’ bench has been a big factor. Backup point guard Fred VlanVleet scored 11 points on Wednesday and sealed the win with a ridiculous heave that nearly kissed Golden State’s banners. VanVleet from JURASSIC PARK! pic.twitter.com/mRatlaq8YX Yeah, uh, don’t let him do that. 5.

Only fifteen inches away, outside the confines of the fourth wall, the silhouette of the writer stared at the slowly-growing Slate post. Although he was neither an albino nor a priest, he could probably have used a little more sun and a little less guilt. The pseudo-albino doom-and-gloomster drew the mouse pointer across the screen and aimed it directly at the delete button. “I should not have chosen this conceit.” His accent was not easy to place, because he was typing, not speaking out loud. “No one who wants to know about an NBC adaptation of a Dan Brown novel will be interested in a parody of Dan Brown’s prose, and no one who is interested in a parody of Dan Brown’s prose will be interested in knowing about NBC’s upcoming adaptation of a Dan Brown novel.” The click of a touchpad echoed hollowly through the gallery. The writer glanced down at the touchpad, almost amused. A misfire. He reached for an external mouse, but then seemed to reconsider, smirking calmly at the calm, smirking sentences that would never be appear on Slate. “My work here is done.” Then he was gone. Alone now, NBC staggered to its feet and turned its gaze to the publish button. It was trapped, and the writer was unlikely to keep a local copy of such an ephemeral and mediocre piece of writing. Even so, the great gripping fear that now gripped it was gripping it with a greater grip than the great fear of deletion had ever managed to grip it greatly with. I must secure advance publicity for the upcoming NBC series based on The Lost Symbol . Rising painfully to its feet, NBC thought of the television shows which had come before The Lost Symbol … of the mission which they had all been entrusted. An unbroken chain of promotional opportunities . Shivering, it pulled itself to its feet. I must find some way … It was trapped within an unpublished blog post, and there existed only one button on earth that would allow it to escape. NBC glanced up at the borders of its opulent Word for Mac window. Wincing in pain, the network summoned all of its faculties and strength until it was standing on its own two feet. The desperate task before it, it knew, would require stretching the post’s conceit well beyond coherence, well beyond the fourth wall, beyond entertainment news itself, deep into the realms of mystery and divinity.

Conan: Sophie Turner stopped by to promote Dark Phoenix but slapped Conan in the face instead.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/culture/2019/06/conan-obrien-sophie-turner-dark-phoenix-slap-drinking-game-crispin-glover.html,"Why Atheists and Agnostics Should Embrace Today’s Gospel Music In an earlier age of show business, showing up on a talk show and then physically assaulting the host was a quick way to get yourself branded a Crispin-Glover-style eccentric .Fortunately for Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner—and unfortunately for Conan O’Brien—those days are over. Turner stopped by Conan with a bottle of tequila and talked him into playing a “drinking game” with the following rules: 1. Play begins as Conan O’Brien takes a shot of tequila. 2. Sophie Turner then absolutely wallops O’Brien with an open-handed slap to the left cheek, spattering tequila across his chin and sending shock waves through his pompadour. 3. A visibly shaken Conan O’Brien drinks bunch of tequila from the bottle. Watch and wince: As nice as it would be to believe that Sophie Turner just dreamed “Tequila Slaps” up as a “Hertz Donut”-type ploy to slap the shit out of Conan O’Brien, the game is at least slightly better-documented than “ The Devil’s Triangle ”; it appears in a promotional clip for the 2015 Vince Vaughn comedy Unfinished Business . But there’s no sense getting bogged down in the details of who invented what when to slap whom: The important thing is that Sophie Turner found a way to pummel a talk show host on his own show, and still managed to get him to play the clip from Dark Phoenix she was there to promote. In Turner’s honor, and in honor of the barrier she slapped her way through tonight, Slate is proud to present the trailer for River’s Edge , the movie that sent Crispin Glover on his disastrous promotional visit to The Late Show With David Letterman so many years ago: He was truly a man ahead of his time.

Billion Dollar Bully highlights why Yelp feels unfair.,slate.com,Stephen Harrison,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/billion-dollar-bully-documentary-yelp.html,"You Have a Moral Obligation to Review Businesses on Yelp (Sometimes) The overall argument of Billion Dollar Bully , the new documentary about Yelp released on Amazon and iTunes in May, is that Yelp extorts small business owners for advertising fees in return for helping to manage and improve reviews on their platform. Earnest and fiery throughout, the film allows the aggrieved parties ample time to vent. The film opens, for example, with Davide Cerretini, owner of a San Francisco Italian restaurant, who claims that Yelp’s salespeople called him 20 times a week pressuring him to advertise on the platform. He finally acquiesced and agreed to a six-month contract, which he did not renew. Once he stopped paying for advertising, Cerretini claims his positive reviews vanished, only to be replaced with new and mysterious negative reviews. “To me, it’s mafia,” Cerretini says in the film. In another example, Danny Teran describes how his Brooklyn restaurant was falsely accused of inflating its Yelp reviews and had their page marked with a “consumer alert” pop-up , a digital scarlet letter that turned off potential customers. When he tried to call Yelp, there was no ability to speak to a human representative from the company about the issue—unless he was interested in buying Yelp ads. “There is nothing you can do!” says an exasperated Teran. Yelp has fought back against the allegations made in the film, arguing that “There has never been a connection between ratings and reviews on Yelp and buying advertising.” After the film’s release, Jason Brown at ReviewFraud.org suggested that at least some examples of extortion presented in the film were dubious. But the issue for small business owners has always been broader than advertising: Local businesses feel that Yelp offers no due process to resolve disputes and misunderstandings. That’s because the company’s standard position is to absolve itself of any responsibility to get involved. The documentary includes a clip from a 2013 interview on The Charlie Rose Show in which Yelp’s co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman claims his company is “just like Wikipedia—it’s open to all comers.” Presumably Stoppelman means that both sites use a crowdsourcing model to aggregate information. But even a cursory review shows that Yelp and Wikipedia are not all that similar. Yelp is a publicly traded company that earns revenue from online advertising, whose name stems from an amalgamation of “yellow pages” and “help.” On the other hand, Wikipedia is a project of the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation that relies on user donations (which is why from time to time the site displays those pesky black-and-yellow banners asking you to support the site for the price of a cup of coffee). Yelp and Wikipedia also differ dramatically in their approach to facts. In Yelp’s case, the company prefers not to get involved at all. A spokesperson for Yelp told me in an email that “We don’t take sides in factual disputes, so in these cases, we recommend that businesses use Yelp’s free response tools to respond and address that review, stating the facts and their company policy.” Unless the review is found to violate Yelp’s terms of service or content guidelines , it’s likely to remain on the site. If someone leaves an inaccurate review, Yelp recommends that the owner use Yelp’s “free response tools” to address that review. Needless to say, this isn’t very comforting to local businesses. The film features Dawn King, a registered nurse, who claimed a former employee left a fake review on the Yelp page for the medical office of Dr. David H.C. King, a urologist, as retaliation for being terminated. In the review, the ex-employee claimed that King had botched her surgery (an event that never happened). Yelp’s standard position that the business should work it out with the reviewer is unlikely to be successful in cases such as this, where one party is clearly acting in bad faith. (Note: It appears Yelp has now removed the fake review of Dr. King for violating the site’s terms of service.) While Yelp generally absolves itself of factual disputes, Wikipedia sits at the other extreme: The community of Wikipedia editors famously debates the facts 24/7/365 . (The nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation supports the community volunteers and provides the technology for hosting Wikipedia and Wikimedia sites but does not directly involve itself in editorial policy, which is self-policed by the community of volunteer editors.) And there is general willingness within the Wikipedia community to delete obvious falsehoods and vandalism. When actress Doris Day’s page was defaced with a graphic image shortly after her death in May, the issue was resolved within a few minutes. Wikipedia’s processes and policies do not always work perfectly , of course, but the site is committed to building a neutral and informative encyclopedia, and that means bad information simply must come down. When I contacted Yelp about the claims made in the documentary, a spokesperson told me that the company used several tools to detect illegitimate reviews: automated recommendation software , human moderators who work full-time on the Yelp support team, and functionality for users to flag suspicious content. The company is especially proud of its automated software. A spokesperson said in an email, “Our recommendation software has always been engineered to surface the most useful and reliable reviews, and has been improved over time to be even more effective at sifting fake and biased reviews, and attempts by businesses to game the system.” What do we expect from internet knowledge platforms when it comes to informational accuracy? But notice how Yelp does not promise that a small business owner can speak to a Yelp representative or appeal to any sort of third-party arbitrator about taking down a fake review. This is likely cost-driven. Adding a formal process to consider contentious reviews would be highly expensive for the company, which has been publicly traded since 2012. The documentary also highlights how Yelp is virtually invulnerable to lawsuits. The company’s terms require that all claims be brought in the state and federal courts of San Francisco, which is challenging for out-of-state and international plaintiffs. Furthermore, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act generally protects internet companies from being sued for content they host for which they haven’t assumed responsibility. In sum, a local business that has been damaged from a false review has little recourse from Yelp itself, nor via the traditional legal system, and no ability to opt out of the platform. It’s little wonder the small business owners interviewed in Bully appear so dejected. Yelp is combating the claims made in the film by purchasing the domain BillionDollarBully.com and redirecting it to a Yelp page that explains that the company does not extort local businesses to manipulate ratings. A company spokesperson told me that the extortion conspiracy theory has been disproven by independent scholarly studies, including one by Harvard Business School . (The film notes the limitations of the HBS study, which focused specifically on the Boston metropolitan area.) Yelp has also launched a Google Ad campaign to “educate people” about the allegations made in the documentary. Speaking of Google … I reached out to Bully ’s director, Kaylie Milliken, to ask a question that wasn’t specifically addressed in the film: If people shouldn’t use Yelp, what site should they use instead? I have written before about a “ duty to Yelp ” by writing online reviews for small businesses, but even in that piece, I clarified that I wasn’t wedded to Yelp as the platform. Did Milliken have a better recommendation, perhaps Google Reviews or TripAdvisor? Milliken demurred. “It’s hard to be a legitimate review site when you have a fiduciary duty to investors,” she said, noting the tension companies face between generating advertising revenue and keeping costs low. Milliken also challenged me to consider why we need online reviews at all. “I think it’s important to get off the computer and just experience things for yourself or ask for recommendations from trusted members of your community,” Milliken said. While I admire the humanism of this approach, it seems a bit idealistic. Many of us do get much of our information online, usually for expediency, but also because it’s not always practicable or comfortable to ask a close friend—for example, while traveling to a new city or researching a new doctor. Instead of unplugging from all review sites, we might reconsider what we expect from internet knowledge platforms when it comes to informational accuracy. Taking further responsibility contradicts Yelp’s standard position, as expressed to me by their spokesperson and voiced repeatedly in the documentary: We do not get involved in factual disputes . But washing their hands of responsibility for misinformation may not be a viable long-term solution for Yelp or similar websites. A combination of factors might ultimately spur a change: revisions to Section 230 of the CDA , government regulation of online speech , further public outcry, or a renewed sense of corporate and digital citizenship. Until then, allegations that Yelp’s system is unfair will continue."
"Catholic Church Reimbursed U.S. Bishop Who Paid $350,000 to Clergy After Wild Tales of Sex, Drugs, and Luxury Living",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/catholic-church-west-virginia-sexual-abuse-vatican-scandal-bransfield.html,"Trump, a True Student of History, Suggests U.S. and Ireland’s Border Situations Aren’t All That Different Really ,The Catholic Church always provides good fodder for Hollywood-like thrillers, that is the inner workings of the church often include the fundamental elements of a good cinematic tale, namely: sex, drugs, money, and, inevitably, a cover-up. A new Washington Post investigation in to the church has everything Hollywood could hope for, implicating a former Catholic bishop in West Virginia who spent millions on a lavish lifestyle in one of the poorest states in the country and gave away as much as $350,000 in gifts to clergy before being ousted from the church in September amidst claims of sexual abuse and financial impropriety. Nine men in the Wheeling-Charleston diocese accused Bishop Michael Bransfield of groping, kissing or exposing himself to them or commenting on their bodies. The hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash gifts from Bransfield were given to young priests he is accused of mistreating, as well as to powerful cardinals in the U.S. and the Vatican itself. The details of Bransfield’s misconduct were outlined in a confidential internal Vatican investigation following Bransfield’s resignation last fall. The instances of abuse, reported by the Post, are staggering:
There were “troubling hugs” from Bransfield, the seminarians and young priests told investigators. On some of these occasions, they alleged, Bransfield appeared to be intoxicated. Others said he warned them not to “get fat.” One said Bransfield slapped him on the buttocks at Castel Gandolfo in Italy, the summer residence of the pope… One seminarian recalled sitting on Bransfield’s lap, being kissed by the bishop and thinking: “I either do this, or I have to completely reinvent my life.” Bransfield asked him to take his pants off, but he refused, the seminarian told investigators. The seminarian later suffered an emotional breakdown and became deeply depressed, the report says. The report went on to detail what appeared to be hush money to victims and payments to senior church figures. The final report on the matter, however, at the behest of the archbishop overseeing the investigation William Lori of Baltimore, edited out the names of the 11 clerics, including Lori himself, who were the recipients of Bransfield’s largesse. Lori told the Post the names were cut because including them, he said, “could inadvertently and/or unfairly suggest that in receiving gifts for anniversaries or holidays there were expectations for reciprocity.” “Bransfield wrote at least 565 checks that were recorded as ‘gifts’ and made out to the clerics by name. The documents obtained by The Post do not make clear why Bransfield gave the gifts, though the recipients of the largest amounts were among the most influential members of the Catholic Church, clerics whose opinions carry weight with the Vatican,” according to the Post. “The gifts came as a succession of younger male clerical assistants complained to church officials in West Virginia that Bransfield was sexually harassing them. “ The hundreds of checks were written by Bransfield from his personal account and then reimbursed by the West Virginia diocese, a legally dubious move for the church, which operates as a tax-exempt nonprofit that is required to use the money for charitable ends. “[Bransfield’s] compensation was increased by an amount that covered the gifts, plus the tax burden that resulted from the increased compensation, a practice known as ‘grossing up,’ according to the report and emails among top diocesan officials,” according to the Post. The Vatican report found that Bransfield’s engaged in pattern of indulgence and abuse. From the Post:
Bransfield spent $2.4 million in church money on travel, much of it personal, which included flying in chartered jets and staying in luxury hotels, according to the report. Bransfield and several subordinates spent an average of nearly $1,000 a month on alcohol, it says. The West Virginia diocese paid $4.6 million to renovate Bransfield’s church residence after a fire damaged a single bathroom. When Bransfield was in the chancery, an administrative building, fresh flowers were delivered daily, at a cost of about $100 a day — almost $182,000 in all. Bransfield, 75, drew on a source of revenue that many parishioners knew little about, oil-rich land in Texas donated to the diocese more than a century ago. He spoke of church money as if it were his to spend without restriction, according to the report. Bansfield, who was also found to abuse alcohol, oxycodone, and other prescription drugs, denied the allegations of sexual abuse and activity with young priests, as well as financial abuse, telling investigators that church aides oversaw the extravagant renovations of his residence and that it was back problems that prompted his luxurious travel because it made him unable to fly economy."
"Trump, while in Ireland, suggests U.S. and Ireland’s border situations aren’t all that different really.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/trump-ireland-visit-controversy-hard-border-wall-brexit-varadkar-nailed-it.html,"The Ruling Against a Cop Accused of a Horrific Body Cavity Search Is a Rare Victory for Police Accountability President Donald Trump is in Europe this week and he didn’t forget to pack his deep reservoir of understanding of global affairs. During a meeting with the Irish prime minister on Wednesday, Trump, on cue, brought up his favorite topic: walls, particularly ones that are built on the borders of nation-states. Ireland, you’ll remember, has dealt with decades of political violence over the partition of Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland. More recently, the possibility of a so-called hard border reemerging on the island between the two has inflamed old tensions while generating new ones, threatening to derail the U.K.’s Brexit negotiations. Trump dealt with those delicate political and historical matters as tactfully as a presidential bowling ball during sit down meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who the Guardian described as being “visibly uncomfortable” as his country’s politics were strapped to the locomotive of the Trump Train. “I think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,” he said at a joint press conference. “I mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it’s going to work out very well here.” The Irish prime minister quickly interjected, to be clear he and Trump were talking about the same Ireland: “One thing we want to avoid, of course, is a wall or border between us [in Ireland].” “I think you do, I think you do,” Trump replied, totally getting it. “The way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that’s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I’m sure it’s going to work out very well. I know they’re focused very heavily on it. … There are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it and it’s going to be just fine. It ultimately could even be very, very good for Ireland. The border will work out.” “The Irish government has mounted an intense, three-year diplomatic effort arguing the opposite, that Brexit threatens peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland,” the Guardian notes. “Addressing the media after Trump’s departure, Varadkar said he explained the history of the border and the Troubles in their private meeting.” Another classic case of Trump absolutely nailing it on the first go."

Trump may not have gotten his own personal *chef kiss* version of it yet, but a new Department of Homeland Security directive shows the Trump administration is doing its best to gussy up its pet project. CBS News reports that in an email to lawmakers Wednesday, DHS said that American troops will be deployed for a month to paint a mile-long portion of said barrier in the California border town of Calexico in order to, among other things, improve its “aesthetic appearance.” Democratic leaders were not impressed by the move. “These are soldiers, they are not painters,” Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, told CBS News.

$2 a day? Inside the fight to define extreme poverty in America.,slate.com,,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/business/2019/06/2-dollars-a-day-poverty-america-research.html,"Inside the Fight to Define Extreme Poverty in America How many Americans live on $2 a day? An ongoing debate just got more complicated. June 05, 2019 11:05 PM Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by NeONBRAND on Unsplash and Jeremy Yap on Unsplash. The idea that many Americans might be living on less than $2 a day once sounded almost impossible; that was supposed to be what poverty meant in the developing world, not a rich nation like the United States. But in a wildly influential 2013 study , two sociologists upended that assumption: Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer showed that by 2011, there were 1.6 million U.S. households with children that, for at least part of the year, had cash incomes that put them below the $2 per person mark. The number had risen from 636,000 in 1996—a 152.9 percent increase. Advertisement Edin and Shaefer later turned their paper into an acclaimed book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing In America , that documented the lives of families mired in this kind of extreme poverty. In a New York Times review, the famed sociologist William Julius Wilson called it “essential” and a “call to action.” Their work inspired follow-on research by Nobel Prize–winning economist Angus Deaton. Bernie Sanders took to quoting them on the campaign trail. The pair’s findings on the growth of extreme poverty also became an important data point in the argument over the legacy of welfare reform. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton teamed up with Republicans in Congress to end the federal government’s old, often vilified program that gave cash directly to poor families. They replaced it with a system designed to make unemployed parents go to work. Edin, today a professor at Princeton, and Shaefer, a professor at the University of Michigan, argued that this change destroyed a key part of the cash safety net, fueling the rise of $2-a-day destitution. Were they right? Edin and Shaefer’s eye-popping results have always been somewhat controversial, with critics— typically on the political right —arguing that they’re mostly a statistical illusion created by bad data. The debate has gone on for years in the pages of academic journals and white papers, with Edin and Shaefer countering detractors and refining their findings along the way. This week, though, a group of rival researchers released the most serious challenge to their work yet. Their paper uses newly available data to essentially double check and correct the government survey results Edin and Shaefer relied on. And, after all of their adjustments, $2-a-day poverty nearly disappears. It’s a convincing critique. But even as it makes a strong case that Edin and Shaefer’s most famous stats aren’t reliable, in some ways, the new study also supports the broader point of their book: The modern safety net seems to be fundamentally failing many families in America. Advertisement The U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be living in “deep” poverty if their income drops below half the official poverty line—about $10,100 or less for a family of three last year. Edin and Shaefer chose to look at $2-a-day poverty in their research instead, because they sensed some families were suffering from even more crushing deprivation. Edin had spent her career studying the financial lives of the very poor—in the 1990s she carefully documented how mothers on welfare stayed afloat. While doing field work in 2010, she noticed that there seemed to be a growing number of shockingly impoverished households with no source of cash income at all. “These families weren’t just poor by American standards,” she and Shaefer wrote in their book. “They were the poorest of the poor.” The fact that they specifically lacked cash was important: Many parents might have received SNAP benefits, aka food stamps, that helped them put meals on the table. But that wouldn’t help them pay for gas to get to work or let them buy clothes for their children. When Edin mentioned her observations to Shaefer, he decided to see if he could spot the trend of growing cashlessness in government data. But first, “he needed to determine what income threshold would capture people who were experiencing a level of destitution so deep as to be unthought-of in America.” He settled on $2 per person per day, the benchmark the World Bank had long used to delineate poverty in the developing world. This did, in fact, lead to some previously unthinkable results. In their original paper, Edin and Shaefer found that in 1996, the year Clinton signed his welfare reform bill into law, 1.7 percent of U.S. households with children were subsisting on $2 per person per day or less of cash income for at least part of the year. By 2011, the share had swelled to 4.3 percent. Even when they counted government benefits that were similar to cash—meaning SNAP, housing assistance, and refundable tax credits—as income, the share of families experiencing $2-a-day poverty still rose, albeit more modestly, from 1.1 percent in 1996 to 1.6 percent in 2011. Cashless poverty really did seem to be on the rise. Advertisement Now, these households were not experiencing the conditions of a Nigerian village or a Mumbai slum. But without dollars to spend, they were scraping the very bleak bottom of American life. In their book, published in 2015, Edin and Shaefer introduced readers to young adults who sold their own plasma to survive and flitted in and out of homelessness. “Rae moved in with her friend Danielle, herself a mother of three, and a group of other childhood friends who were sharing a house on a street where virtually every other property was burned-out,” they wrote of one single mother, who, by her 20s, had managed to lose all of her teeth. “When the water and power were shut off in that house and a woman was raped in the abandoned garage next door, she decided it wasn’t a safe place to raise a child.” This all fed into an emerging narrative about how Clinton’s welfare reform may have hurt some of America’s most vulnerable. Studies suggested that while the legislation may have helped reduce overall poverty a bit by nudging many single mothers into the workforce, the decision to cut some families off from a monthly check seemed to have increased the number of Americans living in deep poverty . By showing that $2-a-day poverty rose after 1996, Edin and Shaefer’s research added to the evidence that ending welfare as we knew it had left more Americans in truly dire need. Their work got attention. It also got pushback: Critics started questioning the data they were working from. Advertisement Most of our statistics on poverty come from surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. The kink in this system is that when the government asks, the very poorest Americans don’t always give accurate answers about their finances. They may forget that they receive SNAP benefits, or mix them up with another program. They might neglect to mention the extra money they make working odd jobs. The upshot of all this underreporting is that some people at the very bottom of the economic ladder may look worse off in the official numbers than they are in real life. This is a well-known issue. Edin and Shaefer tried to address it in their initial research by basing their analysis on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, or SIPP, which appeared to have less of a problem with underreporting than other datasets. They also pointed to other signs of extreme hardship that seemed to buttress their results, such as the growing number of SNAP recipients reporting zero income, or the growing ranks of homeless children in public schools. More recently, they’ve produced analysis showing that if you accounted for underreporting of benefits using commonly accepted techniques pioneered by the Urban Institute, $2 poverty still seemed to have grown. But critics have continued to suggest that their viral stat—that the share of families experiencing $2-a-day poverty grew by more than 150 percent after welfare reform—is really a product of the poor failing to report all of their income and government benefits. And the new paper makes the most persuasive case I’ve seen yet. It’s authored by a team led by Bruce Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy. Meyer is an expert on poverty data who is known for his pioneering research on underreporting in federal surveys. Because of this focus, his work tends to be embraced by conservatives, including the Trump administration’s economic team, but he is widely respected in his field. Here’s what makes Meyer’s new draft paper , which he conducted with the Census Bureau, so attention grabbing. It cross-checks the responses Americans gave when they participated in SIPP—the survey Edin and Shaefer relied on—in 2011, against the government’s actual administrative records showing what those same people earned and the federal benefits they received. Essentially, Meyer and his colleagues use Social Security Administration and IRS data, among other sources, to fact-check people’s descriptions of their own financial lives. Advertisement What they find is that, for the most part, Americans who reported living on $2 a day of income or less seemed to have more resources at their disposal than they let on. Correcting their earnings to match the Social Security Administration’s records alone lifts 55 percent of them above the $2 level; it lifts 38 percent of them out of deep poverty; and it lifts a quarter of them out of poverty altogether. Add in Social Security benefits, other income reflected in their tax files, housing assistance, and SNAP, and nearly 80 percent make it out of $2-a-day poverty. Bruce Meyer One frustrating thing about the paper is that, when it looks at families with children, it doesn’t define “income” in the same way Shaefer and Edin did, making its results slightly less reliable as a comparison. Whereas Edin and Shaefer analyzed how many parents were $2 poor if you only looked at their cash income and also analyzed how many were poor if you looked at their cash income as well as food stamps and some other government benefits, Meyer and his team always count the food stamps and other in-kind benefits as income. This makes it possible for Meyer to reduce the $2-a-day poverty rate to zero for parents. Using this approach with all Americans, they conclude the real rate is 0.24 percent, or about 285,000 households, most of which are single, childless adults. Bruce Meyer Advertisement There is another important difference in how Meyer and his team define the poor in their study. Specifically, researchers don’t consider any household to be in extreme poverty if they have significant assets (the fifth row on the chart above), such as $5,000 in liquid savings or $25,000 in home equity. That’s not unreasonable—after all, it’s hard to argue someone is living on $2 a day if they have significant money in the bank—but it makes it difficult to make an exact apples-to-apples comparison with Edin and Shaefer’s findings, which ignored savings. Either way, the paper sharply undercuts the idea that $2-a-day poverty rose because of welfare reform. If there were virtually no $2-a-day poor families in 2011, their numbers couldn’t have increased much since 1996, since there just aren’t that many of them. (Meyer and his team ran a similar exercise using $4-a-day poverty as their benchmark, and came to similar conclusions.) At the very least, it makes the case that the data Edin and Shaefer relied on had serious shortcomings that make it difficult to draw hard conclusions about the poorest of the poor. In their 2015 book, the two authors argued that the mere fact that a rising number of families were claiming to be living without cash was a cause for concern. But given how much income government surveys seem to miss, it’s at best a guess whether that increase is a sign that the poor have less money, or they’re just reporting having less money over time. ( Meyer has shown that underreporting of government benefits has gotten significantly worse over time, but the trend is less clear with income.) One upshot of all this is that Clinton’s welfare reform may have done less to harm the poorest of the poor than many commentators, myself included , previously thought. That’s not a definite conclusion: It’s possible that other studies showing that deep poverty rose after the law passed are still correct. But the evidence that the 1996 bill led to serious hardship is weaker than before. Meyer’s new paper is consistent with a different story, supported by other recent research : As the old cash welfare program disappeared, other parts of the safety net, most importantly food stamps, have stepped in and helped keep truly extreme poverty from growing. That should be a cautionary tale for conservatives who would like to reform other parts of the welfare state, like food stamps, by adding stricter limits and work requirements. The story here is that these parts provide essential help. Advertisement It’s also important to keep in mind a caveat about Meyer’s paper. Just because $2-a-day poverty might be a statistical artifact, that does not mean there aren’t a large number of families in truly dire circumstances in this country. Meyer and his team themselves write that while their “paper demonstrates that the rate of extreme poverty in the United States is substantially lower than what has been reported, we do not contend that there is little deprivation in the United States.” Their paper also may miss some of the worst cases of need; it excludes homeless people, for instance, who don’t show up in government surveys. Meanwhile, the Department of Education believes 1.35 million public school children lack homes. In some ways, it even confirms that Edin and Shaefer were on the right track when they argued that families without cash ready at hand are prone to special suffering. Meyer still finds that the roughly 1 million households lifted out of extreme poverty by benefits like food stamps—a group that includes most parents reporting $2-a-day incomes—suffer material hardships at much, much higher rates than the normal poor. They’re more likely to miss a rent payment or a bill, to have their power or phone service cut off, or to have difficulty getting enough to eat. There are many people who get some help from the government but still say they don’t have enough cash to live on. The safety net doesn’t seem to be doing enough to catch all of them—even if their suffering isn’t captured neatly in a viral stat. "

Jeopardy! champ Emma Boettcher is a delight to watch.,slate.com,Ruth Graham,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/emma-boettcher-jeopardy-champion-delight-to-watch.html,"“I’ll Take Second Place for $2,000” Chicago librarian Emma Boettcher made headlines on Monday when she ended James Holzhauer’s 32-game winning streak on Jeopardy! But history was not in her favor when she returned to defend the throne the next day. As Jeremy Samuel Faust noted in Slate earlier this week, a surprising number of so-called dragon slayers who took down the game’s longest-reigning champions have gone on to lose their very next games. When Alex Trebek introduced Boettcher’s second appearance on the show, he couldn’t resist reminding her of that history. “Remember, Nancy Zerg defeated Ken Jennings and lasted only one game,” the host said as he introduced the new champ. “Hmm …” It’s early days in the Boettcher era, but I love her already. She is no Nancy Zerg. She appeared totally unfazed by Trebek’s Debbie Downer introduction on Tuesday. She opened the game by choosing the category “Vowelless Bible Books” (“VWLSS BBL BKS”) and briskly claimed every answer in the category, earning an appreciative burst of applause from the audience.* “You know your vowelless Bible books, young lady,” Trebek chuckled. (She ran the first category on Wednesday, too.) Trebek chuckled again Tuesday when the “young lady” (Boettcher is 27) bet all her earnings on her first Daily Double. “Influenced by James, are we?” Boettcher’s face flickered ever so slightly with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. She won the Daily Double, and by the end of the first round, she had $14,200 on the board, more than four times the earnings of her nearest rival. There was a reason Boettcher may have been perplexed by Trebek’s suggestion that she was “influenced” by Holzhauer. First of all, betting it all on a Daily Double is a classic move, not one of Holzhauer’s several real innovations in gameplay. Boettcher felt confident about going all in—a move she also made in her first game—in part because she had calculated her own accuracy rate at home and knew the odds were with her. Why do I find Boettcher so endearing? Probably in part because she is not overtly charming. More to the point, Boettcher barely knew who Holzhauer was. Her first episode taped in March, and Holzhauer’s 32-game streak did not begin airing on television until April. ( Jeopardy! records episodes months before they air.) She found out about her competitor’s historic ongoing streak when she arrived on set, but she had not experienced the hubbub around it. “It was weird to be a daily watcher of Jeopardy! and somehow there’s this phenomenon that I’d never heard of,” she told the New York Times in an interview printed this week, accompanied by a photo of her smiling and holding a daisy. But Trebek returned multiple times in Boettcher’s second episode to the idea that she stood trembling in fear of Holzhauer. “How did you feel coming in to play against him?” the host asked during the contestant interview segment on Tuesday. Boettcher looked briefly stymied as he continued: “Were you intimidated, or did you just say, ‘Hey, I’m as good as anybody else?’ ” “Mostly the latter,” she said. Boettcher’s confidence is well-placed. She’s not just a trivia buff who got lucky. She wrote her capstone project for her master’s degree in information science on Jeopardy! clues, analyzing whether a computer could determine how difficult a clue was based on characteristics like clue length and number of noun phrases. Before receiving the call to appear on the show this year, she had auditioned four times in person, starting in high school. She trained, she told the Times, by standing a few feet from the television, “buzzing” on a toilet-paper holder for practice. That practice paid off when Boettcher beat the curse of the Jeopardy ! Dragon slayers in her first game after vanquishing Holzhauer. She didn’t land on either Daily Double in the second round, but she still ended the round with more than twice the cash of anyone else onstage, ensuring her victory even before the Final Jeopardy clue was announced. “This was a runaway game for Emma,” Trebek said as the game drew to a close. Boettcher flashed another modest smile. And then she won again on Wednesday, too. Why do I find Boettcher so endearing? Probably in part because she is not overtly charming. She sports a business-casual wardrobe and a no-fuss Dorothy Hamill wedge. She is not “ethereal, floating through the game with peerless grace,” as Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern wrote of Holzhauer. Holzhauer is a professional gambler who lives in Las Vegas; Boettcher is a university librarian in the Midwest. In her third game, on Wednesday, she flagged a bit in Double Jeopardy and did not secure her victory until the final question. She has worked tremendously hard to get where she is, trying out over and over and tracking her own scores at home for five years. And now she’s finally here, and she’s winning—$97,002 and counting. Her fourth episode airs Thursday.
Correction, June 6, 2019: This article originally misstated that Boettcher had earned $4,600 in the Vowelless Bible Books category. Some of that total was earned in other categories."
Julian Assange’s indictment could chill free speech without a court trial.,slate.com,Zachary Clopton,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/julian-assange-indictment-courts-fugitive-disentitlement-doctrine.html,"How You Can Tell Barr Is Lying About Mueller’s Evidence Last month, the Department of Justice entered a superseding indictment against Julian Assange for violations of the Espionage Act, a centuries-old law that prohibits the solicitation and dissemination of national defense secrets. First Amendment scholars were outraged, arguing that the prosecution would violate the Constitution. The whole enterprise of investigative journalism, they say, is under threat . Whether the prosecution violates the First Amendment is an important question, and those on both sides have so far assumed that the courts will eventually answer it. The assumption is that if the government is trying to suppress free speech in this case and others, courts can step in to protect it. But what if government officials could find ways to chill free speech without subjecting themselves to court supervision? The Trump administration may have found a way to do just that in the Assange case. For hundreds of years, Anglo-American courts have applied something called the “fugitive disentitlement doctrine,” which basically says that if a defendant flees a jurisdiction, then a court is not obligated to rule on that fleeing defendant’s petitions for relief. So, for example, you cannot jump bail but have your lawyer ask the court to dismiss the case against you. In recent years—going back to before the Trump administration—the Justice Department has been aggressively using this doctrine to deny individuals their day in court. For example, a little more than a decade ago, the DOJ tried to use the doctrine against Ali Hijazi , a Lebanese national living in Kuwait charged with conspiring with a military contractor to defraud the U.S. government. The indictment alleged offenses occurring entirely outside the United States, and Hijazi had only ever been to the United States once, years before the events in question. When Hijazi’s lawyers challenged the indictment, the judge agreed with the government that Hijazi must appear in person to get a hearing. To make matters worse, one of Hijazi’s claims was that stretching American law to cover events that took place wholly outside the United States violated due process, yet the court demanded that he surrender his liberty in order to vindicate that claim. Eventually a court of appeals reversed this decision, but the U.S. government has continued to invoke this doctrine in similar circumstances . There is also evidence that the government is increasingly pressing fugitive disentitlement in immigration and Freedom of Information Act cases . You cannot jump bail but have your lawyer ask the court to dismiss the case against you. That brings us back to the Assange case. Assange’s lawyers seemingly could challenge his indictment based on the First Amendment. The argument would be that the charged conduct—an alleged conspiracy to “obtain, receive and disclose national defense information” as part of the 2010 Chelsea Manning leak—was journalistic and therefore protected by the First Amendment. If past performance predicts future results, however, then we should expect the government to try to duck this challenge altogether. Instead of having to show that the prosecution is legal, DOJ lawyers would argue that Assange cannot challenge the case until he is in court in person—a prospect that, as a result of this new indictment, may not be in the cards anytime soon. (Assange has been arrested in London, but the British extradition treaty with the United States does not cover political offenses and he will likely argue that he is protected under this provision.) If Assange isn’t extradited and also not allowed to contest the Espionage Act charges because of the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, it could have damaging affects for the free speech of everyone. Indicting someone who cannot defend his free speech rights in court is the perfect way to chill the free speech of others. While Assange’s case is on indefinite hold, the specter of similar prosecutions will likely instill fear in journalists. Unless some journalists are willing to risk their own necks, then there isn’t a good way to figure out whether they would be constitutionally protected. In particular, this chilling effect might discourage journalists from publishing government secrets about issues of public concern that have a possible nexus to national security. These issues are not reasons to abolish the fugitive disentitlement doctrine altogether. It seems right that we don’t automatically let defendants flee the country but also continue to engage with the legal system on equal footing. Instead, the right response requires more scrutiny of when this doctrine is used. To begin with, the Justice Department should announce publicly what standard it applies to decide whether to ask a court to disentitle a defendant. If it does not, then Congress should demand an answer. Perhaps more importantly, it would been wholly inappropriate for the department to have treated the possibility of fugitive disentitlement as a factor weighing in favor of indictment. Maybe it was the right choice to indict Assange for Espionage Act violations while he was out of the country, but it would have been inappropriate to have done so because he could not fight back. The Justice Department should formally and publicly disavow this approach. Furthermore, there are at least two legal contexts in which fugitive disentitlement claims should be scrutinized closely. First, as in Hijazi’s case, we should be wary of fugitive disentitlement for prosecutions arising out of foreign acts and against foreign residents. At a minimum, if the territorial reach of a statute is in question, a court should think twice before dismissing such an objection on fugitive disentitlement grounds. Second, as in Assange’s case, we should be wary of fugitive disentitlement when the unchallengeable indictment itself offends the fundamental rights and liberties of third parties. Public policy favors allowing challenges to these potentially chilling indictments. It may be that the Espionage Act constitutionally criminalizes exactly the behavior of which Assange is accused. It is critical, though, that the courts allow us to find out for sure. Support our journalism

"GOP tweets Elizabeth Warren will raise taxes to increase the minimum wage, which is not how minimum wages work.",slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/business/2019/06/republicans-twitter-elizabeth-warren-taxes-minimum-wage-wow.html,"Emma Boettcher Is the Chill, No-Nonsense Jeopardy! Champ of My Heart So, the dark elves who run the Republican Party’s official Twitter account decided to tweet about Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign plans. See if you can spot the problem. Elizabeth Warren plans to give the gov't control of education, health care, & jobs. Her solution to pay for it:—Raise taxes to cancel student debt—Raise taxes to fund gov't-run health care—Raise taxes to increase min. wageEveryday Americans can't afford Warren's agenda. — GOP (@GOP) June 6, 2019 Raise taxes to increase the minimum wage? That … that is not how anything works. Anywhere. I mean, maybe in some hyperattenuated philosophical sense—a pay increase at McDonald’s might make your Big Mac more expensive, which is kind of like a tax hike if you squint at it in the right light, perhaps after a few glasses of wine and a puff on whatever is in your vape pen. But raising the minimum wage does not actually require taxing anybody. Certainly not everyday Americans. You could raise taxes to increase wage subsidies, like the earned income tax credit. But the minimum wage is literally just a minimum wage. The IRS is not involved. I am not the first person to notice this tweet. People have been mocking it at least since 11:14 p.m. last night. Yet it is still up. More than 5,000 people have liked it. And so I am left with questions. Are there actually living, breathing Republicans who believe the minimum wage is a tax hike? Are Republicans test-running some new anti–minimum wage messaging, where they’re just going to Trumpishly flout observable reality and insist it involves a tax increas? Does anybody at GOP social media HQ actually read the things they write? In related news, Tucker Carlson of all people is now saying nice things about Warren’s “economic nationalism” agenda, which he says sounds like “Trump at his best,” and maybe tells you something about the broad appeal of her ideas. Perhaps the GOP should stop offering her free advertising ? If they keep at it, their voters might recognize something they like."
Donald Trump ruining July 4 National Mall celebration.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/donald-trump-july-4-the-mall.html,"Trump Administration Says It Will Open New Mass Facility on Border to Hold Unaccompanied Migrant Children When I was 8 I got to to decide where my family would go on summer vacation. I chose Washington, D.C. over Disney World because I wanted to see the Declaration of Independence, which was an early sign of how popular I would be in high school. I also remember a White House tour, the Air and Space Museum, and a visit to Fort McHenry, where I got car sick. On July Fourth we sat on the National Mall for “A Capitol Fourth,” the music-and-fireworks celebration broadcast on PBS, then in its 12 th year. According to the papers , Henry Mancini performed, and I do remember being excited to see the composer of the Pink Panther theme, which was used at the time in commercials for fiberglass insulation. This paragraph is getting boring, let’s move on. In the summer of 2002, I worked as an intern in the Senate. The atmosphere in D.C. and the country was different than it had been when I went on my family trip. In 1990 the Berlin Wall had just fallen, while summer 2002 was less than a year removed from 9/11. The more destructive consequences of patriotism were evident elsewhere, but the “Capitol Fourth” still had its kitschy, light feeling. Aretha Franklin and Chuck Berry performed , and the event was hosted by Barry Bostwick, a classic Oh It’s That Guy actor who if I recall correctly performed some Broadway songs and laid on the cheese. In looking through records of other years I found musical guests ranging from Smokey Robinson to Gavin DeGraw to the Beach Boys to opera singer Renée Fleming, which speaks to how the evening of the Fourth may be as close as we’re going to come, as a country, to a unifying nonpartisan event that celebrates the entire country in a way that puts a smile on the faces of both red-state military families and blue-state ACLU donors. Or, it was. This year, the relevant officials say, Donald Trump is hijacking the planning of the National Mall festivities and giving a speech at the Lincoln Memorial . Trump’s address purportedly won’t be part of the “Capitol Fourth” concert itself, but seems likely to overshadow it given that he will be the first president to speak at the Mall celebration since 1951; according to the Washington Post he may also add a “second entertainment stage,” presumably for Ted Nugent. And if you’re hoping that maybe Trump is capable of not being an embarrassing partisan toad for just one night, consider that he’s currently in Normandy talking about his belittling nickname for Nancy Pelosi on Fox News against a literal backdrop of American service members’ graves .

Mexico tariff talks: The Mexican government still thinks it can reason with Trump.,slate.com,Le N Krauze,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/mexico-tariffs-trump-lopez-obrador.html,"Britain’s EU Elections Cleared Up Nothing About Brexit Over the past six months, Mexico’s new government has pretended not to hear Donald Trump’s anti-Mexican rhetoric. Nasty tweets have come and gone while Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who promised when he was running for president to push back against Trump’s affronts, has barely blinked. In late January, in an effort to promote the construction of his border wall, Trump compared Mexico to Afghanistan . “I’d rather not say anything at all,” López Obrador replied , with a coy smile. “I’m very respectful.” Indeed, he has been. Mexicans voters may have hoped that the more combative, populist López Obrador would finally stick up for his country after his predecessor Enrique Peña Nieto’s failed attempts to placate Trump. But the new president has not only completely refrained from taking on Trump’s nativist rhetoric in public, his administration has also agreed to many of Trump’s demands on immigration, including the controversial “Remain in Mexico” policy, whichallows the United States to send potential Central American refugees back to Mexico to wait out their asylum process in dire conditions and uncertainty. It has done so with just one thing in mind: protecting bilateral trade . It’s all been for naught. Last week, Trump announced a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods beginning Monday, June 10. The tariff is meant to intimidate the Mexican government into full compliance with U.S. demands on immigration, but the threat broke one of the relationship’s unspoken diplomatic rules—thou shall not use one area of the bilateral agenda to manipulate another. It also immediately shook Mexico’s government out of its cynical stupor. Within hours, López Obrador urgently dispatched Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard to Washington (where he had just been three days prior discussing, well, immigration). By Monday, a large number of Mexican diplomats, Cabinet members, and trade experts had descended on D.C. in an effort to convince the Trump administration to desist. Silent no more, López Obrador sent Trump a two-page letter calling for mutual understanding in the spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mexico’s government had finally drawn a line: Publicly insult Mexico, taunt immigrants, or harass potential refugees and you’ll get respect; threaten tariffs, and half the Mexican government will try to persuade you otherwise. How’s that for moral priorities? Ebrard met with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday. Mexico’s foreign minister seemed confident before the meeting. “We are working hard to reach an understanding,” Ebrard tweeted . “It’s doable and desirable. There’s an 80/20 chance we’ll succeed.” After just 90 minutes in the White House, Ebrard’s odds seemed backward. On Twitter from across the Atlantic, Trump lamented that “not nearly enough” progress had been made and once again threatened tariffs. Pence added his own admonition for good measure. “Mexico must do more to address the urgent crisis at our southern border,” the vice president tweeted . The question, for Ebrard and the rest of the López Obrador administration, is what “more” Mexico can actually do to abate the growing Central American exodus? Before the tariff crisis exploded, Ebrard had been naïvely trying to sell the Americans on an ambitious development project for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Not surprisingly, given the White House’s fixation on enforcement rather than development in the region, Ebrard’s plan was largely ignored in Washington. The Trump administration now seems focused on forcing Mexico’s hand on immigration deterrence and deportation of Central American asylum-seekers. Over the weekend, a number of administration officials hinted at possible immediate actions Mexico could take to appease Trump on the immigrant surge and the tariff threat. The most revealing opinion came from acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Mexico needed to “step up and do more” to stop immigrants on their way to the United States. Mexico, McAleenan suggested, should add boots on the ground along Mexico’s southern border and aggressively go after the “Transnational Criminal Organizations” that smuggle migrants north. McAleenan also said Mexico should clamp down on “transportation choke points” in the country’s southern regions and substantially increase the number of arrests and deportations of Central American migrants. McAleenan also hinted at what could become the most contentious request coming from the United States: “They’re safe in Mexico,” McAleenan said. “Mexico has reached out and offered refugee status to thousands of people since President López Obrador has been in office. That should be the place, if they’re safe in Mexico, to request that.” This was likely a reference to a long-sought request from DHS: that Mexico formally declare itself a “safe third country,” meaning that Central American migrants would have to apply for refuge there rather than in the United States. This would allow the administration to justify punitive procedures like the controversial “Remain in Mexico” policy now making its way through the courts. If this is indeed what Trump wants in order to withdraw the tariff threat, Ebrard and the rest of his delegation are going to have their work cut out for them. Conditions on the ground in Mexico are far harsher that Ebrard would like to admit. This is partly the government’s fault. Contrary to myriad recommendations, López Obrador has dramatically reduced the budget for the government agencies in charge of managing refugees and processing removals. Mexican border towns are ill-equipped for handling transient immigrant populations, let alone managing long-term settlements. Mexico also faces other, more systemic challenges. The fight against smugglers who squeeze immigrants out of their last cent is an uphill battle, and it would be even more so if López Obrador ends up scrapping the Mérida Initiative, the bilateral agreement that has strengthened cooperation on intelligence and security over the last 12 years. And yet, nothing would be a more indefensible concession than granting a potential request for Mexico to become a “safe third country” for Central American immigrants. McAleenan is mistaken: Mexico is not a safe country for refugees. Without real resources, it is not fit to grant asylum in a massive scale. It is wrong and misleading for a U.S. official to pretend otherwise. For a Mexican official like Ebrard to do so would be unconscionable. The decision would put an enormous number of people in danger. It would also grant Trump an invaluable political gift to boast of during the upcoming presidential campaign. What will the Mexican government do? Ebrard and his colleagues will soon have to choose between showing some backbone—demanding real American cooperation on the region’s shared challenges and rejecting Trump’s threats—or giving in to Trump’s outrageous and wholly unrealistic demands. It is a dilemma that will determine the fate of millions. Support our journalism

The Fleabag mastermind, who was tapped to spruce up the Bond 25 script by none other than Daniel Craig, isn’t interested in altering 007’s behavior toward women, she told Deadline in a new interview . She just wants the Bond girls to have roles worth playing. “There’s been a lot of talk about whether or not [the Bond franchise] is relevant now because of who he is and the way he treats women,” Waller-Bridge said. “I think that’s bollocks. I think he’s absolutely relevant now. It has just got to grow. It has just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly. He doesn’t have to. He needs to be true to this character.” While Waller-Bridge insists that she’s only livening up what’s already in the script, she fortunately will be dedicating her talents to some of Craig’s dialogue. “When I saw his Bond for the first time, there was a wryness to his performance that I really loved,” she said. “So, I was really excited about writing dialogue for him.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

As for the female characters, Waller-Bridge just hopes to make them as meaty and fully formed as actual women. “It’s just about making them feel like real people,” she said. “I always think the test for me as an actor, whenever I’m writing anything, is: Would I want to play that role? And so I’m coming into this polish thinking, I just want to make sure that when they get those pages through, that Lashana [Lynch], Léa [Seydoux] and Ana [de Armas] open them and go, ‘I can’t wait to do that.’ As an actress, I very rarely had that feeling early in my career.

What’s it like to be swarmed by lady bugs?,slate.com,Shannon Palus,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/lady-bug-swarm-what-is-it-like.html,"Why Do So Many Researchers Still Treat Race as a Scientific Concept? On an otherwise clear night earlier this week, a large green blob showed up on the radar of the National Weather Service’s San Diego office. “It looked like echoes reflecting off raindrops, but we weren’t seeing any clouds,” meteorologist Mark Moede who was observing the blob later told the Washington Post. What else is raindrop size, but doesn’t come from clouds? Ladybugs. A volunteer on the ground reported that there were “ladybugs everywhere.” The image was “actually a cloud of ladybugs termed a ‘bloom,’ ” tweeted the National Weather Service office in San Diego. (The weather service has settled on this explanation for now, though Moede later clarified to the Post that it’s possible it was something else, like a military effort to foil radar with aluminum particles) . The “bloom” may have shown up on the radar because the ladybugs were flying at thousands of feet , part of an annual migration from mountains to valleys , a local ABC affiliate explained . All this made us wonder: What is it like to be in the middle of a ton of ladybugs? Slate’s own culture editor Forrest Wickman has had such an experience. “The ladybugs seemed cute at first,” he told me, recalling the fateful day one summer when he was a teen. He remembers standing on his family’s porch in Connecticut wearing a brightly colored shirt as more and more ladybugs approached him. “There is a number at which they start to shade from cute into kinda creepy, and there is a larger number at which they shade from kinda creepy to terrifying. By the time it appeared that I was no longer wearing a bright-colored shirt but was instead wearing a red shirt, made of ladybugs, I was running toward the sliding door,” he said. So many ladybugs ended up inside his house that summer that he remembers becoming accustomed to the sound of them crunching beneath his feet. If you want to feel a fraction of what Wickman felt that day, I suggest watching videos of swarms on YouTube. There’s this one of hundreds of ladybugs clustering on a tree in Northern California, according to the video’s poster, or this one of ladybugs looking like clusters of seeds or berries, or this one of ladybugs crawling on a woman’s arm and home in an undisclosed location (the residents were worried about curious tourists also swarming their home), or this one from PBS that features swaths of bugs that the narrator describes “almost like some sort of disease, except its moving.” If videos are not enough to satiate your ladybug curiosity, you can travel to one of the spots where ladybugs are known to cluster, like the Muir Woods National Park in late November . (Ladybugs are not dangerous, but they can secrete a foul-smelling liquid , which means you might not want to get super close.) You could even purchase hundreds of live ladybugs on Amazon and release them into your own swarm. Slate editor Dan Kois did this for his child’s birthday: “It was a ladybug-themed party and at the end we gave everyone little cups with airholes and then opened the bag and a bazillion ladybugs flew everywhere and kids screamed, mostly happily.” Mostly!

"Merkel, Macron, May, Varadkar: Trump's week of awkward conversations.",slate.com,Chip Brownlee,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/merkel-macron-may-varadkar-trumps-week-of-awkward-conversations.html,"Five Teenage Boys Arrested for Attack on Lesbian Couple in London Bus President Donald Trump, with his open contempt for institutions like NATO and the EU and skepticism about the value of longtime U.S. alliances, isn’t exactly known for thriving relationships with his counterparts in Europe. His rapport with European leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron has generally soured over the course of his presidency. So coming together for a three-day state visit to the U.K. and Ireland ahead of the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day Invasion posed a challenge as the president embarked on tour marked with pageantry and pomp—and a few instances of controversy. Here’s a look at Trump’s week of awkward encounters: THERESA MAY Trump’s first stops on his state visit to the U.K. were with members of the British Royal Family. But the president had already caused controversy before he ever even touched down on the British Isles, saying in an interview with a British tabloid that the Duchess of Sussex—the former Meghan Markle— was “nasty” toward him and on Twitter that London Mayor Sadiq Khan was a “stone cold loser.” Trump on Tuesday had what could be his last meeting with lame-duck U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May , who is likely to step down as prime minister before the end of July. Trump gave May a figurative pat on the back on her way out the door —praising her more highly than he has in the past, saying she has done a “very good job” on Brexit negotiations and that “she’s probably a better negotiator than I am.” The two never had a particularly warm relationship, with Trump frequently criticizing her in the past for how she’s handled Brexit. Amid a leadership battle over who will replace May, Trump praised her conservative rival Boris Johnson , who apparently declined a requested meeting with the president. Another candidate, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, also received praise from Trump. Offering a somewhat unintentional hint at how difficult securing a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement could actually be, Trump told reporters during the joint press conference with May that everything—including the popular British public health program the National Health System—should be “on the table” during trade negotiations with the U.S. But that only came after May had to explain to Trump away from the mic what “NHS” stood for after a reporter posed the question and Trump either couldn’t hear or wasn’t aware of the acronym. LEO VARADKAR After his visit to the U.K., Air Force One landed in Ireland on Wednesday where Trump met Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at Shannon airport. (Varadkar and his staff reportedly turned down a request from the administration to hold the meeting at a Trump-owned golf course on Ireland’s Atlantic coast.) Trump’s visit with Varadkar only became more awkward later when—sitting next to an obviously uncomfortable Varadkar—Trump likened Ireland’s post-Brexit border with Northern Ireland to his proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “I think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,” Trump said . The Irish premier quickly interjected with what has been longstanding policy of the Irish government—that is wishes to avoid a border or a wall with Northern Ireland, which is a separate country that is part of the U.K. After Trump left, Varadkar later told the press that he explained the history of the Irish border during a tête-à-tête with Trump. He also said the two discussed trade, visas and other effects Brexit could have on the Republic of Ireland. EMMANUEL MACRON Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron’s vacillating and complicated relationship was on full display in France Thursday. Initially described as having a “bromance,” the two’s relationship soured after they diverged on issues like climate change and the Iran nuclear deal. While the two have taken jabs at each other in the past, Trump and Macron’s brief meeting in France after D-Day commemoration events was tame—perhaps it could be expected since the backdrop was near the beaches of Normandy and the graves of American soldiers. But their differences remained apparent even as the two tried to downplay their disagreements over the Iran deal . Macron and Trump said only that they have the same objective when it comes to Iran, ignoring the fact that the two have seriously different ideas of how to get to that objective. Macron has supported the Obama-era pact that Trump pulled the U.S. out of last year. The French president did call for new negotiations to extend the deal. ANGELA MERKEL Just a week after German Chancellor Angela Merkel took veiled swipes at Trump’s trade policy and his worldview while speaking to graduates at Harvard, the chancellor met Trump again in Portsmouth, England, for D-Day events . During her speech at Harvard , she told students to “tear down walls” and to avoid treating “lies as truth.” She never mentioned Trump’s name, but the target was clear. As their relationship too has gone downhill over Trump’s tenure, there was much focus on their body language during this week’s meetings. You can always count on Angela to express what everyone else is thinking. pic.twitter.com/KOn9d77xNK — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) June 5, 2019 Ahead of a short one-on-one, the two walked in together Wednesday but sat silently in front of press cameras. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the two discussed the situation in Libya and in West Africa during their private talk. Support our journalism

"Dwarf Fortress: in praise of the impossible, beautifully weird game that maybe gave us Fortnite.",slate.com,Evan Urquhart,06-06-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/dwarf-fortress-fortnite-minecraft-strange-play-it.html,"A Jock With Glasses Is Not a Geek, but Gay Culture Sure Is Trying to Make It So Of the five settlers who had just recently joined my growing dwarven community, this one stood out. Older than the others, Urist had a history steeped in blood, hunger, and rage. Though she looked like all the other dwarves—a tiny smiley face on a colorful rectangular field of numbers, letters, and punctuation—I checked out her backstory and deduced that she had to be some kind of werebeast. As quickly as I could, I input the commands to have a mining dwarf wall her up in a small cell. In theory, she could have stayed there forever, the infection contained, allowing my colony to thrive. Instead, I forgot about her and later directed a dwarf to dig out an area that included one of the walls of Urist’s prison. She was freed, assuming weregiraffe form on the full moon and attacking the other dwarves mercilessly. This is just how things go in Dwarf Fortress , a game of infinite possibilities, most of them bad. Consumers of culture are accustomed to the idea that an album can be a commercial failure but succeed as art through its innovation and influence. We’re not used to finding the same dynamic in video games. Depending on your point of view, Dwarf Fortress could be a backwater of the medium or a raging current, a toy for detail-obsessed oddballs who enjoy playing God, or a flourishing source of inspiration, aspiration, and new ideas for indie developers and major video game publishers alike. If you can get past the difficult interface, it can even be pretty fun to play. Once you experience Dwarf Fortress , you begin to notice its tropes elsewhere. Early in a match of Fortnite —still, at the moment, the most popular video game in the world—players must collect wood, stone, and brick from trees and structures. Later, they’ll use these materials to build pathways and defensive structures, or gain the high ground as the playable area of the game’s map shrinks, forcing the surviving players into a tighter space. Although the weapons and the shooting are important, the best builder is usually the winner of the battle royal. Fortnite came by its gather-then-build mechanic by way of another huge game, Minecraft . But even that was predated by Dwarf Fortress , where embarking dwarves (smiley faces) cut trees (brown zeroes) and build complex structures and machines, which also look like numbers, letters, or other ASCII characters. Dwarf Fortress is visually terrible, insanely difficult, and beautifully weird. It’s the video gaming world’s equivalent of John Coltrane’s Giant Steps or some crazy Captain Beefheart track, foundational music that alienates and scares those of us who are just looking for a beat to bop to, but whose influence you see everywhere, once you know where to look. A budding tactician can train and patrol a military. A hunter can send out dwarves in search of dangerous underground beasts. A romantic can tend to their dwarves’ personal lives. Dwarf Fortress has had tens of thousands of players (many of them coders and game developers themselves) since the earliest version was made available in 2006. Unlike most modern games, it is the product of a single coder, Tarn Adams, with creative input from his brother, Zach. Adams considers the free-to-play game, already remarkable for its depth and complexity, to be about 40 percent finished, although he recently agreed to work with members of his fan community to bring a paid version of the game to Steam , with modest improvements on the graphics. (The original version is gratis on his website.) Adams embodies a model of game developer as passionate, monomaniacal auteur, the opposite of the mainstream image of games as corporate, capitalist, and possibly addictive —not to mention collaborative works of entertainment, not solitary, personal works. Like Coltrane’s jazz, the complexity and differentness of Dwarf Fortress are what make it difficult for those who aren’t already steeped in coding and gaming history to approach. While the unofficial motto of Dwarf Fortress is “Losing is fun,” a more accurate motto for the new player might be “Staring at an undifferentiated hash of ASCII characters without any idea of what is going on or how to affect it is fun—really!” Dwarf Fortress has no in-game tutorials (new players will have to go to the wiki for that), which is particularly irksome because the controls are unintuitive in the same way that building an airplane from scratch would be. Only after getting over the hurdle of figuring out what you’re looking at and how to use the menus to direct your dwarves can players begin to experience the real “fun” of having their carefully barricaded hole in the ground infiltrated by a weregiraffe and all their dwarves murdered or turned into weregiraffes themselves. There is a genre of games that are difficult for the sake of being difficult , but Dwarf Fortress isn’t one of those—it’s impenetrable, but sincerely so. Played in a procedurally generated world with rules governing everything from weather patterns to dwarven temperament, it’s more simulation than game, and as simulations go it is deeply textured and incredibly complex. For example, there are 21 possible soil layers, 25 stone layers, and a further 50 types of stone that can be found in pockets and veins. There are 72 types of trees, many of which bear fruit. These trees grow based on biomes, which include tropical moist broadleaf forests and temperate coniferous forests and four more kinds of forest as well as deserts and mountains and salt marshes and more. Elements of the game often interact with one another—for instance, each dwarf has preferences, so a banana-loving dwarf will be overjoyed if the food all has bananas in it, but a rain-hating dwarf may sulk if he gets sent outside, which could lead to work stoppages or even violence. For those who stick with it, this richness allows players to make of the game whatever they want. A builder can barricade their dwarves underground and build fantastic structures. A budding tactician can train and patrol a military. A hunter can send out dwarves in search of dangerous underground beasts. A romantic can tend to their dwarves’ personal lives. This is what draws in the tinkerers and developers and, well, cranks who play the game for free and sustain the Adams brothers with their donations and their continuing interest in every successive release. Tweaks are big and small, but always with the aim of simulating a rich world where a player can create and take part in new stories and adventures every time. One long-anticipated change, for example, will be the creation of a system for magic, an essential element to any fantasy world. Although there have been attempts to create a more-accessible successor to Dwarf Fortress with games like RimWorld , you’re more likely to notice its influence in bits and drips. Minecraft (created by Markus Persson, who has credited Dwarf Fortress as a major influence) ushered in a craze for having building elements in games. These children and grandchildren of Minecraft often contain echoes of the specific building mechanics of Dwarf Fortress . Because of Minecraft , there is Terraria (a 2D Minecraft- like game), where building becomes a core component of strategy as the player makes arenas in which to tackle successive boss fights. In Block Fortress , another Minecraft -influenced game, building is in service to a tower-defense game. Larger gaming studios have been influenced as well. In addition to Epic Games’ Fortnite , Bethesda’s Fallout 4 incorporates building with materials scavenged from post-apocalyptic Massachusetts, which can be used by the player to build houses, settlements, and bases. (Bethesda also came out with the mobile title Fallout Shelter , which offers a colony management experience that is more directly comparable to Dwarf Fortress , although it’s orders of magnitude simpler and easier to play). There are also direct references to Dwarf Fortress hidden in better-known games like World of Warcraft (which included a quest called “Dwarf Fortress” and two dwarven characters who made references to the game), Starcraft II , Runescape , and many more . And there are other more-elusive influences too. Beyond the building trend, there’s emergent gameplay, the term for unexpected or novel complexity that springs out of the interaction between simpler game elements. Dwarf Fortress is at once reaching for more emergence and embodying it at its best—the less-popular “Adventurer Mode” of the game is intended to take the simulated world and make it a background for emergent storytelling with a single protagonist, although for the moment that mode remains flatter and less satisfying for most players than the “Fortress Mode,” in which the player tinkers directly with the simulation itself. This desire for emergence has been at the heart of game designers’ search for ways to make nonplayer characters in story-based video games seem less flat, repetitive, and two-dimensional—in other words, more alive. This is an ongoing quest , but the independence and individuality of dwarves who form friendships, have likes and dislikes, are impacted by trauma, and even have something like proclivities and personalities has been as successful as anything that’s currently in more polished, mainstream franchises like The Sims . It takes far more effort to learn an obscure but brilliant game like Dwarf Fortress than it does to pick up more polished, mainstream fare. But I think there’s an upside to being slowed down and forced to think, and to struggle to understand what’s going on. Instead of being carried away to a preset destination, Dwarf Fortress makes you think hard about where you want to go and question why you’ve been so willing to let other games make those decisions for you. Without Dwarf Fortress , some of the biggest games of the past decade might not exist at all, but just as important is the game and its developer’s stubborn insistence that there is more to making and playing games than the desire to addict people and take as much of their money as possible. In an environment where microtransactions make much of what passes for gaming seem more like compulsive gambling, and where visually stunning games can be shallow, repetitive and dull, that’s a huge accomplishment. Not as huge as keeping that weregiraffe contained, though. "
