Will Lester/AFP/Getty Images Will Lester/AFP/Getty Images Louise and Daivd Turpin, who pleaded guilty to 14 felony counts for the abuse of 12 their 13 children, listened on Friday as two of their adult children testified in court.
Will Lester/AFP/Getty Images A California couple who beat, tortured and abused 12 of their 13 children for years were sentenced to life in prison during an emotional hearing that included testimony from some of the victims.
David and Louise Turpin pleaded guilty in February to 14 felony counts each, including counts of torture, false imprisonment, cruelty to dependent adults and child endangerment, after police discovered they had held their children captive, starving them and forcing them to live in horrific conditions.
""My parents took my whole life from me,"" said one of their elder daughters, whose name was not revealed in court. She was one of the two adult children who read statements to the court before the sentencing. ""Life may have been bad, but it made me strong. I saw my dad change my mom, they almost changed me. I'm a fighter, I'm strong.
""But now,"" she said, ""I'm taking my life back. ... Life is great.""
Her mother wept as she looked on, the Associated Press reported.
National California Couple, Parents Of 13, Plead Guilty To Abuse, Torture, Imprisonment ""I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up. Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that happened, such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten,"" said the couple's son.
""But that is the past and this is now,"" he said.
Like his sister and at least one other sibling, he is enrolled in college and says he is optimistic about the future. He is studying to be a software engineer and has learned to ride a bike.
""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things that they did to us,"" he told the court, speaking slowly.
Both siblings sat in the courtroom accompanied by a support and comfort dog named Raider, from the Corona Police Department.
The sentencing came just over a year after the couple's then-17-year-old daughter escaped through a window of the family's Perris, Calif., home and called 911. It was the culmination of a two-year plan .
The girl directed police to the house where officials found the children — ages 2 to 29 at the time — living in appalling squalor. Some were "" shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings ,"" according to the Riverside Sheriff's Department.
The Two-Way 'This Is Depraved Conduct': Couple Charged With Torture After Kids Found Shackled They were so malnourished and emaciated that police mistook them for much younger children. In fact, they believed the 17-year-old was only 10. Police were also shocked to discover seven adults among the group, ranging in age from 18 to 29 — the eldest weighed 82 pounds when found. Officials also concluded several of the victims suffered cognitive impairment and neuropathy as result of the extreme and prolonged physical abuse.
Further investigations revealed the siblings were restrained by ropes and later chains as a form of punishment. They were often beaten, strangled or tied up for ""weeks or even months at a time."" They were only allowed to shower once a year, and their parents often taunted them by keeping food and toys just out of reach.
The youngest child, who was 2 when the Turpins were arrested, was apparently spared the abuse, the Riverside County district attorney determined.
Both parents offered tearful apologies to their children in court, saying they acted out of love.
""I'm sorry for everything I've done to hurt my children,"" Louise Turpin said, weeping. ""I love my children so much. I'm blessed to be the mother of each one of them. I only want the best for them; their happiness is very important to me. They are very smart, amazing individuals. I hope they get all the education they need.""
Their father, David, spoke briefly before breaking down. ""I am so proud of each and every one of my children. I miss all of my children and I will be praying for them. I long for the opportunity to have contact with them again,"" he said.
His lawyer finished reading the statement saying, ""My home schooling and discipline had good intentions. ... I'm sorry if I've done anything to cause them harm.""
Judge Bernard Schwartz had harsh words for the Turpins and the irreparable years of maltreatment they inflicted on their offspring.
""Their lives have been permanently altered in their ability to learn, grow and thrive. You have delayed their mental, physical and emotional development,"" Schwartz said.
""To the extent that they do thrive, and it appears from today that perhaps a couple are, it will be not because of you both, but in spite of you both,"" he rebuked the pair.
The couple will be eligible for parole after 25 years."
UNC Women's Basketball Coach Resigns After Investigation Into Racist Remarks,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715137550/unc-basketball-coach-sylvia-hatchell-resigns-after-investigation?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Sylvia Hatchell, who has led the Tar Heels since 1986, did not address the allegations against her or the findings of the independent report. Robert Franklin/AP Robert Franklin/AP Sylvia Hatchell, who has led the Tar Heels since 1986, did not address the allegations against her or the findings of the independent report.
Robert Franklin/AP After more than three decades, University of North Carolina women's basketball coach Sylvia Hatchell has resigned from leading the celebrated program. Her resignation followed an external review that found she made ""racially insensitive"" remarks, exercised ""undue influence"" on athletes to play while injured and lacked a connection with her players.
The university announced the move Thursday night, citing the conclusions of an 18-day investigation that was initiated after players and parents raised concerns about the women's experiences and overall culture of the program.
""The University commissioned a review of our women's basketball program, which found issues that led us to conclude that the program needed to be taken in a new direction. It is in the best interests of our University and student-athletes for us to do so,"" UNC Director of Athletics Bubba Cunningham said.
""Coach Hatchell agrees, and she offered her resignation today. I accepted it. We appreciate her 33 years of service to Carolina and to the community, and we wish her the best. Our focus now is on conducting a search for a new head coach who will build on our great Carolina traditions and promote a culture of excellence.""
Sports Baylor Beats Notre Dame To Win NCAA Women's Basketball Championship The review, which included interviews with 28 current players and personnel, determined that the 67-year-old ""is not viewed as a racist, but her comments and subsequent response caused many in the program to believe she lacked awareness and appreciation for the effect her remarks had on those who heard them.""
And, when confronted by players and staff about comments that were racially insensitive, Hatchell ""did not respond in a timely or appropriate manner,"" the investigation found.
According to a report by The Washington Post, Hatchell was accused of making alarming references to lynching, telling players they could be "" hanged from trees with nooses "" if they performed poorly at an upcoming game.
The story was also the first to publicize allegations that Hatchell and the team's physician tried to downplay serious injuries in order to pressure players into continuing to compete. As a result, one player said, she was forced to have corrective shoulder surgery. Another said she had played with a torn tendon in her knee.
Research News Researchers Examine Who's Better At College Basketball's Free-Throw Line But the investigation cleared the team's medical staff of wrongdoing while acknowledging that Hatchell questioned player care and readiness. ""The medical staff did not surrender to pressure to clear players before they were medically ready,"" according to the report.
Finally, the probe identified a ""breakdown of connectivity"" between Hatchell and the players.
Hatchell, who had been on paid administrative leave since the launch of the investigation, did not address the allegations against her in a farewell statement included in the university's announcement.
""The game of basketball has given me so much, but now it is time for me to step away,"" she wrote, adding that the team is ready for new leadership after wrapping up a successful season.
Hatchell has led the Tar Heels since 1986. Her team won the NCAA championship in 1994 and she was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2013.
Calling it a ""bittersweet day,"" Hatchell said, ""I've been fortunate to coach more than 200 young women, and it has been a joy to see them grow into successful teachers, doctors, lawyers, mothers, high school and college basketball coaches, and WNBA players.""
She added that she has been considering retirement since recovering from leukemia in 2014.
Her attorney, Wade Smith, told NPR's Newscast that she denies the claims.
""There was really nothing else for her to accomplish as a basketball coach,"" Smith. ""I mean, hooray for her. She won a national championship. She's in the Naismith Hall of Fame. She's a thousand-game winner. She went to the NCAA tournament Elite Eight a number of times. What more was there for her to do?""
Hatchell is among the most revered figures in women's basketball. She became the third women's coach in Division I with 1,000 career victories in 2017 and last month's NCAA Tournament marked her 23rd appearance in the competition.

Amazon/Screenshot by NPR You can read the redacted Mueller report right now, free, on the Department of Justice website . Or you can read it here on NPR.org .
But perhaps reading 448-page PDFs isn't your thing. Or you don't have enough ink to print all those pages, and someone would notice if you stood next to the office printer for the next 45 minutes or so, adding new reams of paper, only to see it print out black boxes obscuring portions of the text from the public.
Well, you wouldn't be alone: The Mueller report on the 22-month probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election is now a bestselling book, even though its contents are free and widely available.
A day after the report was released by the Justice Department, paperback versions occupied the top two spots on Amazon's bestseller list .
Analysis Will Democrats 'Follow The Mueller Report To Where It Leads'? The top spot is occupied by a version published by Skyhorse Publishing, which includes an introduction by Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer and Trump supporter who has been critical of the Mueller investigation.
Skyhorse Group Editorial Director Mark Gompertz says people just prefer reading in book form.
""We have our typesetters sitting here doing it in a proper typographical way,"" Gompertz tells NPR . ""That's a lot easier for people to read when it's set nicely. We have a team of nine people that will be proofreading throughout the day and night if that's what it takes.""
The second spot on Amazon's list is occupied by a version of the report published by Scribner in partnership with The Washington Post . Their book includes extra content: a list of the major characters, major Justice Department filings and a timeline.
Politics House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler Subpoenas Full Mueller Report ""We thought we could provide not just the Mueller report, but a lot of useful and valuable context around it, so that it would be all the more useful to readers,"" Scribner Vice President and Editor-in-Chief Colin Harrison tells NPR.
A version of the report published by Melville House was at No. 9 on Amazon's list Friday afternoon. That book contains only the report itself.
""It's our belief that we should respect the reader and give them the report and nothing but the report,"" Melville House Co-Publisher Dennis Johnson says.
But still, he says, he hopes a lot of people read it online. ""That would be great. The more people that read it the better. But the fact of the matter is, not everybody has access to a computer. And reading it online may not be the ideal way to read it,"" Johnson says.

Kennedy's assassination, the Starr report discussing President Bill Clinton's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the 9/11 commission's report all found wide readership.
There are are additional perks to physical books, too: They can assume a kind of weight that PDFs rarely do.
""I still have the copy of the Pentagon Papers that my parents bought for our home library thinking that was just an important historic document,"" Johnson says. ""And I'd like to think that this one is up there with that in importance."""
Police In Northern Ireland Seek Journalist's Killers,www.npr.org,Richard Gonzales,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715334737/police-in-northern-ireland-seek-journalists-killers,"Enlarge this image Irish journalist Lyra McKee who was shot and killed during clashes between militant republicans and police in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. McKee family/AP McKee family/AP Irish journalist Lyra McKee who was shot and killed during clashes between militant republicans and police in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
McKee family/AP Police authorities in Northern Ireland are searching for several suspects in the shooting death of a young journalist during a riot Thursday night in the city of Londonderry.
Lyra McKee, 29, was killed, apparently by a stray bullet , as she was standing near a police vehicle during unrest in Londonderry's Creggan neighborhood.
""We are treating this as a terrorist incident and we have launched a murder enquiry,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton told reporters.
Hamilton said police believe the New Irish Republican Army, a militant republican group, was responsible for McKee's death and the violent events. The violence broke out in the predominantly Catholic section of Londonderry, also known as Derry, as police were conducting searches for munitions and firearms they suspected were to be used over the Easter weekend.
""The New IRA is a small group who reject the 1998 Good Friday agreement that marked the Irish Republican Army's embrace of a political solution to the long-running violence known as 'The Troubles' that claimed more than 3,700 lives,"" according to the Associated Press.
As NPR's Frank Langfitt reports, a dissident Irish Republican group said a volunteer gunman was responsible for McKee's death:
""Saoradh is a self-described revolutionary party devoted to uniting the Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland.
""The group says a volunteer accidentally shot journalist Lyra McKee, while she was standing behind British police in the city of Londonderry.
""Police were searching houses in the neighborhood for weapons and explosives. Residents responded with Molotov cocktails.
""The Irish Republican group called McKee's death heart-breaking, but insisted the gunman was defending the community when he opened fire.
"" 'The blame for last night lies squarely at the feet of the British Crown Forces,' the party said in a statement.""
There's at least one report that the New IRA and Saoradh are facing a backlash as residents of Northern Ireland across the spectrum condemned the journalist's slaying.
""Those people who carried out this attack have no place in society. Those people who carried out this attack do not have any support. Those people who carried out this attack have attacked all of us. They have attacked the community, attacked the people of Derry. They have attacked the peace process, and they have attacked the Good Friday Agreement,"" Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O'Neill told reporters .
""Heartbreaking news. A senseless act. A family has been torn apart. Those who brought guns onto our streets in the 70s, 80s & 90s were wrong. It is equally wrong in 2019. No one wants to go back,"" said the leader of the pro-British Democratic Union Party, Arlene Foster, in a tweet .
McKee was a rising journalism star at home and abroad.
""McKee was named Sky News's young journalist of the year in 2006, and Forbes magazine identified her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016,"" reported the Washington Post . ""She served as an editor for California-based news site Mediagazer, a trade publication covering the media industry, according to her publisher. Her work appeared in the Atlantic, Mosaic Science and BuzzFeed News.""
In Northern Ireland, McKee is perhaps best known for a blog post "" Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self ,"" about her fear and anxiety associated with growing up gay and the subsequent acceptance she received from her family when she came out to them. The post was later made into a short film.
""As a writer Lyra was drawn to subjects usually met with silence,"" said her editor at Faber & Faber, Laura Hassan.
Another volume, The Lost Boys , an investigation of children and young men who vanished during the Troubles, is due to be published next year.
""She should have been the future,"" the Guardian wrote in an editorial . ""That a young life has been cut short should remind politicians on all sides that the [Good Friday] agreement cannot be taken for granted."""
"20 Years After The Columbine Shooting, Students And Staff Reflect On What Happened",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266719/20-years-after-the-columbine-shooting-students-and-staff-reflect-on-what-happene?station=KXJZ_FM,"Saturday marks the 20th anniversary of the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. What's changed and what's stayed the same with regards to school safety and mental health since then?
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Tomorrow marks 20 years since two gunmen at Columbine High School in Colorado killed 13 people. The incident is still relevant today. This week, the FBI says a woman infatuated with Columbine made credible threats, traveled to the area and bought a gun. From member station KUNC, Leigh Paterson reports that, for the last two decades, schools have taken steps to better protect and care for their students.
LEIGH PATERSON, BYLINE: Evan Todd has clear memories of April 20, 1999. He was a sophomore at Columbine High School, goofing off in the library with his friends, throwing wads of paper.
EVAN TODD: And then just in an instant...
PATERSON: There was an explosion. Smoke. And then pops of gunfire.
TODD: As the two murderers got closer, we heard the sounds of the gunshots echoing through the hallways.
PATERSON: The killers came into the library and started shooting his classmates execution style. Todd remembers thinking...
TODD: Someone with a gun has got to come in here and stop these guys, and we're going to get out of here and - nothing.
PATERSON: That day, naturally, has really informed Todd's thinking about safety and guns. He now believes that teachers should be allowed to carry guns.
TODD: In the end, when evil comes, there's only one way to stop it. And a firearm would have saved lives at Columbine.
PATERSON: Teachers and staff in school districts in 31 states can now legally carry weapons in schools, according to a review of state laws and local news coverage. There's no federal policy mandating or prohibiting teachers from carrying guns, but there is debate over whether or not federal funds can be used to buy guns for schools. School shootings are rare so there's not much data to suggest whether or not armed teachers would make students safer. Ken Trump is the president of a consulting company called National School Safety and Security Services.
KEN TRUMP: No relation to the president.
PATERSON: He thinks it's all a bad idea. Too much can go wrong. Instead...
TRUMP: Many of the things that we learned after Columbine are so practical and still very relevant today.
PATERSON: Things like reasonable physical security measures, he says. Schools now have cameras, lockdown drills, metal detectors, armed school resource officers. It's become an industry. According to IHS, a market research firm, the market for school security equipment and services reached $2.7 billion in 2017. But there's another aspect to school safety that gets less attention and generally less funding, mental health prevention. Ken Trump says this is just as important.
TRUMP: That schools need to look for early warning signs of children who have emotional, behavioral, mental health concerns.
(SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING)
PATERSON: Thank you.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are you Leigh?
PATERSON: Noel Sudano agrees.
NOEL SUDANO: I am a school counselor at Columbine High School.
PATERSON: She was also a Columbine student 20 years ago.
SUDANO: I think this year in particular, in my own grief process of still processing what happened on April 20, I think I'm feeling more of a calling to really be mindful of this mental health problem.
PATERSON: And by that, she means everything from kids struggling with anxiety, trauma and suicidal thoughts to kids becoming potential threats.
SUDANO: I see little things that can be concerning, like, you're having a hard time controlling your anger, you have a lot of rage built up from things that have happened in your past, you don't have a lot of support in your life.
PATERSON: And now when specific threats or concerns do come up, there are red-flag systems in place, like threat assessment teams and anonymous tip lines to get students help way before there's some sort of crisis. Many of these measures were put in place in Colorado because of Columbine, like Safe To Tell, a website and an app geared towards students where people can report concerns. Colorado's launched in 2004. And last school year, 16,00 tips came in. Several other states have similar programs. But many experts say it's not enough. Mental health services and counselors are stretched thin.
SUDANO: I have my caseload of 350 students, and I care about every single one of them. And I want to think that if there's something we can do preventative, that we can always find this path of redemption or positivity or growth.
PATERSON: A lot has changed over the last 20 years, but what hasn't is that school shootings still happen. For NPR News, I'm Leigh Paterson.
CORNISH: That story came to us from the public media collaboration Guns & America.

"As Part Of Her Fight Against Anti-Semitism, One Woman Is Inviting Non-Jews To Seder",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266709/as-part-of-her-fight-against-anti-semitism-one-woman-is-inviting-non-jews-to-sed?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with Marnie Fienberg, who created ""2 for Seder"" in honor of her mother-in-law, a victim of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting. The program invites two non-Jewish guests to each meal.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Tonight is the first night of Passover. Jews around the world will be gathering around a table for a festive meal to retell the biblical story of the Jewish people escaping from slavery in Egypt thousands of years ago. It's called a Seder. And this year, through a program created by Marnie Fienberg, there will be some 1,800 people attending their first Seder. Feinberg's mother-in-law, Joyce Fienberg, was 1 of 11 worshippers killed during the October massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Joyce was 75.
In her mother-in-law's memory, Marnie Fienberg started a program called 2 for Seder. And she's here to talk about it now. Hi, Marnie.
MARNIE FIENBERG: Hi, Ailsa. How are you?
CHANG: I'm good. Thanks for joining us today. Can you tell me what Joyce was like? What were her Seders like? I want to picture them in my head.
FIENBERG: So actually, Joyce, when my husband and I were first married, sort of tutored me on how to do the proper Seder over time. Joyce also made a point of having many guests at every Seder, a lot of international friends and co-workers and students who were not where their families were. And they always brought them in.
She just wanted to make sure that you were comfortable. She didn't distinguish between any value of any sort. It was - you are a friend, you are an acquaintance, you are welcome in our home.
CHANG: Yeah, I love that. I read that after Joyce was killed, you didn't want to go back to work. Instead, you have devoted yourself to this new idea, 2 for Seder, where you want encourage Jewish families to invite at least two new non-Jewish guests to Seder. Tell me, what do you hope this simple gesture will accomplish over time?
FIENBERG: So I think that grassroots efforts are very powerful. I think the idea that I can do something, I can take action about something that really bothers me is very powerful no matter what space it's in. And this needs to be applied to fighting anti-Semitism and to fighting hatred of any sort. It's very important to me that we, as Jews, open our doors to our neighbors. You are a member of the family tonight.
I'm hoping that if you were experiencing something where someone was talking about Jews in a negative light, that you would be able to say, you know what? I had a very different experience than that. Let's talk about it. It can only go somewhere positive.
CHANG: And tell me why you chose this particular ritual, the Seder, to share with people who aren't Jewish. I mean, what do you think they can take away from the story of Passover?
FIENBERG: So it's more that it's a good on-ramp into what - what it means to be Jewish. It's almost as if when we go through the Passover ritual, that we are going from being slaves and family members to becoming the nation of Israel. It is, in essence, the time we become Jewish every year. If you walk beside me as I'm taking that journey each year, if you walk beside me tonight, then you will really have a bit of insight about what it means, to me, to be Jewish.
CHANG: When you explain this idea to people, this idea of 2 for Seder, has anyone said to you yet, Marnie, this is so idealistic - I mean, you're never going to rid the world of anti-Semitism?
FIENBERG: The negative pushback that I've gotten is a very practical kind of pushback. Most of the Jews that I've ever met, which are a lot of people, are very, very practical people. And they're just thinking about...
CHANG: Logistics.
FIENBERG: Logistics, logistics. And there have been a few people who have asked - but you can't prevent what happened to Joyce this way. And I don't know if that's true. If we can get that base-level understanding of who this diverse quilt of America is.
Maybe we can prevent one killing. Maybe we can prevent one physical interaction. Maybe we can prevent one social media interaction. I don't know where it ends or it begins, but I know we have to do something. I know we can't just sit back. We have to get it done.
CHANG: Marnie Fienberg is the founder of 2 for Seder. Thank you very much for speaking with us today.
FIENBERG: Thank you.

Scientists At The National Hurricane Center Upgrade Hurricane Michael To Category 5,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266671/scientists-at-the-national-hurricane-center-upgrade-hurricane-michael-to-categor?station=KXJZ_FM,"The National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Michael was even stronger than first thought and reclassified it as a Category 5. It's the fourth such storm to make landfall on the U.S. mainland.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
When Hurricane Michael in the Florida Panhandle last year, it walloped the coast. Today scientists at the National Hurricane Center said the storm was even stronger than first thought. In fact, it was a rare top-of-the-scale Category 5 hurricane. NPR's Russell Lewis is here in the studio to discuss why the storm's strength was upgraded and how today's announcement changes how forecasters are planning for the coming hurricane season. Welcome back to the studio, Russell.
RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: It's good to be here.
CORNISH: So how did forecasters go back after the fact and decide that Hurricane Michael was indeed stronger when it hit than they first thought?
LEWIS: Well, we knew that this storm was going to be massive, it was going to be strong and that it was going to do a lot of damage. And that's what it did. It ended up causing some $25 billion in damage. It was directly responsible for the deaths of 16 people. I mean, it was a big storm that targeted Panama City and Mexico Beach in the Florida Panhandle.
But Audie, in every tropical system, forecasters - they go back. They analyze lots of things about the storm - its path, how big it was and, importantly, how strong the storm was. At the height of this storm, there were a lot of variables that sort of played into understanding the strength, from offshore winds sensors to the Hurricane Hunter aircraft that are flying in the storm to Doppler radar to satellite analysis.
And given all of that, forecasters now say that Michael reached sustained winds of 160 miles per hour. And we should say that as a Category 5 storm, Michael is in rare company. It joins Andrew, which hit South Florida in 1992; Camille, which struck Mississippi in 1969 and that unnamed Labor Day hurricane of 1935.
CORNISH: But looking back, why did that rapid increase of strength catch people off guard?
LEWIS: You know, certainly with this storm, it went from a Category 2 to a Category 4 in just 24 hours. And as we've learned now, it wasn't a Category 4. It was a Category 5. And it really is a very rare occurrence. But what you normally see is that a hurricane weakens as it gets closer to land but not with Michael. It kept getting stronger until it hit land. And people in Florida probably remember Hurricane Charley doing exactly that same thing in 2004 before it veered and unexpectedly hit southwest Florida.
CORNISH: What are some of the lessons here for the upcoming hurricane season?
LEWIS: Well, I think really Hurricane Michael has become a case study for meteorologists. In fact, the National Hurricane Center is holding its annual hurricane meeting next week in New Orleans, and they're going to be talking about Michael on a couple of these panels.
And really I think this is a good reminder for everyone. A hurricane, regardless of its strength, is very dangerous. We often hear from people who plan to ride out the storms because they think, oh, it's just a Category 1 hurricane, but that is still a hurricane. And as we've seen, these storms can and do become stronger than forecasters predict. And really the wrong time to think about evacuating is when the storm is right off the coast.
CORNISH: That's NPR's Russell Lewis. Russell, thanks for your reporting.
LEWIS: You're welcome.

Mueller Report Includes Descriptions Of White House Staffers Refusing Trump's Orders,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266664/mueller-report-includes-descriptions-of-white-house-staffers-refusing-trumps-ord?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Mueller report reveals many instances when aides ignored President Trump's orders. But that's a recurring theme in his administration that goes beyond the Russia investigation.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
When President Trump ordered his staff to take action, they didn't always comply - that's one takeaway from the special counsel Robert Mueller's report; it included detailed descriptions of instances where staffers refused to follow the president's directions to interfere in the investigation. NPR's White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe is in the studio to talk more. Hey there, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hey.
CORNISH: So what is the White House saying about some of these revelations?
RASCOE: Well, so President Trump is pushing back on one of the key episodes outlined in the report involving then White House counsel Don McGahn. According to the report, Trump urged McGahn to pressure Rod Rosenstein to remove special counsel Robert Mueller, but he refused to do it. Trump tweeted that he could have fired Mueller if he wanted to, but he chose not to. And White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said today that if Trump wanted someone fired, he would do it. She also said he never directed anyone to do anything illegal or to mislead anyone.
But the actual findings of the report contradict that; investigators found that Trump did pressure aides to relay messages that weren't true. A former White House attorney, Jim Shultz, worked with McGahn in the administration. He spoke with Morning Edition today, and he said there were - that there are times when staff can't carry out a directive. Here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
JIM SCHULTZ: From time to time, it's customary for White House staff or governor staff - I served as general counsel to a governor here in Pennsylvania - when you're in those positions, it's your job to tell the boss, no. And that's what Don McGahn did in this instance.
RASCOE: So his argument was that this was not unusual, but obviously, in the case of trying to fire Mueller, that would have had huge political ramifications; it wasn't, like, a run-of-the-mill policy matter.
CORNISH: Now, have there been other instances outside of the Mueller probe where staffers haven't followed Trump's orders?
RASCOE: So this has really been an issue throughout Trump's presidency, most recently the Department of Homeland Security - there have been reports that Trump wanted his former homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, to stop accepting asylum-seekers crossing the southern border, and she refused.
There was also times early on in his administration where Trump was continually threatening to put tariffs on aluminum and steel and other - and products from China, but his advisers at the time resisted his calls to do so. Eventually, Trump just ended up announcing the tariffs, in a move that really surprised members of the administration. And there've been - also have been a lot of examples kind of on the foreign policy front.
CORNISH: What are the larger implications, though, to this dynamic between - this dynamic in the White House?
RASCOE: Well, who can forget, but at this point you might have forgotten that there was this anonymous op-ed in The New York Times by a Trump administration official last September who basically said that members of the administration worked to limit Trump's, quote, ""misguided impulses.""
And from that op-ed, you talked - that administration official said, basically, there's a two-track presidency, and that's pretty much what you end up seeing, where you have Trump saying one thing and his administration saying and doing something else. And it's not always clear what's going on or the direction that the administration is taking, and there's also a question of accountability - who's really in charge? Is it the president who was elected, or these unelected officials?
CORNISH: That's NPR's Ayesha Rascoe. Ayesha, thank you.
RASCOE: Thank you.

Republican Rep. Tom McClintock Discusses Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266657/republican-rep-tom-mcclintock-discusses-mueller-report?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., about the release of the Mueller report.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Special counsel Robert Mueller did not come to a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice in connection with the Russia investigation. But Mueller did leave the door open for Congress to explore the possibility. Mueller wrote that Congress's ability to address the president's actions documented in his report, quote, ""accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.""
And so let's turn to a member of Congress. Tom McClintock is a Republican who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, and he joins us now. Welcome.
TOM MCCLINTOCK: Thank you for having me.
CHANG: So the president is treating this report as a total exoneration. Do you think that's a fair assessment?
MCCLINTOCK: Oh, very much so. I mean, for two and a half years, we've heard morning, noon and night from the Democrats and the media that the president was an agent of Russia who was coordinating with that hostile government to overturn our elections process. Well, now, after - what? - 22 months of investigation, $25 million, thousands of subpoenas, we now know definitively that was a lie. We know that it was...
CHANG: But on the question of obstruction of justice, the report does describe at least 10 instances of questionable conduct. President Trump requested top aides to lie for him. He told his White House counsel to get Mueller fired. He told other aides to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Russia investigation. Do you find any of those details disturbing?
MCCLINTOCK: First, I think Greg Gutfeld put it best when he says 10 times nothing is still nothing. This new lie that the President obstructed justice is a conclusion that the Mueller report does not make. The charges that we hear being attempted to be used to suggest that he was obstructing justice are based, frankly, on a man who was wrongly accused - literally of treason, blowing off steam behind closed doors over the injustice of it all.
But it's going to be very hard for anybody to make a convincing case on obstruction of justice when, A, there was no underlying crime, that there was no assertion of executive privilege. The president turned over every document that was requested - over a million - released his own attorney to be questioned for 30 hours by the Mueller team.
Now, you compare that to Hillary Clinton, who destroyed 30,000 emails that were under subpoena, going so far as to destroy the hard drives that contained them, and you begin...
CHANG: But putting aside...
MCCLINTOCK: ...To get a sense of the double standard that's involved in this discussion.
CHANG: But putting aside the question of whether there could have been a criminal charge for obstruction of justice, did you find any of the details disturbing, any of the details such as he requested top aides to lie for him, where he told his White House counsel to get Mueller fired? Does that, even though it may not strike you as criminal, does it strike you as unethical or improper?
MCCLINTOCK: I don't believe he used the word fired. I think that the quote was...
CHANG: Removed.
MCCLINTOCK: ...Mueller's got to go, Mueller's got to go. Well, that's not instruction to fire anybody. That's the guy blowing off steam. If - the president certainly had the constitutional authority to fire Mueller, he did not do so. He did not issue any explicit instructions for Mueller to be fired. And Mueller wasn't fired. So I find this absolutely absurd.
CHANG: OK.
MCCLINTOCK: I think that the next phase of this investigation is not going to be obstruction of justice because there's no case to be made there. I mean, we'll certainly see the Democrats try to exploit that. But there's no case to be made.
I think what's going to happen next is we will be seeing within a few months' time the inspector general releasing a report, the Senate Judiciary Committee investigating the origin of this hoax that was used, first of all, to influence the presidential election. And we know that this was being done by top officials at the FBI, the Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies using a phony dossier they knew was false. And then when they failed to prevail in the election...
CHANG: All right. That's one...
MCCLINTOCK: ...They used it for two and a half years to undermine the legitimate election of the president of the United States.
CHANG: In the 30 seconds...
MCCLINTOCK: That's where I think the investigation is going from here.
CHANG: In the 30 seconds we have left, as - with respect to the Mueller investigation, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee is calling for Robert Mueller to testify. What questions do you have for Robert Mueller?
MCCLINTOCK: I want to know who was responsible for taking this phony dossier, leaking it to the press, using it as a justification for a phony FISA warrant to spy on an opposition presidential campaign.
CHANG: All right. That's Republican Tom McClintock of California. Thanks very much.
MCCLINTOCK: Thank you for having me.

James Holzhauer Is Shattering Records In The World Of 'Jeopardy!',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/19/715266647/james-holzhauer-is-shattering-records-in-the-world-of-jeopardy?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Audie Cornish speaks with The Ringer's Claire McNear about James Holzhauer, the Jeopardy! contestant who set the one-day record for winnings.
AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:
Now to the world of ""Jeopardy!"" where 34-year-old James Holzhauer is shattering show records.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""JEOPARDY!"")
JAMES HOLZHAUER: What is Bangkok?
What its Kyoto?
What is Kyrgyzstan?
What is curiosity?
What is dead cat?
ALEX TREBEK: Answer there - the Daily Double.
CORNISH: As of now, Holzhauer has won eleven straight games and recently set the record for most money won in a single day with a total of $131,000. The Ringer's Claire McNear has been looking into Holzhauer's strategy. She joins us in the studio. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
CLAIRE MCNEAR: Thanks so much - great to be here.
CORNISH: Just how much better is this contestant (laughter) than everyone else?
MCNEAR: He's really just a phenomenal player in a few different ways. Speaking specifically about his results, he not only has the highest single score ever. He's now the top four. He's got number one, number two, number three, number four. And he's now second in all-time regular season winnings after just Ken Jennings, who won $2.5 million back in 2004. And that was over 74 games. So he is winning more faster than any ""Jeopardy!"" contestant ever has.
CORNISH: Now, I just assume they're just smarter than us. But is - there's also some strategy involved, and I gather he's got an interesting one.
MCNEAR: There is. There's quite a bit of strategy. So what's kind of caught a lot of people's attention with him beyond the fact that he just keeps winning is he's a professional sports gambler in his non-game-show life. And he takes a very aggressive betting strategy when he plays ""Jeopardy!"" He hunts for Daily Doubles. He starts at the bottom of the board, the high-scoring clues. So that's how you get these totals that are just so much higher than what you normally see.
CORNISH: And there's a whole thing about buzzing strategy. Tell us more.
MCNEAR: Yeah, so what sets apart players like James and Ken Jennings is not just, you know, how much they know or their gambling strategy. It's that James and other players like him are really, really good at the buzzer. And the way the buzzer works on ""Jeopardy!"" is kind of complicated. Alex Trebek reads a clue, and the moment he finishes the last word, there is a ""Jeopardy!"" staffer who manually flips a switch that turns on some lights that tell the three contestants that they cannot ring in. And at that point, they can hit their buzzers and try. But if they hit their buzzers even just a moment too early before that light has gone on, they're briefly locked out of the system for a quarter second, which is usually enough time for somebody else to get in ahead of them.
So it becomes extremely important to be able to predict how, you know, Trebek is going to finish the sentence and also have a sense of when the guy operating the lights is going to hit the switch.
CORNISH: What does Holzhauer attribute his success to?
MCNEAR: I mean, he studied. He read a book called ""Secrets Of The Buzzer"" by this guy Fritz Holznagel, who was a '90s ""Jeopardy!"" champion and has come on the show a few times since. And he came up with kind of a general rubric of best practices that, you know, cut his buzzer reaction time in half, stuff like use your thumb, and always watch where that light is going to turn on. Just stare at that. Wait for that to happen - even something like chug a cup of coffee before you go on the stage because he said that shaved, like, five one-thousandths of a second off his reaction time.
CORNISH: Is there something about his style of play that has kind of shaken up the culture of ""Jeopardy!"" so to speak?
MCNEAR: A little bit. I mean, you know, ""Jeopardy!"" purists always want to see players kind of start at the top of the board and slowly move their way down. But a lot of players kind of move away from that now knowing that the Daily Doubles often sit at the bottom of the board.
I spoke to a few players about kind of what has helped James have so much success, and they said that he has a lot of experience gambling large amounts of money. It probably doesn't faze him as much to put $30,000 on the line as it would like most people. He's done that. He does that for his day job. So I think that helps him a lot.
CORNISH: That's Claire McNear, writer at The Ringer. Thanks for your enthusiasm.
MCNEAR: Thank you so much for having me.

Jacob Yakob/Lionsgate Moms perform heroic tasks every day, but they rarely get portrayed as superheroes. That changes in the new film Fast Color, which tells the story of three generations of black women — a daughter, a mother and a granddaughter — all of whom have supernatural powers.
The main character, Ruth, is played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. ""She really has this almost elemental ability to control the elements of the Earth ... and she's having difficulty controlling it,"" explains Mbatha-Raw. Ruth's seizures cause earthquakes and ""it's almost a shameful thing for her because it's disruptive and she doesn't know how to direct that power.""
Ruth had a daughter, Lila (Saniyya Sidney), when she was very young, and left her to be raised by her grandmother, Bo (Lorraine Toussaint). The film follows the three women as they grapple with fraught family relationships, and the extraordinary power they share.
Interview Highlights On moms as superheroes
Julia Hart — a wonderful writer director — she wrote this script after she'd had her first child and felt ... that women's power ... their ultimate power, is creation. We haven't really celebrated that in films before in this way, you know, and I think there is a sense that motherhood is something that means your creativity in your career, or in your life, somehow has to slow down. And I think certainly for Julia, it accelerated and it brought forth this story. So I think celebrating, you know, women's ultimate superpower being motherhood itself is something I'm really proud to be a part of.
On what Ruth is running from
We start off in the film and Ruth is kind of on the run — and it's very mysterious — we don't really know what she's running from. But we then flashback in the movie further to see her childhood, her adolescence, and her sort of struggling with herself — her identity, her relationship with her mother. ...
We come to understand that Ruth is not really on the run from somebody; she's sort of on the run from herself. She's on the run from her own power. ... She's really running from the identity of motherhood. ... [She] has these many demons inside of her, and she's not really sure how to harness her full, authentic self.
On having a power that must be hidden
I was drawn to the idea of women not feeling comfortable to express themselves and not feeling like they were living in a world where they were being listened to or appreciated. We shot this movie almost two springs ago ... it's been fascinating to see, you know, this awakening that's happened for women over the last two years. ... The resonances there are so distinct and strong. But I think certainly in the film it's really about women as a culture being able to become comfortable with their power which is already inside them.

Jacob Yakob/Lionsgate On superpowers being passed down through women
It's about that idea of legacy. ... The idea of it just being women really is so empowering, especially where we are culturally. To see that we are all connected through the generations ... it's almost like passing on the baton of wisdom.
You look at what's happening now with the women's movement and ... looking back a few generations to feminism in the '70s, and how it's evolved now, and the next generation of young girls that are growing up, you know, with social media and ... how they can feel all of that ... connectivity globally now through the Internet. ... It's about women feeling a sense of community as well.
On whether the film was meant to be about ""Black Girl Magic""
The characters weren't ethnically specific in the script. ... So I wasn't really endowing them with any racial connotations. ... It's only really in retrospect in talking about the film afterwards that people have drawn that out of it and have endowed it with that culturally. So I think that's part of the power of film as well, is that you bring your own experience to it. ... It was just these three women as scripted, and then Julia cast myself, Lorraine and Saniyya and suddenly it brought on another level of cultural significance and meaning.

Gene Yaw (R- Bradford) speaking that the Midstream PA conference in State College in 2016. Marie Cusick/ StateImpact Pennsylvania
In October 2016, state senator Gene Yaw (R- Bradford) made a joke while giving a speech at an oil and gas industry conference in State College.
“I’m contemplating filing a bill that would prohibit the transportation into New York of any gas that’s producing by fracking,” he said with a laugh.
The audience of oil and gas industry representatives at the Midstream PA conference dutifully laughed and lightly applauded. When asked, Yaw said he was kidding.
Two-and-half years later, he’s getting serious. Sort of.
‘Get people talking’
On Thursday Yaw filed a memo seeking co-sponsors for a resolution to ban Pennsylvania’s gas from being transported to Maryland, New Jersey, and New York. The move is driven by what many in the industry see as the hypocrisy of neighboring states. Although they are major consumers , they haven’t welcomed fracking or pipeline development in their own backyards.
The only problem with Yaw’s idea is the state legislature has no jurisdiction over the interstate sale of natural gas—that’s the job of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Yaw’s spokesman Nick Troutman acknowledges that fact, but said the memo is to aimed at bringing the issue to light, “to get people talking.”
In a press release, Yaw mistakenly blamed the late New York Governor Mario Cuomo, father of current Governor Andrew Cuomo, for banning fracking .
The resolution wasn’t the only thing Yaw was up to this week.
On Tuesday, the state Environmental Quality Board (of which he is a member) advanced a petition to create an economy-wide cap-and-trade program , aimed at dramatically cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Yaw wasn’t at the meeting. Instead, he was touting the passage of a bill he’d sponsored to formally designate the Hellbender as Pennsylvania’s state amphibian . He sent Troutman in his place to vote against the climate proposal. In an interview the following day with StateImpact Pennsylvania after his remarks at the 2019 Upstream PA conference, Yaw seemed unaware the petition had advanced.
“It was approved?” he asked, turning to Troutman.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Yaw said. “But there’s not much more I can say about it.”
‘You’re interrupting my sandwich’
Yaw went on to say he doesn’t see a lot of support for bailing out Pennsylvania’s nuclear power industry , which is pushing a proposal that would create an approximately $500 million annual subsidy for the state’s five plants. The nuclear industry, environmental organizations, members of the state’s bipartisan Nuclear Energy Caucus, many economists , and the region’s power grid operator have suggested that putting a price on carbon –requiring polluters to pay for their emissions–would be a more market-friendly way to address climate change and the economic troubles facing nuclear plants.
Despite Yaw’s disapproval of the cap-and-trade proposal (which is one way to price carbon) he said he doesn’t have an opinion on carbon pricing.
“I haven’t looked at it,” he said. “I can’t really speak intelligently about it.”
After answering StateImpact Pennsylvania’s questions about energy and environmental issues for a little more than seven minutes, Yaw looked longingly at the lunch buffet next to him and asked to wrap things up.
“You’re interrupting my sandwich—my ability to get it,” he said. Explainers"

Russian Foreign Ministry/AP President Trump told Russian officials last week that he had fired the ""nut job"" FBI Director James Comey to ease the pressure of the mounting investigation into his campaign's ties to Russia, according to a report from The New York Times .
""I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,"" Trump told the Russian foreign minister and U.S. ambassador on May 10 during an Oval Office meeting, according to a transcript of the meeting read to The Times by a U.S. official. ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.""
White House press secretary Sean Spicer did not dispute the account of the conversation to The Times and, in a statement to NPR, argued that the Russia investigation was harming U.S. foreign policy.
""The President has always emphasized the importance of making deals with Russia as it relates to Syria, Ukraine, defeating ISIS and other key issues for the benefit and safety of the American people. By grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia's actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,"" Spicer said. ""The investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.""
The May 10 meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak came one day after Trump abruptly fired Comey, which the White House argued at first was because of a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein pointing to Comey's mismanagement of the investigation into Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's private email server. Trump later said he had already decided to fire Comey regardless of Rosenstein's memo, which the deputy attorney general confirmed to Congress this week.
Politics Reports: Trump Gave Classified Info To Russians During White House Visit At the same meeting, The Washington Post reported earlier this week , Trump had given the Russians "" highly classified information "" that ""jeopardized a critical source of intelligence"" on ISIS that came from a key ally, which, according to later reports, was Israel. No American reporters were allowed in to document the meeting, only a Russian Foreign Ministry photographer.
The Times report on Friday afternoon is just the latest bombshell story over the past week and adds to mounting headaches for the White House just as Trump has departed for his first foreign trip as president.
Politics Former FBI Director Mueller Appointed As Special Counsel To Oversee Russia Probe Politics President Trump Denies Asking Comey To Scuttle Flynn Investigation Amid growing pressure, Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special counsel to oversee the Department of Justice's Russia investigation. Mueller was tapped for that post the day after another report from The Times, subsequently confirmed to NPR by two sources, that Trump had asked Comey to scuttle the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn was let go after less than a month on the job after it was revealed he had misled Vice President Pence over his conversation during the transition with Kislyak about U.S. sanctions.
Politics Sources: Trump Asked Comey To Shut Down Flynn Investigation Trump has denied he asked Comey to do that, though Comey wrote a memo after their encounter memorializing Trump's words to that effect (""I hope you can let this go""), according to sources close to the former FBI director .
""There is no collusion between, certainly myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians. Zero,"" Trump said Thursday during a news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.

"20 Years After Columbine, Fed's Background Checks Haven't Stopped Mass Shootings : NPR",www.npr.org,Brakkton Booker,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers,"Enlarge this image On April 25, 1999, a memorial service honors the victims of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colo. Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP On April 25, 1999, a memorial service honors the victims of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colo.
Eric Gay/AP Twenty years ago, a pair of students killed a teacher and a dozen of their classmates at a high school in Littleton, Colo. The shooters at Columbine High School used semi-automatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns in the attack before turning the guns on themselves.
Just a few months before that shooting, the FBI launched the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to try to prevent dangerous individuals from purchasing guns.
And in the two decades since, the federal government says it has conducted hundreds of millions of background checks . With critical shortcomings in the system, though, mass shootings continue in the U.S.
""The weakness of the NICS system is talked about mostly in the wake of a tragic shooting, which happens more often than not,"" says Stephen Morris, a former FBI assistant director for the Criminal Justice Information Services Division, which oversees NICS.
NICS functions today much like it did 20 years ago. When someone wants to buy a firearm, a federally licensed gun dealer contacts the system. Usually within minutes, federal investigators receive the request and begin searching for clues within three main databases to approve or deny the purchase.
The FBI says the system has denied more than 1.3 million firearm transfers since NICS first began operating.
If more research needs to be done, the purchase can be delayed for up to three business days. If in that time investigators can't complete the additional background check, federal law allows the gun dealer to proceed with the transaction.
StoryCorps 20 Years Later, Sibling Columbine Survivors Reflect In 2015, a white supremacist in Charleston, S.C., was able to obtain a gun after the FBI failed to complete his background check before the three-day deadline.
The gun purchase was able to go through and that shooter later killed nine black churchgoers.
As NPR reported later, it was discovered the shooter had admitted possessing a controlled substance during an arrest. That should have been sufficient to deny the purchase on the grounds of ""an unlawful drug user or addict.""
Since it was created in late 1998, NICS has initiated some 311 million background checks, including 26 million in 2018 alone, the federal government says.
""We're talking about a system and a process that was created over 20 years ago. It goes without saying the system is stressed out,"" says Morris, the former FBI official.
The NICS system relies on state and local agencies to make the data more robust, but sometimes records can be missing or incomplete.
""Like any database, the system is only as good as the records put in that system,"" says Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. ""There are some very real world examples of where the background check system was not accurate.""
Consider the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007, in which 33 people died, including the gunman.
In that case, Virginia court documents released after the rampage showed a judge had previously declared the man ""mentally ill"" and ordered him to seek treatment. But at the time, Virginia wasn't fully sharing information with NICS. Had that information been in the system, there is a better chance the gunman would not have been able to obtain his guns.
National How Effective Are School Lockdown Drills? In 2017, a gunman killed 27 people including himself in Sutherland Springs, Texas. He was an Air Force veteran and purchased an assault-style rifle and two handguns, but a domestic violence conviction during his time of service should have barred him from possessing the weapons. The Air Force never entered that information into NICS.
Following those attacks, Congress passed legislation to try to address the lapses, including offering states more financial incentives to share information with NICS.
After high-profile shootings, gun violence prevention advocates often renew their calls for universal background checks. Those would require background checks on virtually all gun sales, not just ones administered by federally licensed gun dealers.
Keane, with the gun industry trade association, says he doesn't think federal universal background checks are the solution.
""We think we have to work to fix the NICS system before you even have a conversation about expanding it,"" Keane says. ""That does not make sense to us to expand background checks, through so-called universal background checks, when the system we have now is not working as it should be.""
But 20 states, including California, Connecticut and Vermont, extend background checks to include private sales of at least some firearm transactions. That's according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Just this week, an 18-year-old woman , who authorities say had an ""infatuation"" with the Columbine High School shooting, flew from Miami to Denver and within hours purchased a shotgun along with ammunition.
More than a dozen school districts in the Denver area, including Columbine High School, were closed Wednesday while a ""massive manhunt"" was underway for the woman. Her body was recovered later that day, after she apparently killed herself.
The gun shop owner who sold the guns posted on Facebook that the woman passed both the Colorado Bureau Investigation background check system as well as NICS.
""She did go through the full background check, and was given a clearance by both NICS and CBI,"" wrote Josh Rayburn. ""We had no reason to suspect she was a threat to either herself or anyone else.""

"Book Review: 'Arid Dreams,' By Duanwad Pimwana : NPR",www.npr.org,Lily Meyer,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714870791/emotionally-complex-arid-dreams-operates-on-multiple-levels,"Arid Dreams Stories
by Duanwad Pimwana
Paperback, 189 Arid Dreams Subtitle Stories Author Duanwad Pimwana Duanwad Pimwana is one of Thailand's preeminent female writers. She's beloved for her writing across forms, but especially acclaimed for her short fiction, translated for the first time in the excellent 13-story sampler Arid Dreams. Pimwana's translator, Mui Poopoksakul, does a beautiful job with prose and selection alike, offering stories from the first two decades of Pimwana's literary career. As a result, Arid Dreams serves as both an introduction to Pimwana's style and preoccupations, and a sped-up way to watch her grow from a gifted story writer to an utter master of the form.
This is not to say that Arid Dreams is perfect. Its stories range from exceptional to definitively flawed, but its few misfires serve to illuminate the rest of the collection in fascinating and relevant ways. Take ""The Attendant,"" in which a farmer-turned-elevator-attendant laments his new life of silence and enclosure. ""A body cannot survive sitting still in a confined area forever, so my limping heart tells me,"" the attendant protests, and it seems a short story can't, either. ""The Attendant"" has too slow a pulse to fully succeed. Within Arid Dreams , though, it becomes a marker of Pimwana's abiding interest in entrapment.
In the collection's title story, which is also its newest, Pimwana traps one of her characters on an island, not in an elevator. The narrator of ""Arid Dreams"" is a Thai man who goes on an island vacation, hoping for a few days of relaxation and some beachfront massages. He's immediately taken with a beautiful young masseuse named Jiew, and once he discovers that she's a sex worker, he becomes determined to sleep with her. She turns him down, though: ""I don't sleep with Thai men because the island's a small world ... The fact that I'm a prostitute to westerners [is] something temporary. We meet, then we go our separate ways. But if you're a prostitute in your hometown, that's what you'll be until the day you die."" Jiew does not have the resources to leave her island or community. Her only escape is to an imagined future when sex work will no longer be among the conditions of her life.
'Arid Dreams' serves as both an introduction to Pimwana's style and preoccupations, and a sped-up way to watch her grow from a gifted story writer to an utter master of the form.
The narrator of ""Arid Dreams"" does not push Jiew for sex, but many of Pimwana's male protagonists would have behaved differently. She writes often about straight male sexuality, which appears on a spectrum from patriarchal to predatory. In ""Kanda's Eyebrows,"" the narrator feels ""cheated"" because his wife, Kanda, stops wearing stylish outfits and a full face of makeup after they get married; in ""Men's Rights,"" a husband named Wasu decides to murder his wife, Namfon, for cheating. Both are surrounded by other men who encourage their behavior, and in both cases, the results are the same: The men are increasingly unhappy, and the women around them are increasingly unsafe.
Book Reviews Stories Converge In A Flooded 'Bangkok' All of Pimwana's stories operate at a very high emotional pitch. The narrator of ""Arid Dreams"" tracks his responses to Jiew like a statistician or a Sally Rooney character, noting every slight shift in feeling. In ""Men's Rights,"" she writes Wasu's inner life with such minute detail that he emerges simultaneously as a monster, a tragic antihero, and a pitiable jerk. Perhaps the best example of Pimwana's attention to emotional detail is ""The Awaiter,"" a story in which nothing happens. The protagonist finds three hundred and fifty baht on the ground at a bus station; he stands on the spot for hours, waiting for the money's rightful owner to come and claim it. While there, he ruminates on luck, ethics, and his desire to lead ""a life to which others are connected."" By the time the story ends, it has transformed into a highly moving reflection on hope in the face of solitude — without a single moment of visible action.
Pimwana is profoundly good at compression. She can turn a moment or gesture into the point at which an entire life turns. Unusually, she's able to do this as both tragedy and comedy.
Pimwana is profoundly good at compression. She can turn a moment or gesture into the point at which an entire life turns. Unusually, she's able to do this as both tragedy and comedy. In ""How a Lad Found His Uncle and Learned a Lesson,"" she revisits the same feminist concerns found in ""Men's Rights"" and ""Arid Dreams,"" but this time her narrator is a prototypical literary innocent, unable to detect unkindness even in himself. The result is both comic and infuriating, another habit of Pimwana's. Most of the stories in Arid Dreams land in dual emotional territory, nudging the reader to reconsider her laughter in the light of her rage, or her rage in the light of her empathy. Pimwana's skill at creating multiplicity makes her mastery clear. Each of her stories poses its own moral challenge, pleasurable and unsettling at once. Taken together, they are a phenomenal puzzle to read.

'Physically And Mentally Draining': The Economic Hardships U.S. Dairy Farmers Face : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393992/physically-and-mentally-draining-the-economic-hardships-u-s-dairy-farmers-face,"Penny Berg and her son, Mark Berg, tell NPR's Scott Simon about the current economic difficulties facing American dairy farmers.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
These are hard times for many Americans. For American dairy farmers, even a bit more. Milk prices are now just two-thirds what they were five years ago. Cows are making more milk, even as plant-based substitutes like soy milk, almond milk, rice milk and others have captured more of the market. Mark Berg, a dairy farmer in Pine Island, Minn., who's in business with his parents, Tom and Penny, posted a video on Facebook to try to explain some of the brutal economics farmers now confront.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MARK BERG: I love these fricking cows more than anything else. I don't want to do anything else, you know? And then, you know, I don't - I'm not financially stable enough to take over a farm. And you can't take over a business that's going to fail, you know? And this is like a guaranteed failure.
SIMON: It's been seen almost half a million times all over the world. Mark Berg and his mother, Penny Berg, join us now. I want to thank you both very much for being with us.
M BERG: Thank you.
PENNY BERG: Thank you.
SIMON: Penny Berg, let me begin with you. How much money do you make in the dairy business today, as opposed to five years ago?
P BERG: Well, what Tom and I have always done is we've always been able to put money into our savings. Like, if we sell a cow or if we sell a calf or, like, we get checks, you know, at the beginning of the year. Well, with the milk prices being down for the last four years, as of right now, our savings has dwindled to zero. And so every check - it all has to go directly into our checking account to make ends meet. And after four years, it's not making ends meet.
SIMON: Well, give us, if you could, please, some idea of some of the hard decisions you have to make just to get by week to week, month to month.
P BERG: One of the hardest decisions for us is we're trying to decide which of our animals will have to be sold. We'll probably have to sell around at least 20. And the feed purchase prices are very high at this time, too, so we'll have to sell animals so we have enough to feed the ones we do have.
SIMON: Can you give us an idea of how hard you work - what a day is like for you?
P BERG: There are mornings that I'm up as early as 3:30. We feed calves before we start our morning milking around 6 o'clock. This morning, I was up, for example, at 10 to 4 and will probably get in the house tonight, I would say, 9:30 or so. Of course, we stop and have lunch together. And if I'm not outside helping Mark and Tom, I'm inside doing book work or trying to do some laundry, if that's possible.
SIMON: Do you ever have a day off?
P BERG: Well, we try to have at least a milking off, and that usually ends up for Tom and me on a Sunday night. And if Mark has a date with his girlfriend or something, we try to give him time off, too. It is hard. I mean, we have very, very good high school young men that come and help us after they're done at school. That helps the work load some, but it's still there.
SIMON: Mark Berg, what's it like for you to see your mother work this hard - and your father?
M BERG: You know, to watch mom and dad work that hard, I mean, it's - if I had to describe it in a word, it'd be unfair - just because, you know, both mom and him are getting older, and they work harder now than they ever have in their whole life. And it's not only physically draining, but it's mentally draining.
SIMON: Why did you take the step of sharing your circumstances and worries on Facebook?
M BERG: I guess what - maybe what brought me to post it was that I don't like to see the frustration in my family like it is. And I - and it's because this is just a hard business to be in currently for everyone. And I mostly posted it to just inform people who I know personally. And it ended up reaching a global scale.
SIMON: Penny Berg, hard for you to hear your son talk like that?
P BERG: Yeah, it is. It's hard for the whole family. I'm glad he did what he did, though, because the responses have - that he's gotten back have been overwhelming. I mean, it's - there's farmers that have been my husband and I's age that have said, thank you, Mark, for doing this because we couldn't have. And I feel the same way. I could've never done that. Farmers are proud people, and they're not going to tell somebody that they're having rough times. So I think what Mark did was exceptional.
SIMON: Mark Berg, do you ever think about going into another line of work?
M BERG: At this point, I guess I've never - I don't see myself doing another line of work just because of the fact that, you know, I love taking care of the animals. And I know for a fact that now I'm at the point in my life where if cows were not a part of my day, I wouldn't be happy with what I was doing.
SIMON: Penny Berg, you see a way out?
P BERG: I kind of have the same feelings that Mark does. I guess the way out would be to have the milk prices increase. But I can't see myself with an empty barn. I've - I love the animals, and I can't see myself do anything else. I just can't.
SIMON: Penny Berg, Mark Berg - mother and son dairy farmers in Minnesota - thank you so much for being with us.
M BERG: Thank you.
P BERG: Thank you for having us.

Grocery workers in New England are striking to preserve pensions and other benefits. Their employer, Stop and Shop, says it can't compete unless it brings down costs.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
There was a time when a teenager could take an after-school job bagging groceries, move up the career ladder and one day retire from the same company with a pension. That's rare these days, but strikers contend it should still be possible at the Massachusetts-based grocery chain Stop & Shop. From member station WBUR, Callum Borchers reports on workers' campaigns to keep benefits the company says are unsustainable.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED STRIKERS: (Chanting) If you don't get it, shut it down. If you don't get it, shut it down.
CALLUM BORCHERS, BYLINE: Some 31,000 New England grocery workers have been on strike for a week and a half. They want a new contract that preserves the wages, health care and retirement benefits that long-timers like Peter Amati have always enjoyed.
PETER AMATI: I started 11 days after I turned 16. So next week, I start my 59th year if Stop & Shop's still in business.
BORCHERS: The company wants to stop increasing pension contributions for the many workers who don't have Amati's seniority. They also want to stop paying new hires time and a half on Sundays. Stop & Shop is owned by the Dutch conglomerate Ahold Delhaize, which also owns other grocery chains like Giant, Food Lion and Hannaford. Many workers at those sister companies are unionized, and in recent years, they, too, have protested changes in working conditions. Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and potential candidate Joe Biden have embraced Stop & Shop workers, as David standing up to a corporate Goliath.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED STRIKERS: (Chanting) Hey, hey, ho, ho. Corporate greed has got to go. Hey, hey, ho, ho.
BORCHERS: Stop & Shop declined multiple interview requests. Trade groups of which it is a member also declined. But in written statements, the company has said it can't compete with other grocers if it continues to offer the compensation packages it has in the past. It's taken the unusual step of posting proposed contract terms on its website. The company is apparently trying to show customers that its offer is better than what many blue-collar workers get, says Nicholas Anastasopoulos. He's a labor attorney who represents businesses in collective bargaining and is not affiliated with Stop & Shop.
NICHOLAS ANASTASOPOULOS: When you put something like that out there, the average person that is sort of wandering, coming across that picket line is doing a comparison and taking inventory of what their last couple of years have looked like in terms of what they're getting from their employer or not getting from their employer.
BORCHERS: Stop & Shop is asking workers to pay more for health insurance, but says they'd still pay less than the national average. Figures from the Kaiser Family Foundation support the claim. The company also suggests it's generous to offer any pension at all, saying it is, quote, ""virtually alone among New England supermarkets.""
JIM CARVALHO: I think we'd push back very hard on that.
BORCHERS: Jim Carvalho is the political director of a local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. He represents about a third of the striking Stop & Shop employees.
CARVALHO: Our members over the years have sacrificed in other areas to keep certain areas like health care pensions strong.
BORCHERS: And the rare quality of Stop & Shop's benefits is not a reason to cut them, says Judy Coughlin. It's all the more reason to save what workers have.
JUDY COUGHLIN: They're all of us, right? I mean, if they lose, we're all next. You're next. I'm next. The greed never stops. The people at the top never have enough.
BORCHERS: Coughlin doesn't even work at Stop & Shop. But like many members of other unions, she's joined the picket line to try to preserve the sort of working-class jobs that are fading. For NPR News, I'm Callum Borchers in Boston. Facebook"
Disciplining Kids Without Yelling: Readers Tell Us Their Tricks,www.npr.org,Michaeleen Doucleff,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/04/20/708806109/disciplining-kids-without-yelling-readers-tell-us-their-tricks,"Malaka Gharib/NPR Malaka Gharib/NPR
Is it possible to raise children without shouting, scolding — or even talking to kids with an angry tone?
Last month, we wrote about supermoms up in the Arctic who pulled off this daunting task with ease. They use a powerful suite of tools, which includes storytelling, playful dramas and many questions. Can Inuit Moms Help Me Tame My 3-Year-Old's Anger?
But Inuit parents aren't the only ones with creative alternatives to scolding and timeouts. Goats and Soda readers sent in more than 300 tricks for getting kids to listen without raising your voice — sometimes without even saying a word.
This story is part of a series from NPR's Science desk called The Other Side of Anger . There's no question that we're in angry times. It's in our politics, our schools and our homes. Anger can be a destructive emotion, but it can also be a positive force.
Join NPR in our exploration of anger and what we can learn from this powerful emotion. Read and listen to stories in the series here.
Here are the highlights, which have been edited for clarity and length.
Step 1: Go into Grandma Mode
The first step to no-yell parenting is to get a grip on your own anger, Inuit moms told us. As I've experienced , this is not always easy. But Veda Glover has a Jedi mind trick that's helpful: ""I consciously place my mindset into a grandmother role,"" says Glover, who's a Navajo bilingual teacher in Kirtland, N.M.
""When I first started teaching, I could feel my blood pressure rising when students wouldn't listen to me and follow directions,"" she says. ""Then I came up with a question to ask myself in these situations: 'What would my own grandmother do?' ""
This strategy ""helps me keep calm and, as a result, helps my students understand that there is no need to yell nor become upset,"" says Glover.
Step 2: Learn to give ""the look""
Instead of yelling or saying ""No,"" try deploying a stern look, says teacher Vita Osborn.
""Almost telepathically, my parents conveyed pages of information in a few short looks,"" she says. ""One serious glance from my father or mother was enough to communicate that I was displeasing them in some way.""
In traditional Inuit culture, some parents wrinkle their noses to convey ""No"" to a small child. But you can make ""the look"" with eyes wide open, eyes squinty or even a blink, as teacher Kristi McEwen's mom did.
""My mother is Yupik from southwest Alaska,"" McEwen says in her response to our callout. ""When she wanted me to stop a behavior, all she had to do was slowly but firmly blink at me and that was a stern 'No.' ""
(McEwen says her mother also had an interesting way to stop bickering between cousins: ""She would have us stand in front of her and raise our arms above our heads while she commanded, 'Don't laugh,' McEwen says. ""Of course, we were in fits of giggles before we knew it."")
FWIW: I find a stern look or nose wrinkle is highly effective in the grocery store when my 3-year-old daughter is picking up candy bars in the checkout aisle. I think she hasn't figured out yet how to try to negotiate with eyes and nose.
Step 3: Put the kids to work
When a child misbehaves or makes a mistake, several readers suggested switching from being angry to being productive.
""Imagine the child knocks over a vase that belonged to your grandmother,"" says Terry Meredith. ""Rather than get angry, I say 'Can you go get the broom so we can sweep up the pieces?' ""
Then Meredith and her child work together to fix the mistake. ""I ask 'Do you think we can glue the vase back together?' "" she says. ""Then the child is involved in cleanup and repair.""
This approach teaches children the real-life consequences of their behavior, says business owner Tracy Herman, who also puts her kids to work instead of yelling.
""As they got older, if they spilled or broke something, I'd toss the appropriate tool and say, 'Clean it up,' "" she says. ""Let go of control and provide natural consequences because that is how we learn to make choices in life.""
June Shockley raised three sons with a similar strategy and says she had a ""happy healthy home.""
""I never grounded a child in my life,"" she says. ""I would give an alternate activity.""
For example, if her son was angry with about what's for dinner, Shockley would involve the child in meal prep by taking them grocery shopping and having them help cook the meal.
""That way our sons walked a mile in my shoes,"" Shockley says.
The method also tamed sibling anger.
""If one son hit his brother, I would say, 'We need more kindness in the world. Let's go to the animal shelter and clean the cages and give hugs and kisses to the puppies,' "" Shockley explains.
Step 4: Bust out Woofie
For young kids, sometimes all it takes is a little make-believe to get them to behave, says Kathryn Burnham.
""For example, if we're running late and my 3-year-old daughter needs to put on her shoes, I've learned that yelling or putting on the shoes myself makes things worse,"" says Kathryn Burnham. But when ""Woofie"" comes along, the shoes go on easy as pie.
""I make my hand into a dog by bringing [two of] my middle fingers down to my thumb for a mouth,"" Burnham says. She calls that hand dog ""Woofie.""
""Then I'll say something like 'Can Woofie have a turn trying to put on your shoes?' And I'll make silly whining, panting and barking dog sounds while Woofie helps her put on her shoes.
""The more animated I make Woofie, the more she giggles and loosens up,"" Burnham says. ""With play, the tense situation has been turned into a fun bonding moment.""
For Penny Kronz's son, a stuffed animal often does the trick.
""When he doesn't want to join an activity, I just tell him it's time for his favorite stuffed animal to go to bed or come eat,"" Kronz says. ""Then I proceed doing the activity with the stuffed animal, and he generally will quickly come join in.""
At the end of day, sometimes Mom and Dad have to let go and let the pajamas take over the parenting, says Adele Karoly.
""When my son doesn't want to put on his pajamas, I will start having the pajamas talk to me,"" she says. ""They will say something like, 'Elliot wants to wear us? And I will answer, 'I don't think he does, let me ask him.' ""
And if Elliot says ""No""?
""I will tell the pajamas and continue to have a conversation with them,"" Karoly says. ""Eventually, he will get drawn in and accept the pajamas, and they will be so excited and give him a big hug."" "

From
Some people who were students at Columbine High School in 1999 are now parents themselves. And what they experienced two decades ago is shaping how they relate to their own kids.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Twenty years ago today, the shooting at Columbine High School - for survivors, memories of their experience come up in unexpected ways. People who were students in 1999 have school-age children of their own now. Colorado Public Radio's Nathaniel Minor has the story of one family.
NATHANIEL MINOR, BYLINE: Amy Over is a bubbly, 38-year-old mom in the Denver suburbs. And she smiles a lot, especially when she talks about her kids. She remembers so many details of their big milestones, like her daughter Brie's first day of preschool. It started out great.
AMY OVER: It was a nice day. It was a nice morning. She had her cute, little backpack on and her hair perfect and in little bows.
MINOR: Brie led the way up the sidewalk to the school - her parents a few steps behind. And then it was time for Brie to go inside.
OVER: Once I actually left her, I was just like, oh, oh, my God - like, just this crippling fear inside of me.
MINOR: She felt like the walls were closing in. It was a panic attack.
OVER: Those started that day and stayed with me for a long time. It was a really dark time.
MINOR: Many Columbine survivors, not just Amy, are now raising families. And what happened on April 20, 1999, when 14 students, including the two shooters and a teacher, died - that's still part of their lives. Back then, Amy was about to graduate from high school. That morning, her coach told her she'd gotten a basketball scholarship.
OVER: I was like, I'm going to go play basketball. And everything's great. And then I go down to lunch. And that's when I heard the first gunshots.
MINOR: She dove under a table, then ran out of the building. And she made it home but had a hard time recovering. Her anxiety kept her away from people. It made her physically ill.
OVER: I was a hot mess, literally a mess.
MINOR: And then she met her husband, Curtis.
OVER: And he kind of swooped me up and took care of me. And he is my rock.
MINOR: Over time, Amy learned to work through her anxieties. She went to therapy and took up kickboxing. But one question always hung over her head. When should she talk about Columbine with her daughter? Brie is a perceptive kid. She's 13 now.
BRIE: I've always been curious. And I asked her, like, what happened?
MINOR: Amy wouldn't say much. She didn't want to spoil Brie's innocence. Then a few years ago, on the anniversary of the shooting, Brie told her mom she wanted to go with her to visit the school and the nearby memorial site. So they walked the halls together. Amy showed Brie where she heard the first gunshots, where she hid under a table. And then they visited the memorial, a stone plaza with quotes from teachers and students.
OVER: And she got to see how beautiful it was and how peaceful. And she just read all of the quotes and kind of took everything in.
MINOR: Brie says this experience was a lot for her to process. But in the moment, she was only thinking about her mom.
BRIE: I could tell that she was struggling. And I just gave her a hug because I didn't know how to support her.
MINOR: Brie was uncertain. But Amy says the hug was a huge lift.
OVER: It's like sharing it with my best friend or something - that I finally was able to kind of take a deep breath. And finally, she knows.
MINOR: Amy says she doesn't have panic attacks anymore. And watching her daughter grow up is a big part of that. When Brie's not dancing or doing homework, she's gotten involved with the movement to prevent gun violence.
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) What do we want?
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Change.
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER: (Chanting) When do we want it?
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) Now.
MINOR: Brie and Amy went to the March for Our Lives demonstration in Denver last spring. The shooting in Parkland, Fla., and her own mother's experience at Columbine motivated Brie. She felt empowered but also overwhelmed.
BRIE: It's a feeling I've never felt before. It's just, like - from my gut, I was just drained.
MINOR: Amy felt pride watching her daughter that day.
OVER: She's so sympathetic and empathetic to others. And watching her was just powerful.
MINOR: But then Brie asked her mom a painful question.
OVER: Is this going to happen to me? You know, as a - you just say, no. You know, the chances of that are really slim. But she has that in the back of her mind, you know, that - what if this could happen to me?
MINOR: It's a question Amy Over thinks about a lot. And it's one that's been on the minds of many parents ever since Columbine. For NPR News, I'm Nathaniel Minor in Denver. Copyright © 2019 NPR.

Involuntary Commitment For Addiction Treatment Raises Troubling Questions : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/20/712290717/prison-for-forced-addiction-treatment-a-parents-last-resort-has-consequences,"Enlarge this image The Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center in Plymouth houses men for court-mandated addiction treatment.

toggle caption Robin Lubbock/WBUR The Massachusetts Alcohol and Substance Abuse Center in Plymouth houses men for court-mandated addiction treatment.
Robin Lubbock/WBUR Robin Wallace thought her years of working as a counselor in addiction treatment gave her a decent understanding of the system. She has worked in private and state programs in Massachusetts and with people who were involuntarily committed to treatment.
So in 2017, as her 33-year-old son, Sean Wallace, continued to struggle with heroin use — after years of coping with mental health issues and substance use — she thought she was making the right choice in forcing him into treatment.
Shots - Health News Without Medical Support, DIY Detox Often Fails ""His behavior was erratic,"" Robin says. ""I think he had some mental health issues that were worsened by his use.""
Now she worries that her decision contributed to Sean's taking his own life.
The law known as Section 35
Robin had become one of several thousand Massachusetts residents each year who ask the courts to force a loved one into addiction treatment under a state law known as Section 35 .
The law allows a family member, physician or police officer to ask the courts to involuntarily commit someone to substance use treatment. Dozens of states have civil commitment laws, but Massachusetts is believed to use it more aggressively than most states.
In the last fiscal year, more than 6,500 Massachusetts residents were ordered into treatment this way.
After a court clinician in Hyannis, Mass., reviewed Robin's request, a judge agreed that Sean's substance use was dangerous and ordered him committed to up to 90 days of residential treatment.
Sean had begged his mother in court that day not to go that route. He was being sent to a program, he told her, where he would be locked up and not allowed to continue taking the medication that was helping him with his addiction — methadone.
Shots - Health News Home-Based Drug Treatment Program Costs Less And Works ""I thought he misunderstood,"" says Robin. ""Because I couldn't conceive that there would be an opioid treatment program that would not provide medication-assisted treatment.""
It turns out Sean was right. Although many providers say medication is the gold standard in addiction treatment, Sean was sent to a program in a state prison in Plymouth, Mass., that does not provide the medicine.
When we spoke with Sean in 2017 — shortly after he'd spent about a month committed, he said that the conditions were inhumane and that he was often placed in segregation, or ""the hole"" — though he had not committed any crime.
""I was punished for not eating,"" Sean told us. ""That's how I ended up in the hole. If you refuse your tray, they consider it a behavioral issue. I didn't know that — I was just sick.""
He spiraled to suicide
Sean also said in that interview that he was having trouble adjusting to life after his time in the Plymouth prison.
""I just feel different,"" he said. ""I have a lot more anxiety. I feel scared. I feel like I'm going to wake up and be back there.""
Less than a year after that interview, Sean killed himself. His mother says that after that stint in civil commitment, Sean could no longer hold a job. He ended up in a psychiatric hospital and was later jailed on charges of trying to break into a house. Robin believes being locked up for addiction treatment contributed to his suicide.
""I think that his trauma was very much triggered by him being in the cell"" at the local jail, she says. ""And he just felt like he couldn't take it anymore.""
You Aren't Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 ( en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.
The sheriff wouldn't comment, but documents at the local jail confirm that Sean tried to take his own life there; he later died from those injuries.
Sean's longtime partner, Heather McDermott, says he was never the same after his civil commitment.
""He was like a big, sad, depressed tumor that I was trying to bring back to life,"" McDermott says. ""We had a home. I can't even believe we got here, and then — then he died.""
Massachusetts is one of a few states that use prisons and jails to involuntarily commit men to addiction treatment — and Massachusetts uses the approach more than most states do.
In an emailed statement, the Massachusetts Department of Correction said that its mission is to promote public safety by providing a secure treatment environment. And there is so much demand for involuntary treatment for addiction in Massachusetts that 100 more beds opened in another jail last year.
Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi says that many traditional treatment centers aren't willing to take patients who don't want to be there and that, with a declining inmate population, jails have room for these men.
""This is a very dangerous, acutely sick and — I would say — not so well-behaved population,"" Cocchi says.
Many states are going down the same road as Massachusetts — strengthening their civil commitment laws to hold people against their will so they will get treatment. And some researchers, such as Leo Beletsky of Northeastern University, say more families are choosing to have loved ones locked up because it's the only way to get immediate help.
""Limiting someone's civil rights should be the last resort and only reserved for those cases that are truly dire,"" he says.
Denise Bohan believes involuntary commitment saved her 33-year-old son's life. Families are desperate, she says, and can't reason with a loved one in the throes of addiction.
""This is a last resort,"" Bohan says. ""It's not something you do, like, just on a whim. This is a desperate act of just trying to save your child's life.""
Shots - Health News Aspiring Doctors Seek Advanced Training In Addiction Medicine Several Massachusetts officials are signaling that the law may change so that correctional facilities will not be used for men committed to involuntary addiction treatment — primarily because addiction is now widely considered a disease that requires medical treatment.
Already, a class action lawsuit against the state has been filed, charging gender discrimination — because Massachusetts stopped sending involuntarily committed women to prisons in 2016, in response to a different lawsuit.

The staging of the event often saw multiple dancers performing independent solo routines simultaneously.
Stephanie Berger/Courtesy of Brooklyn Academy of Music Merce Cunningham in 1988. AP AP The choreographer Merce Cunningham would have turned 100 years old this week. And so his revolutionary legacy in dance was commemorated with special performances in London, New York and Los Angeles called Night of 100 Solos .
As 25 performers rehearsed the program recently at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the studio was almost eerily silent — save for the sound of dancers walking, running and jumping. They were ballet dancers, modern dancers, hip-hop dancers. Most had never performed Cunningham's rigorous, idiosyncratic choreography in public.
After the run-through, Patricia Lent, who staged the Brooklyn performance, gave notes to the dancers. Lent danced with Merce Cunningham for 10 years; Night of 100 Solos was her idea.
""And the solos come from all the different decades of Merce's work,"" Lent said. ""So the earliest one we have is from the early '50s and the latest one we have is from his last dance in 2009.""
Cunningham had a unique vision, beginning with his relationship to music. He did the choreography without it, then brought all the production elements — music, costumes and scenery — together at the performance.
Performing Arts Merce Cunningham: A Life In Movement Dance Merce Cunningham's Legacy: The Dance Goes On Dance Exhibition Celebrates Merce Cunningham And His Choreography Of Chance Ken Tabachnick, who runs the Merce Cunningham Trust, says it was an idea the choreographer worked on with composer John Cage, who was Cunningham's most frequent collaborator, as well as his partner in life.
"" They developed a structure that people refer to as 'common time,' where the different elements would be created discreetly and individually apart from each other, and only come together in the common time of the performance,"" Tabachnick said.
Keith Sabado has danced with the companies of famed choreographers Mark Morris and Lucinda Childs, so he normally matches steps to music. He was one of the dancers selected for the Brooklyn show.
""Cunningham technique has its own music,"" Sabado said. ""You just have to find it, and then you have to put your own body into it.""
Enlarge this image Keith Sabado, a veteran of several major dance companies, said that Night of 100 Solos was his chance to ""commune"" with Merce Cunningham, a ""father figure"" of modern dance. Stephanie Berger/Courtesy of Brooklyn Academy of Music Stephanie Berger/Courtesy of Brooklyn Academy of Music Keith Sabado, a veteran of several major dance companies, said that Night of 100 Solos was his chance to ""commune"" with Merce Cunningham, a ""father figure"" of modern dance.
Stephanie Berger/Courtesy of Brooklyn Academy of Music He explained further: ""There's a lot of stillness and then explosion — lots of juxtaposed silent moments and then moments where they're just crazy, crazy, crazy. But, also, you can see, when you watch the work, that the body parts are all correlated to each other, but they may be doing very different things.""
Body parts doing different things at the same time are another essential aspect of Cunningham's technique, said Ken Tabachnick.
"" Cunningham separated the individual limbs and made them independent participants in the movement and technique,"" he said. ""So, the hands oftentime, or the arms, were completely separate, in terms of their movement, from what the legs were doing, or the lower half the body was doing.""
That can be really challenging for dancers who aren't used to it. Sara Mearns is a principal for the New York City Ballet.
"" It's finding the strength between your legs and your back together,"" Mearns said. ""Because when you land, you sometimes have to land and stay there in a plié, [or] in an arabesque for, like, eight counts. And I don't have to do that in ballet.""
Mearns said she's been fascinated by the way Patricia Lent has staged the event. Sometimes two, three, five dancers are performing different solos at once.
"" I think it's more interesting in that way to see two people doing something completely different, and different timings, next to each other,"" Mearns said. ""If someone's moving so slow, it makes the other person's solo moving fast look even faster.""
The unexpected connections and dialogue between the dances and the other elements came clear at the performance in Brooklyn .
The 25 dancers, in solid-colored unitards and pantsuits, performed their solos with newly composed music before a sold-out house — and to audiences watching the performance live online. Dancer Keith Sabado said he's been grateful to be part of the Cunningham centennial tribute.
"" I think of him as a father figure in modern dance terms,"" Sabado said. ""And I really appreciate that I'm getting this opportunity to commune with him, to converse with him again under these circumstances.""
Viewers can commune with Merce Cunningham by watching videos of the Brooklyn, London and LA performances at mercecunningham.org .

Nepal has long been a favorite destination of young Israeli tourist backpackers – so much so that the organization Chabad-Lubavitch puts on a huge Passover celebration to accommodate them.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Last night was the first night of Passover. Jews commemorate the Exodus from Egypt with a ritual feast to tell that story. Seders are typically family affairs, but one of the largest in the world takes place in Nepal. Danielle Preiss reports from Kathmandu.
DANIELLE PREISS, BYLINE: There's a small house in Kathmandu's tourist district where you'll hear more Hebrew than Nepali spoken. The community center is run by the Orthodox Jewish movement, Chabad. This week, Rabbi Chezky Lifshitz led a group of men in prayer in Kathmandu's only synagogue.
CHEZKY LIFSHITZ: (Speaking Hebrew).
PREISS: Most Nepalis practice Hinduism. There's a large Buddhist population, a smaller Muslim community and Christianity is growing. There are also Sikhs, Jains and Kirats, a Himalayan culture and religious practice, but no Jews. Saroj Bajracharya, the Nepali manager of the Chabad House, says the religion isn't well-known, but Nepalis are very tolerant.
SAROJ BAJRACHARYA: Our leaders in general in Nepal - they don't have any problem with other religions.
PREISS: The center mainly caters to groups of Israeli backpackers that travel Nepal, often after completing military service. Passover falls during the spring trekking season, so many now plan to be in Kathmandu for the holiday.
YULI SIMON: I think all the Israelis know about the Seder. And 'cause we are far from home, we want to do, like, real Seder.
PREISS: Twenty-three-year-old Yuli Simon recently finished her military service and is traveling for several months. After Nepal, she'll go to India. Another traveler, Jake Norton from London, was initially skeptical to spend Passover away from home.
JAKE NORTON: And then I realized quite quickly that I was going to be at one of the largest Seders in the world, which excited me quite a bit.
PREISS: But delivering a proper Passover meal to a thousand guests in Nepal is no mean feat. For the big dinner, Chabad imported about 2,000 pounds of matzah from Israel, 200 pounds of beef from New York and 25 gallons of palm oil from Malaysia. During the holiday, observant Jews avoid all leavened products. So matzah, a sort of unleavened bread, takes center stage. But the trickiest item is kosher wine.
CHANI LIFSHITZ: Because it was very tough, you know, to bring all the wine and the - so we make here alone, you know? It's - if you cannot bring it, do it, you know (laughter)?
PREISS: That's Chani Lifshitz, the rabbi's wife. The dinner requires drinking four cups of kosher wine. After years of struggling to import enough, Lifshitz started making his own in huge plastic tanks that normally store water on Kathmandu roofs.
MOSHE KLAR: This is not what I thought I'd be doing in Nepal.
PREISS: Brooklynite Moshe Klar and friends were recruited to help finish the process. To be considered kosher, the wine must be watched by a religious Jew throughout.
DAVID WOONTEILER: A God-fearing Jew.
PREISS: David Woonteiler helps Klar pour a water jug of the pungent homemade wine into a giant pressure cooker. Then they light a gas flame to quickly boil it.
WOONTEILER: Moshe, start 14 minutes - starting it?
PREISS: The boiling makes it so the wine can be handled by non-Jews and still considered kosher. For Chani Lifshitz, the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor, Passover is a time to enjoy but also to remember.
CHANI LIFSHITZ: You have to understand that we suffered so much because (inaudible) that we are Jewish people. So now when we can be together, you know, we can be - Jewish people are family.
PREISS: Here, it's just a bigger family. For NPR News, I'm Danielle Preiss in Kathmandu.

Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images The tunnel leading to Colombia's most famous church feels more like a byway into the bowels of the earth. It's dark and dank, with a faint smell of sulfur in the air. But after a few hundred yards, the shaft gradually widens to reveal Roman Catholic icons, like the Stations of the Cross and Archangel Gabriel.
And they're all carved out of salt.
Colombia's Salt Cathedral is located about 600 feet underground, in a former salt mine in Zipaquirá, just outside Bogotá. It's especially busy during Easter, with thousands attending services marking the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.
But the cathedral is also an architectural wonder, built in the caverns and tunnels left behind by miners, who extracted millions of tons of rock salt starting two centuries ago.
At the bottom, the temple opens up to reveal three naves representing the birth, life and death of Christ. There is a basilica dome, chandeliers and an enormous, floor-to-ceiling cross illuminated with purple lights. The pews are jammed with the faithful and when a choir breaks into song ahead of Mass, the sound envelops the chamber.

Rodrigo Arangua/AFP/Getty Images ""I found it to be incredibly impressive,"" said Reagan Jeffries, a Dallas-area schoolteacher, after touring the site. ""How do you even make this? How do you bring the equipment down?""
For all of its grandeur, the church had modest beginnings.
Initially, miners prayed in a small sanctuary built inside the caverns. There, they would pray to the Virgin of the Rosary of Guasá , the patron saint of miners, to protect them from toxic gases, explosions and other accidents. That first sanctuary was built in the 1930s.

Javier Galeano/AP ""The work was very dangerous,"" Juan Pablo García, a cathedral administrator, said of mining the Zipaquirá salt deposits, where commercial mining began in 1815. ""Every day that they came out of the mine alive was a reason for giving thanks.""
After extracting salt, the miners left in their wake a vast network of grottoes, pits and passageways. Retired mining engineer Jorge Castelblanco says most exhausted mines are simply abandoned and sealed up. But Zipaquirá's miners and church officials — influential figures in this deeply Catholic country — persuaded the Colombian government to convert the empty spaces into a church in 1953.
Structural problems forced its closure in 1990. That's when Castelblanco, 127 miners, plus a handful of sculptors were brought in to build the current version of the cathedral — located 200 feet below the original cathedral. (The first sanctuary from the 1930s had been closed earlier because it was unstable).

toggle caption Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images The Salt Cathedral, shown here in 2011, sits 600 feet underground.
Luis Acosta/AFP/Getty Images It was a massive undertaking. Just carving the Stations of the Cross into the walls took five years. Another challenge was transferring the massive rock salt altar from the old site to the new.
""It weighed 16 tons,"" Castelblanco said. Workers had to cut it into three pieces to make the move.
Their efforts appear to have paid off.
""It's magnificent,"" said Ana Milena Arroyo, a Catholic pilgrim from northern Colombia, after exiting the cathedral following Mass on Palm Sunday. ""It's amazing that people had the genius to build this.""
The church is also breathing new life into the local economy. Salt mining in Zipaquirá has dwindled, but now tourists and religious pilgrims flock here. Tour guide Andrés Ortiz said the site receives about 600,000 visitors annually.
And although it's not among the Seven Wonders of the World, Colombia's Congress proclaimed the Salt Cathedral to be ""the first wonder of Colombia."""

New Novel Follows Undocumented Mother's Journey Through U.S. Immigration System,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715394006/new-novel-follows-undocumented-mothers-journey-through-u-s-immigration-system,"NPR's Scott Simon asks Aaron Bobrow-Strain about his new book The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez , which documents the life of a young Mexican woman journeying through the U.S. immigration system.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""The Death And Life Of Aida Hernandez"" puts a compelling human face and story on that phrase border crisis. Aida Hernandez, which is not her real name, was born in Agua Prieta on the Mexican side of the border in 1987. But her mother was beaten by her husband, and she escaped with her family to Douglas, Ariz.
Aida became a mother at 16. She worked late at night in clubs to help support her son, but that made her vulnerable to violence from brutal men. Her struggles, triumphs, steadiness and character steer her story as it winds through immigration courts and detention centers.
Aaron Bobrow-Strain is the author of ""The Life and Death of Aida Hernandez."" He's a professor of politics at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and joins us from there. Thanks so much for being with us.
AARON BOBROW-STRAIN: Thank you. It's wonderful to be here.
SIMON: The first look we get at Aida Hernandez, whom I will call a heroine - she's in an ambulance. How did that happen and why begin the book there?
BOBROW-STRAIN: So the book follows Aida's life. She's growing up undocumented in Douglas, Ariz. And there's a lot of twists and turns along the way as she comes of age amidst this evermore punitive and violent approach to border security that we've adopted. And so I think the best way to explain how she got into the ambulance without giving too much of the story away is simply to say that in this context, living undocumented in one of the most heavily policed small towns in America, even the smallest kinds of mistakes have extremely high costs.
SIMON: Wound all throughout your story is the increasing militarization of the border. And to be fair to the current administration, you don't see it as something that just began two years ago, but has been building up for a number of years.
BOBROW-STRAIN: That's right. I first went to the border in 1993, and I worked there for four years. It was a very formative moment in the border because it was really during that moment of the Clinton administration that we began what has become - I call it a 25-year-long bipartisan obsession with deterrence, which is to say an obsession with not dealing with immigration and the border in a real substantial way, but simply by coming up with evermore cruel, evermore drastic and evermore expensive forms of deterrence, even though they don't work.
SIMON: Yeah. The book opened your eyes to the fact that many women along the border face the constant threat of sexual assault and other violence, don't they?
BOBROW-STRAIN: Yeah. That was not something I expected to write about when I went into the project. But after meeting Aida and hearing her story, I realized that you can't understand the way we've approached border security without understanding its effects on violence against women. And I want to make sure that this is really different from when Trump talks about, you know, rapists on the border. What I'm focused on is the way our own policy choices have created a climate in which violence against women flourishes.
SIMON: Well, let me get you to be even a little explicit about that. What's the argument that you make - the increased militarization of the border leads to encouraging violence against women?
BOBROW-STRAIN: So there's two parts. One is that we've channeled migration into these fairly uncontrolled areas away from ports of entry, inspection, visas. We've kind of pushed migration into deserts. As we've made border crossing more expensive, that has drawn in and attracted evermore organized and violent criminal organizations who take over smuggling operations.
And there are other ways that the book talks about how violence against women is promoted by these policies. One of the key ones that appears in the book is just that by pushing undocumented people into the shadows, it gives abusers significant power in relationships.
SIMON: Aida winds up in detention separated from her son Gabriel. The conditions in detention, as you relentlessly and graphically lay out, are grimy and crowded and heartless. But she does find a purpose there, doesn't she?
BOBROW-STRAIN: Yeah, and I think what often gets missed in reporting on immigration detention is the way in which people in detention are able to craft agency and dignity for themselves even amidst these brutal conditions. And Aida finds her voice as a leader in the immigration detention. She's fluent in English, so she's one of the people who can really help other detainees navigate the very complex and confusing immigration law. And most people in immigration detention are navigating that complex body of law on their own without the help of an attorney. In that moment, Aida is able to come into her own and find a voice helping other people understand what's happening to them as best she can.
SIMON: Aida Hernandez is not her real name, but I wonder if you felt a sense of responsibility in telling her story to the public, in throwing her life open in this intimate and personal way.
BOBROW-STRAIN: Yeah. I mean, this is something I thought about through the whole project, spent a lot of time talking with Aida. And I think there's a long history of folks writing the stories of poor people in an exploitative way for the consumption of more affluent readers. And I really wanted to avoid those pitfalls.
In the end, this isn't just a book about Aida. Really, it's a book written in collaboration with Aida about the kinds of immigration policies and economic policies that the rest of us have created. It's a book about the world we've created as much as it's a book about Aida. And in that sense, I hope it's a sympathetic portrait of Aida, but it's also - should be a look in the mirror for the rest of us because these policies have been carried out in our name, supposedly to keep us safe.
SIMON: Aaron Bobrow-Strain, his book ""The Death and Life of Aida Hernandez"" - thanks so much for being with us.
BOBROW-STRAIN: Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Plus, they discuss a new initiative aimed at making racing less deadly for horses.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
And now it's time for sports.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SIMON: And another one bites, well, the ice in the NHAL (ph) - NHL playoffs. And a WNBA star - in fact, the WNBA star - is out for surgery. NPR's Tom Goldman is here. Tom, thanks so much for being with us.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: It's my pleasure, Scott.
SIMON: Five to one last night, Calgary Flames lost to the Colorado - I should reverse that. The Colorado (imitating French accent) Avalanche - avalanche.
(LAUGHTER)
SIMON: I'm still thinking Paris, France. Avalanche defeated the Calgary Flames, and it seemed - who had such a great year. It seems like having a spectacular regular season's become a curse in the playoffs.
GOLDMAN: Yes. We should say that the (imitating French accent) Avalanche beat the Flames.
SIMON: Well, that's what they would call them in Quebec. But go ahead, yeah.
GOLDMAN: They beat the (imitating French accent) Flames...
SIMON: (Laughter).
GOLDMAN: ...Four games to one to win their opening-round series. Now, as you mentioned, yes, Calgary was the top seed in the Western Conference. And earlier this week, Tampa Bay, the top seed in the East, was swept out of the playoffs four games to none by Columbus. So this is the first time that both conference top seeds lost first-round playoff series.
And this, you know, gives life to the old playoff adage that the postseason is a new season. Everyone has a chance. Of course, some teams have more of a chance than others. But in this case, those shiny No. 1 seedings didn't matter. And as a result, there's now a lot more hope and belief among the teams still playing.
SIMON: I think we have to note something this week. Now, football can and - deserves a lot of attention for the toll it takes on the brains and bodies of players. But this week, we were reminded that hockey, a game invented by gentle Canadians, is the only team sport where players can outright brawl right in front of the referees, and the referees, you know, do nothing until the last minute and, many times, without penalty.
GOLDMAN: Yeah. And sometimes, people get hurt. I believe the fight you're talking about is between - was between Alex Ovechkin, the star of last year's Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, and 19-year-old Andrei Svechnikov of the Carolina Hurricanes. Ovechkin knocked him out and put Svechnikov in the concussion protocol. Ovechkin was given a five-minute game penalty. Scott, you know the old joke, I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out, right?
SIMON: Yes. Yes. Yes.
GOLDMAN: It is funny, but not sure it applies exactly today because fighting is on the decline in the NHL.
SIMON: Yup.
GOLDMAN: It's certainly a long way from the brawling 1980s, when fights happen all the time. And Ovechkin, also, is not known as a fighter. Still, it was disturbing, you know, to see...
SIMON: Yeah.
GOLDMAN: ...Svechnikov lying on the ice, momentarily unconscious, his arms and hands clenched. So Game 5 is tonight in Washington. The referees will probably be on high alert.
SIMON: Breanna Stewart - the WNBA season's about to begin. But Breanna Stewart, one of the league's marquee player, has been sidelined with an injury. We ought to learn something about the WNBA from that, shouldn't we?
GOLDMAN: Yeah. Well, she tore an Achilles tendon in a European championship game. She was playing for a Russian team. And it's expected she'll miss the entire WNBA season. That's a big blow...
SIMON: Yeah.
GOLDMAN: ...For the defending champion Seattle Storm. Stewie, as she's called, was a big reason they won the title last year. She was named Finals MVP. She was also the league MVP last season.
SIMON: Why do the best women players have to go overseas?
GOLDMAN: Because they don't make a lot of money in the WNBA. I mean, her base salary last season was about $56,000. And, Scott, let's state up front, you know, Breanna Stewart could've gotten hurt anywhere at any time. But the reality is by having to supplement their WNBA incomes playing overseas, which most WNBA players do...
SIMON: Yeah.
GOLDMAN: ...They often don't give their bodies enough time to rest and to heal. This - you know, making more money is going to be a part of the conversation that players have with ownership when they start bargaining on a new collective bargaining agreement.
SIMON: NPR's Tom Goldman, thanks so much.
GOLDMAN: You're welcome. Facebook"
Yellow Vest Protestors In Paris Mix With Notre Dame Cathedral Mourners,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393978/yellow-vest-protestors-in-paris-mix-with-notre-dame-cathedral-mourners,"Yellow Vest Protestors In Paris Mix With Notre Dame Cathedral Mourners Yellow Vest Protestors In Paris Mix With Notre Dame Cathedral Mourners Embed Embed
Yellow Vest protestors plan their weekly demonstrations in the wake of the fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral and calls for unity from the French president.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Yellow vest protesters are back in the streets of Paris today, as they have been each Saturday since November. They say they are enraged the government could raise a billion dollars in just a few days to help restore the Notre Dame Cathedral but can't find similar funds to help the struggling working class and elderly in France. Officials had warned demonstrators not to stir up trouble today and banned them from gathering on the Ile de la Cite, where the Notre Dame Cathedral is located. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley joins us from the streets of Paris. Eleanor, thanks so much for being with us.
ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Well, I'm happy to be with you, Scott.
SIMON: And the situation has gotten much more serious today suddenly...
BEARDSLEY: Let's say...
SIMON: ...Hasn't it?
BEARDSLEY: Yes, it's degenerated. Actually, it's a strange city today. I was just in Saint-Germain-des-Pres, where people were sitting at cafes and shopping. But now I'm at Place de la Republique where the yellow vest protest march ended. And the police are here. And I think they were trying to keep them from taking over the square.
You can hear people singing in the background, maybe. But we've witnessed just tons of volleys of tear gas being fired. I've seen wounded people being taken on stretchers with their heads bandaged into ambulances. I've seen the police and undercover police very - roughhousing, you know, manhandling people, grabbing, exfiltrating them from the protest because there's a lot of - I don't know - anarchists, troublemakers - call them what you want - who've come out here to do this.
And they're arresting them. They're taking them out. They're trying, you know, to make sure it doesn't get out of hand. So it's very chaotic. But, you know, a mile away, it's a beautiful city.
SIMON: And remind us again what the protests are about. They've been going on for so many weeks now.
BEARDSLEY: Right. They started in November because there was a gas tax. And it was the straw that broke the camel's back. A lot of people sort of rose up from the heartland. And no one realized there was all these people. This small gas tax really affected them because they have to drive maybe 20 miles to get to work. They can't make ends meet every month. And they were furious. And then this morphed into something bigger and bigger every week. This is the 23rd week. And it's a huge movement now of people who feel they've been forgotten.
And Notre Dame, this week - everyone was sad about that. The yellow vest people were sad about it. They cried. But, you know, they said, but within two days, they raised a billion for a cathedral, and we can't get anything. We've been protesting for months. And we can't make ends meet. You know, we don't even have enough food to put on the table. I don't know if they're exaggerating or not. But - and they're angry now. And there's this anger of the inequality in France - the billionaires who can rebuild Notre Dame, but they don't care about the little people. And the man, they say, who is responsible for all this is President Emmanuel Macron.
SIMON: So President Macron, of course, issued a - what much of the world found a very moving appeal for unity following the fire at Notre Dame. Did that manage to strike exactly the wrong note with the yellow vest demonstrators?
BEARDSLEY: Yes. I mean, actually, nothing Macron can say will satisfy them. And they say life is not going to stop in France because Notre Dame burned. And so they want to hear from him. And he is going to speak next week. But they're angry. And there - it feels like nothing he can say will placate them at this point.
SIMON: I - at the same time, we we hear from people in France who complain that they're finding the protests every week to be just really irritating. Are they making their point? Are they gaining more popularity?
BEARDSLEY: You know, every week, it's been a different thing. They wax and wane depending on the mood of the country that week. And yeah, the country's divided. I mean, half the country thinks these people are a nuisance, and they need to go away. But they don't go away, Scott. And it's like a little, small dog yipping at Macron's heel - actually, not so small sometimes. He can't really proceed with anything else until he solves this crisis. And it will not go away. And I think probably half the country doesn't like them. But they still have public support because I think a lot of people do see there's inequalities. And people can't, you know, really make ends meet. And - so it's a very mixed bag. I keep waiting for the poll that will say, you know, 80% of the French want the yellow vests to go home. But it doesn't come.
SIMON: NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, thanks so much.

Mueller Report: Law Professor On Prosecuting An Obstruction Of Justice Case,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393964/mueller-report-law-professor-on-prosecuting-an-obstruction-of-justice-case,"NPR's Scott Simon asks New York University law professor Ryan Goodman why he thinks the redacted Mueller report points to collusion and what he feels the odds of an obstruction of justice case are.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
And now we turn to Ryan Goodman. He teaches law at New York University and is editor-in-chief of the blog Just Security. Thanks very much for being with us.
RYAN GOODMAN: Thank you for having me.
SIMON: I gather there's no real legal definition of collusion. And again, the special counsel found that nobody on the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia, but you're not so quick to lay that aside, are you?
GOODMAN: That's right. It's true that the special counsel found that the investigation did not establish sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a crime of conspiracy. There's one major caveat I suppose I would put to that, which is that the special counsel also said, given the enormity of people who were lying to us, that materially impaired the investigation. So it's a counterfactual. But the question might be, what might they have come up with?
SIMON: Lying to investigators is a crime in and of itself, isn't it?
GOODMAN: It is, and the fact that several people did it is quite extraordinary. And then on top of that - if you layer on top of that all the obstruction, which includes kinds of assurances given to Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen where they thought they would either maybe get a pardon or the investigation would be shut down, that's another way in which it forced - at least in the case of Manafort - somebody who could've been a star witness not to cooperate.
SIMON: How do you feel, then, about the special counsel's decision to leave that question open - whether or not the President obstructed justice? You just cited some facts that possibly contradict that. You know, we know that he leaned on the FBI Director James Comey to go easy on Michael Flynn, that he told the White House counsel to get rid of Mueller.
GOODMAN: That's right. There are a series of these incidents. He basically directs Don McGahn to write a false statement about having told McGahn to get Mueller fired. So that - I think that for some people like myself and I think for many listeners, they might realize that's, like, not even just, like, destroying evidence, but it's creating evidence. So I think there are a number of these that, in the aggregate, add up to a very serious case, I would say, of obstruction. Some of them individually crossed that line, and it seems that they would have crossed that line by Mueller himself but for the fact that he was operating under the Justice Department's position that a sitting president cannot be indicted.
SIMON: So could you prosecute an obstruction of justice case if it failed you?
GOODMAN: I think that this would be a pretty straightforward case. Another way I've thought of it is, any American but for the president of the United States would be indicted for these actions. If these were all the actions that they were alleged to have committed, I'm pretty sure that's also what Mueller is sending us as a signal.
SIMON: Ryan Goodman, law professor and editor of Just Security. Thanks so much for being with us.
GOODMAN: Thank you. Facebook"
Mueller Report: Ex-Prosecutor On Why An Obstruction Of Justice Case Has Weak Odds Of Success,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393957/mueller-report-ex-prosecutor-on-why-an-obstruction-of-justice-case-has-weak-odds,"NPR's Scott Simon asks former prosecutor Solomon Wisenberg why he thinks a case against President Trump for obstruction of justice has weak odds of success.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Robert Mueller's special counsel's report revealed a lot - disarray in the White House, lies to the American people and how two people looking at the same facts can reach different conclusions, including on the letter of the law. We're going to spend the next few minutes with two legal thinkers - first, Solomon Wisenberg, criminal defense attorney who worked under Ken Starr as deputy independent counsel in the Whitewater probe. Mr. Wisenberg joins us from the studios of WUNC in Chapel Hill. Thanks so much for being with us.
SOLOMON WISENBERG: My pleasure.
SIMON: Two main parts to the Mueller report - we'll note first they concluded no one in the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russians, which does not end questions about the propriety about campaign's contacts with Russia. But let me ask you about obstruction of justice. The report says, quote, ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state."" That doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement of their integrity.
WISENBERG: Well, I would leave integrity out of it. If it was a question of judging integrity, the president would be getting a D-minus or an F by that section of the report. But Mueller has been criticized, I think with some justification, that he didn't make that call. But that's what he was supposed to do, and I think when he didn't do it, it fell upon the attorney general to make the call himself.
SIMON: Do you think the attorney general's made the right call?
WISENBERG: I think he has made the right call. There's no question that the president's conduct was abhorrent, but the question is whether or not it amounts to criminal obstruction of justice. There is only one incident that, in my opinion, comes close to constituting traditional obstruction of justice, and that is the president's efforts to get Don McGahn, his White House counsel, to issue a written statement to the effect that the president had not asked him to fire Bob Mueller. All of the other episodes, I don't think, are really close to obstruction of justice. And some of them - to even speak of them as obstruction is ludicrous. But that one is quite disturbing.
SIMON: The attorney general seemed to say the president didn't intend to obstruct justice. He was - believe his words were, just frustrated and angered - essentially letting off steam when he told Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller and then lie to the American people about it. Can you really use a defensive ignorance when we're talking about the president of the United States?
WISENBERG: Well, I think what the - the attorney general was actually using words from the Mueller report, talking about the president's motivations, what they might be. I think the attorney general was impressed with the fact that there was no underlying crime. And it's a lot easier to prove intent in an obstruction case if you have an underlying crime.
SIMON: And there's no underlying crime here.
WISENBERG: Well, according to the special counsel, he could not establish that and apparently couldn't come close to establishing that.
SIMON: That's - I don't have to tell a big-name lawyer - saying we can't establish it's a little different than saying exonerate.
WISENBERG: I really don't think so. Let's say that you're indicted. And you go to trial, and the jury finds you not guilty. All they have found is that the government hasn't proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. But I think it's fair to call that an exoneration. And I think if you've been investigated for two years and they say, we can't establish the case, I'm comfortable with calling that an exoneration.
What I'm uncomfortable with are the just multiple instances of mendacious conduct by the president of the United States. Not only does the president repeatedly lie, but he repeatedly asked his subordinates to lie. And he's incredibly fortunate that all of them refused to carry out what he wanted to do. And let me point out that the evidence that Mueller has on this point is not coming from the president's enemies. It's coming from Don McGahn, his counsel. It's coming from Corey Lewandowski, a very close friend. It's coming from Hope Hicks. It's coming from Chris Christie. These are the president's friends who are basically proving the case that he is not an admirable fellow. That's just all there is to it.
SIMON: Solomon Wisenberg, thanks very much for being with us.
WISENBERG: My pleasure. Facebook"

NPR's Scott Simon asks actress Isabella Rossellini about her new one-woman, one-dog show, ""Link Link Circus.""
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
A one-woman, one-dog show is now open in New York at the Frederick Loewe Theatre at Hunter College. It's already drawn raves on the road. ""Link Link Circus"" is a night of comic monologues, home movies, animations and impersonations that explore the link between animals and humans, especially the intelligence and emotional lives of animals. It stars a dog named Peter Pan, whose stage name is Pan, as various animals from ducks to elephants. Pan's co-star on stage and in life is Isabella Rossellini...
ISABELLA ROSSELLINI: (Laughter).
SIMON: ...The acclaimed star of films that include ""Blue Velvet,"" ""White Nights,"" ""Death Becomes Her,"" ""Big Night"" and, of course, she is a voice in ""The Incredibles 2."" Pan is resting, as big stars need to do, but Isabella Rossellini is in our New York studio. Thanks so much for being with us.
ROSSELLINI: Thank you for being here (laughter).
SIMON: Now you - you're working on a master's degree in animal behavior at Hunter.
ROSSELLINI: Yes.
SIMON: But you're doing that because of a lifetime of interest in animals.
ROSSELLINI: Yes, I was always interested in animals. My father gave me a book called ""King Solomon's Ring"" by Konrad Lorenz, who won a Nobel Prize in 1973, being the founder of animal behavioral studies. And it was literally - has - a little lamp went on my head, and I thought, this is what I want to do. I always was a child that loved animals.
SIMON: The home movies that are in the show are very touching - a little girl, her dogs, her goats, even a monkey at one point. Then, of course, you see the parents and go, oh, my god. That's Ingrid Bergman. That's Roberto Rossellini.
ROSSELLINI: (Laughter).
SIMON: That's where your relationship with animals began - in person.
ROSSELLINI: Yes. I mean, my parents - my mom, of course, was Ingrid Bergman - was a - for - maybe the younger audience doesn't know it. She was a - won 3 Oscars. She worked with Hitchcock, with Fleming. She did a classic film called ""Casablanca"" that most people have seen. My father was a very influential director after Second World War and sort of showed me the path of following something that was my passion.
SIMON: I don't know how - I don't know a nice way to say this to Isabella Rossellini. You do an awful lot of mating in this show.
ROSSELLINI: (Laughter).
SIMON: You're always mating as a different animal. Now, many of the scenes are broadly comic, you know, like the one featuring a whale. But I have to tell you; the mating of the duck was truly upsetting to me.
ROSSELLINI: Oh, was it upsetting? I think I'm full of admiration, actually. So I have to explain what happens to the duck. So the duck is - really has a lot of male jump on her and trying to mate with her. So evolution endowed her with a very labyrinthic vagina. I don't even know that it's called a vagina. They must have another name for it, but that's what it is - an - a female organ of reproduction that has many canal that she can control. So if she penetrated by the man she - by the male that she doesn't want to be the father of her ducklings, she sends him to a dead end. And that's how she controls fertility and who is - so we thought that courtship was finishing - once you accept mating, courtship was the moment where you decide to accept that male or not. But now we are seeing that there is more strategies.
SIMON: Please tell us about your four-legged co-star.
ROSSELLINI: My four-legged co-star - her name is Peter Pan, Pan on the - she is a rescue. I asked Bill Berloni, who is a man who trains dog for Broadway...
SIMON: This is a Broadway legend.
ROSSELLINI: It is a Broadway legend. And I explained to him what I wanted. I wanted a dog that was small enough so she could travel with me on the plane 'cause we took the show to many, many different cities. I also wanted a dog who had the distinct signs of domestication - patchy coat, floppy ears.
SIMON: At one point, you hold Pan like a baby and coo to her. And you turn to the audience and say, I know what you're thinking.
ROSSELLINI: Yes. I pick her up and talk to her, as we often talk to our pets, with high-pitched voice - hello, how are you? That's a nice little doggy. And then I feel like the audience is looking at me with strange eyes. And I say, I know what you're thinking. Here is Isabella, maternal instinct going astray. And she talks to her dog if it is a baby. It's typical of old women like her. It's pathetic.
And then I say to the audience, well, you are wrong. It's not my fault. It could be the fault of evolution because there has been studies about evolution. And, of course, we have probably made the wolf to become a dog, but the wolf also might have domesticated us. It is a process that went back and forth, and it has been 15,000, 20,000 years old.
Another possibility is a study done by Professor Eugene Morton. And he studied the voices - the intonation of birds and mammals. So for example, any sound that goes from down to up is always to express the light. It's not threatening. (Vocalizes). And all animal - they might not have it. (Vocalizing) is the human sound, but a bird might chirp up or an - a dog might go (vocalizing). That is always to indicate there is not a threat. But if your voice is loud and low and is a staccato - huh, huh, huh - that's always a threat. So the Morton law is maybe the language that we share with animals.
SIMON: I have to ask you a Lancome question.
ROSSELLINI: Of course.
SIMON: For years, you were the face of Lancome.
ROSSELLINI: Yes.
SIMON: And then, as I have heard the story, they said to you one day, this has been great, but...
ROSSELLINI: Yes.
ROSSELLINI: Exactly. So I...
SIMON: But - there is a but to this.
ROSSELLINI: But there is a but. I'm back at 67. So I was very surprised when they got me back. When I turned 40, Lancome said that women dream to be young. And although my campaign was very successful with me, they didn't think I could continue the campaign because a woman of 40 cannot represent women's dream. And advertisement is about the dream, which was to look 20.
So I accepted it very sadly because I loved working with Lancome, and then 23 years later, they called me back. Now there is a woman CEO, and I think that made a difference. I think she said, you know, women of all ages - all of women want to be elegant and sophisticated. And I - we want you back because you have to represent that voice. Yes, we also have anti-age cream, but we also have creams and makeup for everybody to have fun, and you can tell that story better than anybody.
SIMON: At one point, King Solomon's Ring...
ROSSELLINI: Yes.
SIMON: Of course, you know the story from when your father gave you the book. King Solomon's ring would enable us to hear what animals were saying. And you get King Solomon's ring, and you put it on. But the show suggests maybe we don't really want to hear (laughter) what animals are saying.
ROSSELLINI: I was - there was a study, a fascinating study about a scientist that said, but if we were able to talk to animals - first of all, their perception of the world is completely different. We only have five senses. They have more senses or different senses. The world for them is smell - for us is sight. So how do we communicate even if we talked? And so I want to give a little glimpse of that. So the play does end with me wearing the King Solomon's ring. And finally, I can speak to the dog - Pan - but Pan talks dog. She says, can I smell your butt? - 'cause that's the first thing.

Charles Nix, Mitch Goldstein, and Sarah Hyndman talk to NPR's Scott Simon about a recent face-lift to the typeface Helvetica, which recently got its first redesign in 35 years.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
The Helvetica typeface is widely used around the world. Don't tell us you haven't noticed. But Helvetica is being refreshed after 36 years - even a new name, Helvetica Now. But like many changes, some people are skeptical.
CHARLES NIX: Well, if I'm perfectly honest, my first reaction was, do we need another Helvetica?
SIMON: Charles Nix is type director at Monotype, the company responsible for Helvetica Now. The alter-typeface became a trending topic on Twitter. Mitch Goldstein, a design professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, tweeted, saw Helvetica trending and I thought maybe it died? And that got people talking - or, anyhow, typing.
MITCH GOLDSTEIN: Half the people were like, awesome. It's dead, finally. And I'm so glad it's gone. It's the worst. And then the other half of people were like, Helvetica's incredible. You know, it will never die.
SIMON: Graphic Designer Sarah Hyndman explains why it's such a polarizing typeface, a phrase I don't believe I've ever used before.
SARAH HYNDMAN: Helvetica is one of those typefaces that you love or hate. You either use it all the time - it's become a staple - or you feel like you've grown out of it, and it's a little bit too ubiquitous.
SIMON: Sarah Hyndman says even if people don't like the new look of the font, many agree Helvetica needed change.
HYNDMAN: There are lots of foibles in Helvetica, like the way the letters space. The L looks too much like a 1.
SIMON: And Charles Nix says Helvetica was not always versatile.
NIX: Helvetica used to not be able to be used for captions and small text because it was a little cramped. We've made it - instead of being sort of micro-challenged, we've made it, like, a micro-champion. So when you set captions in the new version of Helvetica, it really sings.
SIMON: Imagine a singing typeface. Most of the changes may not be apparent at first, but Helvetica Now is expected to make an old typeface more compatible, contemporary and less cramped - the best way to say BJ Leiderman writes our theme music.

NPR's Scott Simon asks Chris Mullin about Brexit, migration, and his new novel, The Friends of Harry Perkins . It's a follow-up to Mullin's 1982 hit book, A Very British Coup.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""A Very British Coup"" was a sensation when it was published in 1982 and again when it's made into a TV series in 1988.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""A VERY BRITISH COUP"")
OLIVER FORD DAVIES: (As Horace Tweed) Your living room, prime minister.
RAY MCANALLY: (As Harry Perkins) Oh.
DAVIES: (As Horace Tweed) And the bedroom is this way.
MCANALLY: (As Harry Perkins) Oh. Those are my books. There's my miners lamp.
DAVIES: (As Horace Tweed) And the bathroom and dressing room.
SIMON: Harry Perkins, a very left-wing Labour MP, becomes prime minister and begins to withdraw Britain from NATO, bust up media monopolies until he's quietly opposed, then stealthily deposed by his own intelligence and security services - the British deep state. The book was written by Chris Mullin, who, by the way, would become a Labour MP. He's now returned with ""The Friends of Harry Perkins,"" describing a Britain that is post-Perkins, post-Brexit, smaller, less majestic and feeling besieged. And the former MP for Sunderland South, Chris Mullin, joins us from London. Thanks so much for being with us.
CHRIS MULLIN: Thank you for having me, Scott.
SIMON: So your novel opens in 2025, six years after Brexit. What has Britain become, the way you see it here?
MULLIN: There hasn't been any great Armageddon of the sort that some people are predicting when we leave the EU. But there's been a long, steady decline into insularity and irrelevance. And then along comes Fred Thompson, who was a sidekick of Harry Perkins, my prime minister in the first book. And he starts rising up the greasy pole. And it becomes clear, as the book progresses, that he's a good deal more pragmatic and also that the very forces that destabilized the Harry Perkins government so many years before might possibly be on his side this time.
SIMON: Yeah. For an American admirer of British democracy, almost the most depressing part of your novel is the constant threat of xenophobic violence - the tragic assassination, outrageous assassination of Jo Cox, to whom the book is dedicated, being noted. It's depressing to think of British democracy marked by this violence.
MULLIN: Yes. One mustn't exaggerate. Hopefully, the Jo Cox murder, serious though it was, was a one-off by a lone nutter. But there's no doubt that an air of extremism, which we haven't seen in the recent past, has begun to contaminate British politics in some respect. The Brexit vote was motivated partly by a fear of foreigners - the idea taking hold in some quarters that lots of East Europeans, in particular, coming, taking jobs here. And that has also led to some - a resurgence of some very nasty forces.
SIMON: Yeah. it's interesting to me, though, because you seem to believe that if left-wing parties - at least in Britain - don't develop policies that limit immigration, they're not going to win elections.
MULLIN: I certainly think the issue has to be addressed. And I think it is a fair criticism of the political classes - not just in the U.K., but in Western Europe as a whole - that they have failed to take seriously the impact of mass migration on their electoral base. My guess - you might be seeing some of the same in the United States. Certainly, your president is trying to exploit that at the moment. By and large, most British politicians here of whatever party - most mainstream politicians - don't attempt to exploit that issue.
SIMON: Well - then in a democracy, how does a left-wing liberal party come up with a policy to limit immigration that's not against their principles?
MULLIN: Well, you have to devise a system that - a mechanism - and it's quite difficult to do - that distinguishes between those seeking political asylum because their life is threatened and those who are migrating for economic reasons.
SIMON: What about the argument that people who are migrating for economic reasons, in fact, are in fear for their lives? There may not be a specific bounty on their head, but their lives have been destroyed by war and famine and suffering.
MULLIN: Well, I certainly believe that where that is the case, we must deal humanely with them - and also that we have to help those countries construct viable social systems of their own so that people want to go on living there. But I do not believe that it's possible to cope with the scale of migration that is currently underway. You've only got to go to somewhere like Rome, and you see large numbers of Congolese trying to sell umbrellas and sunglasses. And they've been sold a false prospectus. They - the people smugglers - and there are a lot of racketeers at the back of all this - have sold them a vision of the life that awaits them that is actually false.
SIMON: From your point of view, what's the best resolution of Brexit right now?
MULLIN: Well, if I knew that, I'd probably be prime minister. My view, however, is that it will be quite different from what the public were promised. The public were given a - told a lot of misleading - in some cases, downright lies - about the future that awaited us. And they just - in my view, it ought to be put back to the public and see whether they want to depart on the terms that are available. If they do, then that's fine. We'll have to go.
SIMON: Chris Mullin, his new book ""The Friends of Harry Perkins"" - thank you so much for being with us.

NPR's Scott Simon speaks with Joey Mellows from Portsmouth, England, who is currently traveling around the U.S. hoping to attend 162 baseball games –– the equivalent of a Major League schedule.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Major league baseball teams play 162 games a season. And that's just how many games, major and minor, that Joey Mellows hopes to attend this year - a lot of baseball, especially for a British guy. Joey Mellows is from Portsmouth, England, and is now touring the U.S. as Baseball Brit - that's his Twitter handle.
We've caught up with him as he drives to Florida to watch a game between the Southern League Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp and the Birmingham Barons. Thanks so much for being with us, Mr. Mellows.
JOEY MELLOWS: Thank you, Mr. Simon, for having me on your show. Appreciate it.
SIMON: So what's a nice British guy doing so enamored of an American sport?
MELLOWS: I grew up in England. I spent my first 29 years there and never gave baseball a second thought at all. But then I moved to South Korea, and baseball there is such a huge part of the culture.
SIMON: Yeah.
MELLOWS: It didn't take too long before I began watching games in various Korean and Japanese ballparks.
SIMON: Now, I'm going to guess that for someone who grew up on cricket, baseball is actually a pretty speedy game.
MELLOWS: Yeah. I have no problems whatsoever, you know, with length of play. I think, you know, whether it's 2 hours, 50 minutes or 3 hours, 30 minutes, I couldn't care less. I really enjoy, you know, the time spent at a ballpark specifically. And, you know, the more time spent there, the better value.
SIMON: What do you like about the game? Wax eloquent for a moment, if you could.
MELLOWS: From just the sporting aspect, I like the fact it's kind of like a Wild West duel. You have one man holding a ball, eyeballing one gentleman holding a bat. It's very intense. And I like the fact that one man's challenging another man. And the man holding a bat is going to fail more times than not. I find something very reassuring about that as I go through my own life knowing that these, you know, sporting heroes I watch on the field fail just as regularly as I do.
SIMON: Boston Red Sox are going to play the New York Yankees in London later this year - right? - in June.
MELLOWS: Yes. This is the first time major league baseball has ever come to Europe. It's about time, I think. You know, the NFL is very well established now, and we're very excited and very grateful that, you know, two of the biggest teams in all of baseball are coming over to the London Stadium on June the 29 and June the 30. So yeah - just kind of getting ready for that now, and there's so many people back home that are, you know, working online to make sure that more people find out about baseball and more people attend this fantastic event that we've got going on.
SIMON: What would you tell your fellow Britons about - to note about baseball as they try to watch, if they give it a tumble?
MELLOWS: I'd say, you know, just be patient. You know, just, you know, watch it with a friend. And, you know, there's so much to enjoy in terms of the action itself. But one of my favorite things about baseball is that it's a sport that brings people together. I find baseball more enjoyable, personally, when I'm able to, you know, talk and think and reflect with my friends or with whoever I've gone to the ballgame with. So I would say, you know, don't try and understand everything if it's your first time, but just enjoy the action and enjoy whoever you're going to the game with.
I mean, I only discovered it four years ago - baseball - but I've, you know, I've watched - I think I watched 75 games last year in ballparks across Korea and the USA and Canada, even. And, yeah, I'm learning every day. I think that's one of the most enriching things about baseball is that there's always something you haven't seen before. And, you know, I like reading about the history. I'm catching up on that. And I just enjoy everything, really, that baseball offers.
SIMON: Don't mean to put you on the spot, but what's the best ballpark food you've had in the U.S.?
MELLOWS: I am not that adventurous, to be honest, when it comes to ballpark food. I had a mac and cheese hotdog with bacon on last night, which blew my mind. I just couldn't believe that that was something that someone created.
SIMON: Forgive me. It's going to blow more than your mind (laughter).
MELLOWS: Yeah. It was a lot to take on, and it was pretty messy, but I enjoyed it a lot.
SIMON: You are a great fan, Mr. Mellows. Joey Mellows calls himself Baseball Brit. Thanks so much for speaking with us.
MELLOWS: Oh, thank you for having me. Facebook"

On April 21, 1959, Fidel Castro arrived in New York to a crowd of 20,000 people. NPR's Scott Simon speaks with author Tony Perrottet about the Cuban leader's historic U.S. visit.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Sixty years ago, a bearded, young revolutionary marched into Havana with his band of rebels. Fidel Castro was celebrated as a liberator by many in America then as the man who'd overthrown a brutal dictator. U.S. journalists flocked to Cuba to interview him. Even Ed Sullivan got into the act. As America's foremost variety show host stood among bearded men in fatigues who were toting machine guns, Ed Sullivan practically fawned.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ED SULLIVAN: We want you to like us, and we like you - you and Cuba.
FIDEL CASTRO: Very glad and very happy for the honor of your interview.
SIMON: And a few months later, April 21, 1959, Fidel Castro took New York City by storm.
Here to tell us about what was called Fidelmania is Tony Perrottet. He's the author of ""Cuba Libre!: Che, Fidel, And The Improbable Revolution That Changed World History."" He joins us from Los Angeles. Thanks so much for being with us.
TONY PERROTTET: Oh, thanks for having me.
SIMON: We're going to get to the New York visit in a moment, but first, Ed Sullivan. I mean, we think of Elvis. We think of The Beatles. How did interviewing Fidel Castro come about - and in Cuba, no less?
PERROTTET: Well, he may have been the most powerful man in showbiz in '59, but he was somewhat insecure. He - what he really wanted was to be taken seriously as a foreign correspondent or a political commentator. So he decided that all the - every journalist in the United States wanted to interview - get the first TV interview with Fidel, so he decided to hop on a plane and go down there and meet the young rebel.
So they interview him in the town hall. It was a very improvised thing. All the guerrillas are standing around. One of them knocks over the - you know, one of - the lighting. They can't find a plug to put in the - that's powerful enough to put in the camera. But they do this interview. And it's the first - it is the first TV interview. And Ed Sullivan really falls over himself. He's really starstruck.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SULLIVAN: They said your army was communist and that you were communist. I've seen your army. They carry Bibles. Cuba, I know, is mostly Catholic. And you, too - aren't you Catholic?
CASTRO: Yes.
SIMON: At the time of the interview, there were concerns that Fidel Castro and a lot of the rebels were secretly communist, as opposed to the avowed communist that they became, right?
PERROTTET: There was a lot of concern. The - Batista, the dictator, actually hired a PR company in Washington to promote this idea that these guys were communists. But the CIA would send people down regularly to interview, you know, the revolutionaries and find their secret contacts. And they come - always come back saying that they're very - they're sort of left of center. They're nationalist, but they're not communist. And so weirdly, you have the situation where the CIA members are actually starting to support Fidel.
SIMON: Let's get to the New York visit. And to set the scene a bit, some audio from a contemporary newsreel.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: New York Pennsylvania Station rarely has seen anything like it. Only the magnetism of a Castro could produce it. For this is the spontaneous, oh-for-sure unrehearsed enthusiasm greeting the Cuban premier, bearded Fidel Castro. Visiting this town...
SIMON: And we'll explain. There's a little boy held aloft, and he has (laughter) a fake beard, little army hat, little army fatigues. What was included in this New York visit?
PERROTTET: Oh, it was very touristic in a sense. He's - he went to City Hall and, you know, met the mayor. He went up the Empire State Building and the observation deck. He went to Bronx Zoo, and he leapt over the fence and patted a tiger at one stage, much to the, you know, delight of the journalists. And then he ate a hot dog and declared the Bronx Zoo the best thing that New York has.
SIMON: And a big speech in Central Park, right?
PERROTTET: Yes, that was the climax on the last night. And some 30,000 people turned up.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: This is his hour in New York town.
SIMON: Let me ask you about some other stops that he made, including, by the way, from Washington, D.C., where we often forget he met Richard Nixon.
PERROTTET: Yes, that was the start of the trip. And so he went to D.C., and Eisenhower - President Eisenhower made sure that he was off on a golf trip. So Nixon was there, and they had this meeting. And it didn't go terribly well. (Laughter) Fidel disliked Nixon, and Nixon sort of snubbed him a little bit and was sort of very aloof. He said that Fidel was either lying about being a communist, or he's just extremely naive. And so he's just playing into the hands.
SIMON: So when Fidel Castro visited the United States 60 years ago, what was the effect on the relationship that the U.S. hoped to strike with Cuba?
PERROTTET: Well, on the popular level, it was extremely successful. He was mobbed at every stop. But on this other level - the official level - he sort of wasn't making any headway at all. He thought that he could actually be a populist, as he was in Cuba, that he could speak directly to the American people and that the government would sort of go, oh, wow. But they - Eisenhower and Nixon had other ideas.
What happened, unfortunately, was that the romantic idea of Fidel sort of started to slide. And it was a very sort of superficial obsession that the Americans had with Fidel - you know, this idea that he was this heroic figure. They expected him to sort of get out of his khakis, put on a three-piece suit and become the young lawyer that he was raised to be.
There was a communist guy who was with him at one stage, and he tried to convince Fidel to, you know, to the Red camp. And Fidel said, I would be a communist if I could be Stalin. You know, in other words, you know, if he could run the whole show, he'd be a communist. If not, not that interested. So it was kind of - he was more interested in power than the ideology.
SIMON: Tony Perrottet, author of ""Cuba Libre!,"" thanks so much for being with us.
PERROTTET: Well, thank you for having me.

Democrats Divided Over Pursuing Impeachment,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393915/democrats-divided-over-pursuing-impeachment,"Democrats Divided Over Pursuing Impeachment Democrats Divided Over Pursuing Impeachment Embed Embed
Democrats are pressing ahead with their own inquiry over the Mueller investigation, issuing a subpoena for the full report and underlying evidence. They're divided over pursuing impeachment.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Democrats still have a lot of questions about Robert Mueller's investigation. They'll get a chance to ask some of them soon when Attorney General William Barr testifies in a couple of weeks. Big question House Democrats now face is how aggressively to pursue their investigations now that the report is out and no one from the Trump campaign was charged over conspiring with Russia. NPR's congressional correspondent Sue Davis joins us. Sue, thanks so much for being with us.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.
SIMON: Let's hear what the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler - Democrat, obviously, from New York - said yesterday on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JERRY NADLER: Mueller, the special prosecutor, made very clear that he couldn't reach a determination on obstruction of justice, basically because of certain Justice Department guidelines which didn't allow him to do that - but that he laid it out for Congress.
SIMON: Laid it out for Congress - does that mean that Congress is headed for impeachment hearings?
DAVIS: As you and I sit here today, this still seems rather unlikely. Following the release of the report, Democratic leaders like House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said that this country's going to have an election in 18 months and that he believes the fate of President Trump should be left to the voters. Remember, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has always been an impeachment skeptic. She has set a bar that would have to be, in her words, overwhelming and bipartisan, meaning you would need to get some Republicans on board to do it, namely Senate Republicans. And if anything, the response from Republicans on Capitol Hill to Robert Mueller's report was, case closed. Time to move on.
SIMON: At the same time, there were Democrats who, for some time, have been saying there's enough to proceed with impeachment and this week said, look; everyone says wait for the Mueller report. Well, I've read it. And even more now, I say impeachment. Is it dividing the party?
DAVIS: On some level, absolutely. You know, at the same time, you have people like Steny Hoyer and Nancy Pelosi saying one thing. You look to the progressive left or the activist left where you have freshmen lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Ilhan Omar of Minnesota who, in response to the report, signed on to a resolution calling for impeachment proceedings to begin in the House Judiciary Committee. That is a resolution offered by another female freshman lawmaker - Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan.
Also, you have some of the leading 2020 contenders - Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings. It is certainly a reflection of where the party's base is, but it is not the presiding sentiment of the party. Lawmakers are out of town right now. We know House Democrats are going to have a conference call on Monday to begin hashing out their strategy here. Pelosi has told Democrats, in her words, Congress will not be silent. But in terms of the impeachment question, I think what you would have to see is a major shift in public opinion in order to prod Democrats in that direction 'cause of right now, their party leaders are saying, we're not going there.
SIMON: How do you explain the bipartisan agreement - Republicans and Democrats both calling for Robert Mueller to testify?
DAVIS: I think they agree they want him to appear. I think their reasons why for that agreement is very different. They have drawn very different conclusions about what this report says. Republicans see that as a political exoneration of the president, and they would like Robert Mueller to back that point up on television.
For Democrats, they see a report that does not exonerate the president. If anything, it lays out in extraordinary detail a president who encouraged bad actors to meddle in an election, who tried to interfere in the special counsel's investigation but for his aides, in many cases, who declined to carry out his directives. And they see a conclusion in this report where Robert Mueller may have just left on their doorstep a pathway to move forward on impeachment or at least to lay out a case to the people as to why Donald Trump should not be re-elected president.
SIMON: NPR's Susan Davis. Thanks so much.
DAVIS: You're welcome. Facebook"
Redacted Mueller Report Reveals Trump White House In Disarray,www.npr.org,Ron Elving,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715393898/redacted-mueller-report-reveals-trump-white-house-in-disarray,"Mueller's report didn't find evidence to support allegations the Trump campaign ""conspired or coordinated"" with Russia to win the 2016 election. But it does lay bare a Trump White House in disarray.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation did not find evidence to support allegations the Trump campaign, quote, ""conspired or coordinated with Russia"" to win the 2016 election. But it did find 10 separate attempts by the president to slow down investigations or push out officials, including Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Did President Trump try to obstruct justice? And the special counsel report also lays bare a White House that - well, I'm going to let NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving finish that sentence. Morning, Ron.
RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott.
SIMON: A White House that...
ELVING: Let's just say it's easy to understand the record-high turnover rate.
SIMON: Carlos Lozada, the great Washington Post book critic, who won the Pulitzer Prize this week, reviews the Mueller report and says it, not any other, is the best book so far about the Trump White House and says, in so many words, Omarosa was right.
ELVING: She called her book ""Unhinged"" and Mueller's book has a little bit longer title. It's ""Report On The Investigation Into Russian Interference In The 2016 Election."" So not hard to decide which you want for the movie title. But you can also choose from some of those other books, ""Fire And Fury,"" ""Team Of Vipers,"" Bob Woodward's ""Fear."" And, of course, that doesn't even mention the scary books from two former directors of the FBI. But this Mueller report has a rather unassailable purchase on the real story, Scott, because Mueller didn't just do interviews or make calls. He had the power to subpoena witnesses, get warrants and prosecute people for perjury. Now, that's an array of tools reporters can only dream about.
SIMON: And to read the report, there are instances where administration figures - these are the people closest to the president - just flat out ignored them as if they knew not to put any trust in his words or take him too seriously.
ELVING: Yes. In fact, that has become Trump's best defense against charges of obstructing justice. His defenders can say it's ambiguous because the people he ordered to obstruct justice didn't do it.
SIMON: Our congressional correspondent Susan Davis is coming up in about 10 minutes on the Democratic response - whether or not to act on calls for impeachment. But there is clearly no bipartisan amity or trust left for the attorney general.
ELVING: It's been clear for nearly a year now that William Barr volunteered for this job by writing a 19-page memo to the Justice Department saying the whole Mueller investigation was ill-conceived. He said the president really couldn't be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. And while that memo was unsolicited at the time, it was anything but unwelcome in the eyes of the president himself. So a little later on, Jeff Sessions is out as attorney general. William Barr is in. And the Mueller investigation and the Mueller report go forward under a very different regime. And just two months after he's in power, we get this.
SIMON: Let me ask you about the president's reaction because within the space of, really, a few days, he's gone from claiming total exoneration to calling the Mueller report B.S. And, of course, he didn't say B.S. I have to.
ELVING: The president has been trying to undermine the information, in particular, that came to Mueller from former White House counsel Don McGahn. McGahn has been a kind of wild card in this from the beginning. It was reported that the president told him to fire Robert Mueller in June of 2017 and later told McGahn to deny it. McGahn did neither of those. And that's all detailed and confirmed here in this report. It's one of the 10 instances you mentioned a moment ago as possible obstruction of justice that are named in the report. McGahn is said to have sat for 30 hours of interviews with the investigators basing his testimony on the notes he took after those confrontations with the president. And now the president is on Twitter, fuming about people who take, quote, ""so-called notes.""
SIMON: NPR's Ron Elving, thanks for your notes.
ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

Now she worries that her decision contributed to Sean's taking his own life.
The law known as Section 35
Robin had become one of several thousand Massachusetts residents each year who ask the courts to force a loved one into addiction treatment under a state law known as Section 35 .
The law allows a family member, physician or police officer to ask the courts to involuntarily commit someone to substance use treatment. Dozens of states have civil commitment laws, but Massachusetts is believed to use it more aggressively than most states.
In the last fiscal year, more than 6,500 Massachusetts residents were ordered into treatment this way.
After a court clinician in Hyannis, Mass., reviewed Robin's request, a judge agreed that Sean's substance use was dangerous and ordered him committed to up to 90 days of residential treatment.
Sean had begged his mother in court that day not to go that route. He was being sent to a program, he told her, where he would be locked up and not allowed to continue taking the medication that was helping him with his addiction — methadone.
Shots - Health News Home-Based Drug Treatment Program Costs Less And Works ""I thought he misunderstood,"" says Robin. ""Because I couldn't conceive that there would be an opioid treatment program that would not provide medication-assisted treatment.""
It turns out Sean was right. Although many providers say medication is the gold standard in addiction treatment, Sean was sent to a program in a state prison in Plymouth, Mass., that does not provide the medicine.
When we spoke with Sean in 2017 — shortly after he'd spent about a month committed, he said that the conditions were inhumane and that he was often placed in segregation, or ""the hole"" — though he had not committed any crime.
""I was punished for not eating,"" Sean told us. ""That's how I ended up in the hole. If you refuse your tray, they consider it a behavioral issue. I didn't know that — I was just sick.""
He spiraled to suicide
Sean also said in that interview that he was having trouble adjusting to life after his time in the Plymouth prison.
""I just feel different,"" he said. ""I have a lot more anxiety. I feel scared. I feel like I'm going to wake up and be back there.""
Less than a year after that interview, Sean killed himself. His mother says that after that stint in civil commitment, Sean could no longer hold a job. He ended up in a psychiatric hospital and was later jailed on charges of trying to break into a house. Robin believes being locked up for addiction treatment contributed to his suicide.
""I think that his trauma was very much triggered by him being in the cell"" at the local jail, she says. ""And he just felt like he couldn't take it anymore.""
You Aren't Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 ( en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.
The sheriff wouldn't comment, but documents at the local jail confirm that Sean tried to take his own life there; he later died from those injuries.
Sean's longtime partner, Heather McDermott, says he was never the same after his civil commitment.
""He was like a big, sad, depressed tumor that I was trying to bring back to life,"" McDermott says. ""We had a home. I can't even believe we got here, and then — then he died.""
Massachusetts is one of a few states that use prisons and jails to involuntarily commit men to addiction treatment — and Massachusetts uses the approach more than most states do.
In an emailed statement, the Massachusetts Department of Correction said that its mission is to promote public safety by providing a secure treatment environment. And there is so much demand for involuntary treatment for addiction in Massachusetts that 100 more beds opened in another jail last year.
Hampden County Sheriff Nick Cocchi says that many traditional treatment centers aren't willing to take patients who don't want to be there and that, with a declining inmate population, jails have room for these men.
""This is a very dangerous, acutely sick and — I would say — not so well-behaved population,"" Cocchi says.
Many states are going down the same road as Massachusetts — strengthening their civil commitment laws to hold people against their will so they will get treatment. And some researchers, such as Leo Beletsky of Northeastern University, say more families are choosing to have loved ones locked up because it's the only way to get immediate help.
""Limiting someone's civil rights should be the last resort and only reserved for those cases that are truly dire,"" he says.
Denise Bohan believes involuntary commitment saved her 33-year-old son's life. Families are desperate, she says, and can't reason with a loved one in the throes of addiction.
""This is a last resort,"" Bohan says. ""It's not something you do, like, just on a whim. This is a desperate act of just trying to save your child's life.""
Shots - Health News Aspiring Doctors Seek Advanced Training In Addiction Medicine Several Massachusetts officials are signaling that the law may change so that correctional facilities will not be used for men committed to involuntary addiction treatment — primarily because addiction is now widely considered a disease that requires medical treatment.
Already, a class action lawsuit against the state has been filed, charging gender discrimination — because Massachusetts stopped sending involuntarily committed women to prisons in 2016, in response to a different lawsuit.

toggle caption Christophe Petit Tesson/AP Firefighters line up as they wait for French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner outside Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on Tuesday.
Christophe Petit Tesson/AP More than 400 firefighters answered the call when fire broke out in the Notre Dame Cathedral this Holy Week. As Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Plus, spokesperson for the Paris firefighters, told the Agence France Press, ""One doesn't imagine as a Paris firefighter one day intervening to save Notre Dame!""
""Time worked against us,"" he said. ""The wind was against us, and we needed to retake control.""
Father Jean-Marc Fournier, a fire department chaplain on the scene, told the New York Times , ""Artworks can be reproduced, while a human life can't."" But firefighters risked their lives to save the art and relics that have been kept in Notre Dame in a kind of trust for the world.
Father Fournier helped lead a group to the locked chest that held the Crown of Thorns said to have been worn by Jesus. While Father Fournier searched for the keys to the chest, firefighters resorted to blunt force and broke it open. A human chain of emergency workers delivered to crown to safety.
Plus said, ""There is so much emotion and a little satisfaction to have been able to save what we were able to.""
Every inch of France is mapped from the center of Notre Dame. People tell time by the toll of its bells. The cathedral has been the scene of royal coronations and the crowning of cardinals, while its grounds are the setting for protests, concerts, picnics, painters, pickup soccer games and countless strolls by families, tourists and lovers.
After all these centuries, Notre Dame is still a working church. It hums with masses, baptisms, communions and millions of murmured, silent, everyday prayers, uttered over flickering vigil candles.
The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo , told firefighters when they received the nation's Medal of Honor yesterday, ""You risked your lives to save what is a part of all of us.""
Billionaires, corporations and ordinary citizens immediately pledged a billion dollars to rebuild Notre Dame. Their efforts may have encouraged more than two million dollars in contributions to an American campaign to rebuild the three African American Baptist churches set aflame in Louisiana.
Holy Week may be exactly the time to wonder how the world can find so much so quickly to rebuild an extraordinary house of faith, while so many people in the world are left to struggle with so little, in refugee camps and shattered cities.
But the fortitude of Paris firefighters can remind us, as much as the cathedral itself, of the majesty of human effort. The most magnificent edifices can be fragile. Courage, kindness and faith endure."
"20 Years After Columbine, Fed's Background Checks Haven't Stopped Mass Shootings",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/714921726/20-years-on-the-background-check-system-continues-to-miss-dangerous-gun-buyers?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image On April 25, 1999, a memorial service for the victims of the Columbine High School shooting Littleton, Colo.

toggle caption Eric Gay/AP On April 25, 1999, a memorial service for the victims of the Columbine High School shooting Littleton, Colo.
Eric Gay/AP Twenty years ago, a pair of students killed a teacher and a dozen of their classmates a high school in Littleton, Colo. The shooters at Columbine High School used semiautomatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns in the attack before turning the guns on themselves.
Just a few months before that shooting, the FBI launched the National Instant Background Check System to try and prevent dangerous individuals from purchasing guns.
And in the two decades since, the federal government says it has conducted more than hundreds of millions of background checks. With critical shortcomings in the system, though, mass shootings continue happening in the U.S.
""The weakness of the NICS system is talked about mostly in the wake of a tragic shooting, which happens more often than not,"" says Stephen Morris, a former FBI assistant director for the Criminal Justice Information Services Division, which oversees NICS.
NICS functions today much like it did 20 years ago. When someone wants to buy a firearm, a federally licensed gun dealer contacts the system and usually within minutes federal investigators receive the request and begin searching for clues within three main databases to approve or deny the purchase.
The FBI says the system has denied more than 1.3 million firearm transfers since NICS first began operating.
If more research needs to be done, the purchase can be delayed for up to three business days. If in that time investigators can't complete the additional background check, federal law allows the gun dealer to proceed with the transaction.
StoryCorps 20 Years Later, Sibling Columbine Survivors Reflect In 2015, a white supremacist in Charleston, S.C., was able to obtain a gun after the FBI failed to complete his background check before the three-day deadline.
The gun purchase was able to go through and that shooter later killed nine black churchgoers.
As NPR reported later, it was discovered the shooter had admitted to possessing a controlled substance during an arrest. That should have denied the purchase on the grounds of ""an unlawful drug user or addict.""
Since it was created in late 1998, the federal government says NICS has initiated some 311 million background checks, including 26 million in 2018 alone.
""We're talking about a system and a process that was created over 20 years ago. It goes without saying the system is stressed out,"" says Morris, the former FBI official.
The NICS system relies on state and local agencies to make the data more robust, but sometimes records can be missing or incomplete.
""Like any database, the system is only as good as the records put in that system,"" says Lawrence Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation. ""There are some very real world examples of where the background check system was not accurate""
Like at Virginia Tech in 2007 when 33 people died, including the gunman.
In that case, Virginia court documents released after the rampage showed a judge had previously declared the man ""mentally ill"" and ordered him to seek treatment. But at the time, Virginia wasn't fully sharing information with NICS. Had that information been in the system, there is a better chance the gunman would not have been able to obtain his guns.
National How Effective Are School Lockdown Drills? In 2017, a gunman killed 27 people including himself in Sutherland Springs, Texas. He was an Air Force veteran and purchased an assault-style rifle and two handguns, but a domestic violence conviction during his time of service should have barred him from possessing the weapons. The Air Force never entered that information into NICS.
Following those attacks, Congress pass legislation to try to address the lapses, including offering states more financial incentives to share information with NICS.
After high-profile shootings, gun violence prevention advocates often renew their calls for universal background checks. Those would require background checks on virtually all gun sales, not just ones administered by federally licensed gun dealers.
Lawrence Keane, with the gun industry trade association, says he doesn't think that federal universal background checks are the solution.
""We think we have to work to fix the NICS system before you even have a conversation about expanding it,"" Keane says. ""That does not make sense to us to expand background checks, through so-called universal background checks, when the system we have now is not working as it should be.""
But twenty states, including California, Connecticut and Vermont extend background checks to include private sales of at least some firearm transactions. That's according to Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Just this week, an 18-year woman authorities say had an ""infatuation"" with the Columbine High School shooting, flew from Miami to Denver and within hours purchased a shotgun along with ammunition.
More than a dozen school districts in the Denver area, including Columbine High School, were closed Wednesday while a ""massive manhunt"" was underway for the woman. Her body was recovered later that day, after apparently killing herself.
The gun shop owner who sold the guns posted on Facebook that she passed both the Colorado Bureau Investigation background check system as well as NICS.
""She did go through the full background check and was given a clearance by both NICS and CBI. We had no reason to suspect she was a threat to either herself or anyone else.""

The quiet of the late-winter morning is interrupted by a staccato of gunshots.
""Military drills,"" shrugs Kim Seung-ho, 58, the director of the DMZ Ecology Research Institute, a nonprofit organization that does research on the wildlife in the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, which is the border area between North and South Korea. A thick blanket of fog seeps over the forested hills on this late-winter morning as Kim stands, searching the horizon for birds, on the bank of the Imjin River just north of Paju, South Korea.
This morning, Kim and the institute's intern Pyo Gina, 24, are on their weekly trip to count birds just outside the DMZ, a 155-mile-long, 2.5-mile-wide strip of land that has been virtually untouched by humans for more than six decades. This strip of land became an unintentional wildlife sanctuary when the two Koreas pulled back from the area after an armistice was signed in their 1950-53 war.

The DMZ is fortified with tall, barbed-wire fences, riddled with land mines and heavily guarded by the respective countries' militaries, keeping all human disturbances to a minimum. After people left the area, plants and wildlife were able to grow unrestrained. But with increasing goodwill between North and South Korea, environmentalists like Kim fear that the protected nature of the area is changing and may lead to detrimental effects on the wildlife.
""I can't help but worry that this area will face a serious threat. If we had preserved the region because we had agreed it's environmentally valuable, then it can be kept intact regardless of political circumstances. But this region was preserved because of the presence of military forces,"" says Kim. ""Once the military tension disappears, it may naturally follow that people feel a strong urge to transform the area.""

Even with tentative overtures toward peace, the two Koreas appear to be far from a place where the DMZ would disappear completely. Talks of a peace agreement have come up in the past, like a peace declaration made in 2000 , but progress has been slow. Despite positive measures at a summit between North and South Korean leaders last fall, President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's failed summit in Hanoi in February was a setback for all.

""A sea eagle!"" gasps Pyo. The white-tailed eagle coasts on spread wings before quickly ducking around a bend in the Imjin and is lost to sight.
According to South Korea's Ministry of Environment, more than 5,000 species of plants and animals have been identified in the area, including more than 100 that are protected. Vulnerable, near-threatened and endangered animals in the DMZ include the Siberian musk deer, white-naped crane, red-crowned crane, Asiatic black bear, cinereous vulture and long-tailed goral — a species of wild goat.

Kim and Pyo count birds in the Civilian Control Zone, an area up to about 6 miles wide that runs along the southern side of the DMZ. Because of the restricted nature of the DMZ itself, the institute can only do research on the periphery. Although public access to the civilian zone is also restricted and the perimeter is lined by barbed wire and military guard posts, Kim has clearance to enter for research purposes.

""Preserving the DMZ area should also mean preserving the Civilian Control Zone,"" says Kim, standing on a narrow path between rice paddies. ""If we only preserve the DMZ proper, the variety of birds that come here will be curtailed. Small forest birds can both find enough food and inside the DMZ, but bigger birds come out here for food and go back in the DMZ just to sleep.""

The endangered red-crowned crane, one of the rarest cranes in the world, winters in the area, relying on the spent grains left in the fields of the CCZ for food and sleeping in the quiet of the DMZ. There are only about 3,000 of this type of crane left in the world, according the International Crane Foundation. The civilian zone plays an important role in the preservation of the DMZ wildlife, acting as a buffer to minimize traffic to the edges of the DMZ itself.

He fears the detrimental effects of digging up land mines and the displacement of plants that is inevitable in the process.
""Some, including myself, argue that we should leave the DMZ as it is and try not to utilize the land,"" he says.

The South Korean government is also pushing for the entire DMZ to be named a biosphere reserve through UNESCO, as a joint effort with North Korea. This allocation would require a wide buffer zone that limits development in areas alongside the DMZ. A previous application by the South Koreangovernment in 2012 failed, in part because of a lack of rules limiting development by landownersin the surrounding areas.

Amazon Independent Booksellers Since its founding, America has been fertile ground for conspiracy beliefs. While every generation produces rumor-mongers, today we anoint them with special powers through social media.
Anna Merlan, a journalist at Gizmodo Media Group, explores our contemporary fixation with conspiracy theories of all political stripes in Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to Power . Throughout the book, she reports from gatherings of people whose beliefs are both extreme and false.
Merlan explains that today's conspiracy thinking arises from (1) increasingly rigid class structure, leaving ""many people locked into their circumstances ... desperate to find someone to blame,"" and (2) rising disenfranchisement, people feeling ""shut out of systems of power."" Conspiracy theories flourish in times of rapid social change, she says, ""when we're reevaluating ourselves, and perhaps, facing uncomfortable questions in the process.""
To demonstrate that conspiracy theories have been with us throughout history, Merlan goes back to Emperor Nero, famously said to have fiddled while Rome burned. This vision of a fiddling Nero, however, is apparently attributable to a sole source — Tacitus — who recorded the events years after Rome went to ashes.
Merlan walks readers through famous conspiracy theories in U.S. history, some true and many false. Women were convicted and executed under pernicious falsehoods in the Salem witch trials in 17th century Massachusetts, while it appears that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in assassinating John F. Kennedy. Allegations are true that the U.S. government engaged in years of horrific medical experiments without consent on thousands of prisoners, disabled children, and terminally ill patients; as well as the infamous ""Tuskegee experiments,"" in which Black men went untreated for syphilis long after a known cure in the form of penicillin was available. Barack Obama was born in the United States, despite Donald Trump's deceitful campaign asserting otherwise. Truly grand and real conspiracies are hard to conceal, Merlan states, citing Watergate, the Iran-Contra scandal under Reagan, and the fact that the National Security Agency has spied on Americans.
Merlan spends a chapter on ""false flags,"" which bolster conspiracy theories by suggesting that victims stage events to bring attention to themselves or an issue. She describes both right- and left-wing conspiracies. She provides horrifying details about conspiracies that deny the Sandy Hook murders and the realities of other mass murders, including the Holocaust; conspiracies that allege proof that aliens are among us in various forms, sometimes as part of government plots; white nationalist theories that we are being overtaken by — you name it — Muslims, Jews, people of color. She has an entire chapter on the so-called ""deep state"" and ""Russiagate."" As a Jew herself, Merlan points up anti-Semitism as the root of all kinds of disparate, unrelated conspiracy allegations.
For fear of generating undeserved press for racist, misogynistic, homophobic, anti-Semitic, bigoted, harmful, and dangerous theories, it seems prudent to refrain from providing them further press here. If you want more detail on a parade of horrifying twists of truth, read the book. Suffice to say, falsehoods fanned by conspiracists do real and lasting damage. One has only to look at the outbreak of measles to see both the tenaciousness of the false science cited by anti-vaxxers and its resultant harm.
Merlan's recitations are chilling, as are her warnings that fringe beliefs tend to go mainstream. While false theories wax and wane, Merlan sees the bigger problem as the increasingly efficient rise of these theories against the ""very real"" resurgence in nationalism and white supremacy today.
Republic of Lies would have been strengthened with deeper analysis of the extent to which these theories take hold and the weight our society accords them. Where do these theories fall in the metrics of our political discourse? Are we comparing apples and oranges when we talk about falsehoods versus reality, or are we comparing apples and dump trucks? How potent are the false equivalencies? Or, as Merlan herself puts it after attending an alarming white nationalist cookout in southeastern Kentucky, ""What is it that I spent the day looking at?""
Merlan's reporting has shown her a ""disturbing thirst for vengeance, a willingness to punish enemies and vanquish evildoers that is then twisted by opportunists."" She sees more conspiracists all the time; but she does not provide much of a roadmap for combatting false beliefs. In an epilogue, she states that there ""are no brakes available;"" no means to stop an armed Edgar Welch from storming a Washington, D.C. pizzeria in the false belief that a child-pornography ring was in operation. She urges reporters to do their jobs responsibly and engage with their critics.
Conspiracy theories are the symptom, not the disease, she says:
""[T]hey are a function of the society in which they breed. The worst conspiracy impulses, it seems, flourish in isolation. That, in a way, is the hardest condition to counter.... Conspiracy theories can lose their draw if we ... [create] a more just, equitable, economically secure, and politically representative society.... We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one.""
Well, yes. Let's hope that prescription is unarguable.

Congress Considers Pell Grants for Inmates : NPR,www.npr.org,Elissa Nadworny,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/713874091/congress-considers-making-college-more-accessible-to-people-in-prison,"LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR
""Both Democrats and Republicans had a hand in creating the problem back in '94,"" says Jesse Kelley, who studies criminal justice at R Street, a conservative-leaning research firm. ""So now everybody's like, 'OK well, we all already agree that something needs to be fixed. So let's just do this.' ""
The idea to reintroduce Pell Grants to the prison population came in 2015, when President Barack Obama's Education Department announced an experiment , called Second Chance Pell. The department identified universities, community colleges and workforce training programs to serve incarcerated people who qualified for Pell. Today, according to the Department of Education, the pilot initiative has involved more than 10,000 inmates across 64 institutions. While there's no official expiration date on experimental pilots, the Department of Education has said they typically last about three to five years. Congress would need to pass legislation like the REAL Act in order to take Second Chance Pell out of the pilot phase.
Two recent reports offer a glimpse into the the pilot program's effectiveness. In January, the Vera Institute of Justice offered the most a comprehensive look at the program so far . It found: The majority of incarcerated people are academically eligible to take college-level courses, meaning they hold a GED or high school diploma. Education in prison means better job opportunities after being released. The report estimates an increase of about $45.3 million in combined earnings of formerly incarcerated workers during the first year after leaving prison. Access to education will lead to lower rates of folks returning to prison after they are released, saving states a projected $365.8 million per year on incarceration costs. College Classes In Maximum Security: 'It Gives You Meaning'
In 2018, a previous report from the Vera Institute of Justice found that people in the program describe the experience as transformative and become positive role models in prison.
""People in prison are often really ready for opportunities to grow and to change and to think about new futures that they might be able to have,"" says Ruth Delaney, a program manager at the Vera Institute of Justice. ""So offering college in prison is a really great moment in someone's life to offer the opportunity for that change."" Measuring The Power Of A Prison Education
In early April, the Government Accountability Office, often called the congressional watchdog, reviewed the Second Chance Pell pilot and identified a few implementation challenges. The first was about eligibility: To receive Pell, an inmate must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA — and in order to fill out the FAFSA, and qualify for federal student aid, the Department of Education requires that all male students be registered for the selective service (in case the U.S. ever had a military draft). It's something young men must do before the age of 26 . But one of the pilot sites in Michigan was only able to fill about half of their open spots because many of their inmates hadn't registered for the selective service, and the window to do so had closed.
Other issues the GAO pointed out included debt from previous student loans, which makes inmates ineligible, and the complicated FAFSA verification process, which frequently trips up students. Given those findings, the GAO suggests that even more inmates could benefit from these grants with proper guidance in filling out and remedying paperwork. Earning A 2-Year Degree While Serving A 6-Year Sentence
All this comes as policymakers shift from the ""tough on crime"" era that facilitated the 1994 ban on Pell to a more holistic approach to criminal justice, aptly named ""smart on crime."" In late 2018, President Trump signed a criminal justice reform bill, called the First Step Act, which he celebrated during his state of the union . ""Both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform,"" he said. ""They said it couldn't be done.""
And that momentum, to open up opportunities for incarcerated people, has also rippled into state legislatures. Lawmakers in North Carolina, for example, are trying to pass a bill that would expand scholarship opportunities to incarcerated people .
""In the afterglow of the success of the First Step Act, everyone wants to continue the trend,"" Kelley says. Facebook "
"You Can Help: When A Loved One Shows Signs Of Suicide Risk, Reach Out : Shots - Health News",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/20/707686101/reach-out-ways-to-help-a-loved-one-at-risk-of-suicide,"Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (En Español: 1-888-628-9454; Deaf and Hard of Hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741.
If you know someone struggling with despair, depression or thoughts of suicide, you may be wondering how to help.
Most Americans say that they understand that suicide is preventable and that they would act to help someone they know who is at risk, according to a national survey conducted by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention in 2018.
Yet many of us are afraid to do the wrong thing. In fact, you don't have to be a trained professional to help, says Doreen Marshall , a psychologist and vice president of programs at the AFSP.
""Everyone has a role to play in suicide prevention,"" she says. But ""most people hold back. We often say, 'Trust your gut. If you're worried about someone, take that step.' ""
And that first step starts with simply reaching out, says Marshall. It may seem like a small thing, but survivors of suicide attempts and suicide experts say, it can go long way.
Simple acts of connection are powerful, says Ursula Whiteside , a psychologist and a faculty member Washington School of Medicine.
""Looking out for each other in general reduces [suicide] risk,"" says Whiteside. ""Because people who feel connected are less likely to kill themselves.""
And ""the earlier you catch someone,"" she adds, ""the less they have to suffer.""
Here are nine things you can do that can make a difference.
If You Need Help: Resources
If you are someone you know is in crisis and need immediate help, call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or go here for online chat .
For more help:
Find 5 Action Steps for helping someone who may be suicidal, from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Six questions to ask to help assess the severity of someone's suicide risk , from the Columbia Lighthouse Project. To prevent a future crisis, here's how to help someone make a safety plan . 1. Recognize the warning signs Signs of suicide risk to watch for include changes in mood and behavior, Marshall says.
""For example, someone who is usually part of a group or activity and you notice that they stop showing up,"" explains Marshall. ""Someone who is usually pretty even-tempered, and you see they are easily frustrated or angry.""
Other signs include feeling depressed, anxious, irritable or losing interest in things.
Pay attention to a person's words, too.
""They may talk about wanting to end their lives or seeing no purpose or wanting to go to sleep and never wake up,"" says Marshall. ""Those are signs that they may be thinking about [suicide]. It may be couched as a need to get away from, or escape the pain.""
According to the AFSP, people who take their own lives often show a combination of these warning signs.
And the signs can be different for different individuals, says Madelyn Gould , a professor of epidemiology in psychiatry at Columbia University who studies suicide and suicide prevention.
""For some people, it might be starting to have difficulty sleeping,"" she says. Someone else might easily feel humiliated or rejected.
""Each one of these things can put [someone] more at risk,"" explains Gould, ""Until at some point, [they're] not in control anymore.""
2. Reach out and ask, ""Are you OK?"" So, what do you do when you notice someone is struggling and you fear they may be considering suicide?
Reach out, check in and show you care, say suicide prevention experts.
""The very nature of someone struggling with suicide and depression, [is that] they're not likely to reach out,"" says Marshall. ""They feel like a burden to others.""
People who are having thoughts of suicide often feel trapped and alone, explains DeQuincy Lezine , a psychologist and a member of the board of directors of the American Association of Suicidology . He is also a survivor of suicide attempts.
When someone reaches out and offers support, it reduces a person's sense of isolation, he explains.
""Even if you can't find the exact words [to say], the aspect that somebody cares makes a big difference,""says Lezine.
Questions like ""Are you doing OK?"" and statements like ""If you need anything, let me know"" are simple supportive gestures that can have a big impact on someone who's in emotional pain, explains Julie DeGolier, a medical assistant in Seattle and a survivor of suicide attempts. It can interrupt the negative spiral that can lead to crisis.
The website for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has a list of do's and don'ts when trying to help someone at risk.
Opposite Action — Tips from Survivors From the suicide prevention site, Now Matters Now, this video offers examples of ""opposite action,"" a suicide prevention technique derived from dialectical behavior therapy. The technique guides people to choose actions that help them embrace life instead of withdrawing when they're struggling with suicidal feelings.
3. Be direct: Ask about suicide ""Most people are afraid to ask about suicide, because they [think they] don't want to put the thought in their head,"" says Marshall. ""But there's no research to support that.""
Instead, she and other suicide prevention experts say discussing suicide directly and compassionately with a person at risk is key to preventing it.
One can ask a direct question like, ""Have you ever had thoughts of suicide?"" says Marshall.
More general questions like, ""What do you think of people who kill themselves?"" can also open up a conversation about suicide, says Gould. ""Now they are talking about it, when you might not have had the conversation before.""
4. Assess risk and don't panic: Suicidal feelings aren't always an emergency Say a loved one confides in you that they have been thinking about suicide. What do you do then?
""Don't let yourself panic,"" says Whiteside.
People often believe that a person considering suicide needs to be rushed to the hospital. But ""not everyone who expressed these thoughts needs to be hospitalized immediately,"" says Marshall.
Research shows that most people who've had suicidal thoughts haven't had the kind of overpowering thoughts that might push them to make an attempt, explains Whiteside. In other words, many more people experience suicidal thoughts than take action on them.
But how do you know whether your loved one's situation is an immediate crisis?
Whiteside suggests asking direct questions like: ""Are you thinking of killing yourself in the next day or so?"" and ""How strong are those urges?""
For help with this conversation, psychiatrists at Columbia University have developed the Columbia Protocol, which is a risk-assessment tool drawn from their research-based suicide severity rating scale. It walks you through six questions to ask your loved one about whether they've had thoughts about suicide and about the means of suicide and whether they have worked out the details of how they would carry out their plan.
Someone who has a plan at hand is at a high risk of acting on it — according to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center , about 38 percent of people who have made a plan go on to make an attempt.
5. If it's a crisis, stick around So what if you've assessed risk and you fear your loved one is in immediate crisis? First, request them to hold off for a day or so, says Whiteside, at the same time being ""validating and gentle.""
The kind of intense emotions that might make someone act on an impulse, ""usually resolve or become manageable in less than 24 or 48 hours,"" she says. If you can, offer to stay with them during that time period, she adds. Otherwise, help them find other immediate social support or medical help. They shouldn't be alone at these times of crisis.
Ask whether they have any means of harming themselves at hand and work with them to remove those things from their environment. Research shows that removing or limiting access to means reduces suicide deaths.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline offers this guide to the five action steps to take if someone you know is imminent danger.
If you don't feel confident about helping someone through a crisis period, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline , says Gould.
6. Listen and offer hope If the person is not in immediate risk, it is still important to listen to them, say survivors of suicide attempts like Lezine and DeGolier.
""The biggest thing is listening in an open-minded way, to not be judgmental,"" says DeGolier.
""Don't tell a person what to do. They're looking to be heard, to have their feelings acknowledged.""
The next step is to offer hope, says Whiteside. It helps to say things like, ""I know how strong you are. I've seen you get through hard things. I think we can get through this together,"" she explains.
One of Lezine's closest friends in college did just that during his suicidal phases, he says.
""For one thing, she never lost faith in me,"" says Lezine. ""She always believed I have a positive life possible and I would achieve good things.""
He says her faith in him kept him from giving in to his despair completely.
""Having somebody, a confidante who absolutely believed as a person in [my] ability to do something meaningful in life"" was instrumental in his recovery, he says.
7. Help your loved one make a safety plan When a person is not in immediate risk of attempting suicide, it's a good time to think about preventing a future crisis.
""That's where we want to make help-seeking and adaptive coping strategies a practice,"" says Gould.
Suicide prevention experts advise people develop what's known as a safety plan, which research has shown can help reduce suicide risk. It's a simple plan for how to cope and get help when a crisis hits, and typically, an at-risk person and their mental health provider create it together, but a family member or friend can also help.
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has a template for creating a safety plan . It includes making a list of the person's triggers and warning signs of a coming crisis, people they feel comfortable reaching out to for help and activities they can do to distract themselves during those times — it can be something simple as watching a funny movie.
Safety planning includes helping your loved one make their environment safer. This is one of the most important steps to preventing suicide , says Marshall. That involves a conversation about lethal means.
""If you ask what kinds of thoughts you're having, they may tell you the means,"" she says.
If they don't volunteer that information, it's worth asking them directly, she adds. Once they say what means they have thought of using, one can discuss with them how to limit their access to it.
""The more time and space you can put between the person and harming themselves, the better,"" says Marshall. ""If this is someone who is a firearm owner, you may talk with them to make sure they don't have ready access to firearm in moments of crisis.""
Understanding suicidal thoughts This video from Now Matters Now explains what it's like to experience suicidal thoughts, and how therapy can help people cope with them.
8. Help them tackle the mental health care system
When someone is in urgent crisis mode, it's often not the best time to try to navigate the mental health care system, says DeGolier. But to prevent a future crisis, offer to help your loved one connect with a mental health professional to find out whether medications can help them and to learn ways to manage their mood and suicidal thinking.
A kind of talk therapy called dialectical behavior therapy , or DBT, has been shown to be effective in reducing risk of suicide. It teaches people strategies to calm their minds and distract themselves when the suicidal thoughts surface.
It can be hard for someone who's struggling with negative emotions to get and keep a mental health appointment. Family members and friends can help, notes Whiteside.
""Know that it takes persistence,"" she says. ""You don't stop until you have an appointment for them. That may mean you call 30 people until you find someone who has an availability. You take the day off from work, go with them.""
Lezine says he was fortunate to have had that kind of help and support from his college friend when he was struggling.
""One of the things that was helpful ... was she went with me [to my appointment],"" he says. ""When you're feeling really down and feeling like you don't matter as much, you might not want to take time, or think that it's worth the time, or feel like I don't want to go through this.""
Many people don't make it to their first appointment, or don't follow up, he says. Having a person hold your hand through the process, accompany you to your appointments can prevent that.
""If somebody is sitting there with you, you can have eye contact, touch contact,"" says Lezine. ""It does make a difference, making you feel like you have another person who cares.""
9. Explore tools and support online For those struggling to access mental health care there are some evidence-based digital tools that can also help.
For example, there's a smartphone app called Virtual Hope Box , which is modeled on cognitive behavioral therapy techniques. Research shows that veterans who were feeling suicidal and used the app were able to cope better with negative emotions.
Whiteside and her colleagues started a website called Now Matters Now , which offers videos with personal stories of suicide survivors talking about their own struggles and how they have overcome their suicidal thoughts. Stories of survival and coping with suicidal thoughts have been shown to have a positive effect on people at risk of suicide.
The website also has videos that teach some simple skills that are otherwise taught by a therapist trained to offer DBT.
Those skills include mindfulness and paced breathing, which involves breathing with exhales that last longer than the inhales. Whiteside explains that this can calm the nervous system. Similarly, a cold shower or splashing ice water on one's face or making eye contact with someone can distract and/or calm the person who is at immediate risk of taking their own life.
Surveys show that people who visit the website and watch the videos have a short-term reduction in their suicidal thoughts, she says."
The Mueller Report: A New Tell-All About Trump's White House : NPR,www.npr.org,Ron Elving,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715258810/the-tell-all-book-that-could-trump-them-all-the-mueller-report,"Enlarge this image Robert Mueller testifies before Congress in 2013.

toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Robert Mueller testifies before Congress in 2013. A redacted version of Mueller's report as special counsel was released on Thursday.
Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images The latest book-length tell-all on life inside President Trump's White House has appeared, and it's just as unsparing about dysfunction and deception as all those earlier versions by journalists, gossip mavens and former staffers. Maybe more so.
The difference is that the president likes this one.
Or at least he says he likes it. And it's probably not because of the catchy title ( Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election) , or any previous works by the author, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
More likely it's the ending of the story that the president likes, or what he takes to be the ending.
"" GAME OVER ,"" declared the president's review on Twitter. Now that would be a catchy title — for the movie the president might like to make.
But it actually isn't the way the Mueller report ends.
It's not even the way it ends in the very first review anyone wrote of this 448-page publication. That was, of course, the four-page review penned in March by Attorney General William Barr. That review did say the book ended with the president not being indicted. But we'd already had a spoiler alert on that because it's the viewpoint of the Justice Department that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Not much of a surprise there.
Analysis Highlights From The Mueller Report, Annotated As for charges of obstruction of justice, well, we got the word on that one early too. Because Barr had already authored a 19-page explanation for why a president could not be charged with obstruction of justice – suggesting pointedly that Mueller should not even be thinking about it.
That was way back in 2018, when Barr was a private citizen but felt free, as a former attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, to share his strong views with the current management at Justice.
Few authors get to pick who will provide the exclusive first review of their work, and Mueller didn't either. That choice was made by the principal character in the story, the president himself.
Trump got to choose who would get the first crack at interpreting this soon-to-be-best-seller when he chose William Barr to be his new attorney general.
That choice might have been made soon after Trump fired his first attorney general, former senator Jeff Sessions. It might have been made even sooner, possibly after hearing about Barr's 19-page memo. Suffice it to say there have been few cabinet-level appointments in this administration that worked out better for the president.
Of course, many others are reading Mueller's work, and their reviews have taken a less legalistic look than Barr did. They tend to dwell on such events as the president telling the White House counsel to have Mueller fired in June 2017, shortly after Mueller began compiling his epic. Or the president telling that counsel to deny the order was ever given. Or the president telling an aide to tell Sessions to get rid of Mueller.
None of these orders was carried out, as Mueller observes, and that disobedience may now constitute Trump's best defense against a charge of obstructing justice. That, and the Justice Department view that a sitting president cannot be so charged in the first place.
Politics Meet The People In Trump's Orbit Who The Mueller Report Says Ignored His Orders Interest in the report, and especially in portions redacted by Barr and underlying documents and other evidence not yet seen, has not decreased – despite the president's attempts to give away the ending.
Among those clamoring for a chance to review it are several relevant committees from Congress. The House Judiciary Committee is bound to get special attention, as that is where hearings would be held on a resolution of impeachment.
The I-word has been in the air on Capitol Hill since the Mueller probe began, largely because obstruction of justice was a crucial part of the charges the last two times Congress got serious about taking down a president.
The most recent one of these involved President Bill Clinton's 1998 grand jury testimony about his affair with a White House intern. Before that, it was President Richard Nixon's efforts to cover up White House involvement in a burglary at the Watergate offices of the Democratic National Committee.
The latter case stretched over 1972-1974, and the man who was White House counsel at the critical time was one John Dean. Still alive and on CNN Thursday, Dean said ""the endeavor of obstruction"" could be a crime even if the obstructive orders to subordinates were disobeyed. That is a theory of the case other reviewers may pursue.
An irony in all of this is that the president himself has been so astringent in commenting on earlier books about his White House. These have included Bob Woodward's best-selling Fear , peek-a-boo looks inside by Cliff Sims ( Team of Vipers ), Omarosa Manigault ( Unhinged ) and Michael Wolff ( Fire and Fury ) — as well as sober memoirs by former FBI heads James Comey and Andrew McCabe .
The chaotic atmosphere described in all these books was based on eyewitness accounts, but Trump denounced them all as ""fiction."" Now we see much the same depiction in Mueller's pages and hear much less objection. In fact, it's amazing how many journalistic stories derided as ""fake news"" over the past few years now re-appear in Mueller's recounting — only this time as documented evidence.
That is the difference it makes when an author can supplement his research with subpoena power, warrants and the threat of perjury prosecution.
It may not make the end product an ideal movie script, or a page-turner in the aisles at your bookstore. But Mueller's contribution to the literature of this period in history will have an expanding readership in the immediate future as well.
Stay tuned for the sequel."
Northern Ireland Police Arrest 2 Men In Shooting Death Of Journalist,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715457050/northern-ireland-police-arrest-2-men-in-shooting-death-of-journalist,"Enlarge this image A woman stops to pay her respects Saturday at the scene where 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee was fatally shot in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Brian Lawless/AP Brian Lawless/AP A woman stops to pay her respects Saturday at the scene where 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee was fatally shot in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
Brian Lawless/AP Police in Northern Ireland have arrested two men in connection with the shooting death of a 29-year-old journalist in Londonderry on Thursday night.
Authorities say they arrested an 18- and 19-year-old under the U.K.'s controversial Terrorism Act and took them to the Musgrave Serious Crime Suite, a police station in Belfast.
Cellphone video released by police shows journalist Lyra McKee taking photos with her phone shortly before she was shot, probably by a stray bullet, according to police. The shooting occurred during rioting in Derry's Creggan neighborhood, a stronghold for dissident groups such as the New Irish Republican Army and Saoradh, which aim to bring about a united Ireland. Police were in the neighborhood searching for weapons they suspected would be used in an attack over Easter weekend.
Saoradh said in a statement on Friday that McKee's death was accidental and that the gunmen were defending their community against state-sponsored violence. It also suggested U.K. government-backed forces entered the neighborhood to grab headlines during U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the island, Joe Zefran reports for the NPR Newscast unit.
Europe Police In Northern Ireland Seek Journalist's Killers ""A republican volunteer attempted to defend people from the PSNI/RUC,"" the group said, citing the acronyms of Northern Ireland's current and former police forces. ""Tragically a young journalist, Lyra McKee, was killed accidentally.""
Authorities say the violence intensified when a gunman aimed at police who were searching the area. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton called the shooting ""a terrorist act,"" which was ""carried out by violent dissident republicans.""
""The New IRA is a small group who reject the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that marked the Irish Republican Army's embrace of a political solution to the long-running violence known as 'The Troubles' that claimed more than 3,700 lives,"" according to The Associated Press .
A leader for one of Northern Ireland's largest political parties, Sinn Féin, called McKee's death ""a human tragedy for her family.""
""Those people who carried out this attack have attacked all of us,"" deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said. ""They've attacked the community. They've attacked the people of Derry. They've attacked the peace process, and they've attacked the Good Friday Agreement.""
McKee was named Sky News' young journalist of the year in 2006, and Forbes magazine identified her as one of their 30 under 30 in media in Europe in 2016, the Washington Post reported . She is perhaps most remembered for her blog post, ""Letter to My 14-Year-Old Self,"" which chronicled her struggle growing up gay in Northern Ireland and the later acceptance she received from her family.

Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: We Quiz Orlando Magic Star Aaron Gordon On Actual Magic PETER SAGAL, HOST:
We have time for one more segment as we take the week off to play outside. So let's hear from someone who spends most of his time playing inside.
BILL KURTIS: Orlando Magic star Aaron Gordon joined us onstage when we went down to Orlando in November. Peter looked so tiny next to him.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SAGAL: You've got fans. I've got to ask you - I should admit I'm not, you know, conversant with, like, the basketball stuff - how is it that someone the size of the Statue of Liberty...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a small forward?
(LAUGHTER)
AARON GORDON: I would like to think of myself as a powerful small forward...
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: ...You know? It's just, like, kind of a mix of a couple of different things.
SAGAL: Is it, like, a power forward, and then there's a small forward?
GORDON: Yeah, exactly.
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: So it's kind of like a lot of - maybe a hyphen in it.
SAGAL: Hyphen? Yeah, OK. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
MO ROCCA: Is the power forward more of a ball hog? Because it sounds like the small forward is nicer and shares the ball more.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: When it comes to rebounding, yes. A power forward can just be as ball hog-ish (ph) as he'd like to be.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Your whole family...
GORDON: Yeah.
SAGAL: ...Is a family of basketball players. Your parents play? Your father play?
GORDON: Yeah. Dad played at San Diego State.
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: And....
SAGAL: And your brother plays pro ball.
GORDON: He played pro ball overseas. He's been to a bunch of places. So he plays, and then my sister played at Harvard.
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: So she was a Harvard basketball player. And I play.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right. So I imagine your friendly games at home are absolutely vicious.
GORDON: Oh, my gosh. Oh, they were...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: ...Gruesome at times.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because I know that one of the things the NBA is known for is trash talk. Do you trash-talk your siblings?
GORDON: Oh, definitely.
SAGAL: All right. Tell me something.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Let's go with what you say to your sister.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: It's kind of like the saying - I'm the youngest...
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: So just by nature, I'm the most annoying.
SAGAL: Right. Of course.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's your role. I have a younger brother. Yeah.
GORDON: More like, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I'm better. You're not. You know what...
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: ...I mean? Along the lines of...
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: Yeah.
SAGAL: Yeah. I mean...
GORDON: That's about it.
SAGAL: I mean, just do you, like, leave your NBA contract out on a table?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, I'm sorry. I left this here. Let me pick it up.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, some money fell out of my pocket. Let me grab that, as well.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So you are known for your enthusiasm for the slam dunk contest.
GORDON: Yes.
SAGAL: Yes. And...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You did a slam dunk in which you vaulted on top of and then over the mascot. And you just - DID you just go up to the mascot and say, you're just going to stand there, and I'm going to jump up, put my hands in your head and go over you, and you're going to hold up the ball. And the mascot was like, OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: Pretty much.
SAGAL: The mascot - is he, like - the mascot does not say no to Aaron Gordon.
GORDON: It's actually - it's really funny because Stuff the Magic Dragon - he's a great mascot. You know what I mean?
(CHEERING)
GORDON: He's a great mascot. He is. He's this, like, green dragon. He has these stars on the top of his head. And, when I was practicing, I couldn't get the grip of the ball right. So I was, like, Stuff, buddy...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: You might need to take the stars off your head. And he was really going to take one for the team. He was a team player. And we did it, and I got the dunk. But I could just see the sadness in this mascot...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: ...In his body language - like he had lost a part of himself with the stars. You know, so...
SAGAL: Stuff...
GORDON: Yeah. So we were, like, OK. We put the stars back on his head. Just - I had to make it work for the sake of him.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's a heartwarming story.
GORDON: Yeah. That's my good friend these days.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Well, Aaron Gordon, we have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: Abracadabra.
SAGAL: You play for the Orlando Magic, but what do you know about real magic - by which we mean magic shows?
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: We're going to ask you three questions about great magicians. Answer two of them correctly, and you will win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Aaron playing for?
KURTIS: Hal Ray of Tampa, Fla.
(CHEERING)
GORDON: OK - Florida boy. All right. Here we go.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first question. One of the great magicians of the late 19th century was Harry Kellar. How did Kellar learn to do his greatest trick, the levitating woman? Was it, A, he was a practicing Buddhist who attained enlightenment and was given control over gravity...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, he tied the woman to a thousand trained fleas, who flew her upward...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, he walked up on stage while another magician was doing the trick, ran around back to see what was done and then ran away.
GORDON: I'm going to go with the latter one.
SAGAL: You're correct.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
GORDON: All right. I like that. I like that.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It was pretty daring, but that's how you get to be a legend of magic. All right. Second question - let's see if you do as well. Another great magician of that golden era of magic was Carter the Great, and one of his famous tricks was which of these? A, the magical divorce, a trick in which he made his own wife disappear...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, the disappearing theater in which the entire audience found itself in a suddenly vacant lot sitting on their butts; or C, the vaguely disquieting meal in which Carter ate an ear of corn raw.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: I think I'm going to go with B.
SAGAL: You're going with B - the disappearing theater. All of a sudden, everybody was out there sitting on their butts in a field.
GORDON: That's the one.
SAGAL: That's the one. He picked it. Sadly, he missed this shot. No, I'm afraid.
GORDON: Oh, dang.
SAGAL: It was actually the magical divorce. He made his wife disappear. His wife eventually decided that wasn't funny.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: So she's still around.
SAGAL: She's still around. She stayed married to him...
GORDON: OK.
SAGAL: But he changed the name of the trick to the phantom bride. So this is your last question. If you get this right, you win.
GORDON: OK.
SAGAL: Some magicians have been able to use their skills in real life such as in which of these? A, Doug Henning, who used to skip out on dinner checks by making himself disappear during dessert...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: : ...B, Penn Jillette, who for three years has made himself look like he's lost a hundred pounds by constantly surrounding himself with trick mirrors...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, David Copperfield, who once made his wallet disappear while he was being mugged.
GORDON: I'm going to go with Copperfield. It's C.
SAGAL: You're going to go David Copperfield. That's right, Aaron.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
GORDON: Yay.
(APPLAUSE)
GORDON: Thanks.
SAGAL: He says he was being mugged outside walking to his car after a performance. Some guy came up, tried to mug him, and he made his watch, wallet and passport disappear.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: Oh, man.
SAGAL: Bill, how did Aaron do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Two out of three is a win.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
GORDON: Thanks.
SAGAL: Aaron Gordon is the small forward for the Orlando Magic. Aaron Gordon, thank you for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME. Aaron Gordon, everybody.
GORDON: All right.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And here is some more previously unaired material never been heard before.
Jessi, a wealthy New York real estate developer went through a bitter, expensive divorce with his wife of 50 years. And to let his ex-wife know he's better off with his new younger bride, this week he put his wedding photos where?
JESSI KLEIN: In the New York Times wedding section.
SAGAL: Oh, no. Not big enough for him.
KLEIN: Oh, Times Square?
SAGAL: Close. It's not far from there, but he put it on a...
KLEIN: On a billboard.
SAGAL: No, I'll give it to you. He put it on the side of a building...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...That he owned.
KLEIN: Like a billboard.
SAGAL: Like a...
(LAUGHTER)
KLEIN: Peter.
SAGAL: Billboards don't come this big. He put up a picture of himself and his new wife 42 feet high, each of them, on the sides of a building he owns in New York. Harry Macklowe is now divorced and happily remarried. And what better way to celebrate than rub it in everybody's face?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Once he found out that he's not legally allowed to rub things in other people's faces...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...He settled for the next best thing - putting up enormous photos of himself and his bride on the sides of one of his Park Avenue buildings. He said, quote, ""since I wasn't getting married during the summer in the Hamptons, I wasn't able to hire an airplane with a banner to go up and down the shoreline."" The Hamptons' loss is our gain. The pictures are big enough so that you can see the realization in the new Mrs. Macklowe's eyes that this maybe wasn't a good idea.
(LAUGHTER)
KLEIN: Well, it sounds like he's definitely over his ex.
SAGAL: Yeah, absolutely.

Originally broadcast Jan. 19, 2019.
Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: Conan O'Brien Gets Quizzed On Hot Cocoa BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, This is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Thank you so much. We are taking the week off from news. We're getting outside. And we're enjoying some fresh air.
KURTIS: I love fresh air. Have you heard Terry Gross's interview with Conan O'Brien?
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: So much better than ours.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: While that is definitely true, we still had a pretty good time with him. Conan joined us back in January. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
CONAN O'BRIEN: I was a young writer at ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I was the writer that was kind of known to sort of perform my sketches for the other writers. And I'd perform them for people, and I'd get them laughing. I think Lorne Michaels noticed that. I left ""Saturday Night Live."" I went on to ""The Simpsons."" And I worked there for about a year and a half, two years when Lorne Michaels was charged with, who's the new guy who's going to replace Letterman? And he said, you know, there's this guy, Conan. He's got something. And they looked into it, and it turns out I really didn't have anything.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Yeah. But I fooled them. And here we are all these years later so.
SAGAL: I know. It must have been crazy those first years because you, you know - you weren't a stand-up. You didn't have a following as a performer. And you were thrown - you're going to be on national television. Were you scared? Were you nervous? Were you excited?
O'BRIEN: I was deluded. And I want to advise your audience that there's nothing like delusion. There's nothing like - if you think you can't do something, convince yourself that you can. And then have a few drinks and go do it.
MO ROCCA: Hey, Conan. It's Mo. Hi.
O'BRIEN: Mo, how dare you speak to me directly.
ROCCA: I know.
(LAUGHTER)
ROCCA: I forgot.
O'BRIEN: Here's how we're going to work, Mo. Mo, here's how we're going to work it. Your question has to go through Bill Kurtis, and then Bill Kurtis...
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...Has to ask.
ROCCA: Ok. Bill, would you ask Conan...
(LAUGHTER)
ROCCA: I've heard that a lot of late-night show hosts, when they get home, a lot of times, they can't even remember who was a guest earlier that day at the taping because they're doing so many shows. Could you ask him about that?
KURTIS: Conan, can you remember the guests on the show that night?
O'BRIEN: Bill, that's a really stupid question.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Yes. You know, it's funny - to Mo's point, no. You do the show, and it becomes - you're so in the moment when you're doing it. And I liken the whole experience - and I'm actually not even kidding about this - I think everyone's - probably in your audience is familiar with the famous toy, the Etch A Sketch...
SAGAL: Yes.
O'BRIEN: ...Where you turn the knobs, you create a picture, you create something. And then you just shake it, and it's gone, and you start again. Every day I come in and I learn everything I can that I need to know for that show. And I learn it to the best that I can. And I can tell you everything about the gas and I can tell you everything about the comedy the minute it's over a shake the Etch a Sketch and all of it's gone. And I go home and I don't know what we did. I've done 4000 hours of broadcasting I'm told nine of it quite good.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Conan O'Brien, we are delighted to talk to you. But we've asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: Team Coco, meet hot cocoa.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Your supporters, fans are known as Team Coco. But what do you know about actual cocoa, the tasty hot chocolate beverage?
O'BRIEN: I know everything...
SAGAL: Oh.
O'BRIEN: ...About cocoa.
SAGAL: Really?
O'BRIEN: Yes, I do.
SAGAL: That's a bold statement, sir.
O'BRIEN: There's not a thing you can ask me...
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...About hot cocoa that I do not know.
SAGAL: Well, I am interested in what's going to happen now because we have, in fact, prepared three questions for you about hot cocoa. If you answer two of them correctly, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Are you ready to do this?
O'BRIEN: I was born ready.
SAGAL: Who is Conan O'Brien playing for?
KURTIS: Chase McGee of Raleigh, N.C.
SAGAL: All right, first question. You think it's just what kids drink instead of coffee, but hot cocoa can change your life, as it did for whom? A, Bernie Madoff, who, after he was convicted and imprisoned for fraud, quote, ""cornered the prison market on Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate;"" B, Jeff Bezos, whose first Internet business was delivering steaming cups of hot chocolate to people suffering through the Seattle winter; or C, Eric McMillan, who was inspired to invent the kids' ball pit by looking at mini-marshmallows floating in his hot chocolate.
O'BRIEN: The answer is Eric McMillan.
SAGAL: You're very confident.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Peter, I'm going to say this one more time...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It was actually A. It was Bernie Madoff.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He apparently...
O'BRIEN: I'd like to contest.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No. Apparently, you know, a born trader is a born trader, and he's apparently made very well for himself in prison with the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate.
HELEN HONG: What?
SAGAL: Yeah.
O'BRIEN: You know why I got that one wrong?
SAGAL: Why.
O'BRIEN: Because I believe in our penal reform system.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: And I don't - I'm shocked that they would let Bernie Madoff do that. So, in a way, I'm counting that answer as correct.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I like your confidence. People - there's your second question - people really love cocoa a lot - so much so that, at one time, people were doing what? A, mixing protein powder into cocoa so it would be the only thing they'd ever have to eat; B, snorting lines of cocoa powder like coke; or C, trying to have a transfused into their body instead of blood?
O'BRIEN: The answer is B - snorting cocaine - well, cocoa as cocaine.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Sorry.
SAGAL: Freudian slip there.
O'BRIEN: Old habits...
SAGAL: Yeah.
O'BRIEN: ...Die Hard.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: The answer is B, snorting cocoa.
SAGAL: You're right, Coco.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Or Conan.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Snorting chocolate was championed by a Belgian chocolatier who invented a little device that would shoot cocoa powder into your nose.
O'BRIEN: Oh, I know that engineer, and I've worked with him.
SAGAL: Have you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Have you tried the snorting coke?
O'BRIEN: Yes, I have. It's fantastic. There's an incredible high. It lasts for about 20 minutes, and then you have to cough out the marshmallows.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: But other than that, it's a wonderful experience.
SAGAL: I bet.
O'BRIEN: And when you wake up, you're wearing German shorts. I don't know why.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ll right. Last question. You can get this right. For true chocolate lovers, there's a pill created by a French scientist which, for $13 a bottle, will do what? A, make anything you eat, including meat, taste like chocolate; B, make your farts smell like chocolate; or C, it gives you chocolate dandruff? Instead of dry skin, you shed chocolate flakes.
O'BRIEN: The answer is A.
SAGAL: Your answer is A - that it makes anything you eat...
O'BRIEN: Taste...
SAGAL: ...Including meat, taste exactly like chocolate.
O'BRIEN: ...Exactly like chocolate.
SAGAL: So you'd be sitting there eating, say, prime rib...
O'BRIEN: Yes. And it...
SAGAL: Kimchi.
O'BRIEN: Yes - chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
SAGAL: It's B.
(LAUGHTER).
O'BRIEN: No.
SAGAL: Yes. I'm sorry, but yes. The idea is it's a little pill, and you take it, and if you take it, your farts smell like chocolate.
HONG: No way.
SAGAL: There's also a strawberry option.
O'BRIEN: You know what? I'm going to tell you something. I didn't go for that because it's scatological. I don't work blue.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: I didn't realize this was that kind of show.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: But I guess it's all about farts now...
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...With you and I hope you're proud of yourself.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Conan O'Brien do on our show?
KURTIS: We throw the score out because he's the only guest we've had when anything he says is right. Conan, you're the king.
O'BRIEN: You know, to have...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'BRIEN: Thank you.
SAGAL: Conan O'Brien is the host of so many shows, including the new podcast Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend. You can also see him on ""Conan Without Borders"" on Netflix and on ""Conan"" on TBS. Conan O'Brien, what a pleasure to finally have you on. Thank you so much.
(APPLAUSE)
O'BRIEN: Thank you very much.
KURTIS: Thank you, Conan.
SAGAL: See you soon, I hope.

Originally broadcast Dec. 8, 2018.
Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: We Quiz Candice Bergen Of 'Murphy Brown' On Murphy's Law BILL KURTIS: Long before the fictional newscasters on Fox News...
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: ...There was the fictional newscaster Murphy Brown.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
The incredible Candice Bergen brought Murphy Brown to life for 11 seasons, and she joined us onstage at Carnegie Hall back in December.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
CANDICE BERGEN: The show would never have been brought back if the election had turned out the way we wanted.
SAGAL: Really?
(APPLAUSE)
BERGEN: If Hillary Clinton were president, we would never have brought the show back.
SAGAL: Really?
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: So what do you know? Donald Trump created a job.
BERGEN: That's right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So I'm taking it Murphy Brown is not very happy with the current president.
BERGEN: Oh, well, we've had - really, the man is a gift.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Every day is a gift.
SAGAL: It really is.
PETER GROSZ: That's such a positive way...
FAITH SALIE: Yes.
GROSZ: ...To look at what's going on.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: I don't know how many people who are fans of you now know this, but you were, in fact, an extraordinarily famous child because your father was one of the most famous Americans alive, right? Edgar Bergen.
BERGEN: I don't think he was that famous. But he was...
PAULA POUNDSTONE: I think he was pretty famous.
BERGEN: OK.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, your father - again, for those who don't know - was the world's most famous and successful ventriloquist. He had a dummy, Charlie McCarthy. And...
BERGEN: He was also a famous ventriloquist on radio.
SAGAL: Yes.
SALIE: Which?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And I have to say, I have - and I mean no offense - I've seen archival film of your father doing his act. And just like people say I have a face for radio, he was a ventriloquist for radio.
BERGEN: Exactly.
(LAUGHTER)
POUNDSTONE: Did you grow up really in your early years thinking that you were Charlie McCarthy's sister?
BERGEN: Oh, yes. I was always called Charlie McCarthy's sister. And - but he was far more than a brother. He was like a head of state in our house.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: And he had a room next to mine. And every now and then, my father would bring him out, and we would just kind of sit. And once - I mean, I remember once we would have - in the breakfast room, he would put Charlie on one knee and me on the other. And he - when he would squeeze my neck, it meant that I should move my mouth. And he...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He would put you on a knee and treat you as if you were another ventriloquist's dummy.
BERGEN: That's correct.
POUNDSTONE: Yes.
SAGAL: OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: Charlie must've been so jealous.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Skipping ahead a bit...
BERGEN: Yes.
SAGAL: In the '90s, you starred in ""Murphy Brown,"" which as much as any other sort of sitcom or TV show exemplified the '90s. It was, like, the - a dominant show. And, of course, it became quite political when Dan Quayle famously went after not you, but your character. Did he know that it was a fictional character?
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: I don't think Dan Quayle had ever seen the show.
SAGAL: Oh, really?
BERGEN: But he was savvy. The - his handlers had taken the line about Murphy out of his speech, and he reinserted it into the speech. And that's all anybody talked about...
SAGAL: I remember.
BERGEN: ...For the entire six months of the campaign. It was on the front page of every paper. It was in every political cartoon, every editorial. It just didn't let up.
SAGAL: Right.
SALIE: Don't those seem like beautiful, simpler times?
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You won in the original run five Emmys...
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: ...For lead actress in a comedy.
BERGEN: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: And I was going to say that's almost unfair to the competition. But apparently, you realized that yourself. And - is this true - that you'd said, please don't nominate me anymore? You turned it down.
BERGEN: I didn't say please don't. I just didn't submit myself for nomination. I didn't, like, go in and say, please don't nominate me.
SAGAL: Oh, no. No, don't do this. No. Please.
(LAUGHTER)
SALIE: And did you take your five Emmys home and then bludgeon Charlie McCarthy with them?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, that's an interesting question.
SALIE: Where is he?
SAGAL: Where is Charlie McCarthy?
BERGEN: He's in the Smithsonian.
POUNDSTONE: Yeah, it's in the Smithsonian, absolutely.
SAGAL: Yeah. As Faith said, do you ever bring your Emmys down there and go, hey, Charlie?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You may have gotten the inheritance, but I got these little babies.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: One day, I'm going to break out of this glass, and I swear to god...
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: I'm going to steal those Emmys.
SALIE: Candice, when you were on ""The Muppet Show...""
BERGEN: Yeah.
SALIE: What was that like? Was that, like, trippy nostalgia to go back to talking with puppets or what?
POUNDSTONE: Yeah. Those were your cousins.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Let's just say it was a medium I was very comfortable...
POUNDSTONE: Yeah.
BERGEN: ...In.
POUNDSTONE: Pinocchio - or grandpa, as you call him...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Candice Bergen, we could talk to you all day about...
POUNDSTONE: All right.
SAGAL: But we have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: ""Murphy Brown,"" Meet Murphy's Law.
SAGAL: Murphy's law, of course, as I'm sure you know, is the law of the universe that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. We're going to ask you three questions about examples of Murphy's law in effect. If you get two right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Candice Bergen playing for?
KURTIS: Dylan Watton of Queens, New York.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here - are you ready to do this?
BERGEN: Sure.
SAGAL: OK, first question. McDonald's commissioned an internal corporate webpage once to help its employees eat better. But they had to take it down after what inevitably happened? A, the employees all gained an average of 20 pounds over six months...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, it illustrated the concept of poor nutrition with a picture of a McDonald's meal...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, it encouraged people to go out and eat at Burger King.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: I would say that because they gained 20, 25 pounds.
SAGAL: You think that McDonald's gave its employees nutrition advice, and they all followed it, and they all ballooned like the Hindenburg.
BERGEN: Well, isn't that what happens?
SAGAL: Not in this case. What happened was...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...They - the webpage they commissioned to illustrate good eating habits used a picture of the McDonald's cheeseburger and french fries...
POUNDSTONE: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...To illustrate what you should not eat.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So the McDonald's corporation quickly took it down. All right. You still have two more chances - not a problem here. Bill Hillmann was gored by a bull in Spain - bad enough. But it happened shortly after he did what? A, was arrested for 27 different incidents of cow tipping...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, wrote a book called ""How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona""...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, put on his new bright red cape.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE: B.
BERGEN: B.
POUNDSTONE: Yeah.
BERGEN: B.
(CROSSTALK)
BERGEN: Yes, I'll go with the audience.
SAGAL: You're right.
SALIE: Yeah.
SAGAL: They're right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Everybody's right. That's what happened. He didn't read his own book. All right, last one. If you get this right, you win. A big game hunter in Zimbabwe was killed last year when what happened? A, a zebra caught sight of his zebra-print bikini briefs and thought he was a rival male...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, one of his fellow hunters mistook him for a, quote, ""balding lion...""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, he shot an elephant, and the elephant fell on him.
BERGEN: I guess the elephant fell on him.
SAGAL: That's what happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SALIE: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It's tragic. But at least we know one of them died happy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Candice Bergen do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She won. Congratulations.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Somewhere in the Smithsonian Institution, a wooden dummy just went, damn.

SAGAL: Candice Bergen stars as Murphy Brown on the show ""Murphy Brown,"" back after a short hiatus. It airs Thursday nights on CBS. She was just nominated for a Golden Globe for the part. Candice Bergen, thank you so much.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Thanks, everybody. Flowers are blooming, birds are chirping, and it's time to take a moment to enjoy the spring because pretty soon, the only seasons we will have will be summer, summer two, mega summer and everything's on fire.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: So while we can still go outside without putting on SPF 500 sunscreen, we're breathing in some fresh air and taking a week off from the news. Instead, we're going to listen back to some segments we love.
SAGAL: Let's start with an interview with my second favorite Bill, William Shatner, who joined us back in December.
KURTIS: Peter tried not to geek out and failed.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SAGAL: So when I was a kid, I loved ""Star Trek"" - the original series, of course. I loved it so much that I used to dream of being a crew member on the Enterprise - not one of those red shirt guys - they get into trouble - but a blue shirt, maybe even a yellow shirt. And I would get...
WILLIAM SHATNER: Easy now.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: That's...
(APPLAUSE)
SHATNER: I mean, you can have ambition, but that's my job, OK?
SAGAL: All right. All right. All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: This isn't how I thought it would go, but I dreamed in those days that I would someday get to talk to Captain Kirk himself. We'll now find out if that's as good as I dreamed it would be because William Shatner has a new album of Christmas songs out, and he joins us now. William Shatner, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
SHATNER: Well, what a pleasure.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: What a joy to talk to you.
SHATNER: I'm really excited to be on because I've got to tell you, I've listened to the program over the years. It's one of my favorites. Driving somewhere on a Saturday afternoon - WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
SAGAL: Thank you. I can't tell you what it means to me to know that you listen to me after I spent so many happy hours watching you.
SHATNER: Yes, but I didn't know it was you.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You have a new record out. You've become quite a recording artist.
SHATNER: I have. I've got two records - two albums out this year, a country music album and this Christmas album that we've called ""Shatner Claus.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, your singing career, if I may be so bold, began with a record that you put out when you were playing Captain Kirk back in the '60s called ""The Transformed Man.""
SHATNER: Yes.
SAGAL: I've listened to the whole thing.
SHATNER: How - pity is the...
SAGAL: No, no.
SHATNER: ...Only thing I feel for you.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And this is the famous record where you did that that eventually infamous version of ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.""
SHATNER: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, this became, shall we put it, a novelty song after a while and subject of much amusement.
SHATNER: I believe the word derision is the...
SAGAL: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
(LAUGHTER)
HELEN HONG: You said it, not us.
SAGAL: And was that hard for you to deal with when that became, like, a hilariously funny thing that people were sharing back in the...
SHATNER: Well, I understood it does enter the area of the perception of silly.
SAGAL: Right. But it didn't bother you. You kind of embraced that as the singing William Shatner.
SHATNER: No, no. It bothered me, and I embraced it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So we all know the famous sketch you did on ""Saturday Night Live"" where you're at a ""Star Trek"" convention and you express some, shall we say, impatience with your more avid fans. Was that reflecting your experience?
SHATNER: No. It was meant as a joke. And I'm sorry that you took it so seriously that you moved out of your parents' apartment.
(LAUGHTER)
HONG: Wow.
SAGAL: It's all right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I was getting tired of my mother's cooking.
SHATNER: But look what it's done for you.
SAGAL: I know. I feel good.
SHATNER: You're master of ceremonies of these silly questions.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know that there has been - because there's been so many versions of ""Star Trek"" since the best one...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...That a lot of people spend their time arguing over which captain was better. I assume you believe it was Kirk rather than Picard or any of the others.
SHATNER: Well, I don't know what the argument is about, actually.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you - I mean, do you actually, like, get together with the other actors and ever hash this out?
SHATNER: Yes. Several blows were struck.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: No. I think everybody thinks they're the best, and I just leave them their quandary. I don't want to disturb their mental stability.
SAGAL: One of the things that so many people have done over the years is they do their William Shatner impressions.
SHATNER: Yes.
SAGAL: I have done a William Shatner impression. I'm not going...
SHATNER: I'd like to hear it.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: What do you mean no?
HONG: Do it.
SAGAL: No, I can't. How could I...
HONG: Come on.
SAGAL: ...To the face of the - in the face of the - all right.
(APPLAUSE)
HONG: Oh, Peter, do it.
SHATNER: I would like - by popular demand, you're being requested to do the imitation.
SAGAL: All right. The only thing I can think of to do is the episode where you - the crew of the enterprise ends up on the planet where the Kohms are finding fighting the Yangs, if you remember this, and Captain Kirk and the crew the Enterprise save them by introducing the U.S. Constitution. Remember this one?
SHATNER: Well, vaguely. Yes.
SAGAL: Yes. And so...
SHATNER: Are you going to recite the Constitution?
SAGAL: Well...
SHATNER: I don't know if I can put up with that.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And this is one of the great things - is that Captain Kirk sort of gets this document, and he says, here's this thing that says (imitating William Shatner) we the people...
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's the worst imitation...
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: ...I've ever heard.
(APPLAUSE)
SHATNER: God. Oh, my god. I hope you don't do that in public.
SAGAL: Well, William Shatner, as you can tell, we're all pretty delighted to talk to you. But we must do our business. We have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: (Shouting) Cannes Film Festival.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So one of the greatest moments in all of cinema, we would agree, was you shouting Khan in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan."" So we thought we'd ask you about a different Cannes - the Cannes Film Festival in France. Answer 2 out of 3 right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of anyone they like on their voicemail. Bill, who is William Shatner playing for?
KURTIS: Chris Taucher of Columbus, Ohio.
SHATNER: Oh, I know him.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Here is your first question. Martin Scorsese has been a fixture at Cannes since the '70s, but he always hasn't had the best relationship with the press, who, of course, swarm Cannes. In 1978, talking to the press, he decided to stop all the interviews. Why? A, he ran out of cocaine, saying no more coke, no more interviews; B, He called the police on a reporter who asked him, how tall are you, anyway? Or C, he snapped and responded to a question by shouting, you talking to me? You talking to me?
SHATNER: (Laughter) Well, it's got to be that he snapped.
SAGAL: He did - he snapped and started shouting, you talking to me? You talking to me?
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: No. In fact, it was the cocaine - you know, the '70s - different time. All right. Next question - Cannes is famous for the film competition but also for elaborate publicity stunts around it such as when one company once did what? A, swarmed the celebrities on the red carpet with 200 fake zombies, resulting in three actors getting bitten; B, poisoned the food at the party's buffet just to entice partygoers to visit some port-a-potties that were covered with ads; or C, storming the famous Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc with fake terrorists dressed like ISIS members?
SHATNER: That's the kind of thing they would do.
SAGAL: The last one.
LUKE BURBANK: (Laughter).
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: You're right, Captain. That's what...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...They did.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It was supposed to promote this company's broadband services. It did not help. All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Last question - if you get this right, you win, and my life has meaning. The festival can be dangerous, as in which of these happened? A, over the years, at least 14 women and four men have fainted from being crammed into too-tight outfits for the runway; B, when the actress Simone Silva took off her top in a photo shoot with co-star Robert Mitchum, two photographers suffered broken bones in the ensuing crush; or C, the sound of all the cameras going off attracts hordes of wild dogs known as the les chiens du cinema (ph)?
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: I love the picture of Mitchum standing by while the lady disrobes, and people are crushed.
SAGAL: That's the one you're going to go with?
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: You're right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: That's what happened.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: The ensuing photograph, in which Mitchum is kind of using his hands as a makeshift bra - that picture is actually one of most famous images to be taken at Cannes. Bill, how did William Shatner do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Two out of 3. And, Captain, that's a win.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: William Shatner's new Christmas album, ""Shatner Claus,"" is out now. William Shatner, thank you so much for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS"")
SHATNER: Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you. You answer quite slowly - a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis, and here's your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: This week, we're taking a break from the news, going outside and just binge-watching the world go by.
KURTIS: Have you seen the show called the clouds? The special effects are amazing.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: While Bill applies sunscreen, let's keep listening to our favorite segments from the last year. Here's a recent bluff game that became an instant classic.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
MICHAEL HULBERT: Hi there, Peter. This is Michael Hulbert, and I'm calling from Shelburne Falls, Mass.
SAGAL: Shelburne Falls, Mass - I thought I knew Massachusetts well, but I have no idea where that is.
HULBERT: It's a little bit west of Greenfield.
SAGAL: All right. Well...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Are you just making up town names to frustrate me?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because I've never heard of Greenfield, either. What do you do there?
HULBERT: I am a musician and performer in a small theater company called the Agile Rascal Bicycle Touring Theatre.
SAGAL: That's great. And...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bicycle touring?
HULBERT: Yes. We perform original works in theater, and we tour them on bicycles. And we perform for free.
SAGAL: So you said to yourself, you know, it's impossible to make a living in the theater. But let's - it's not hard enough. Let's...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Let's make sure that when we show up, we'll be sweaty.
TOM PAPA: How are we going to break into the Shelbyville market?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If you make it in Shelbyville, well, then you can move over to Greentown, or whatever that was.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry. Hello, Michael. It's nice to have you with us.
(LAUGHTER)
HULBERT: Thank you...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Good to talk to you. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is the topic?
KURTIS: Bullseye.
SAGAL: Darts - that's the game we play in bars, mostly, because that's definitely the time to be picking up sharp objects and throwing them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But what's a pastime here is a sport in Great Britain. In fact, there was a big cont-rah-versy (ph), as they say over there...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...At this year's Grand Slam of Darts tournament. Our panelists are each going to tell you about it. Only one of them is telling the truth. Pick that one, you will win our prize - the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?
HULBERT: Yes, I am.
SAGAL: All right. First, let's hear from Bim Adewunmi.
BIM ADEWUNMI: The world of professional darts, like any other high-performance sport, has its fair share of gamesmanship. From well-timed coughing jags to exaggerated sniffling, darts has seen and heard it all. But has it smelled it all? Things escalated this month following allegations of an ill wind, specifically one emanating from the behind of Scottish darts player Gary the Flying Scotsman Anderson.
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: In a post-match debrief after being blown out in a match 10-2...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Wesley Sparky Harms, Anderson's Dutch rival, accused the two-time PDC world champion of releasing something a little stronger than his signature smooth throw, all to gain the upper hand on the oche. Anderson staunchly denied the allegation, instead turning the accusation back on his rival. I swear on my children's lives that it was not my fault, he said. He then breezily relied on the classic he who smelt it dealt it defense...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Of all of our childhoods. Anderson, the winner, went on to describe the smell as eggs - rotten eggs.
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: But, he insisted, the stink hadn't come from him. Whoever the eye-watering stench came from, it'll take a while to disperse. Harms, presumably sporting a mean stink-eye...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Told Dutch TV channel RTL 7, it it'll take me two night to lose the smell from my nose.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: A gaseous controversy between two players at the Grand Slam of Darts. Your next story of a dart debacle comes from Brian Babylon.
BRIAN BABYLON: Everyone at the international darts championship was impressed by one of the first American women to make it to the finals, Dr. Cheri Gurdson (ph), a agricultural chemist professor from the University of Nebraska, who was competing while wearing a classic cornhusker's farmer's overall and plaid shirt with farm girl pigtails. The British tabloids called her Dr. Pippi Long-darts.
(LAUGHTER)
BABYLON: The semifinal round started like any other. Dr. Gurdson and her challenger, Charles Cook (ph), walked out and shook hands. By the second round, Charles Cook was visibly sweating and also whispering to each dart before he threw them. His last six throws missed the target entirely. Things look good for the American, but then her behavior also became erratic. She started gazing at each dart, turning them around, touching the point with her thumb, and then seemed surprised each time that they were sharp.
(LAUGHTER)
BABYLON: Finally, the match was called on account of both contestants not being able to continue. Finally, the disorientated Dr. Gurdson admitted to the truth. She laced her hands in a hallucinogenic frog toxin she made in the lab in order to get an edge on her opponent. Sadly, the antidote she created for herself didn't work as good as she hoped. In her last statement before being disqualified and ordered off the venue, she said, sometimes darts go on the target. Sometimes a target comes to you. Sometimes I can hear my own smells. Woo, go Cornhuskers.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: An American tried to use frog or toad toxins to defeat her opponent, but it backfired. Your last story of some bullseye BS comes from Tom Papa.
PAPA: The 2018 Grand Slam of Darts was not without controversy this year. For the first time in its storied history, the games were the focus of animal rights protesters, who are contending that the Dart Association is promoting animal cruelty by continuing to use the term bullseye.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: A crowd of protesters heckled attendees as they entered the building holding up signs that read, stick a dart in your own eye.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: What did the bull do to you? And Trump sucks.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: A spokesman for SAFE - the Save Animals From Exploitation organization - said it's time for the dart community to stop using the defenseless bull as its plaything. We went for the fox hunters. We're eliminating the bullseye. And we're coming after the flea circus next.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: Jonathan Haskel (ph), the head of the National Dart Association, seemed genuinely perplexed by the protests. We've had complaints before, but mainly about our drinking and our hygiene.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: This is a new one to me.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: All right.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: One of those happened at a major darts tournament in Great Britain. Was it, from Bim Adewunmi, one competitor saying that the guy who beat him got a unfair advantage by passing gas? From Brian Babylon, how an American competitor tried to use toad toxin to hallucinate her way to a victory? Or, from Tom Papa, how animal rights protesters disrupted the event because they protested the term bullseye? Which of these is the real story of an event at the big darts tournament?
HULBERT: Well, I think I'm going to go with Bim's
SAGAL: You're going to go with - you think you're going to go with Bim's.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Why are you choosing Bim's?
HULBERT: Farts are hilarious.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I - all right. You're choosing Bim's story. And to bring you the real story of what happened at this darts tournament, we spoke to a genuine sports journalist.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DES BIELER: There was a really strong smell of fart in the air while he...
(APPLAUSE)
BIELER: ...He who smelt it dealt it.
SAGAL: That was Des Bieler. He's a sports reporter for The Washington Post talking to us with great seriousness about the dart farter.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So, Michael, you got it right. You were correct. Farts are hilarious, and Bim was telling the truth. You've won our prize - the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing.
HULBERT: Thank you. Goodbye.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.

Paris Police Fire Tear Gas As Yellow Vest Protests Escalate : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715470174/yellow-vest-protesters-fueled-by-anger-over-notre-dame-funds-march-in-paris,"Enlarge this image Yellow vest protesters marched — and set fires — Saturday in Paris to remind the government that rebuilding the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral isn't the only problem the nation needs to solve. Francisco Seco/AP Francisco Seco/AP Yellow vest protesters marched — and set fires — Saturday in Paris to remind the government that rebuilding the fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral isn't the only problem the nation needs to solve.
Francisco Seco/AP Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET
Yellow vest protests grew violent on Saturday as firefighters battled several fires amid clouds of tear gas in eastern Paris.
Protesters set ablaze a car, motorbikes and barricades near the Place de la République as they took to the streets of Paris and other French cities for the 23rd Saturday in a row, The Associated Press reported . This time they say they are outraged the government could raise more than a billion dollars to help restore the burned Notre Dame cathedral while their demands to fight wealth inequality remain overlooked.
By late afternoon, police were firing tear gas and water cannons to disperse a tense crowd of several thousand people around France's finance ministry. Firefighters acted fast to put out several small fires in the area. NPR's Eleanor Beardsley reports from the scene that emergency personnel carried out the wounded on stretchers.
French police detained 189 people and took 110 into custody. The Interior Ministry says there were 6,700 protesters in Paris and more than 10,000 across the country.
Activists have marched in the streets every Saturday since November urging French President Emmanuel Macron to respond to a social crisis that has crippled the working class and elderly in France.
Protesters were banned from the Île de la Cité, the site of Notre Dame, and other major thoroughfares in the city. Some 60,000 police officers were dispatched across the country.
Protesters are calling Saturday's demonstrations their ""second ultimatum"" against Macron and his government. The night Notre Dame caught fire, Macron canceled a speech to propose solutions to the Yellow Vest movement. He is expected to hold a press conference on Thursday.
While the number of protesters have dwindled in recent weeks, French officials had warned that the marches could attract more protesters following the shock and sadness of the Notre Dame fire. Many protesters were set off by how quickly French billionaires pledged funds to restore the damaged cathedral, while many working class people in France struggle to pay their bills.
Correction April 20, 2019
An earlier version of this story misspelled Emmanuel Macron's first name as Emanuel. The story has also been updated to clarify that 60,000 police officers were dispatched across France, not Paris."

Venezuela's president has been making enemies throughout the Americas with a collapsed economy that has produced millions of migrants. But he still has friends in the Caribbean.
DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST:
Venezuela's reputation is suffering, thanks to its president, socialist Nicolas Maduro - derided as a despot who has provoked one of the biggest refugee outflows in Latin American history. But as John Otis reports, a handful of Caribbean countries remains firmly in Maduro's camp.
(APPLAUSE)
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: At a ceremony in August, Keith Rowley, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, signed an agreement for Venezuela to supply his twin-island nation with natural gas. President Maduro then took the microphone to praise a faithful partner.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: He said, Trinidad and Tobago should know it has a friend in the Venezuelan president. For the most part, Maduro has been making enemies. He faces sanctions from the Trump administration. Fourteen nations in the Americas, from Canada to Argentina, downgraded diplomatic relations with Caracas after Maduro was re-elected in May to another six-year term. They dismissed the vote as a sham. These governments are also worried about an exodus of 3.6 million Venezuelans who have fled hyperinflation and food shortages back home. Tiny Trinidad, which sits seven miles off the Venezuelan coast, has received 60,000 of them.
Still, Trinidad remains a staunch supporter of the Maduro government. Indeed, it refuses to label Venezuelans arriving here as refugees for fear of upsetting Maduro, so says Rodney Charles, an opposition lawmaker in Port of Spain, the capital.
RODNEY CHARLES: It does not make sense. We hear the news. We hear the reports - the starvation in Venezuela, the incarceration of political opponents. For some reason, this government does not want to acknowledge that there is a problem.
OTIS: Venezuelan allies like Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia are left-wing soulmates. But Trinidad's position is pragmatic. The government is betting that the August agreement to build an underwater pipeline between Venezuela and Trinidad will revive the island's vital natural gas sector. That's according to Mariano Browne, a former Trinidadian finance minister.
MARIANO BROWNE: That is the actual one of the reasons why this government is tippy-toeing around Venezuela because there's a monetary or pecuniary interest in acquiring Venezuela gas. And they don't want to do anything to upset the government.
OTIS: Several Caribbean countries, which receive subsidized Venezuelan oil, have adopted similar positions. Last year, for example, the Organization of American States tried to condemn the Maduro government for replacing the opposition-controlled Congress with a rubberstamp legislature. The resolution was blocked by Trinidad, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and several other small islands.
ERIC FARNSWORTH: This is one of the more frustrating aspects of the whole international effort on Venezuela.
OTIS: That's Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Americas Society think tank. He says it would make more sense for the region to insist on a return to full democracy in Venezuela.
FARNSWORTH: First of all, because then the economic relationship is going to be, you know, something that will, you know, really last for the long term - but more importantly, you're not then going to have - be threatened as these small island countries currently are, as Trinidad's a perfect example of, refugee flows of desperate Venezuelans trying to escape a collapsing country.
OTIS: Some are already second-guessing Trinidad's natural gas agreement. Charles, the lawmaker, points out that opposition politicians in Venezuela have warned that any energy contracts signed with Maduro will not be recognized should a new government take power in Caracas.
CHARLES: Why are we putting all of our eggs in the Maduro basket, given what we understand is the situation over there?
OTIS: Government officials in Trinidad did not respond to requests for comment. For NPR News, I'm John Otis in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Copyright © 2018 NPR. All rights reserved.

Venezuela's Authoritarian President Maduro Continues Blockade Of U.S. Aid - NPR,www.npr.org,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/11/693668165/venezuelas-authoritarian-president-maduro-continues-blockade-of-u-s-aid,"Venezuela's Authoritarian President Maduro Continues Blockade Of U.S. Aid Venezuela's Authoritarian President Maduro Continues Blockade Of U.S. Aid Embed Embed
U.S. food and medical aid for Venezuelans is sitting at the border, unable to move into the country because embattled President Nicolás Maduro has blocked the roads.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
The Venezuela-Colombia border - humanitarian aid from the U.S. sits on the Colombian side of that border, although it's intended for people inside Venezuela. If they were to receive it, that would boost opposition leader Juan Guaido. The U.S., among other countries, says he is Venezuela's legitimate head of state. But Venezuela's authoritarian president, Nicolas Maduro, still controls the country, and as John Otis reports, he's blocking the aid.
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Tons of food and medicine from the U.S. government sit in a warehouse near a bridge connecting Colombia and Venezuela. The warehouse now holds nearly $100 million of rice, flour, baby formula, diapers and emergency medical kits. As he toured the site on Friday, Kevin Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia, suggested that much more will be coming.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KEVIN WHITAKER: What you see here is the first shipments of what we hope will be a great flood of humanitarian relief for the people of Venezuela.
OTIS: But President Maduro is having none of it. Hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food and medicine have prompted more than 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, yet Maduro denies there's a problem.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: At a news conference, he said the humanitarian crisis was invented by Washington to justify an invasion of Venezuela.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Unintelligible).
OTIS: To stop the aid from getting across the frontier, Venezuelan soldiers have blocked all six lanes of the border bridge with shipping containers and a tanker truck. Now the area around the bridge has become a rallying point for angry Venezuelans like these doctors.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: They chant, what do we want? Humanitarian aid. Why? Because our patients are dying.
One of the protesters, Dayana Delgado, is an immunologist from the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal.
DAYANA DELGADO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: She says, ""if we have to, we will form a human chain and pass the aid box by box so it reaches the people who need it."" But humanitarian aid is also being used for hardball politics. Juan Guaido and his U.S. backers are hoping to put the powerful Venezuelan armed forces on the spot. Blocking the aid is infuriating average Venezuelans, but Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador, is urging military officers to turn against Maduro and allow the aid to flow. And that could be a major step towards regime change.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WHITAKER: This is an opportunity for the Venezuelan armed forces to take part in an admirable humanitarian campaign. The choice that they make now is going to be recorded by their families, by their country and by the entire world from here on out.
OTIS: Meanwhile, Guaido is calling for more street protests on Tuesday. He's also signing up volunteers to help distribute the U.S. aid.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JUAN GUAIDO: (Speaking Spanish).
OTIS: On Sunday, Guaido told reporters, our responsibility is to create enough political social and international pressure so that the aid is allowed in. But so far, the Venezuelan military remains loyal to Maduro. The border bridge remains blocked, and the supplies remain untouched in the warehouse.

'Stop The Maduro Genocide'- Protesters March In Venezuela With U.S. Support - NPR,www.npr.org,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/689883651/pressure-on-maduro-intensifies-as-venezuela-braces-for-more-protests,"— HispanoPost (@hispanopost) January 30, 2019
Economist Ricardo Hausmann told NPR's The Indicator that a Venezuelan earning a median salary would be able to buy fewer than two eggs on a day's wage. A survey from three universities in Venezuela found that citizens lost 24 pounds on average in 2017 because of the food shortage. Maduro's government has struggled to address the hardship and once drew ridicule for suggesting people eat rabbits to survive .
Protesters on Wednesday used the word for ""usurper"" to describe Maduro. In the Caracas neighborhood of Chacao, protesters stood on a road and waved Venezuelan flags. One held a placard that said ""Stop the Maduro Genocide.""
Maduro has shown no signs of relenting to the opposition. He retaliated by freezing Guadó's bank accounts and barring him from traveling overseas. Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, announced a criminal probe Tuesday into Guaidó's anti-government activities. In a video posted to Facebook and subtitled in English, Maduro accused President Trump of orchestrating a coup against his regime in an attempt to steal Venezuela's oil resources, and he warned the U.S. against military intervention.
""Let us not allow another war like Vietnam in Latin America,"" Maduro declared. ""Venezuela has a strong democracy. We have our own problems, as any other country, and we will solve them by ourselves.""
Maduro also joined dozens of evangelical supporters in a prayer session that was aired on state TV, appealing to an ""all powerful God"" to bless the nation, the AP reported .
The U.S., in turn, has ratcheted up pressure on Maduro's government. On Monday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-run oil company, and a day later, the State Department said it had granted Guaidó authority to take control of Venezuelan government assets held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any other U.S.-insured banks.
The U.S. is Venezuela's biggest customer for oil, and production is expected to drop if Maduro remains in power.
World powers have lined up on either side of the Venezuelan crisis. Some two dozen countries, including several Latin American nations, Australia , Canada and Israel , have backed Guaidó. A number of Western European countries have said they will side with him if Maduro does not call new elections.
Russia and China continue to support Maduro's regime with loans and political support at the U.N. Security Council. Private military contractors linked to Russia's government are also rumored to be in Venezuela protecting Maduro, Reuters reported , citing sources close to the contractors.
On Wednesday, Guaidó called on Venezuelan armed forces to ""cross over to our side, the side of the constitution."" 2/2 la apertura del canal humanitario y la Ley de Amnistía. #TúTambiénTienesRazones para seguir apoyando nuestra ruta: Cese a la usurpación, Gobierno de Transición y Elecciones Libres pic.twitter.com/GT3GyMbeEx — Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) January 30, 2019
So far, the vast majority of Venezuela's military has remained loyal to the sitting president and ignored Guaidó's appeals. On Wednesday, Maduro presided over military exercises and rallied rows of troops in green fatigues, invoking the liberator Simón Bolívar and former President Hugo Chávez and referring to the U.S. support of Guaidó as imperialism.
""The sun is rising,"" Maduro said. ""January is gone. And rebellious February, anti-imperialist February, is coming."" #EnVivo 📹 | Despertamos con el sol de nuestro Esequibo para iniciar la Marcha Militar con el personal acantonado en la REDI Capital y el Estado Mayor Superior de la #FANB . https://t.co/LhN55lcdTX — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) January 30, 2019
Maduro has offered to talk with the opposition, but Guaidó is likely to refuse negotiations because he does not recognize Maduro as the leader of the country.
Last week, Guaidó successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people for protests, as NPR has reported . The U.N. said Tuesday that 40 people are believed to have been killed during the weeklong political standoff. More than half of them are believed to have been shot by security forces or pro-government forces while protesting, and one member of the National Guard is also believed to have been killed during protests. More than 850 people are thought to have been detained.
Two French reporters covering the protests for the TV program Quotidien have been arrested, Reuters reports , citing a French diplomatic source.

Guaidó has called for more protests on Saturday.
Venezuela expert Bruce Bagley at the University of Miami said social protests and foreign pressure were unlikely to push Maduro out of office unless the military switched allegiances.
""Maduro doesn't care how many countries condemn him,"" Bagley told NPR.""The fulcrum is the military.""
The U.S. intervention is welcome among Venezuelans who are fed up with Maduro, NPR has reported, but worries remain that any transition would be violent, as hard-line pro-government troops, police and militias hold fast.

Venezuela's Maduro Orders Closure Of Brazilian Border - NPR,www.npr.org,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/22/696940060/venezuelas-maduro-orders-closure-of-brazilian-border,"Venezuela's Maduro Orders Closure Of Brazilian Border Facebook

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who is facing international pressure to step down after elections widely seen as rigged, ordered the country's vast border with Brazil to be closed. The move will make it harder for aid groups to get emergency food and medicine into the country.
The U.S. and some other countries have recognized Juan Guaidó, the parliamentary opposition leader, as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Guaidó is embracing the support and has promised to bring in emergency aid to help the poor country.
However, Maduro and his allies view the aid — particularly that coming from the U.S. — as part of an attempt to destabilize his government, ushering in regime change. Maduro has told Venezuelans that he believes the humanitarian effort is actually a pretext for a U.S. invasion .
""Maduro has remained firm, saying that this aid at the border will not come in,"" NPR's Eyder Peralta, reporting from Venezuela, told All Things Considered. ""He views it as a foreign invasion, and he has asked his military to act accordingly.""
Earlier this month, Maduro blocked one of the busiest highways on the Colombian border, preventing the entry of food and medicine there. Maduro said Thursday that he might also shut the border with Colombia, according to The Associated Press.
A looming showdown may come to a head on Saturday. That's when Guaidó has declared that tons of international aid, currently warehoused along the border, must be brought into the country — either peacefully, or by force.
So far the country's military has stood by Maduro, but President Trump has warned Venezuelan troops against trying to stop the flow of aid.
""If you choose this path, you will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,"" Trump said in Miami this week, directly addressing the Venezuelan military. To the crowd, he said, ""End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death for your people.""
Thousands of volunteers have amassed at the border to help bring the food and medicine into the country. Opposition politicians left the country's capital Thursday to drive to the border, but they were blocked by security officials. Peralta, who was traveling with the politicians, says that thousands of cars were blocked on one of the most important highways in Venezuela.
After Maduro announced the Brazilian border would be closed indefinitely, Venezuelans rushed into Brazil to buy groceries, Brazilian media reported ."

"Helvetica, The Iconic Font Both Loved And Scorned, Gets Its 1st Redesign In 36 Years",www.npr.org,Scott Simon,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715499199/helvetica-the-iconic-font-both-loved-and-scorned-gets-its-1st-redesign-in-36-yea,"Enlarge this image Helvetica is celebrated and loathed for its ubiquity. Now, the 62-year-old font is getting a face lift for the digital age. Jim Davis/Boston Globe via Getty Images Jim Davis/Boston Globe via Getty Images Helvetica is celebrated and loathed for its ubiquity. Now, the 62-year-old font is getting a face lift for the digital age.
Jim Davis/Boston Globe via Getty Images It's been used by brands such as American Airlines, Panasonic and Toyota. It's all over the signage in the New York City subway system. Even Google, Apple and Netflix used it for a time.
Helvetica is ubiquitous around the world, but despite its popularity, the typeface has some issues: letters scrunch together at small sizes and the space between them can be uneven.
Now, after 36 years, the widely used — and widely controversial — font is getting a makeover.
The upgrade was designed by the the Massachusetts type giant Monotype, which controls licensing for Helvetica. The company has updated each of Helvetica's 40,000 characters for the digital age, offering three new sizes designed to work on everything from billboards to the tiny screens of a smartwatch. The updated font even has a new name : ""Helvetica Now.""
Like many changes, though, some people are skeptical.
""If I'm perfectly honest, my first reaction was, do we need another Helvetica?"" says Charles Nix, type director at Monotype.
The altered typeface became a trending topic on Twitter. Mitch Goldstein, a design professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, wondered whether the buzz about Helvetica meant that the popular typeface was no more. That invited a variety of strong opinions on the font.
""Half the people were like, 'Awesome. It's dead. Finally! I'm so glad it's gone. It's the worst,' "" Goldstein says. ""And the other half of the people were like, 'Helvetica is incredible. It will never die.' ""
So much hatred for Helvetica in the replies. I mean... you guys... it's a typeface.
— Mitch Goldstein (@mgoldst) April 10, 2019 So why is Helvetica such a polarizing typeface?
""Helvetica is one of those typefaces that you love or hate,"" graphic designer Sarah Hyndman explains. ""You either use it all the time, it's become a staple, or you feel like you've grown out of it, and it's a little bit too ubiquitous.""
Hyndman says even if people don't like the new look of the font, many agree Helvetica needed change.
""There are lots of foibles in Helvetica like the way the letters space,"" she says. ""The [letter 'L'] looks too much like [the number '1'].""
YouTube Helvetica was also not the most versatile font in the toolbox, admits Nix. Now, he says, that's all changed.
""Helvetica used to not be able to be used for captions and small text because it was a little cramped,"" he says. ""Instead of being micro-challenged, we've made it like a micro-champion. So when you set captions in the new version of Helvetica, it really sings.""

"'Rafiki': The First Kenyan Film To Premiere At Cannes, Banned At Home",www.npr.org,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533608/rafiki-the-first-kenyan-film-to-premiere-at-cannes-banned-at-home,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks to Wanuri Kahiu, director of the film Rafiki about Kahiu's style of filmmaking and why the movie was banned in Kenya.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
We're going to talk about a new movie out this week called ""Rafiki."" It's a love story between two teenage girls. And it's based in Kenya, where gay sex is against the law. It's the first Kenyan film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. But back at home, it's been banned because of its subject matter.
WANURI KAHIU: The head of the classification board said, if I banned this film, I'll make you very popular. And definitely people turned up to us to see why this film was being banned. And I have to say, there was quite a lot of people who were disappointed that it was quite innocent, that it was quite light.
PFEIFFER: That's the film's director, Wanuri Kahiu. I spoke with her. And we began by talking about whether she was trying to be political with this film.
KAHIU: I'm never trying to make a political statement. I'm always trying to make an artistic statement. But because I am born of a certain gender and of a certain race, everything that I do becomes deemed political. And I think that it's even more unfortunate that sometimes that when two people are in love, the moment that you change the gender and the race of the people in love, it becomes increasingly political.
So a love story becomes less of a love story if it's black or if it's queer and then more levels of politicization are assigned to it. I was just trying to make a love story. And that's all I was trying to do. I wasn't trying to make a political statement.
PFEIFFER: Even if you didn't mean to, it certainly has become that for some people. Does it surprise you? Or did that feel inevitable?
KAHIU: I think it feels inevitable. But though it surprised me, I really still resist it. I think the film became political after the film was banned. And when we went to court to fight for freedom of expression, then it became a political act. But the film in and of itself I feel is just a love story.
PFEIFFER: One thing that really struck me about this movie is that so many films about Africa show us war and poverty and AIDS and disease. This is a movie bursting with bold colors and vibrant music, really beautiful street scenes of laundry drying and food being served. It's bright and cheerful, dynamic. I wondered if that was a deliberate way to portray Africa differently than it's often portrayed?
KAHIU: Absolutely. I am a firm believer in what we've started to term as AFROBUBBLEGUM, which is not only a movement, it's become a genre. And it means fun, fierce and frivolous African art. So anything that has joy and hope at the center of it coming from Africa I consider AFROBUBBLEGUM. And it was incredibly important that I tell stories of joy, stories of love, stories of resilience and absolute radiance.
I like the term radical hope. And those kind of stories are incredibly important to tell not only because we need to see images of ourselves so that we know we are worthy of hopeful existences, but so that other people can start to see us as that. And if Africa is actually the cradle of humanity, then we need to be able to be sensitive about Africa and the depiction of Africans because it speaks to so much of where our lineage came from not only as people of color and people in the diaspora, but in a genetics sort of a way, you know?
We want to think that we are born of love and joy. And our existence as a whole has been joyful and loving and kind. And the only way to do that is if we see images of ourselves in joy and in love.
PFEIFFER: Kenya has a film classification board that was not happy with your movie because it depicts gay sex. They actually asked you to change the end of the film to have the main character look more remorseful that now ends more on a note of hope. You wouldn't do that, and that got the movie banned.
I've read that you said you think that the ban wasn't prompted so much by the lesbian scenes as by the happy ending. Do you think that if things had ended badly for the two women, maybe the censors wouldn't have objected so much?
KAHIU: Oh, they were very clear on it. It's not that they would have objected, they were very, very clear on it. I had a meeting with the Kenya Film Classification Board. And during the meeting, not once did anybody say that the love scenes should be changed or the kiss should be changed or anything of that nature. The only thing they said is that the ending was not remorseful enough.
And they didn't feel that if the film was happy and joyous, that that was a message that they wanted to support. But if I could change the ending of the film and make it more remorseful, then perhaps they would give me a rating. And they were quite clear on that.
PFEIFFER: And what does that tell you about their thought process and what they think about this larger issue?
KAHIU: I think that for me, it's quite complicated because if you think of our country's motto - and we have a beautiful Kenyan motto, which is peace, love, and unity - I think that if they wanted me to change the ending, it wouldn't be reminiscent of the spirit of the motto.
And I truly feel that the film, the way it is really speaks to our achievements and our growth as people. And the ideals of peace, love and unity should be something that we truly work towards in our art, in our - in the way we think and act. But asking for work to be remorseful I think goes against the very spirit of the nation.
PFEIFFER: There is a a violent scene, though - not gory - but given how lovely and light much of the rest of the movie is, it's hard to watch because when the women do get outed as a couple, basically a mob descends on them. And that was hard to watch, I think.
KAHIU: Yeah, it was. But we have to remember that 1 in 5 LGBT people in Kenya are violently attacked because of how they identify. And it's something that we have to be cognizant of. And it's something that we have to pay attention to. So while I would have loved the film to exist without it, I thought that it was important to also tell the story of the harm that is caused as a result of the way you choose to love.
PFEIFFER: There's a point in the movie where this - these two young women are talking about what future there could be for them.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""RAFIKI"")
SHEILA MUNYIVA: (As Ziki Okemi) Kena, stop being naive. What did you expect was going to happen either way? Are you planning to marry me? Are we going to have this beautiful family?
SAMANTHA MUGATSIA: (As Kena Mwaura) Yes.
PFEIFFER: Kenya's High Court is considering overturning the ban on gay sex. I think that's going to happen later this year.
KAHIU: Yeah, in May.
PFEIFFER: In the meantime, though, people who are public about being gay in Kenya are at risk of being harmed or arrested. I'm wondering what hope you think there is for people in same-sex relationships in Kenya? What actually are the long-term possibilities right now?
KAHIU: Well, the fact that there is a case in court that is decriminalizing homosexuality means that the law for the first time has to recognize that LGBTQ+ people exist. They are mentioned and identified as Kenyans. That's a huge leap forward. There's many people who came out as a result of ""Rafiki."" People came to watch the movie. They went home - came with their parents to watch the movie. And came out to their parents. That was huge.
There's a beautiful tweet I read a couple of weeks ago. The tweet asked what was the happiest moment of your life? And somebody answered watching ""Rafiki"" and coming out to my mother. So it is hopeful. Things are changing. Conversations are starting within families. They've definitely started within my own family. So that in itself is hope.
PFEIFFER: Wanuri Kahiu is director of ""Rafiki,"" a movie about a love story between two teenage girls. Thanks for talking with us.
KAHIU: Thank you.

A recent opioid sting caught 60 people, including doctors, accused of enabling addicts. Physician Stephen Loyd tells NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer how the sting could affect addicted patients.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
A crackdown this week on opioid abuse resulted in federal criminal charges against 60 people accused of illegally prescribing and distributing opioids. They include doctors, nurses and pharmacists. One even allegedly traded drugs for sex. That sting focused on Appalachia, one of the areas hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. It's a mostly rural area where access to health care is already a challenge for residents.
So we wanted to know about the impact of this crackdown on both addicts and people who rely on opioids to manage chronic pain. That's something Dr. Stephen Loyd has been thinking a lot about over the last few days. He's based in Nashville. And he's the state of Tennessee's former assistant commissioner for substance abuse. He's also a former addict, and now works with addiction recovery programs in the Nashville area. Dr. Loyd, thank you for talking with us about this.
STEPHEN LOYD: Thanks so much for having me, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: More than half the people charged in the sting are from Tennessee, where you live. Seventeen of them are doctors. Give us some perspective on what happens when you remove 17 doctors and other health care officials from a rural area that already has a doctor shortage even if those doctors were doing criminal things?
LOYD: That's something that, you know, that I think we really need to consider because a lot of these areas have a hard time recruiting providers in the first place. And I ran into this in previous work that I had done against doctors and nurse practitioners who were improperly prescribing. And even in open-and-shut cases, it's very hard to remove those doctors from the community in front of the jury of their peers because they're the only health care sometimes, you know, for miles.
And so it is an impact on the community. And I think that a lot of consideration has been given to that by our state officials. But it is an impact because of the restricted access to care, even if they are bad providers when it comes to prescribing controlled substances.
PFEIFFER: Well, and the reality is that some of these health care professionals who were charged will probably not be able to practice again. That really impacts people who relied on them to get opioids to manage chronic pain. What are the options for those patients now?
LOYD: There's only so much you can do, Sacha, right? You can direct them towards another health care provider. But a lot of times, we're talking about, you know, certified legitimate pain medicine doctors - which I can tell you, there are not enough of in our state, and certainly aren't enough of in rural Appalachia - and then those people with addiction, you know, the people who, you know, who have been feeding their addiction through these illicit prescriptions. Legitimate addiction medicine doctors that are going to utilize evidence based practice, there is a shortage of those as well.
Now, if we're talking about state agencies and state funded agencies that, you know, such things as the 21st Century Cures Act money that came down a few years ago initiated by President Obama and then, you know, followed through on with President Trump, that's really good access to care. And my state's done a great job with that. But the problem lies outside of their control, right? Because now we're really talking about the stigma associated with chronic pain patients as well as patients with addiction disease, and therein is the underlying problem.
PFEIFFER: In terms of how to help people who've lost their doctors in this sting, the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has publicized two hotlines that people can call to find treatment services or counselling. And they say they're offering more training sessions to teach people how to use naloxone, the overdose reversal drug. Do you think that's enough outreach?
LOYD: I think it's a great response, right? It's a great initial response. But I want you to think of it from a patient standpoint, and that's where I come from. So - because I work in this everyday and I see the mindset - so it takes a lot to pick up the phone and call a hotline. And then, you know, being directed from care there, there's a lot of follow through that has to happen. And there's some folks that won't do that for a lot of reasons. And so a lot of times, the easier alternative is is to seek it illicitly. So is it enough? No, I don't think it's ever enough. But I don't think it's anything that state agencies can control right now.
PFEIFFER: So if, as you say, this crackdown could result in people just looking elsewhere for drugs, maybe illegal drugs, what has been accomplished?
LOYD: Well, you have to take players like this out of the business. This is one of the things that frustrates me right now. The pharmaceutical industry points to now is, OK, we're not talking about prescription pills anymore, right? We're talking about illicit heroin and fentanyl. But people got started seeking heroin and fentanyl from the prescribing of those pain medications coming out of clinics like this. You absolutely have to cut that off.
The response will be what - where the key is in how we direct people to help.
PFEIFFER: So crack down on the doctors, but make sure there's a support system ready for their patients.
LOYD: Absolutely. And the thing is - and this is so beautiful - is that when you get to watch lives change. For myself, you know, I used to get up every single morning thinking, you know, where am I going to get my pills? And that occupied my entire day. Now, keep in mind, I was a practicing physician. So I had some other things to do. And that's what people who are, you know, who are addicted are facing every single day.
And now, you know, providing them with quality help and watching them change their lives is one of the most fun things that I've ever been involved with. We need to make that opportunity more widespread. We need to decrease the stigma around stepping out and ask for help. And also, Sacha, we need to make evidence-based treatment available without the stigma that goes along with it.
PFEIFFER: That's Dr. Steven Loyd. He's based in Nashville, Tenn. Thanks for talking with us.

Congress must decide what to do with information from the Mueller report. Democratic strategists Luis Miranda and Robin Winston tell NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer whether their party should pursue impeachment.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Now that the Mueller report has been released, it's up to Congress to decide how to move forward. The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas for an unredacted version of the report. Many lawmakers have called for special counsel Robert Mueller to testify. And yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress will exercise the, quote, ""oversight of our democracy."" For some people in the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party, that means impeachment. But many party leaders, including Pelosi, have cautioned against that.
So where do the Democrats, who are now in charge of the House, go from here? We have two Democratic strategists with us to debate that. Luis Miranda was a former Democratic National Committee spokesman, and Robin Winston is former chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.
Thanks for joining us.
LUIS MIRANDA: Thanks, Sacha.
ROBIN WINSTON: Thank you.
PFEIFFER: Luis Miranda, as a former DNC spokesperson, how would you advise the party to proceed, especially in the context of the presidential primaries beginning in less than a year?
MIRANDA: I think that voters really expect the party and the elected officials that they went out for very strongly in November of 2018 to take their responsibilities seriously. I think we all expect the candidates for president and those running for 2020 to stay focused on a variety of issues - on the economy, on health care. But if you were elected to the House of Representatives, I think you have a duty to that congressional oversight and to not really wavering on something that the Mueller report appears to make pretty clear, which is that Congress needs to take up at least the consideration of impeachment.
PFEIFFER: Just before the redacted Mueller report came out, a poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School found that 51 percent of people said the report's findings would make no difference in how they vote in the 2020 election. They just care more about other things. How, Luis, do you think that should factor into the thinking of Democrats?
MIRANDA: Well, I think that if you go by polls, they'll tell you a lot of different things at different moments. I think it's a moment to really focus on principles, and how do you restore faith and trust in our democracy and in the rule of law? And if we don't - and I'm a centrist. I think I'm much closer to the center of the party than to the far left.
But I can tell you that I think voters would see any effort to sort of whitewash this as another example of the establishment just not taking their role seriously and just politics as usual. And so we have to be very realistic about the fact that if we don't act forcefully and convincingly and do - and carry out the duty that the Office of Congress and their duty as a coequal branch of government has, I think it'll have an effect on - particularly in the primaries, but certainly later if you have a disaffected base going into 2020.
PFEIFFER: Robin Winston, you spent several years chairing the Democratic Party in Indiana. That gives you a perspective beyond Washington. What does that wider perspective make you think about what the Democrats' next move should be?
WINSTON: Well, I think it's kitchen table issues. Folks here in the Midwest are concerned about jobs, retaining jobs. You know, look at the folks in Lordstown. They're not concerned about the Mueller report. They're concerned about their mortgage and where their paycheck's going to come from because you closed down a plant that over 1,200 people relied upon for their daily income.
You know, the way that I look at approaching this is there's really three tangible things. One's a constitutional argument. One's a legal argument. And then, of course, there's a political argument. If we look back to the 2018 elections, many of the Democrats who were elected were not elected because of the Trump investigation of Mueller. I don't remember many people running those ads. What they ran ads about was affordable health care, was about doing something about our deficit and about making sure that we address the issues of immigration.
To me, I've always been a person who believes that kitchen table issues do resonate with voters. I think it'd be premature right now to talk about impeachment, mainly because we don't have the complete report.
MIRANDA: And I agree with Robin that there's three separate questions - the political one for 2020 candidates, I agree with them. They're not going to be - if they get elected to office, they're not going to be dealing with Trump's impeachment, so that's not really for them to carry. But if you were elected to the House, there's a duty there.
PFEIFFER: A question for both of you - is there something short of impeachment that you'd like to see Democrats do to satisfy people in the party who say, look - the Mueller report points to 10 separate instances of the president attempting to slow down the investigation, so he needs to be sanctioned in some way? I'm thinking of a piece Karen Tumulty wrote for The Washington Post suggesting an official censure.
WINSTON: I think that the Democrats will go ahead and have their hearings. I think that Bob Mueller will draw more people to any television show than anything recently. I believe that once he testifies and once we get the complete report that you will find that a lot of our folks will look at other actions that can be taken. Maybe censure is one of them. But one of the most stirring actions that can be taken is to defeat the president in November of '20. You know, we've got people that are out campaigning. The I word that they're hearing on the campaign trail is about immigration, not about impeachment.
MIRANDA: And I think that's right - that once Mueller presents himself at a public hearing - and certainly a private one so that they can go over some of the redacted pieces that legitimately needed to be kept away, whether it's because of ongoing cases or protecting methods and sources. But once he actually comes out, and if he sounds more like what we are reading in the report than what Barr - Attorney General Barr tried to present in his defense of Donald Trump, then I think you have more to go on for sure, absolutely. And I think that's got to be the starting point. But the report does seem to lay out that Congress has an obligation to do much more than simply look the other way.
But Robin and I are on the same page here - that our candidates in Iowa and across the country need to be focused on issues beyond Trump because if they do get elected in 2020, they're going to need to be focused on rebuilding and healing and strengthening our economy, expanding health care access. So those are definitely the issues that people should be campaigning on. But if you're in Congress right now, you need to take this report seriously.
PFEIFFER: Luis Miranda was a Democratic National Committee spokesman, and Robin Winston was chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.
Thanks to both of you.
MIRANDA: Thank you.

Troll Watch: What We Learned From The Mueller Report : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533622/troll-watch-what-we-learned-from-the-mueller-report,"
Clint Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute tells NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer what he learned about how Russian Internet trolls operate from the redacted Mueller report.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
And now we want to spend a few minutes looking at a specific piece of the Mueller report. It's a large section about Russian troll activity and its impact on the 2016 election. That's today's topic in our regular segment called Troll Watch.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
PFEIFFER: This is where we usually look at what kind of fake news and memes were pushed by trolls this week. Today, we're taking a slightly different perspective in asking what the Mueller report reveals about these operations. Joining us is Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and now a distinguished research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Clint, thank you so much for talking with us.
CLINT WATTS: Thanks for having me.
PFEIFFER: The Mueller report examines the activities of a big troll farm based in St. Petersburg, Russia. It's funded by a Russian oligarch. It's called the IRA, short for the Internet Research Agency. Give us a mini-tutorial on what the Internet Research Agency is and why it gets mentioned so many times in the report.
WATTS: The Internet Research Agency is essentially a central hub for the disinformation put out by the Russian state-sponsored disinformation system - meaning that it helps coordinate the bringing together of state-sponsored propaganda like how RT, Russia Today, is funding news headlines, go into the social media landscape - and then how audiences are infiltrated through the use of personas that are false but also look like and talk like the audience they're trying to influence.
PFEIFFER: Some of the information about this troll farm is redacted in the Mueller report, mainly because of ongoing investigations. But from what you were able to read, did you learn anything you didn't already know?
WATTS: There were things that I had assumed or sort of calculated over the years writing about their disinformation that I didn't know for sure. One was that in 2014, they were already starting to move to the U.S. audience base. They had also taken a field trip to the United States, which was a counter to the supposition that was put out in a lot of arguments that there must be Americans working for him.
In fact, they'd actually come to America. Something else that I thought was deeply frightening was we had heard about how the Russian troll farm had orchestrated protest inside the United States. But they had been doing that as early as 2015 and had done that after the election. This is a much longer period than we had known before.
PFEIFFER: The Mueller report contains specific examples of fake Twitter accounts controlled by this Russian troll farm. One was meant to look like an official account of the Tennessee Republican Party. Some of its tweets were critical of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren. It was even retweeted by Trump campaign officials and Trump's sons. Do you have any advice for regular people on social media for how they can spot when these accounts are fake, and you're essentially being manipulated?
WATTS: It's very difficult to spot a Russian influence account or a growing number of domestic misinformation accounts that appear around the elections. But things to always look for are, one, is it a verified account or not? I think the next part is, do you have a actual person's name? Do you know where they're physically located? Do they share media, live video, pictures of themselves that show them to be who they are? Oftentimes, the trolls would use flowers or dogs or pets - that sort of thing - or would take images off the web and use those. And people oftentimes would find themselves being used as a troll farm account.
So can you verify the identity of that? And if you can't, you should not necessarily trust the information they're sharing with you. You should not retweet it. And you shouldn't share with others unless you really know where it's coming from.
PFEIFFER: We obviously have another presidential election coming. Is there anything that you think can be learned from the Mueller report to try to prevent other foreign groups from influencing U.S. voters in 2020?
WATTS: One of the strange vulnerabilities of the Mueller report is that now that we've seen it, it actually alerts many actors to where the vulnerabilities still are in our country. One is election infrastructure. It's been talked about it a lot, but the Congress has still not been able to pass the Honest Ads Act or the Election Integrity Act. We need our institutions to be able to protect voting machines. We should have paper ballot backups. We should have verifiable audit trails. I think the next part is, in terms of social media, the social media companies have actually done far more than the U.S. government has to really build resilience going into 2020.
So the number one thing we need from our country, I think, at this point is leadership. Anytime falsehoods are levered for political purposes, that provides ripe ammunition for the Russian government or really any foreign actor to use that to divide us in this country. Russia won't need to write fake news in 2020. Americans are doing plenty of that for themselves. And Russia can just repurpose and reuse that information to divide us. And I think that's a vulnerability that really comes down to our leaders in Congress and at the White House.
PFEIFFER: That's former FBI special agent Clint Watts, now with the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Clint, thank you.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with retired coal miner Ronnie Hipshire about a picture of his father that was used without permission by Russian trolls to promote then-candidate Donald Trump.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Now we're going to hear from someone who was affected by Russian trolls. Ronnie Hipshire is a retired coal miner in West Virginia. His father, Lee, was also a coal miner, and he died of complications from black lung disease. Ronnie learned something disturbing on Page 31 of the Mueller report. Without his family's permission, a Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency had used a photo of his dad for a pro-Trump poster. Ronnie Hipshire is with us from Logan, W.Va., to explain how this unfolded.
Ronnie, welcome to the program. And I wonder if you could first describe this photo to us because I've seen it, and it's very memorable - has a big impact.
RONNIE HIPSHIRE: OK, I sure will. Back in 1974, Earl Dotter, a photojournalist with the MWA, was put with my dad in the Paragon Mine (ph) to sort of shadow him all day long to see in the mines why so many men were getting killed and so many things were happening back in the '70s. And my dad was exiting the mine after the day, and Earl shot this photo of my father coming out of the Paragon Mine. And the picture shows him after a hard day's work.
What I didn't like about seeing this on the Mueller report is them stealing my dad's picture and putting it on a Trump campaign rally. And my dad was one of the most staunch Democrats that you'll ever see in your life. And he never would have even thought about putting his face on something like that. It just was beyond me to see it. I just - it disturbed me big-time because I know what my dad would have thought.
PFEIFFER: How did you learn that it was in the Mueller report?
HIPSHIRE: Earl Dotter sent me an email telling me about it.
PFEIFFER: The photographer.
HIPSHIRE: Yeah, the photographer that took the picture. He emailed me and told me about it, and I looked it up, and seen that, and went and took it up to my sister and showed her about it. And it just went through her, too, you know. It just - she couldn't believe that it was used by the Russians to get someone elected. I guess you would call it a troll like your column, you know. It was something it wasn't supposed to be 'cause it wasn't through the blessing of Earl or us to have dad's picture representing Donald Trump - something I know that he definitely would have never done.
PFEIFFER: Do you think you would feel any differently if the photo had been used to promote a different political issue that you support? So without your family's permission, but an issue that you actually advocate for.
HIPSHIRE: If it was - they would come to me, right? Yes, I believe in that. I believe that dad would have - you know, he was a Democrat. He would love the Democrat Party.
PFEIFFER: What would you like to see happen to prevent this from happening to other people?
HIPSHIRE: I don't know what you would do to keep them from doing it. If they can get in and steal stuff like this, how can they - how could you block the Internet down? I mean, I don't know.
PFEIFFER: Ronnie Hipshire is a retired coal miner from West Virginia.
Ronnie, thank you for talking with us about this.
HIPSHIRE: Thank you. You have a blessed day.

Maxwell House Partners With Amazon For A 'Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Passover Haggadah : NPR,www.npr.org,Eliza Dennis,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533615/maxwell-house-partners-with-amazon-for-a-marvelous-mrs-maisel-passover-haggadah,"Maxwell House Partners With Amazon For A 'Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Passover Haggadah Maxwell House Partners With Amazon For A 'Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Passover Haggadah Embed Embed
With over 50 million printed copies, Maxwell House has released a new edition of their Haggadah, designed for fans of the Amazon show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel .
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Last night marked the beginning of Passover, the holiday when Jews gather together to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt. To do this, you need a haggadah. And as NPR's Eliza Dennis reports, a common one in the U.S. comes from a place you might not expect.
(SOUNDBITE OF AD)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Smell good, ground coffee. That's Maxwell House coffee.
ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE: That's right. Maxwell House is the producer of a popular haggadah in the U.S. Let me explain. The haggadah is a book of texts used during the Seder, Passover's ritual meal. And Maxwell House produced their haggadah as a marketing tool.
JENNY SINGER: The Maxwell House haggadah is the longest-running sales promotion in advertising history.
DENNIS: That's Jenny Singer. She is the deputy life and features editor for The Forward, a Jewish American publication. And she knows a thing or two about the Maxwell House haggadah. It all started with the 1920s ad-man Joseph Jacobs. He realized that his fellow Jews weren't drinking coffee because they thought it wasn't kosher for Passover. So he turned to Maxwell House.
SINGER: They got this kind of obscure Lower Eastside rabbi to give them the OK to say that coffee is kosher for Passover.
DENNIS: Joseph Jacobs saw an opportunity.
SINGER: You buy a pound of Maxwell, you get a free haggadah.
DENNIS: And people did. Maxwell House has printed more than 55 million haggadot.
SINGER: You open it up. And there are these gorgeous illustrations of Moses parting the Red Sea, and then the Israelites sitting down to drink Maxwell House coffee on the other side.
DENNIS: And it hasn't changed much. The Maxwell House haggadah has only been updated to modernize some of the language and to include gender neutral pronouns. But this year, there's a special edition.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL"")
RACHEL BROSNAHAN: (As Midge Maisel) And crazy, the famous mad divorcee of the upper west side.
DENNIS: That's Midge Maisel, the main character of the hit TV show ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" set in 1950s New York City. She's a Jewish housewife who makes brisket during the day and does standup comedy at night. And this year, Maxwell House and Amazon, which produces the show, teamed up on an updated version of the haggadah. It's Pepto Bismol pink. It includes a recipe for Midge's famous brisket, and is complete with wine stains and illustrations of the cast members.
ALEX BORSTEIN: I didn't know Maxwell House still existed. I'm not even joking. Like, the coffee that I drink at this point are just always those little pod things. But I happily ordered some coffee.
DENNIS: That's Alex Borenstein, the actress that plays Susie Myerson, Midge's fearless agent.
BORSTEIN: She's a little Jewish person.
DENNIS: And so is Borstein. She actually grew up using the Maxwell House haggadah.
BORSTEIN: It's a long one. It's the dry one. It's the - it's the fire and brimstone.
DENNIS: And what would her character Susie think?
BORSTEIN: Susie would be like, oh, my God, 63 pages? What, are we slaves again? How long are we stuck here? This is 40 years.
DENNIS: Borstein and a few other cast members will be having a Masel Passover tonight. And they'll be using the Maxwell haggadot - well, mostly.
BORSTEIN: I like to add my own flavor.
DENNIS: Maybe we'll see that version next year.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL "")
BROSNAHAN: (As Midge Maisel) You've been a great audience, ladies and gentlemen. That's it for me. My name is Mrs. Maisel. Thank you, and good night.

NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with retired Olympic soccer star Abby Wambach about her new book, <em>Wolfpack: How to Come Together, Unleash our Power, and Change the Game</em>
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Abby Wambach was a major soccer star - two Olympic gold medals, the all-time highest goal score among women and men internationally, global recognition. But when Barnard College, the all-women's school in New York City, asked her to give its commencement address last year, she felt underqualified. So she poured her heart into her speech and decided to turn it into a rallying cry for women.
That hard work paid off. Her speech went viral, and she's now turned it into a book about leadership for people everywhere. It's called ""WOLFPACK: How To Come Together, Unleash Our Power, And Change The Game."" Abby Wambach is with us from Colorado Public Radio to talk about some of the leadership lessons in her new book.
Abby, welcome to the show.
ABBY WAMBACH: Wow. That was that was maybe the best introduction that I've gotten...
PFEIFFER: (Laughter).
WAMBACH: ...Over the last couple weeks being on the road with this. So can I take you with me everywhere I go now, Sacha?
PFEIFFER: We're glad to hear that. Thank you for that. So you actually start your book with a note to readers. It's about a company that was hiring you to teach leadership. And the man you were talking with told you he wanted to make sure that your presentation was also applicable to men. You had a sassy reply. Would you tell our listeners how you responded to him?
WAMBACH: Yeah. I said, good question, but only if you ask that of other male speakers for the women that will be in the audience. You know, and I think that - the reason why I wanted to start the book off with this specific anecdote is because I have to bring light to some of the micro-aggressions or insidious things that men say that women have to take and eat and store away.
And, you know, this is also part of the book, where I'm inviting men into this solution, into this conversation. Because I don't believe myself to be this righteous feminist who doesn't - and is male-hating. Like, I actually really think that men have to be a part of the solution for us to create the change that we want to see in the world. And so this is kind of my invitation. And a way to draw men into this conversation is to kind of showcase an instance that has happened to women so often.
PFEIFFER: A constant theme is the book is that leadership has no universal form. You can lead from wherever you are in life. And you give an example near the end of your career. It's your final season on the U.S. women's national soccer team. You're no longer a starter. That could feel really devastating. But you realized you can lead from the bench. I love that idea - lead from the bench. Can you talk about that a little?
WAMBACH: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think everybody knows what it feels like to be benched. And I think that we have to acknowledge the fact that we're human beings, and that's going to hurt. So you're allowed to be disappointed. But what you're not allowed to do is to miss your opportunity to lead from the bench.
You know, in 2015, I came off the bench for our Women's National Team and my final World Cup. We ended up winning this World Cup, and I think that there was a reason. And it wasn't just because of the players on the field - it was because of the support that they were given by those players that were sitting on the bench and that came off the bench to close out those games.
You know, it's not easy. Like, I have children, and I see the feelings that run through them when they aren't starting. But I also have to get my children aware of what they're doing in their body language and their response to that benching, what that can do to the collective because, at the end of the day, we have to figure out, we have to decide if you and your ego mean more than the group's win, than the collective success of everyone else, whether it's being left off a project or not given the raise or not getting the - not got the job. Or you're at home, and you're nursing your child, and you're home on maternity leave and fearing that your colleagues are getting ahead.
There's so many different versions of what it means to be benched. And I can safely say that I wouldn't have learned the full context of what really true leadership is about until I had the opportunity to lead from the bench.
PFEIFFER: You write about how after you retired, your greatest loss was losing your team, your teammates. That was so important to you. And at a certain point, you had taken a break from physical activity. You were trying to get back into running. It was really hard. And your wife pointed out to you, well, you've lost your team. You're trying to do it alone. So you have a lesson that says, find your pack. I like that, too. Tell us what you mean by that. How do you find a pack?
WAMBACH: Our Women's National Team has been so successful over decades since the beginning of the creation of the team, right? And all of these women - we all think that we're the best in the world. Rightfully so - but you can imagine that environment and the standards and the competition and the challenge and the demanding aspects of it. So, having lived inside of this little ecosystem for so many years, I became so accustomed to having those around me push me to become my best self.
So I took a few years off, and I got super unfit, but I needed - my body needed a complete reset. So I started running again, and this whole thing - like, I hate running. I hate every step of it. And I would come home, and I would complain. And eventually, my wife was, like, look - like, you don't have your teammates around you.
And it dawned on me - like, wow. Oh, OK. I see how this works. Suffering and joy is made so much better when you get to do it with people around you that see your best self and hold you to that account.
PFEIFFER: It's common for professional athletes after they retire to feel like they've lost their identity. What have you done to kind of rebuild who you are? Do you feel like you have an identity again after your pro career?
WAMBACH: You know, that's a really great question. Our book hit No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list on Wednesday. And here I am having written this book and stepping into a different version of, you know, women's rights feminist icon. And it's something I'm really proud of because I had to really educate myself on what I believe to be true.
And so I - I don't know. I think that recreating a person's identity is happening on the daily. And I - for me - I want to keep breaking free from all of these identities and get down to that last one, which is human. And I hope that people out there feel the same way because we are all the same matter.
PFEIFFER: That soccer star Abby Wambach.
Abby, thank you.

The migrants are encountering crowded shelters, strained resources, and residents who are not as generous as they were with a previous caravan that was making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:
We're also following some news in Latin America. A new group of Honduran migrants is travelling north through Guatemala. They're encountering crowded shelters, and strained resources and residents who have not been as generous as they were with an earlier caravan on its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. Maria Martin has this report.
MARIA MARTIN, BYLINE: The sign outside the migrant help organization called Casa Migrante in downtown Guatemala City reads, (speaking Spanish), we're sorry, but we're full. Still, hundreds - some estimate thousands - of mostly Honduran migrants sat or stood on the sidewalks for blocks outside the shelter on Thursday evening hoping for a meal, a bed or some direction. Many are on their second or third night of a long journey fleeing Honduras.
ELESEO: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: Thirty-five-year-old Eleseo (ph), from Progreso de Yoro (ph), says one can't live in Honduras. Eleseo believes Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez is to blame for the poverty and violence driving people north. ""He's corrupt and shameless,"" says Eleseo.
(SOUNDBITE OF CHILD CRYING)
MARTIN: Among the migrants, there are many families with children.
JUAN RAMON MURILLO: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: Juan Ramon Murillo (ph) and his wife, Vivian (ph), sit on the sidewalk with their 4-year-old daughter, Katherine (ph), between them. He's 27 and says finding work is hard in their community of San Juan. They decided to take the risk to head north to the U.S. to find a better life for their family.
HUMBERTO BARRIOS: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: After many hours of waiting, Father Humberto Barrios (ph) of Casa Migrante comes out to speak to the waiting throng of migrants. ""Be calm and patient,"" he says. ""Everyone will get a meal, with priority for the women and children."" He says they're working to see if more beds can be found for this night.
BARRIOS: (Speaking Spanish).
MARTIN: ""We are alarmed by the large number of people,"" says Father Humberto. ""It's harder now to find shelters than previous caravans now that school is back in session,"" he says, ""especially with no help from the Guatemalan government and the public, for whatever reason, not quite as generous with this group as when the last caravan passed through Guatemala last October.""

Go in search of eggs in most foreign countries and you might encounter a strange scene: eggs on a shelf or out in the open air, nowhere near a refrigerator.
Shock and confusion may ensue. What are they doing there? And are they safe to eat?
We Americans, along with the Japanese, Australians and Scandinavians, tend to be squeamish about our chicken eggs, so we bathe them and then have to refrigerate them.
But we're oddballs. Most other countries don't mind letting unwashed eggs sit next to bread or onions.
The difference boils down to two key things: how to go after bacteria that could contaminate them, and how much energy we're willing to use in the name of safe eggs. Think You Know How To Cook Eggs? Chances Are You're Doing It Wrong
To understand when the rift happened, let's rewind. About a hundred years ago, many people around the world washed their eggs. But there are a lot of ways to do it wrong, so the method got a bad reputation in certain parts of the world. A batch of rotten eggs, which had been washed in Australia, left a bad impression on its British importers.
By 1970, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had perfected the art of the wash with the help of fancy machines, and it required all egg producers to do it. Meanwhile, many European countries were prohibiting washing, and Asian countries never got on board with it. The exception was Japan, which joined the egg-washers after a bad spate of salmonella in the 1990s.
So what's the deal with washing and refrigeration? Soon after eggs pop out of the chicken, American producers put them straight to a machine that shampoos them with soap and hot water . The steamy shower leaves the shells squeaky clean. But it also compromises them, by washing away a barely visible sheen that naturally envelops each egg.
""The egg is a marvel in terms of protecting itself, and one of the protections is this coating, which prevents them from being porous,"" says food writer Michael Ruhlman, author of Egg: A Culinary Exploration of the World's Most Versatile Ingredient."

"Soccer Star Abby Wambach Turns Rallying Commencement Speech Into New Book, 'Wolfpack'",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533636/soccer-star-abby-wambach-turns-rallying-commencement-speech-into-new-book-wolfpa?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with retired Olympic soccer star Abby Wambach about her new book, <em>Wolfpack: How to Come Together, Unleash our Power, and Change the Game</em>
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Abby Wambach was a major soccer star - two Olympic gold medals, the all-time highest goal score among women and men internationally, global recognition. But when Barnard College, the all-women's school in New York City, asked her to give its commencement address last year, she felt underqualified. So she poured her heart into her speech and decided to turn it into a rallying cry for women.
That hard work paid off. Her speech went viral, and she's now turned it into a book about leadership for people everywhere. It's called ""WOLFPACK: How To Come Together, Unleash Our Power, And Change The Game."" Abby Wambach is with us from Colorado Public Radio to talk about some of the leadership lessons in her new book.
Abby, welcome to the show.
ABBY WAMBACH: Wow. That was that was maybe the best introduction that I've gotten...
PFEIFFER: (Laughter).
WAMBACH: ...Over the last couple weeks being on the road with this. So can I take you with me everywhere I go now, Sacha?
PFEIFFER: We're glad to hear that. Thank you for that. So you actually start your book with a note to readers. It's about a company that was hiring you to teach leadership. And the man you were talking with told you he wanted to make sure that your presentation was also applicable to men. You had a sassy reply. Would you tell our listeners how you responded to him?
WAMBACH: Yeah. I said, good question, but only if you ask that of other male speakers for the women that will be in the audience. You know, and I think that - the reason why I wanted to start the book off with this specific anecdote is because I have to bring light to some of the micro-aggressions or insidious things that men say that women have to take and eat and store away.
And, you know, this is also part of the book, where I'm inviting men into this solution, into this conversation. Because I don't believe myself to be this righteous feminist who doesn't - and is male-hating. Like, I actually really think that men have to be a part of the solution for us to create the change that we want to see in the world. And so this is kind of my invitation. And a way to draw men into this conversation is to kind of showcase an instance that has happened to women so often.
PFEIFFER: A constant theme is the book is that leadership has no universal form. You can lead from wherever you are in life. And you give an example near the end of your career. It's your final season on the U.S. women's national soccer team. You're no longer a starter. That could feel really devastating. But you realized you can lead from the bench. I love that idea - lead from the bench. Can you talk about that a little?
WAMBACH: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I think everybody knows what it feels like to be benched. And I think that we have to acknowledge the fact that we're human beings, and that's going to hurt. So you're allowed to be disappointed. But what you're not allowed to do is to miss your opportunity to lead from the bench.
You know, in 2015, I came off the bench for our Women's National Team and my final World Cup. We ended up winning this World Cup, and I think that there was a reason. And it wasn't just because of the players on the field - it was because of the support that they were given by those players that were sitting on the bench and that came off the bench to close out those games.
You know, it's not easy. Like, I have children, and I see the feelings that run through them when they aren't starting. But I also have to get my children aware of what they're doing in their body language and their response to that benching, what that can do to the collective because, at the end of the day, we have to figure out, we have to decide if you and your ego mean more than the group's win, than the collective success of everyone else, whether it's being left off a project or not given the raise or not getting the - not got the job. Or you're at home, and you're nursing your child, and you're home on maternity leave and fearing that your colleagues are getting ahead.
There's so many different versions of what it means to be benched. And I can safely say that I wouldn't have learned the full context of what really true leadership is about until I had the opportunity to lead from the bench.
PFEIFFER: You write about how after you retired, your greatest loss was losing your team, your teammates. That was so important to you. And at a certain point, you had taken a break from physical activity. You were trying to get back into running. It was really hard. And your wife pointed out to you, well, you've lost your team. You're trying to do it alone. So you have a lesson that says, find your pack. I like that, too. Tell us what you mean by that. How do you find a pack?
WAMBACH: Our Women's National Team has been so successful over decades since the beginning of the creation of the team, right? And all of these women - we all think that we're the best in the world. Rightfully so - but you can imagine that environment and the standards and the competition and the challenge and the demanding aspects of it. So, having lived inside of this little ecosystem for so many years, I became so accustomed to having those around me push me to become my best self.
So I took a few years off, and I got super unfit, but I needed - my body needed a complete reset. So I started running again, and this whole thing - like, I hate running. I hate every step of it. And I would come home, and I would complain. And eventually, my wife was, like, look - like, you don't have your teammates around you.
And it dawned on me - like, wow. Oh, OK. I see how this works. Suffering and joy is made so much better when you get to do it with people around you that see your best self and hold you to that account.
PFEIFFER: It's common for professional athletes after they retire to feel like they've lost their identity. What have you done to kind of rebuild who you are? Do you feel like you have an identity again after your pro career?
WAMBACH: You know, that's a really great question. Our book hit No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list on Wednesday. And here I am having written this book and stepping into a different version of, you know, women's rights feminist icon. And it's something I'm really proud of because I had to really educate myself on what I believe to be true.
And so I - I don't know. I think that recreating a person's identity is happening on the daily. And I - for me - I want to keep breaking free from all of these identities and get down to that last one, which is human. And I hope that people out there feel the same way because we are all the same matter.
PFEIFFER: That soccer star Abby Wambach.
Abby, thank you.
WAMBACH: Thank you, guys.

Maxwell House Partners With Amazon For A 'Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Passover Haggadah,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533615/maxwell-house-partners-with-amazon-for-a-marvelous-mrs-maisel-passover-haggadah?station=KXJZ_FM,"With over 50 million printed copies, Maxwell House has released a new edition of their Haggadah, designed for fans of the Amazon show, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel .
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Last night marked the beginning of Passover, the holiday when Jews gather together to retell the story of the Exodus from Egypt. To do this, you need a haggadah. And as NPR's Eliza Dennis reports, a common one in the U.S. comes from a place you might not expect.
(SOUNDBITE OF AD)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Smell good, ground coffee. That's Maxwell House coffee.
ELIZA DENNIS, BYLINE: That's right. Maxwell House is the producer of a popular haggadah in the U.S. Let me explain. The haggadah is a book of texts used during the Seder, Passover's ritual meal. And Maxwell House produced their haggadah as a marketing tool.
JENNY SINGER: The Maxwell House haggadah is the longest-running sales promotion in advertising history.
DENNIS: That's Jenny Singer. She is the deputy life and features editor for The Forward, a Jewish American publication. And she knows a thing or two about the Maxwell House haggadah. It all started with the 1920s ad-man Joseph Jacobs. He realized that his fellow Jews weren't drinking coffee because they thought it wasn't kosher for Passover. So he turned to Maxwell House.
SINGER: They got this kind of obscure Lower Eastside rabbi to give them the OK to say that coffee is kosher for Passover.
DENNIS: Joseph Jacobs saw an opportunity.
SINGER: You buy a pound of Maxwell, you get a free haggadah.
DENNIS: And people did. Maxwell House has printed more than 55 million haggadot.
SINGER: You open it up. And there are these gorgeous illustrations of Moses parting the Red Sea, and then the Israelites sitting down to drink Maxwell House coffee on the other side.
DENNIS: And it hasn't changed much. The Maxwell House haggadah has only been updated to modernize some of the language and to include gender neutral pronouns. But this year, there's a special edition.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL"")
RACHEL BROSNAHAN: (As Midge Maisel) And crazy, the famous mad divorcee of the upper west side.
DENNIS: That's Midge Maisel, the main character of the hit TV show ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" set in 1950s New York City. She's a Jewish housewife who makes brisket during the day and does standup comedy at night. And this year, Maxwell House and Amazon, which produces the show, teamed up on an updated version of the haggadah. It's Pepto Bismol pink. It includes a recipe for Midge's famous brisket, and is complete with wine stains and illustrations of the cast members.
ALEX BORSTEIN: I didn't know Maxwell House still existed. I'm not even joking. Like, the coffee that I drink at this point are just always those little pod things. But I happily ordered some coffee.
DENNIS: That's Alex Borenstein, the actress that plays Susie Myerson, Midge's fearless agent.
BORSTEIN: She's a little Jewish person.
DENNIS: And so is Borstein. She actually grew up using the Maxwell House haggadah.
BORSTEIN: It's a long one. It's the dry one. It's the - it's the fire and brimstone.
DENNIS: And what would her character Susie think?
BORSTEIN: Susie would be like, oh, my God, 63 pages? What, are we slaves again? How long are we stuck here? This is 40 years.
DENNIS: Borstein and a few other cast members will be having a Masel Passover tonight. And they'll be using the Maxwell haggadot - well, mostly.
BORSTEIN: I like to add my own flavor.
DENNIS: Maybe we'll see that version next year.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL "")
BROSNAHAN: (As Midge Maisel) You've been a great audience, ladies and gentlemen. That's it for me. My name is Mrs. Maisel. Thank you, and good night.

Son 'Disturbed' By Russian Use Of Family Photo Discovered In Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533629/son-disturbed-by-russian-use-of-family-photo-discovered-in-mueller-report?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks with retired coal miner Ronnie Hipshire about a picture of his father that was used without permission by Russian trolls to promote then-candidate Donald Trump.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Now we're going to hear from someone who was affected by Russian trolls. Ronnie Hipshire is a retired coal miner in West Virginia. His father, Lee, was also a coal miner, and he died of complications from black lung disease. Ronnie learned something disturbing on Page 31 of the Mueller report. Without his family's permission, a Russian troll farm called the Internet Research Agency had used a photo of his dad for a pro-Trump poster. Ronnie Hipshire is with us from Logan, W.Va., to explain how this unfolded.
Ronnie, welcome to the program. And I wonder if you could first describe this photo to us because I've seen it, and it's very memorable - has a big impact.
RONNIE HIPSHIRE: OK, I sure will. Back in 1974, Earl Dotter, a photojournalist with the MWA, was put with my dad in the Paragon Mine (ph) to sort of shadow him all day long to see in the mines why so many men were getting killed and so many things were happening back in the '70s. And my dad was exiting the mine after the day, and Earl shot this photo of my father coming out of the Paragon Mine. And the picture shows him after a hard day's work.
What I didn't like about seeing this on the Mueller report is them stealing my dad's picture and putting it on a Trump campaign rally. And my dad was one of the most staunch Democrats that you'll ever see in your life. And he never would have even thought about putting his face on something like that. It just was beyond me to see it. I just - it disturbed me big-time because I know what my dad would have thought.
PFEIFFER: How did you learn that it was in the Mueller report?
HIPSHIRE: Earl Dotter sent me an email telling me about it.
PFEIFFER: The photographer.
HIPSHIRE: Yeah, the photographer that took the picture. He emailed me and told me about it, and I looked it up, and seen that, and went and took it up to my sister and showed her about it. And it just went through her, too, you know. It just - she couldn't believe that it was used by the Russians to get someone elected. I guess you would call it a troll like your column, you know. It was something it wasn't supposed to be 'cause it wasn't through the blessing of Earl or us to have dad's picture representing Donald Trump - something I know that he definitely would have never done.
PFEIFFER: Do you think you would feel any differently if the photo had been used to promote a different political issue that you support? So without your family's permission, but an issue that you actually advocate for.
HIPSHIRE: If it was - they would come to me, right? Yes, I believe in that. I believe that dad would have - you know, he was a Democrat. He would love the Democrat Party.
PFEIFFER: What would you like to see happen to prevent this from happening to other people?
HIPSHIRE: I don't know what you would do to keep them from doing it. If they can get in and steal stuff like this, how can they - how could you block the Internet down? I mean, I don't know.
PFEIFFER: Ronnie Hipshire is a retired coal miner from West Virginia.
Ronnie, thank you for talking with us about this.
HIPSHIRE: Thank you. You have a blessed day.

Troll Watch: What We Learned From The Mueller Report,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533622/troll-watch-what-we-learned-from-the-mueller-report?station=KXJZ_FM,"Clint Watts of the Foreign Policy Research Institute tells NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer what he learned about how Russian Internet trolls operate from the redacted Mueller report.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
And now we want to spend a few minutes looking at a specific piece of the Mueller report. It's a large section about Russian troll activity and its impact on the 2016 election. That's today's topic in our regular segment called Troll Watch.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
PFEIFFER: This is where we usually look at what kind of fake news and memes were pushed by trolls this week. Today, we're taking a slightly different perspective in asking what the Mueller report reveals about these operations. Joining us is Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and now a distinguished research fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Clint, thank you so much for talking with us.
CLINT WATTS: Thanks for having me.
PFEIFFER: The Mueller report examines the activities of a big troll farm based in St. Petersburg, Russia. It's funded by a Russian oligarch. It's called the IRA, short for the Internet Research Agency. Give us a mini-tutorial on what the Internet Research Agency is and why it gets mentioned so many times in the report.
WATTS: The Internet Research Agency is essentially a central hub for the disinformation put out by the Russian state-sponsored disinformation system - meaning that it helps coordinate the bringing together of state-sponsored propaganda like how RT, Russia Today, is funding news headlines, go into the social media landscape - and then how audiences are infiltrated through the use of personas that are false but also look like and talk like the audience they're trying to influence.
PFEIFFER: Some of the information about this troll farm is redacted in the Mueller report, mainly because of ongoing investigations. But from what you were able to read, did you learn anything you didn't already know?
WATTS: There were things that I had assumed or sort of calculated over the years writing about their disinformation that I didn't know for sure. One was that in 2014, they were already starting to move to the U.S. audience base. They had also taken a field trip to the United States, which was a counter to the supposition that was put out in a lot of arguments that there must be Americans working for him.
In fact, they'd actually come to America. Something else that I thought was deeply frightening was we had heard about how the Russian troll farm had orchestrated protest inside the United States. But they had been doing that as early as 2015 and had done that after the election. This is a much longer period than we had known before.
PFEIFFER: The Mueller report contains specific examples of fake Twitter accounts controlled by this Russian troll farm. One was meant to look like an official account of the Tennessee Republican Party. Some of its tweets were critical of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren. It was even retweeted by Trump campaign officials and Trump's sons. Do you have any advice for regular people on social media for how they can spot when these accounts are fake, and you're essentially being manipulated?
WATTS: It's very difficult to spot a Russian influence account or a growing number of domestic misinformation accounts that appear around the elections. But things to always look for are, one, is it a verified account or not? I think the next part is, do you have a actual person's name? Do you know where they're physically located? Do they share media, live video, pictures of themselves that show them to be who they are? Oftentimes, the trolls would use flowers or dogs or pets - that sort of thing - or would take images off the web and use those. And people oftentimes would find themselves being used as a troll farm account.
So can you verify the identity of that? And if you can't, you should not necessarily trust the information they're sharing with you. You should not retweet it. And you shouldn't share with others unless you really know where it's coming from.
PFEIFFER: We obviously have another presidential election coming. Is there anything that you think can be learned from the Mueller report to try to prevent other foreign groups from influencing U.S. voters in 2020?
WATTS: One of the strange vulnerabilities of the Mueller report is that now that we've seen it, it actually alerts many actors to where the vulnerabilities still are in our country. One is election infrastructure. It's been talked about it a lot, but the Congress has still not been able to pass the Honest Ads Act or the Election Integrity Act. We need our institutions to be able to protect voting machines. We should have paper ballot backups. We should have verifiable audit trails. I think the next part is, in terms of social media, the social media companies have actually done far more than the U.S. government has to really build resilience going into 2020.
So the number one thing we need from our country, I think, at this point is leadership. Anytime falsehoods are levered for political purposes, that provides ripe ammunition for the Russian government or really any foreign actor to use that to divide us in this country. Russia won't need to write fake news in 2020. Americans are doing plenty of that for themselves. And Russia can just repurpose and reuse that information to divide us. And I think that's a vulnerability that really comes down to our leaders in Congress and at the White House.
PFEIFFER: That's former FBI special agent Clint Watts, now with the Foreign Policy Research Institute.
Clint, thank you.
WATTS: Thank you.

"'Rafiki': The First Kenyan Film To Premiere At Cannes, Banned At Home",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533608/rafiki-the-first-kenyan-film-to-premiere-at-cannes-banned-at-home?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer speaks to Wanuri Kahiu, director of the film Rafiki about Kahiu's style of filmmaking and why the movie was banned in Kenya.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
We're going to talk about a new movie out this week called ""Rafiki."" It's a love story between two teenage girls. And it's based in Kenya, where gay sex is against the law. It's the first Kenyan film to screen at the Cannes Film Festival. But back at home, it's been banned because of its subject matter.
WANURI KAHIU: The head of the classification board said, if I banned this film, I'll make you very popular. And definitely people turned up to us to see why this film was being banned. And I have to say, there was quite a lot of people who were disappointed that it was quite innocent, that it was quite light.
PFEIFFER: That's the film's director, Wanuri Kahiu. I spoke with her. And we began by talking about whether she was trying to be political with this film.
KAHIU: I'm never trying to make a political statement. I'm always trying to make an artistic statement. But because I am born of a certain gender and of a certain race, everything that I do becomes deemed political. And I think that it's even more unfortunate that sometimes that when two people are in love, the moment that you change the gender and the race of the people in love, it becomes increasingly political.
So a love story becomes less of a love story if it's black or if it's queer and then more levels of politicization are assigned to it. I was just trying to make a love story. And that's all I was trying to do. I wasn't trying to make a political statement.
PFEIFFER: Even if you didn't mean to, it certainly has become that for some people. Does it surprise you? Or did that feel inevitable?
KAHIU: I think it feels inevitable. But though it surprised me, I really still resist it. I think the film became political after the film was banned. And when we went to court to fight for freedom of expression, then it became a political act. But the film in and of itself I feel is just a love story.
PFEIFFER: One thing that really struck me about this movie is that so many films about Africa show us war and poverty and AIDS and disease. This is a movie bursting with bold colors and vibrant music, really beautiful street scenes of laundry drying and food being served. It's bright and cheerful, dynamic. I wondered if that was a deliberate way to portray Africa differently than it's often portrayed?
KAHIU: Absolutely. I am a firm believer in what we've started to term as Afro Bubble Gum, which is not only a movement, it's become a genre. And it means fun, fierce and frivolous African art. So anything that has joy and hope at the center of it coming from Africa I consider Afro Bubble Gum. And it was incredibly important that I tell stories of joy, stories of love, stories of resilience and absolute radiance.
I like the term radical hope. And those kind of stories are incredibly important to tell not only because we need to see images of ourselves so that we know we are worthy of hopeful existences, but so that other people can start to see us as that. And if Africa is actually the cradle of humanity, then we need to be able to be sensitive about Africa and the depiction of Africans because it speaks to so much of where our lineage came from not only as people of color and people in the diaspora, but in a genetics sort of a way, you know?
We want to think that we are born of love and joy. And our existence as a whole has been joyful and loving and kind. And the only way to do that is if we see images of ourselves in joy and in love.
PFEIFFER: Kenya has a film classification board that was not happy with your movie because it depicts gay sex. They actually asked you to change the end of the film to have the main character look more remorseful that now ends more on a note of hope. You wouldn't do that, and that got the movie banned.
I've read that you said you think that the ban wasn't prompted so much by the lesbian scenes as by the happy ending. Do you think that if things had ended badly for the two women, maybe the censors wouldn't have objected so much?
KAHIU: Oh, they were very clear on it. It's not that they would have objected, they were very, very clear on it. I had a meeting with the Kenya Film Classification Board. And during the meeting, not once did anybody say that the love scenes should be changed or the kiss should be changed or anything of that nature. The only thing they said is that the ending was not remorseful enough.
And they didn't feel that if the film was happy and joyous, that that was a message that they wanted to support. But if I could change the ending of the film and make it more remorseful, then perhaps they would give me a rating. And they were quite clear on that.
PFEIFFER: And what does that tell you about their thought process and what they think about this larger issue?
KAHIU: I think that for me, it's quite complicated because if you think of our country's motto - and we have a beautiful Kenyan motto, which is peace, love, and unity - I think that if they wanted me to change the ending, it wouldn't be reminiscent of the spirit of the motto.
And I truly feel that the film, the way it is really speaks to our achievements and our growth as people. And the ideals of peace, love and unity should be something that we truly work towards in our art, in our - in the way we think and act. But asking for work to be remorseful I think goes against the very spirit of the nation.
PFEIFFER: There is a a violent scene, though - not gory - but given how lovely and light much of the rest of the movie is, it's hard to watch because when the women do get outed as a couple, basically a mob descends on them. And that was hard to watch, I think.
KAHIU: Yeah, it was. But we have to remember that 1 in 5 LGBT people in Kenya are violently attacked because of how they identify. And it's something that we have to be cognizant of. And it's something that we have to pay attention to. So while I would have loved the film to exist without it, I thought that it was important to also tell the story of the harm that is caused as a result of the way you choose to love.
PFEIFFER: There's a point in the movie where this - these two young women are talking about what future there could be for them.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""RAFIKI"")
SHEILA MUNYIVA: (As Ziki Okemi) Kena, stop being naive. What did you expect was going to happen either way? Are you planning to marry me? Are we going to have this beautiful family?
SAMANTHA MUGATSIA: (As Kena Mwaura) Yes.
PFEIFFER: Kenya's High Court is considering overturning the ban on gay sex. I think that's going to happen later this year.
KAHIU: Yeah, in May.
PFEIFFER: In the meantime, though, people who are public about being gay in Kenya are at risk of being harmed or arrested. I'm wondering what hope you think there is for people in same-sex relationships in Kenya? What actually are the long-term possibilities right now?
KAHIU: Well, the fact that there is a case in court that is decriminalizing homosexuality means that the law for the first time has to recognize that LGBTQ+ people exist. They are mentioned and identified as Kenyans. That's a huge leap forward. There's many people who came out as a result of ""Rafiki."" People came to watch the movie. They went home - came with their parents to watch the movie. And came out to their parents. That was huge.
There's a beautiful tweet I read a couple of weeks ago. The tweet asked what was the happiest moment of your life? And somebody answered watching ""Rafiki"" and coming out to my mother. So it is hopeful. Things are changing. Conversations are starting within families. They've definitely started within my own family. So that in itself is hope.
PFEIFFER: Wanuri Kahiu is director of ""Rafiki,"" a movie about a love story between two teenage girls. Thanks for talking with us.
KAHIU: Thank you.

"Amid Rural Doctor Shortage, Dozens Of Medical Workers Charged In Opioid Crackdown",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533601/amid-rural-doctor-shortage-dozens-of-medical-workers-charged-in-opioid-crackdown?station=KXJZ_FM,"A recent opioid sting caught 60 people, including doctors, accused of enabling addicts. Physician Stephen Loyd tells NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer how the sting could affect addicted patients.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
A crackdown this week on opioid abuse resulted in federal criminal charges against 60 people accused of illegally prescribing and distributing opioids. They include doctors, nurses and pharmacists. One even allegedly traded drugs for sex. That sting focused on Appalachia, one of the areas hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. It's a mostly rural area where access to health care is already a challenge for residents.
So we wanted to know about the impact of this crackdown on both addicts and people who rely on opioids to manage chronic pain. That's something Dr. Stephen Loyd has been thinking a lot about over the last few days. He's based in Nashville. And he's the state of Tennessee's former assistant commissioner for substance abuse. He's also a former addict, and now works with addiction recovery programs in the Nashville area. Dr. Loyd, thank you for talking with us about this.
STEPHEN LOYD: Thanks so much for having me, Sacha.
PFEIFFER: More than half the people charged in the sting are from Tennessee, where you live. Seventeen of them are doctors. Give us some perspective on what happens when you remove 17 doctors and other health care officials from a rural area that already has a doctor shortage even if those doctors were doing criminal things?
LOYD: That's something that, you know, that I think we really need to consider because a lot of these areas have a hard time recruiting providers in the first place. And I ran into this in previous work that I had done against doctors and nurse practitioners who were improperly prescribing. And even in open-and-shut cases, it's very hard to remove those doctors from the community in front of the jury of their peers because they're the only health care sometimes, you know, for miles.
And so it is an impact on the community. And I think that a lot of consideration has been given to that by our state officials. But it is an impact because of the restricted access to care, even if they are bad providers when it comes to prescribing controlled substances.
PFEIFFER: Well, and the reality is that some of these health care professionals who were charged will probably not be able to practice again. That really impacts people who relied on them to get opioids to manage chronic pain. What are the options for those patients now?
LOYD: There's only so much you can do, Sacha, right? You can direct them towards another health care provider. But a lot of times, we're talking about, you know, certified legitimate pain medicine doctors - which I can tell you, there are not enough of in our state, and certainly aren't enough of in rural Appalachia - and then those people with addiction, you know, the people who, you know, who have been feeding their addiction through these illicit prescriptions. Legitimate addiction medicine doctors that are going to utilize evidence based practice, there is a shortage of those as well.
Now, if we're talking about state agencies and state funded agencies that, you know, such things as the 21st Century Cures Act money that came down a few years ago initiated by President Obama and then, you know, followed through on with President Trump, that's really good access to care. And my state's done a great job with that. But the problem lies outside of their control, right? Because now we're really talking about the stigma associated with chronic pain patients as well as patients with addiction disease, and therein is the underlying problem.
PFEIFFER: In terms of how to help people who've lost their doctors in this sting, the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has publicized two hotlines that people can call to find treatment services or counselling. And they say they're offering more training sessions to teach people how to use naloxone, the overdose reversal drug. Do you think that's enough outreach?
LOYD: I think it's a great response, right? It's a great initial response. But I want you to think of it from a patient standpoint, and that's where I come from. So - because I work in this everyday and I see the mindset - so it takes a lot to pick up the phone and call a hotline. And then, you know, being directed from care there, there's a lot of follow through that has to happen. And there's some folks that won't do that for a lot of reasons. And so a lot of times, the easier alternative is is to seek it illicitly. So is it enough? No, I don't think it's ever enough. But I don't think it's anything that state agencies can control right now.
PFEIFFER: So if, as you say, this crackdown could result in people just looking elsewhere for drugs, maybe illegal drugs, what has been accomplished?
LOYD: Well, you have to take players like this out of the business. This is one of the things that frustrates me right now. The pharmaceutical industry points to now is, OK, we're not talking about prescription pills anymore, right? We're talking about illicit heroin and fentanyl. But people got started seeking heroin and fentanyl from the prescribing of those pain medications coming out of clinics like this. You absolutely have to cut that off.
The response will be what - where the key is in how we direct people to help.
PFEIFFER: So crack down on the doctors, but make sure there's a support system ready for their patients.
LOYD: Absolutely. And the thing is - and this is so beautiful - is that when you get to watch lives change. For myself, you know, I used to get up every single morning thinking, you know, where am I going to get my pills? And that occupied my entire day. Now, keep in mind, I was a practicing physician. So I had some other things to do. And that's what people who are, you know, who are addicted are facing every single day.
And now, you know, providing them with quality help and watching them change their lives is one of the most fun things that I've ever been involved with. We need to make that opportunity more widespread. We need to decrease the stigma around stepping out and ask for help. And also, Sacha, we need to make evidence-based treatment available without the stigma that goes along with it.
PFEIFFER: That's Dr. Steven Loyd. He's based in Nashville, Tenn. Thanks for talking with us.
LOYD: Thank you.

Democrats Look At How To Proceed After Mueller Report Is Released,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715533594/democrats-look-at-how-to-proceed-after-mueller-report-is-released?station=KXJZ_FM,"Congress must decide what to do with information from the Mueller report. Democratic strategists Luis Miranda and Robin Winston tell NPR's Sacha Pfeiffer whether their party should pursue impeachment.
SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:
Now that the Mueller report has been released, it's up to Congress to decide how to move forward. The House Judiciary Committee has issued subpoenas for an unredacted version of the report. Many lawmakers have called for special counsel Robert Mueller to testify. And yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress will exercise the, quote, ""oversight of our democracy."" For some people in the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party, that means impeachment. But many party leaders, including Pelosi, have cautioned against that.
So where do the Democrats, who are now in charge of the House, go from here? We have two Democratic strategists with us to debate that. Luis Miranda was a former Democratic National Committee spokesman, and Robin Winston is former chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.
Thanks for joining us.
LUIS MIRANDA: Thanks, Sacha.
ROBIN WINSTON: Thank you.
PFEIFFER: Luis Miranda, as a former DNC spokesperson, how would you advise the party to proceed, especially in the context of the presidential primaries beginning in less than a year?
MIRANDA: I think that voters really expect the party and the elected officials that they went out for very strongly in November of 2018 to take their responsibilities seriously. I think we all expect the candidates for president and those running for 2020 to stay focused on a variety of issues - on the economy, on health care. But if you were elected to the House of Representatives, I think you have a duty to that congressional oversight and to not really wavering on something that the Mueller report appears to make pretty clear, which is that Congress needs to take up at least the consideration of impeachment.
PFEIFFER: Just before the redacted Mueller report came out, a poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School found that 51 percent of people said the report's findings would make no difference in how they vote in the 2020 election. They just care more about other things. How, Luis, do you think that should factor into the thinking of Democrats?
MIRANDA: Well, I think that if you go by polls, they'll tell you a lot of different things at different moments. I think it's a moment to really focus on principles, and how do you restore faith and trust in our democracy and in the rule of law? And if we don't - and I'm a centrist. I think I'm much closer to the center of the party than to the far left.
But I can tell you that I think voters would see any effort to sort of whitewash this as another example of the establishment just not taking their role seriously and just politics as usual. And so we have to be very realistic about the fact that if we don't act forcefully and convincingly and do - and carry out the duty that the Office of Congress and their duty as a coequal branch of government has, I think it'll have an effect on - particularly in the primaries, but certainly later if you have a disaffected base going into 2020.
PFEIFFER: Robin Winston, you spent several years chairing the Democratic Party in Indiana. That gives you a perspective beyond Washington. What does that wider perspective make you think about what the Democrats' next move should be?
WINSTON: Well, I think it's kitchen table issues. Folks here in the Midwest are concerned about jobs, retaining jobs. You know, look at the folks in Lordstown. They're not concerned about the Mueller report. They're concerned about their mortgage and where their paycheck's going to come from because you closed down a plant that over 1,200 people relied upon for their daily income.
You know, the way that I look at approaching this is there's really three tangible things. One's a constitutional argument. One's a legal argument. And then, of course, there's a political argument. If we look back to the 2018 elections, many of the Democrats who were elected were not elected because of the Trump investigation of Mueller. I don't remember many people running those ads. What they ran ads about was affordable health care, was about doing something about our deficit and about making sure that we address the issues of immigration.
To me, I've always been a person who believes that kitchen table issues do resonate with voters. I think it'd be premature right now to talk about impeachment, mainly because we don't have the complete report.
MIRANDA: And I agree with Robin that there's three separate questions - the political one for 2020 candidates, I agree with them. They're not going to be - if they get elected to office, they're not going to be dealing with Trump's impeachment, so that's not really for them to carry. But if you were elected to the House, there's a duty there.
PFEIFFER: A question for both of you - is there something short of impeachment that you'd like to see Democrats do to satisfy people in the party who say, look - the Mueller report points to 10 separate instances of the president attempting to slow down the investigation, so he needs to be sanctioned in some way? I'm thinking of a piece Karen Tumulty wrote for The Washington Post suggesting an official censure.
WINSTON: I think that the Democrats will go ahead and have their hearings. I think that Bob Mueller will draw more people to any television show than anything recently. I believe that once he testifies and once we get the complete report that you will find that a lot of our folks will look at other actions that can be taken. Maybe censure is one of them. But one of the most stirring actions that can be taken is to defeat the president in November of '20. You know, we've got people that are out campaigning. The I word that they're hearing on the campaign trail is about immigration, not about impeachment.
MIRANDA: And I think that's right - that once Mueller presents himself at a public hearing - and certainly a private one so that they can go over some of the redacted pieces that legitimately needed to be kept away, whether it's because of ongoing cases or protecting methods and sources. But once he actually comes out, and if he sounds more like what we are reading in the report than what Barr - Attorney General Barr tried to present in his defense of Donald Trump, then I think you have more to go on for sure, absolutely. And I think that's got to be the starting point. But the report does seem to lay out that Congress has an obligation to do much more than simply look the other way.
But Robin and I are on the same page here - that our candidates in Iowa and across the country need to be focused on issues beyond Trump because if they do get elected in 2020, they're going to need to be focused on rebuilding and healing and strengthening our economy, expanding health care access. So those are definitely the issues that people should be campaigning on. But if you're in Congress right now, you need to take this report seriously.
PFEIFFER: Luis Miranda was a Democratic National Committee spokesman, and Robin Winston was chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.
Thanks to both of you.
MIRANDA: Thank you.
WINSTON: Thank you.

Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: We Quiz Orlando Magic Star Aaron Gordon On Actual Magic PETER SAGAL, HOST:
We have time for one more segment as we take the week off to play outside. So let's hear from someone who spends most of his time playing inside.
BILL KURTIS: Orlando Magic star Aaron Gordon joined us onstage when we went down to Orlando in November. Peter looked so tiny next to him.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SAGAL: You've got fans. I've got to ask you - I should admit I'm not, you know, conversant with, like, the basketball stuff - how is it that someone the size of the Statue of Liberty...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Is a small forward?
(LAUGHTER)
AARON GORDON: I would like to think of myself as a powerful small forward...
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: ...You know? It's just, like, kind of a mix of a couple of different things.
SAGAL: Is it, like, a power forward, and then there's a small forward?
GORDON: Yeah, exactly.
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: So it's kind of like a lot of - maybe a hyphen in it.
SAGAL: Hyphen? Yeah, OK. Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
MO ROCCA: Is the power forward more of a ball hog? Because it sounds like the small forward is nicer and shares the ball more.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: When it comes to rebounding, yes. A power forward can just be as ball hog-ish (ph) as he'd like to be.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Your whole family...
GORDON: Yeah.
SAGAL: ...Is a family of basketball players. Your parents play? Your father play?
GORDON: Yeah. Dad played at San Diego State.
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: And....
SAGAL: And your brother plays pro ball.
GORDON: He played pro ball overseas. He's been to a bunch of places. So he plays, and then my sister played at Harvard.
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: So she was a Harvard basketball player. And I play.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Right. So I imagine your friendly games at home are absolutely vicious.
GORDON: Oh, my gosh. Oh, they were...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: ...Gruesome at times.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because I know that one of the things the NBA is known for is trash talk. Do you trash-talk your siblings?
GORDON: Oh, definitely.
SAGAL: All right. Tell me something.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: All right. Let's go with what you say to your sister.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: It's kind of like the saying - I'm the youngest...
SAGAL: Right.
GORDON: So just by nature, I'm the most annoying.
SAGAL: Right. Of course.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's your role. I have a younger brother. Yeah.
GORDON: More like, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, I'm better. You're not. You know what...
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: ...I mean? Along the lines of...
SAGAL: Yeah.
GORDON: Yeah.
SAGAL: Yeah. I mean...
GORDON: That's about it.
SAGAL: I mean, just do you, like, leave your NBA contract out on a table?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, I'm sorry. I left this here. Let me pick it up.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, some money fell out of my pocket. Let me grab that, as well.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So you are known for your enthusiasm for the slam dunk contest.
GORDON: Yes.
SAGAL: Yes. And...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: You did a slam dunk in which you vaulted on top of and then over the mascot. And you just - DID you just go up to the mascot and say, you're just going to stand there, and I'm going to jump up, put my hands in your head and go over you, and you're going to hold up the ball. And the mascot was like, OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: Pretty much.
SAGAL: The mascot - is he, like - the mascot does not say no to Aaron Gordon.
GORDON: It's actually - it's really funny because Stuff the Magic Dragon - he's a great mascot. You know what I mean?
(CHEERING)
GORDON: He's a great mascot. He is. He's this, like, green dragon. He has these stars on the top of his head. And, when I was practicing, I couldn't get the grip of the ball right. So I was, like, Stuff, buddy...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: You might need to take the stars off your head. And he was really going to take one for the team. He was a team player. And we did it, and I got the dunk. But I could just see the sadness in this mascot...
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: ...In his body language - like he had lost a part of himself with the stars. You know, so...
SAGAL: Stuff...
GORDON: Yeah. So we were, like, OK. We put the stars back on his head. Just - I had to make it work for the sake of him.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: That's a heartwarming story.
GORDON: Yeah. That's my good friend these days.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Well, Aaron Gordon, we have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: Abracadabra.
SAGAL: You play for the Orlando Magic, but what do you know about real magic - by which we mean magic shows?
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: We're going to ask you three questions about great magicians. Answer two of them correctly, and you will win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Aaron playing for?
KURTIS: Hal Ray of Tampa, Fla.
(CHEERING)
GORDON: OK - Florida boy. All right. Here we go.
SAGAL: All right. Here's your first question. One of the great magicians of the late 19th century was Harry Kellar. How did Kellar learn to do his greatest trick, the levitating woman? Was it, A, he was a practicing Buddhist who attained enlightenment and was given control over gravity...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, he tied the woman to a thousand trained fleas, who flew her upward...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, he walked up on stage while another magician was doing the trick, ran around back to see what was done and then ran away.
GORDON: I'm going to go with the latter one.
SAGAL: You're correct.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
GORDON: All right. I like that. I like that.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It was pretty daring, but that's how you get to be a legend of magic. All right. Second question - let's see if you do as well. Another great magician of that golden era of magic was Carter the Great, and one of his famous tricks was which of these? A, the magical divorce, a trick in which he made his own wife disappear...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, the disappearing theater in which the entire audience found itself in a suddenly vacant lot sitting on their butts; or C, the vaguely disquieting meal in which Carter ate an ear of corn raw.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: I think I'm going to go with B.
SAGAL: You're going with B - the disappearing theater. All of a sudden, everybody was out there sitting on their butts in a field.
GORDON: That's the one.
SAGAL: That's the one. He picked it. Sadly, he missed this shot. No, I'm afraid.
GORDON: Oh, dang.
SAGAL: It was actually the magical divorce. He made his wife disappear. His wife eventually decided that wasn't funny.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: So she's still around.
SAGAL: She's still around. She stayed married to him...
GORDON: OK.
SAGAL: But he changed the name of the trick to the phantom bride. So this is your last question. If you get this right, you win.
GORDON: OK.
SAGAL: Some magicians have been able to use their skills in real life such as in which of these? A, Doug Henning, who used to skip out on dinner checks by making himself disappear during dessert...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: : ...B, Penn Jillette, who for three years has made himself look like he's lost a hundred pounds by constantly surrounding himself with trick mirrors...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, David Copperfield, who once made his wallet disappear while he was being mugged.
GORDON: I'm going to go with Copperfield. It's C.
SAGAL: You're going to go David Copperfield. That's right, Aaron.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
GORDON: Yay.
(APPLAUSE)
GORDON: Thanks.
SAGAL: He says he was being mugged outside walking to his car after a performance. Some guy came up, tried to mug him, and he made his watch, wallet and passport disappear.
(LAUGHTER)
GORDON: Oh, man.
SAGAL: Bill, how did Aaron do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Two out of three is a win.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
GORDON: Thanks.
SAGAL: Aaron Gordon is the small forward for the Orlando Magic. Aaron Gordon, thank you for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME. Aaron Gordon, everybody.
GORDON: All right.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:
And here is some more previously unaired material never been heard before.
Jessi, a wealthy New York real estate developer went through a bitter, expensive divorce with his wife of 50 years. And to let his ex-wife know he's better off with his new younger bride, this week he put his wedding photos where?
JESSI KLEIN: In the New York Times wedding section.
SAGAL: Oh, no. Not big enough for him.
KLEIN: Oh, Times Square?
SAGAL: Close. It's not far from there, but he put it on a...
KLEIN: On a billboard.
SAGAL: No, I'll give it to you. He put it on the side of a building...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...That he owned.
KLEIN: Like a billboard.
SAGAL: Like a...
(LAUGHTER)
KLEIN: Peter.
SAGAL: Billboards don't come this big. He put up a picture of himself and his new wife 42 feet high, each of them, on the sides of a building he owns in New York. Harry Macklowe is now divorced and happily remarried. And what better way to celebrate than rub it in everybody's face?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Once he found out that he's not legally allowed to rub things in other people's faces...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...He settled for the next best thing - putting up enormous photos of himself and his bride on the sides of one of his Park Avenue buildings. He said, quote, ""since I wasn't getting married during the summer in the Hamptons, I wasn't able to hire an airplane with a banner to go up and down the shoreline."" The Hamptons' loss is our gain. The pictures are big enough so that you can see the realization in the new Mrs. Macklowe's eyes that this maybe wasn't a good idea.
(LAUGHTER)
KLEIN: Well, it sounds like he's definitely over his ex.
SAGAL: Yeah, absolutely.

Thank you, Bill.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Thank you so much. We are taking the week off from news. We're getting outside. And we're enjoying some fresh air.
KURTIS: I love fresh air. Have you heard Terry Gross's interview with Conan O'Brien?
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: So much better than ours.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: While that is definitely true, we still had a pretty good time with him. Conan joined us back in January. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
CONAN O'BRIEN: I was a young writer at ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I was the writer that was kind of known to sort of perform my sketches for the other writers. And I'd perform them for people, and I'd get them laughing. I think Lorne Michaels noticed that. I left ""Saturday Night Live."" I went on to ""The Simpsons."" And I worked there for about a year and a half, two years when Lorne Michaels was charged with, who's the new guy who's going to replace Letterman? And he said, you know, there's this guy, Conan. He's got something. And they looked into it, and it turns out I really didn't have anything.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Yeah. But I fooled them. And here we are all these years later so.
SAGAL: I know. It must have been crazy those first years because you, you know - you weren't a stand-up. You didn't have a following as a performer. And you were thrown - you're going to be on national television. Were you scared? Were you nervous? Were you excited?
O'BRIEN: I was deluded. And I want to advise your audience that there's nothing like delusion. There's nothing like - if you think you can't do something, convince yourself that you can. And then have a few drinks and go do it.
MO ROCCA: Hey, Conan. It's Mo. Hi.
O'BRIEN: Mo, how dare you speak to me directly.
ROCCA: I know.
(LAUGHTER)
ROCCA: I forgot.
O'BRIEN: Here's how we're going to work, Mo. Mo, here's how we're going to work it. Your question has to go through Bill Kurtis, and then Bill Kurtis...
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...Has to ask.
ROCCA: Ok. Bill, would you ask Conan...
(LAUGHTER)
ROCCA: I've heard that a lot of late-night show hosts, when they get home, a lot of times, they can't even remember who was a guest earlier that day at the taping because they're doing so many shows. Could you ask him about that?
KURTIS: Conan, can you remember the guests on the show that night?
O'BRIEN: Bill, that's a really stupid question.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Yes. You know, it's funny - to Mo's point, no. You do the show, and it becomes - you're so in the moment when you're doing it. And I liken the whole experience - and I'm actually not even kidding about this - I think everyone's - probably in your audience is familiar with the famous toy, the Etch A Sketch...
SAGAL: Yes.
O'BRIEN: ...Where you turn the knobs, you create a picture, you create something. And then you just shake it, and it's gone, and you start again. Every day I come in and I learn everything I can that I need to know for that show. And I learn it to the best that I can. And I can tell you everything about the gas and I can tell you everything about the comedy the minute it's over a shake the Etch a Sketch and all of it's gone. And I go home and I don't know what we did. I've done 4000 hours of broadcasting I'm told nine of it quite good.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Conan O'Brien, we are delighted to talk to you. But we've asked you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: Team Coco, meet hot cocoa.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Your supporters, fans are known as Team Coco. But what do you know about actual cocoa, the tasty hot chocolate beverage?
O'BRIEN: I know everything...
SAGAL: Oh.
O'BRIEN: ...About cocoa.
SAGAL: Really?
O'BRIEN: Yes, I do.
SAGAL: That's a bold statement, sir.
O'BRIEN: There's not a thing you can ask me...
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...About hot cocoa that I do not know.
SAGAL: Well, I am interested in what's going to happen now because we have, in fact, prepared three questions for you about hot cocoa. If you answer two of them correctly, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Are you ready to do this?
O'BRIEN: I was born ready.
SAGAL: Who is Conan O'Brien playing for?
KURTIS: Chase McGee of Raleigh, N.C.
SAGAL: All right, first question. You think it's just what kids drink instead of coffee, but hot cocoa can change your life, as it did for whom? A, Bernie Madoff, who, after he was convicted and imprisoned for fraud, quote, ""cornered the prison market on Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate;"" B, Jeff Bezos, whose first Internet business was delivering steaming cups of hot chocolate to people suffering through the Seattle winter; or C, Eric McMillan, who was inspired to invent the kids' ball pit by looking at mini-marshmallows floating in his hot chocolate.
O'BRIEN: The answer is Eric McMillan.
SAGAL: You're very confident.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Peter, I'm going to say this one more time...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: It was actually A. It was Bernie Madoff.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He apparently...
O'BRIEN: I'd like to contest.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: No. Apparently, you know, a born trader is a born trader, and he's apparently made very well for himself in prison with the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate.
HELEN HONG: What?
SAGAL: Yeah.
O'BRIEN: You know why I got that one wrong?
SAGAL: Why.
O'BRIEN: Because I believe in our penal reform system.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: And I don't - I'm shocked that they would let Bernie Madoff do that. So, in a way, I'm counting that answer as correct.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I like your confidence. People - there's your second question - people really love cocoa a lot - so much so that, at one time, people were doing what? A, mixing protein powder into cocoa so it would be the only thing they'd ever have to eat; B, snorting lines of cocoa powder like coke; or C, trying to have a transfused into their body instead of blood?
O'BRIEN: The answer is B - snorting cocaine - well, cocoa as cocaine.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: Sorry.
SAGAL: Freudian slip there.
O'BRIEN: Old habits...
SAGAL: Yeah.
O'BRIEN: ...Die Hard.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: The answer is B, snorting cocoa.
SAGAL: You're right, Coco.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Or Conan.
(APPLAUSE)
KURTIS: (Laughter).
SAGAL: Snorting chocolate was championed by a Belgian chocolatier who invented a little device that would shoot cocoa powder into your nose.
O'BRIEN: Oh, I know that engineer, and I've worked with him.
SAGAL: Have you?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Have you tried the snorting coke?
O'BRIEN: Yes, I have. It's fantastic. There's an incredible high. It lasts for about 20 minutes, and then you have to cough out the marshmallows.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: But other than that, it's a wonderful experience.
SAGAL: I bet.
O'BRIEN: And when you wake up, you're wearing German shorts. I don't know why.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ll right. Last question. You can get this right. For true chocolate lovers, there's a pill created by a French scientist which, for $13 a bottle, will do what? A, make anything you eat, including meat, taste like chocolate; B, make your farts smell like chocolate; or C, it gives you chocolate dandruff? Instead of dry skin, you shed chocolate flakes.
O'BRIEN: The answer is A.
SAGAL: Your answer is A - that it makes anything you eat...
O'BRIEN: Taste...
SAGAL: ...Including meat, taste exactly like chocolate.
O'BRIEN: ...Exactly like chocolate.
SAGAL: So you'd be sitting there eating, say, prime rib...
O'BRIEN: Yes. And it...
SAGAL: Kimchi.
O'BRIEN: Yes - chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
SAGAL: It's B.
(LAUGHTER).
O'BRIEN: No.
SAGAL: Yes. I'm sorry, but yes. The idea is it's a little pill, and you take it, and if you take it, your farts smell like chocolate.
HONG: No way.
SAGAL: There's also a strawberry option.
O'BRIEN: You know what? I'm going to tell you something. I didn't go for that because it's scatological. I don't work blue.
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: I didn't realize this was that kind of show.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: But I guess it's all about farts now...
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
O'BRIEN: ...With you and I hope you're proud of yourself.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Conan O'Brien do on our show?
KURTIS: We throw the score out because he's the only guest we've had when anything he says is right. Conan, you're the king.
O'BRIEN: You know, to have...
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
O'BRIEN: Thank you.
SAGAL: Conan O'Brien is the host of so many shows, including the new podcast Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend. You can also see him on ""Conan Without Borders"" on Netflix and on ""Conan"" on TBS. Conan O'Brien, what a pleasure to finally have you on. Thank you so much.
(APPLAUSE)
O'BRIEN: Thank you very much.
KURTIS: Thank you, Conan.
SAGAL: See you soon, I hope.

Not My Job: We Quiz Candice Bergen Of 'Murphy Brown' On Murphy's Law,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/20/715232069/not-my-job-we-quiz-candice-bergen-of-murphy-brown-on-murphys-law?station=KXJZ_FM,"Thirty years after it first debuted in 1988, the sit-com Murphy Brown is back — and Bergen is still in the title role. Originally broadcast Dec. 8, 2018.
Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: We Quiz Candice Bergen Of 'Murphy Brown' On Murphy's Law BILL KURTIS: Long before the fictional newscasters on Fox News...
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: ...There was the fictional newscaster Murphy Brown.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
The incredible Candice Bergen brought Murphy Brown to life for 11 seasons, and she joined us onstage at Carnegie Hall back in December.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
CANDICE BERGEN: The show would never have been brought back if the election had turned out the way we wanted.
SAGAL: Really?
(APPLAUSE)
BERGEN: If Hillary Clinton were president, we would never have brought the show back.
SAGAL: Really?
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: So what do you know? Donald Trump created a job.
BERGEN: That's right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So I'm taking it Murphy Brown is not very happy with the current president.
BERGEN: Oh, well, we've had - really, the man is a gift.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Every day is a gift.
SAGAL: It really is.
PETER GROSZ: That's such a positive way...
FAITH SALIE: Yes.
GROSZ: ...To look at what's going on.
SAGAL: Yeah, I know.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: I don't know how many people who are fans of you now know this, but you were, in fact, an extraordinarily famous child because your father was one of the most famous Americans alive, right? Edgar Bergen.
BERGEN: I don't think he was that famous. But he was...
PAULA POUNDSTONE: I think he was pretty famous.
BERGEN: OK.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, your father - again, for those who don't know - was the world's most famous and successful ventriloquist. He had a dummy, Charlie McCarthy. And...
BERGEN: He was also a famous ventriloquist on radio.
SAGAL: Yes.
SALIE: Which?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And I have to say, I have - and I mean no offense - I've seen archival film of your father doing his act. And just like people say I have a face for radio, he was a ventriloquist for radio.
BERGEN: Exactly.
(LAUGHTER)
POUNDSTONE: Did you grow up really in your early years thinking that you were Charlie McCarthy's sister?
BERGEN: Oh, yes. I was always called Charlie McCarthy's sister. And - but he was far more than a brother. He was like a head of state in our house.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: And he had a room next to mine. And every now and then, my father would bring him out, and we would just kind of sit. And once - I mean, I remember once we would have - in the breakfast room, he would put Charlie on one knee and me on the other. And he - when he would squeeze my neck, it meant that I should move my mouth. And he...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: He would put you on a knee and treat you as if you were another ventriloquist's dummy.
BERGEN: That's correct.
POUNDSTONE: Yes.
SAGAL: OK.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: Charlie must've been so jealous.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Skipping ahead a bit...
BERGEN: Yes.
SAGAL: In the '90s, you starred in ""Murphy Brown,"" which as much as any other sort of sitcom or TV show exemplified the '90s. It was, like, the - a dominant show. And, of course, it became quite political when Dan Quayle famously went after not you, but your character. Did he know that it was a fictional character?
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: I don't think Dan Quayle had ever seen the show.
SAGAL: Oh, really?
BERGEN: But he was savvy. The - his handlers had taken the line about Murphy out of his speech, and he reinserted it into the speech. And that's all anybody talked about...
SAGAL: I remember.
BERGEN: ...For the entire six months of the campaign. It was on the front page of every paper. It was in every political cartoon, every editorial. It just didn't let up.
SAGAL: Right.
SALIE: Don't those seem like beautiful, simpler times?
SAGAL: Yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You won in the original run five Emmys...
BERGEN: Yeah.
SAGAL: ...For lead actress in a comedy.
BERGEN: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: And I was going to say that's almost unfair to the competition. But apparently, you realized that yourself. And - is this true - that you'd said, please don't nominate me anymore? You turned it down.
BERGEN: I didn't say please don't. I just didn't submit myself for nomination. I didn't, like, go in and say, please don't nominate me.
SAGAL: Oh, no. No, don't do this. No. Please.
(LAUGHTER)
SALIE: And did you take your five Emmys home and then bludgeon Charlie McCarthy with them?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Oh, that's an interesting question.
SALIE: Where is he?
SAGAL: Where is Charlie McCarthy?
BERGEN: He's in the Smithsonian.
POUNDSTONE: Yeah, it's in the Smithsonian, absolutely.
SAGAL: Yeah. As Faith said, do you ever bring your Emmys down there and go, hey, Charlie?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You may have gotten the inheritance, but I got these little babies.
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: One day, I'm going to break out of this glass, and I swear to god...
(LAUGHTER)
GROSZ: I'm going to steal those Emmys.
SALIE: Candice, when you were on ""The Muppet Show...""
BERGEN: Yeah.
SALIE: What was that like? Was that, like, trippy nostalgia to go back to talking with puppets or what?
POUNDSTONE: Yeah. Those were your cousins.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: Let's just say it was a medium I was very comfortable...
POUNDSTONE: Yeah.
BERGEN: ...In.
POUNDSTONE: Pinocchio - or grandpa, as you call him...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Well, Candice Bergen, we could talk to you all day about...
POUNDSTONE: All right.
SAGAL: But we have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: ""Murphy Brown,"" Meet Murphy's Law.
SAGAL: Murphy's law, of course, as I'm sure you know, is the law of the universe that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. We're going to ask you three questions about examples of Murphy's law in effect. If you get two right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Candice Bergen playing for?
KURTIS: Dylan Watton of Queens, New York.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Here - are you ready to do this?
BERGEN: Sure.
SAGAL: OK, first question. McDonald's commissioned an internal corporate webpage once to help its employees eat better. But they had to take it down after what inevitably happened? A, the employees all gained an average of 20 pounds over six months...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, it illustrated the concept of poor nutrition with a picture of a McDonald's meal...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, it encouraged people to go out and eat at Burger King.
(LAUGHTER)
BERGEN: I would say that because they gained 20, 25 pounds.
SAGAL: You think that McDonald's gave its employees nutrition advice, and they all followed it, and they all ballooned like the Hindenburg.
BERGEN: Well, isn't that what happens?
SAGAL: Not in this case. What happened was...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...They - the webpage they commissioned to illustrate good eating habits used a picture of the McDonald's cheeseburger and french fries...
POUNDSTONE: (Laughter).
SAGAL: ...To illustrate what you should not eat.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So the McDonald's corporation quickly took it down. All right. You still have two more chances - not a problem here. Bill Hillmann was gored by a bull in Spain - bad enough. But it happened shortly after he did what? A, was arrested for 27 different incidents of cow tipping...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, wrote a book called ""How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona""...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, put on his new bright red cape.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE: B.
BERGEN: B.
POUNDSTONE: Yeah.
BERGEN: B.
(CROSSTALK)
BERGEN: Yes, I'll go with the audience.
SAGAL: You're right.
SALIE: Yeah.
SAGAL: They're right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: Everybody's right. That's what happened. He didn't read his own book. All right, last one. If you get this right, you win. A big game hunter in Zimbabwe was killed last year when what happened? A, a zebra caught sight of his zebra-print bikini briefs and thought he was a rival male...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...B, one of his fellow hunters mistook him for a, quote, ""balding lion...""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...Or C, he shot an elephant, and the elephant fell on him.
BERGEN: I guess the elephant fell on him.
SAGAL: That's what happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SALIE: Yeah.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It's tragic. But at least we know one of them died happy.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bill, how did Candice Bergen do on our quiz?
KURTIS: She won. Congratulations.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Somewhere in the Smithsonian Institution, a wooden dummy just went, damn.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Candice Bergen stars as Murphy Brown on the show ""Murphy Brown,"" back after a short hiatus. It airs Thursday nights on CBS. She was just nominated for a Golden Globe for the part. Candice Bergen, thank you so much.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Candice Bergen, ladies and gentlemen.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis, and here's your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill.

SAGAL: This week, we're taking a break from the news, going outside and just binge-watching the world go by.
KURTIS: Have you seen the show called the clouds? The special effects are amazing.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: While Bill applies sunscreen, let's keep listening to our favorite segments from the last year. Here's a recent bluff game that became an instant classic.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
MICHAEL HULBERT: Hi there, Peter. This is Michael Hulbert, and I'm calling from Shelburne Falls, Mass.
SAGAL: Shelburne Falls, Mass - I thought I knew Massachusetts well, but I have no idea where that is.
HULBERT: It's a little bit west of Greenfield.
SAGAL: All right. Well...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Are you just making up town names to frustrate me?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Because I've never heard of Greenfield, either. What do you do there?
HULBERT: I am a musician and performer in a small theater company called the Agile Rascal Bicycle Touring Theatre.
SAGAL: That's great. And...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Bicycle touring?
HULBERT: Yes. We perform original works in theater, and we tour them on bicycles. And we perform for free.
SAGAL: So you said to yourself, you know, it's impossible to make a living in the theater. But let's - it's not hard enough. Let's...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Let's make sure that when we show up, we'll be sweaty.
TOM PAPA: How are we going to break into the Shelbyville market?
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: If you make it in Shelbyville, well, then you can move over to Greentown, or whatever that was.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I'm sorry. Hello, Michael. It's nice to have you with us.
(LAUGHTER)
HULBERT: Thank you...
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: Good to talk to you. You're going to play our game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is the topic?
KURTIS: Bullseye.
SAGAL: Darts - that's the game we play in bars, mostly, because that's definitely the time to be picking up sharp objects and throwing them.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: But what's a pastime here is a sport in Great Britain. In fact, there was a big cont-rah-versy (ph), as they say over there...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...At this year's Grand Slam of Darts tournament. Our panelists are each going to tell you about it. Only one of them is telling the truth. Pick that one, you will win our prize - the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?
HULBERT: Yes, I am.
SAGAL: All right. First, let's hear from Bim Adewunmi.
BIM ADEWUNMI: The world of professional darts, like any other high-performance sport, has its fair share of gamesmanship. From well-timed coughing jags to exaggerated sniffling, darts has seen and heard it all. But has it smelled it all? Things escalated this month following allegations of an ill wind, specifically one emanating from the behind of Scottish darts player Gary the Flying Scotsman Anderson.
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: In a post-match debrief after being blown out in a match 10-2...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Wesley Sparky Harms, Anderson's Dutch rival, accused the two-time PDC world champion of releasing something a little stronger than his signature smooth throw, all to gain the upper hand on the oche. Anderson staunchly denied the allegation, instead turning the accusation back on his rival. I swear on my children's lives that it was not my fault, he said. He then breezily relied on the classic he who smelt it dealt it defense...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Of all of our childhoods. Anderson, the winner, went on to describe the smell as eggs - rotten eggs.
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: But, he insisted, the stink hadn't come from him. Whoever the eye-watering stench came from, it'll take a while to disperse. Harms, presumably sporting a mean stink-eye...
(LAUGHTER)
ADEWUNMI: ...Told Dutch TV channel RTL 7, it it'll take me two night to lose the smell from my nose.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: A gaseous controversy between two players at the Grand Slam of Darts. Your next story of a dart debacle comes from Brian Babylon.
BRIAN BABYLON: Everyone at the international darts championship was impressed by one of the first American women to make it to the finals, Dr. Cheri Gurdson (ph), a agricultural chemist professor from the University of Nebraska, who was competing while wearing a classic cornhusker's farmer's overall and plaid shirt with farm girl pigtails. The British tabloids called her Dr. Pippi Long-darts.
(LAUGHTER)
BABYLON: The semifinal round started like any other. Dr. Gurdson and her challenger, Charles Cook (ph), walked out and shook hands. By the second round, Charles Cook was visibly sweating and also whispering to each dart before he threw them. His last six throws missed the target entirely. Things look good for the American, but then her behavior also became erratic. She started gazing at each dart, turning them around, touching the point with her thumb, and then seemed surprised each time that they were sharp.
(LAUGHTER)
BABYLON: Finally, the match was called on account of both contestants not being able to continue. Finally, the disorientated Dr. Gurdson admitted to the truth. She laced her hands in a hallucinogenic frog toxin she made in the lab in order to get an edge on her opponent. Sadly, the antidote she created for herself didn't work as good as she hoped. In her last statement before being disqualified and ordered off the venue, she said, sometimes darts go on the target. Sometimes a target comes to you. Sometimes I can hear my own smells. Woo, go Cornhuskers.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: An American tried to use frog or toad toxins to defeat her opponent, but it backfired. Your last story of some bullseye BS comes from Tom Papa.
PAPA: The 2018 Grand Slam of Darts was not without controversy this year. For the first time in its storied history, the games were the focus of animal rights protesters, who are contending that the Dart Association is promoting animal cruelty by continuing to use the term bullseye.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: A crowd of protesters heckled attendees as they entered the building holding up signs that read, stick a dart in your own eye.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: What did the bull do to you? And Trump sucks.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: A spokesman for SAFE - the Save Animals From Exploitation organization - said it's time for the dart community to stop using the defenseless bull as its plaything. We went for the fox hunters. We're eliminating the bullseye. And we're coming after the flea circus next.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: Jonathan Haskel (ph), the head of the National Dart Association, seemed genuinely perplexed by the protests. We've had complaints before, but mainly about our drinking and our hygiene.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: This is a new one to me.
(LAUGHTER)
PAPA: All right.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: One of those happened at a major darts tournament in Great Britain. Was it, from Bim Adewunmi, one competitor saying that the guy who beat him got a unfair advantage by passing gas? From Brian Babylon, how an American competitor tried to use toad toxin to hallucinate her way to a victory? Or, from Tom Papa, how animal rights protesters disrupted the event because they protested the term bullseye? Which of these is the real story of an event at the big darts tournament?
HULBERT: Well, I think I'm going to go with Bim's
SAGAL: You're going to go with - you think you're going to go with Bim's.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Why are you choosing Bim's?
HULBERT: Farts are hilarious.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I - all right. You're choosing Bim's story. And to bring you the real story of what happened at this darts tournament, we spoke to a genuine sports journalist.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
DES BIELER: There was a really strong smell of fart in the air while he...
(APPLAUSE)
BIELER: ...He who smelt it dealt it.
SAGAL: That was Des Bieler. He's a sports reporter for The Washington Post talking to us with great seriousness about the dart farter.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: So, Michael, you got it right. You were correct. Farts are hilarious, and Bim was telling the truth. You've won our prize - the voice of your choice on your voicemail. Thank you so much for playing.
HULBERT: Thank you. Goodbye.
SAGAL: Bye-bye.

Here's an unaired moment from one of our past shows.
Helen.
HELEN HONG: Yes?
SAGAL: Helen, with more and more states legalizing pot, the hot, new trend, as I'm sure you all know...
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: The hot, new trend is cannabis drinks. However, the manufacturers of these drinks are facing a challenge. What?
HONG: A problem amongst cannabis drinks is that you drink one, and then you fall asleep....
(LAUGHTER)
HONG: So they don't really sell a lot of them.
SAGAL: No, that's not the problem.
(LAUGHTER)
HONG: Can I have a hint?
SAGAL: Well, you may not notice by the third one.
HONG: Oh, it takes a while for it to hit, so you're just blazed.
SAGAL: No, that's not the problem. It's a much more basic problem for people selling beverages.
HONG: You pee the weed out.
(LAUGHTER)
JESSI KLEIN: I feel like every single answer you've given is the right answer.

SAGAL: Those are probably all true.

SAGAL: I'm going to put it this way. I would imagine...
KLEIN: I love your...
SAGAL: ...If these things do come to market in the way they're supposed to, we will see a lot of sophisticated stoners sort of picking one up, holding their nose and then pouring it down...

SAGAL: It does. It tastes exactly like yuck.

We'll find out. Originally broadcast Dec. 15, 2018.
Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me! Not My Job: William Shatner Gets Quizzed On Cannes BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Hey there, De Niro. Get a load of me - Raging Bill...
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: ...Bill Kurtis. And here's your host at the Chase Bank Auditorium in Chicago, Peter Sagal.
PETER SAGAL, HOST:
Thank you, Bill.
(CHEERING)
SAGAL: Thanks, everybody. Flowers are blooming, birds are chirping, and it's time to take a moment to enjoy the spring because pretty soon, the only seasons we will have will be summer, summer two, mega summer and everything's on fire.
(LAUGHTER)
KURTIS: So while we can still go outside without putting on SPF 500 sunscreen, we're breathing in some fresh air and taking a week off from the news. Instead, we're going to listen back to some segments we love.
SAGAL: Let's start with an interview with my second favorite Bill, William Shatner, who joined us back in December.
KURTIS: Peter tried not to geek out and failed.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SAGAL: So when I was a kid, I loved ""Star Trek"" - the original series, of course. I loved it so much that I used to dream of being a crew member on the Enterprise - not one of those red shirt guys - they get into trouble - but a blue shirt, maybe even a yellow shirt. And I would get...
WILLIAM SHATNER: Easy now.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: That's...
(APPLAUSE)
SHATNER: I mean, you can have ambition, but that's my job, OK?
SAGAL: All right. All right. All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: This isn't how I thought it would go, but I dreamed in those days that I would someday get to talk to Captain Kirk himself. We'll now find out if that's as good as I dreamed it would be because William Shatner has a new album of Christmas songs out, and he joins us now. William Shatner, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
SHATNER: Well, what a pleasure.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: What a joy to talk to you.
SHATNER: I'm really excited to be on because I've got to tell you, I've listened to the program over the years. It's one of my favorites. Driving somewhere on a Saturday afternoon - WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
SAGAL: Thank you. I can't tell you what it means to me to know that you listen to me after I spent so many happy hours watching you.
SHATNER: Yes, but I didn't know it was you.
SAGAL: All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: You have a new record out. You've become quite a recording artist.
SHATNER: I have. I've got two records - two albums out this year, a country music album and this Christmas album that we've called ""Shatner Claus.""
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Now, your singing career, if I may be so bold, began with a record that you put out when you were playing Captain Kirk back in the '60s called ""The Transformed Man.""
SHATNER: Yes.
SAGAL: I've listened to the whole thing.
SHATNER: How - pity is the...
SAGAL: No, no.
SHATNER: ...Only thing I feel for you.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And this is the famous record where you did that that eventually infamous version of ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.""
SHATNER: Yes.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: As I'm sure you know, this became, shall we put it, a novelty song after a while and subject of much amusement.
SHATNER: I believe the word derision is the...
SAGAL: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
(LAUGHTER)
HELEN HONG: You said it, not us.
SAGAL: And was that hard for you to deal with when that became, like, a hilariously funny thing that people were sharing back in the...
SHATNER: Well, I understood it does enter the area of the perception of silly.
SAGAL: Right. But it didn't bother you. You kind of embraced that as the singing William Shatner.
SHATNER: No, no. It bothered me, and I embraced it.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So we all know the famous sketch you did on ""Saturday Night Live"" where you're at a ""Star Trek"" convention and you express some, shall we say, impatience with your more avid fans. Was that reflecting your experience?
SHATNER: No. It was meant as a joke. And I'm sorry that you took it so seriously that you moved out of your parents' apartment.
(LAUGHTER)
HONG: Wow.
SAGAL: It's all right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I was getting tired of my mother's cooking.
SHATNER: But look what it's done for you.
SAGAL: I know. I feel good.
SHATNER: You're master of ceremonies of these silly questions.
SAGAL: I know.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: I know that there has been - because there's been so many versions of ""Star Trek"" since the best one...
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: ...That a lot of people spend their time arguing over which captain was better. I assume you believe it was Kirk rather than Picard or any of the others.
SHATNER: Well, I don't know what the argument is about, actually.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Do you - I mean, do you actually, like, get together with the other actors and ever hash this out?
SHATNER: Yes. Several blows were struck.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: No. I think everybody thinks they're the best, and I just leave them their quandary. I don't want to disturb their mental stability.
SAGAL: One of the things that so many people have done over the years is they do their William Shatner impressions.
SHATNER: Yes.
SAGAL: I have done a William Shatner impression. I'm not going...
SHATNER: I'd like to hear it.
SAGAL: No.
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: What do you mean no?
HONG: Do it.
SAGAL: No, I can't. How could I...
HONG: Come on.
SAGAL: ...To the face of the - in the face of the - all right.
(APPLAUSE)
HONG: Oh, Peter, do it.
SHATNER: I would like - by popular demand, you're being requested to do the imitation.
SAGAL: All right. The only thing I can think of to do is the episode where you - the crew of the enterprise ends up on the planet where the Kohms are finding fighting the Yangs, if you remember this, and Captain Kirk and the crew the Enterprise save them by introducing the U.S. Constitution. Remember this one?
SHATNER: Well, vaguely. Yes.
SAGAL: Yes. And so...
SHATNER: Are you going to recite the Constitution?
SAGAL: Well...
SHATNER: I don't know if I can put up with that.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: And this is one of the great things - is that Captain Kirk sort of gets this document, and he says, here's this thing that says (imitating William Shatner) we the people...
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's the worst imitation...
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: ...I've ever heard.
(APPLAUSE)
SHATNER: God. Oh, my god. I hope you don't do that in public.
SAGAL: Well, William Shatner, as you can tell, we're all pretty delighted to talk to you. But we must do our business. We have invited you here to play a game we're calling...
KURTIS: (Shouting) Cannes Film Festival.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: So one of the greatest moments in all of cinema, we would agree, was you shouting Khan in ""Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan."" So we thought we'd ask you about a different Cannes - the Cannes Film Festival in France. Answer 2 out of 3 right, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of anyone they like on their voicemail. Bill, who is William Shatner playing for?
KURTIS: Chris Taucher of Columbus, Ohio.
SHATNER: Oh, I know him.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Here is your first question. Martin Scorsese has been a fixture at Cannes since the '70s, but he always hasn't had the best relationship with the press, who, of course, swarm Cannes. In 1978, talking to the press, he decided to stop all the interviews. Why? A, he ran out of cocaine, saying no more coke, no more interviews; B, He called the police on a reporter who asked him, how tall are you, anyway? Or C, he snapped and responded to a question by shouting, you talking to me? You talking to me?
SHATNER: (Laughter) Well, it's got to be that he snapped.
SAGAL: He did - he snapped and started shouting, you talking to me? You talking to me?
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: No. In fact, it was the cocaine - you know, the '70s - different time. All right. Next question - Cannes is famous for the film competition but also for elaborate publicity stunts around it such as when one company once did what? A, swarmed the celebrities on the red carpet with 200 fake zombies, resulting in three actors getting bitten; B, poisoned the food at the party's buffet just to entice partygoers to visit some port-a-potties that were covered with ads; or C, storming the famous Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc with fake terrorists dressed like ISIS members?
SHATNER: That's the kind of thing they would do.
SAGAL: The last one.
LUKE BURBANK: (Laughter).
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: You're right, Captain. That's what...
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: ...They did.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: It was supposed to promote this company's broadband services. It did not help. All right.
(LAUGHTER)
SAGAL: Last question - if you get this right, you win, and my life has meaning. The festival can be dangerous, as in which of these happened? A, over the years, at least 14 women and four men have fainted from being crammed into too-tight outfits for the runway; B, when the actress Simone Silva took off her top in a photo shoot with co-star Robert Mitchum, two photographers suffered broken bones in the ensuing crush; or C, the sound of all the cameras going off attracts hordes of wild dogs known as the les chiens du cinema (ph)?
(LAUGHTER)
SHATNER: I love the picture of Mitchum standing by while the lady disrobes, and people are crushed.
SAGAL: That's the one you're going to go with?
SHATNER: Yeah.
SAGAL: You're right.
(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)
SAGAL: That's what happened.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: The ensuing photograph, in which Mitchum is kind of using his hands as a makeshift bra - that picture is actually one of most famous images to be taken at Cannes. Bill, how did William Shatner do on our quiz?
KURTIS: Two out of 3. And, Captain, that's a win.
SAGAL: Congratulations.
(APPLAUSE)
SAGAL: William Shatner's new Christmas album, ""Shatner Claus,"" is out now. William Shatner, thank you so much for joining us on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS"")
SHATNER: Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you. You answer quite slowly - a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Getty Images Updated at 12:53 a.m. ET Monday
Nearly 300 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after explosions tore through Sri Lanka in a series of coordinated blasts that struck three churches and three hotels. It marked the country's worst violence since the end of its civil war in 2009.
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said Monday the death toll had risen to 290 dead with more than 500 wounded, according to The Associated Press.
A top police official reportedly had alerted security officials 10 days earlier about a threat to churches from a radical Islamist group, National Thowheeth Jama'ath. It was unclear what precautions, if any, had been taken, or whether that group had played any role in the assaults, according to The New York Times .

Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters Sri Lanka's prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, pointedly said he and other ministers had not been warned, in what appeared to be a sign of the recent frictions within the government hierarchy, the paper adds.
The blasts started as people gathered for Mass on Easter Sunday. In Colombo, the country's capital, bombings were reported at St. Anthony's Shrine and three high-end hotels: the Shangri-La, the Cinnamon Grand and the Kingsbury.

Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images Explosions were also reported at St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo, north of the capital, and at Zion Church in Batticaloa, in the country's Eastern Province. A police spokesman, Ruwan Gunasekara, said at least 207 people were killed and 450 wounded in the attacks.
The blasts gave way to sounds of screams and cries as billowing smoke could be seen from the streets. Inside the churches, devastated worshippers stood near pews covered in rubble and blood. A similar scene of destruction was reported at the luxury hotels that were attacked.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but police say 13 suspects linked to the explosions have been arrested, The Associated Press reported. Sri Lanka's defense minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, described the violence as a terrorist attack carried out by religious extremists and said he believed they were part of one group.

Lakruwan Wanniarachchi/AFP/Getty Images Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who condemned the ""cowardly"" attacks, told reporters that information about the bombings appeared to have been received in advance . "" We must look into why adequate precautions were not taken. Neither I nor the ministers were kept informed,"" he said at a news conference.
St. Sebastian's Church posted photos of the aftermath on Facebook, pleading for relatives to ""come and help if your family members are there.""
Harsha de Silva, Sri Lanka's minister of economic reforms and public distribution, said he visited the shattered churches, and he described the horrific scenes. ""I saw many body parts strewn all over. Emergency crews are at all locations in full force,"" he said on Twitter.

After the explosions, the government announced a curfew, which has since been lifted.
Easter services scheduled for Sunday evening were canceled, Sri Lanka's state news agency reported , and the government moved to block social media sites , including Facebook and Instagram, to stop the spread of false information. The Sri Lanka Red Cross said misinformation had already begun to spread online about its building being attacked, and it sought to dispel the rumor.

""We will go after them,"" Defense Minister Wijewardene vowed . ""Whatever religious extremism that they are following, we will take the necessary actions against them and will stop these groups from operating in this country in the near future.""
Wijewardene also said that three police officers had lost their lives during a search for suspects after explosives detonated.

Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty Images Religious and ethnic tensions have plagued the tropical country for years. A civil war started in 1983 and ended in 2009 after security forces defeated the Tamil Tigers, rebels who were fighting for an independent homeland.
During that time, they carried out a series of attacks, including bombings of a holy Buddhist temple and the Central Bank in Colombo .
Sunday's violence came just ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the end of Sri Lanka's civil war.
""We don't really have all the answers we want about who was behind the attacks,"" the U.S. ambassador to Sri Lanka, Alaina Teplitz, told NPR. ""I don't believe they were linked to that conflict period, but for a country trying to recover, trying to achieve reconciliation among the ethnic and religious groups here, this is not going to support that effort.""

"Book Review: 'Flowers Over The Inferno,' By Ilaria Tuti : NPR",www.npr.org,Silvia Moreno-Garcia,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/21/714878681/flowers-over-the-inferno-has-a-tantalizing-weirdness,"Unseen Forces Menace 'The Houseguest'
Paradoxically, we also don't learn enough about Battaglia. I didn't realize this was the first volume of a new series of books when I picked it up, so part of this feeling of missing bits may just turn out to be the natural result of introductionitis (yes, I made up a word). I'm sure we'll discover more about Battaglia's tragic past, Marini's reasons for leaving the big city, and the like down the line. But for now there were several moments which tasted of toast with not enough butter.
The pace of the book and the number of points of view are another stumbling block. Very short chapters breeze by like bullets, whipping us back and forth. It can make for a quick read, but there are also times when one feels like asking the author to take a breath.
When it works, 'Flowers Over the Inferno' works nicely indeed, and when it doesn't, you are left with enough goodwill to pat it on the back.
The highlights: There is a tantalizing weirdness in the flashbacks to a creepy institution that conducted grotesque experiments in the 1970s. That, plus the gory attacks, the identity of the killer, and the ultimate truth about the shenanigans in this quaint village are all original enough to tie the narrative into a whole.
When it works, Flowers Over the Inferno works nicely indeed, and when it doesn't, you are left with enough goodwill to pat it on the back. Italy offers a nice break from all those northern European thrillers, and I did love the closing sentence of the book. I'd buy this book a drink, but maybe not a whole meal. Sometimes, however, that Aperol spritz is all you need, especially in summer.

He held six house parties in one day on April 6.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio The Iowa caucuses are still nine months away, and with at least 20 Democrats either considering a run or officially declared, many of them are looking for ways to stand out in the crowded field. One tried-and-true way: show up in voters' homes.
Politics Presidential Candidates Still Like To Party The house party has a long tradition in the presidential primary politicking of the two early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, where locals open their doors to let aspiring presidents audition in their living rooms. It's a staple of the early campaign, when many candidates can't pack larger venues.
""It's pretty surreal that you can have a candidate running for president in your living room,"" says Liz Adelman, who recently hosted Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., at her Des Moines, Iowa, home.
Adelman is originally from outside Washington, D.C., and has lived in Iowa for about 10 years.
""We've done this before, so I kind of knew the drill of what to expect in terms of food and put everything in cabinets to hide,"" says Adelman, who works in public relations, with a laugh. ""It doesn't normally look this clean.""

Adelman says it's surreal to host a candidate in her living room.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio Adelman was not endorsing Harris at the house party she hosted for the candidate (although Harris is among Adelman's favorite candidates). Harris was there talking about the state chapter of Emerge America and emphasizing the importance of women running for office.
""I am running for president of the United States and I am a candidate and I would love to have everybody's support, so I'm going to get that out of the way,"" Harris told the crowd standing on a landing at the base of Adelman's staircase.
Enjoying his rise in fame last week, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., drew a crowd estimated at 1,600 on Tuesday in Des Moines. The last time he was in Des Moines was February, when he was in a living room with a couple of dozen potential caucusgoers.

Two months later, Buttigieg drew a crowd of nearly 1,600 in Des Moines.
Clay Masters/Iowa Public Radio Some house parties have a guest list, while others are more of a town hall at which anyone can show up and ask questions. This month, candidate Beto O'Rourke visited six houses in Des Moines on one Saturday.
Homeowner Nathan Blake told the crowd that he and his family had just moved in and that hosting a presidential candidate hurried their unpacking.
Politics 'First In The Nation' Voting Site Under Scrutiny For Alleged Election Law Violations ""[I'm] really happy that all of you are here, whether you're a supporter of Beto or, just as I've been saying this week, Beto-curious,"" Blake told the crowd in his living room, where many were sitting cross-legged on the floor. ""We only have 10 months to decide.""
During the question-and-answer portion of O'Rourke's south-side Des Moines house party, Dante Powell asked him what he would do as president to ease tensions between African Americans and law enforcement.
""I was not prepared for how honest he was,"" Powell says. ""So, I appreciated very much him going into detail the way he did and owning the inherent racism in the systems that I was asking about.""
Powell says he likes O'Rourke, but he's far from picking a favorite, a feeling shared by many Iowa Democrats trying to grapple with nearly 20 declared presidential candidates.
A bed for weary candidates
Politics Meet The Small-Town Newspaper Editor Who's Drawing 2020 Democrats To Rural Iowa House parties aren't just for Iowa's big population centers.
""We have to resort to every trick that we can,"" says Kurt Meyer. He lives in the small north Iowa town of Mona and is the chair of the Tri-County Democrats.
Meyer has been hosting candidates for years.
This cycle, Meyer has even had a couple of Democratic candidates spend the night at his house after they stumped in his living room.
""We have accommodations to put you up for the night, and that affords people an opportunity to not only to get to know the candidate but for us to get to know the candidate in a more informal setting,"" Meyer says.
With nice weather in the months ahead, expect even more Iowans to open their homes to candidates trying to become the next president."

toggle caption Olivia Sun for NPR In the fictional world of Marvel's Black Panther, the Afro-futurist utopia of Wakanda has a secret, almost magical resource: a metal called vibranium. Its mythic ability to store energy elevated vibranium to a central role in the fictional nation's culture and the metal became part of Wakandan technology, fashion and ceremony.
Of course vibranium isn't real. But one metal has held a similarly mythic role for over 2,000 years in many cultures across the African continent: iron.
African blacksmiths have been crafting agricultural tools, musical instruments, weapons and symbols of power and prestige out of the raw material for ages.

The exhibition, which runs until October 20, features many works from the 19th and 20th century but contains some artifacts from the early days of African ironworking.
Africans began extracting iron ore from the continent's rich deposits roughly 2,500 years ago. Evidence from archaeological sites in what is now modern-day Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe show that blacksmithing was a widespread practice across sub-Saharan Africa.

toggle caption Olivia Sun for NPR To transform iron into something a blacksmith can work with, it must be refined, or smelted, by applying intense heat to remove impurities from the ore.
Across Africa, workers practiced ""bloomery smelting"": heating iron-containing minerals in a furnace until the iron particles separate — or ""bloom"" — from the rest of the minerals, leaving pure, malleable iron.
""Africans were practicing this method at the same time as Europeans,"" says Dewey, referring to the early centuries of the Common Era .
According to Tom Joyce , the lead curator of the exhibit who is himself a blacksmith, Africans actually preceded Europeans by 300 to 400 years in the development of bellowing technology that allowed more efficient smelting by preheating the iron with a mixture of hot and cool air.

toggle caption Olivia Sun for NPR African ironworks were of such high quality that traders from Europe and elsewhere sought them as exports as early as the 11th century, according to William Dewey , a co-curator and art historian at Penn State University.
But what truly sets African ironworks apart from other parts of the world are the forms that blacksmiths fashioned from these blooms.
Expertly crafted iron plows, sickles and hoes were essential for the development of agriculture across Africa. Blacksmiths tailored the design of these tools to meet the continent's varied climate, terrain, soil types and crops, yielding a wide diversity of forms. Such craftsmanship elevated blacksmiths to prominent roles in many African societies, according to Marla Berns , a co-curator of this exhibit. She is also the director of the Fowler Museum at UCLA, which debuted ""Striking Iron"" last year.
A blacksmith's artistry could also transform the tool into a ritual object, symbolizing productivity and fecundity, says Berns.

Olivia Sun for NPR Some works were crafted with no practical purpose but solely for ritual use. Rain wands from Nigeria evokes the form of lightning or slithering snakes, both presages of rain to come, says Berns. She says ""they were planted in the earth and were intended to draw the life force of the Earth up toward the heavens in order to bring down the rain.""
African blacksmiths also built musical instruments that echoed the rhythmic soundscape of the forge. Large clapperless bells and smaller thumb pianos took a variety of forms, enabling an even wider variety of music.
According to Berns, these instruments weren't so much used for entertainment but for spiritual purposes. ""They're potent, powerful objects, used to create sounds to call the spirits, the ancestors or to call people to action across large distances,"" she says.

Many blacksmiths added bold flourishes to the weapons — distinctive curves or intricate engravings — to convey authority and prestige to their owner. Dewey says kings would often bear such symbolic weapons, sometimes purportedly forged by the king himself .

toggle caption Olivia Sun for NPR In many parts of Africa, ironworks of such clear craftsmanship were treated as currency. Expertly crafted blades or tools, too ornate and large for practical use, would serve as payment for a dowry or large purchases like horses, according to Joyce.
For example, the Nkuthshu and Ndengese peoples in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo until the mid-20th century traded oshele , large ornate currency tokens reminiscent of throwing knives.
As European powers expanded their exploitation on the African continent during the 15th century, they tried to undermine African iron production, making the locals reliant on the colonial economy. Local smelting was sometimes prohibited, and blacksmiths were often specifically targeted by slavers for their skills to transport them to other colonies, like the Americas.

Taken together, the exhibit highlights the diversity, ingenuity and sheer beauty of African blacksmithing, says Christine Mullen Kreamer, deputy director and chief curator of the National Museum of African Art. ""I hope the exhibit challenges perceptions of Africa and African artists.""
