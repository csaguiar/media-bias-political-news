"Hacker blackmailed almost $1M from porn website users, spent proceeds on prostitutes, $6G Rolex",www.foxnews.com,James Rogers,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/hacker-blackmailed-almost-1m-from-porn-website-users-spent-proceeds-on-prostitutes-6g-rolex,"Sky News reports that 24-year-old Zain Qaiser, a former computer science student, was jailed for six years and five months. In a statement , the U.K.’s National Crime Agency described Qaiser as “a top level cyber criminal who targeted hundreds of millions of computers” across the globe. The hacker spent the proceeds of his criminal activity on stays in high-end hotels, prostitutes, gambling, drugs and luxury items including a $6,500 Rolex watch, the NCA added.
""In just one 10-month period, he spent £68,000 [$88,000] on gambling in a London casino, despite being unemployed and living with his family,” the agency explained.
The scam affected users in more than 20 countries, including Canada, the U.S. and countries in Europe.
Working with a Russian-speaking organized crime group, Qaiser bought “masses” of advertising traffic from porn websites using the online name “K!NG.” The hacker used fraudulent identities and bogus companies to pose as legitimate online advertising agencies, according to officials. “Once advertising space was secured, the crime group would host and post advertisements laced with malicious software, known as malware,” the NCA added.
The malware would lock users&apos; devices and display a message purporting to be from local law enforcement or a government agency, demanding that the victim pay a ""fine"" of $300 to $1,000 to unlock the device.
The total value of the blackmail operation is believed to be much higher than Qaiser’s share of the illegal proceeds. “Zain Qaiser was an integral part of this organized crime group generating millions of pounds in ransom payments by blackmailing countless victims and threatening them with bogus police investigations,” said Nigel Leary the NCA’s senior investigating officer, in the statement. “In addition, when Qaiser’s criminal enterprise was frustrated by diligent members of the online advertising community, he retaliated causing misery and hundreds of thousands of pounds in financial losses.”
“This was an extremely long-running, complex cyber-crime investigation in which we worked with partners in the US, Canada, Europe and the Crown Prosecution Service,” Leary added. “The FBI and the US Secret Service have both arrested people in relation to this global malware campaign.”
In a ransomware attack, hackers typically encrypt a computer network’s data to hold it “hostage,” providing a digital decryption key to unlock it for a price.
There have been other incidents where porn was used as an extortion tactic. A recent email scam , for example, made bogus claims about pornography use in an attempt to extort money.

Bob Dylan's Nashville whiskey distillery to open in 2020 along with on-site performance venue,www.foxnews.com,Michael Bartiromo,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bob-dylans-nashville-whiskey-distillery-to-open-in-2020-along-with-on-site-performance-venue,"Heaven’s Door Spirits , LLC., which produces Bob Dylan’s signature line of whiskeys, has announced plans to open its Nashville distillery and events space in the fall of 2020. ""We&apos;re thrilled to celebrate the anniversary of &apos;Nashville Skyline&apos; with our own addition to Music City&apos;s skyline,"" said Heaven’s Door Spirits CEO Marc Bushala in a press release , making a reference to Dylan’s “Nashville Skyline” album, released on April 9, 1969.
The distillery is also planning to set up shop in the downtown SoBro (south of Broadway) neighborhood, inside the old Elm Street Methodist Church the corner of Elm and 5th Avenue, which was originally built in 1871, The Tennessean reports.
Rendering of the future Heaven's Door Distillery and Center for the Arts
""Nashville is the natural home for the Heaven&apos;s Door distillery and the Elm Street Church is a fitting home for Dylan&apos;s visual artwork,” added Bushala. “We spent years looking for a property that truly captures the essence of the Heaven&apos;s Door brand, and when we finally found the deconsecrated church in SoBro, we immediately knew that it would be the perfect physical and spiritual center for the brand, and Bob&apos;s art.""
In addition to its distilling facilities and housing Dylan’s metalwork sculptures and paintings, the space will house a restaurant, a “whiskey library” and a 360-seat performance venue, according to a press release.
Dylan and Bushala originally announced their collaboration on Heaven’s Door Spirits in April 2018 , along with three inaugural whiskeys including a Tennessee Bourbon, a Double Barrel Whiskey and a Straight Rye Whiskey. A Tennessee Bourbon “limited 10-year release” has since been added to the collection.
There were also plans for a second collection, to be called “The Bootleg Series,” to debut sometime in 2019.
“I’ve been traveling for decades, and I’ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer,” Dylan remarked to The New York Times in April 2018. “This is great whiskey.”
Bushala further claimed that Dylan is a full partner in Heaven’s Door Spirits, and did not merely license his name to the product.

Rape charge dismissed against retired Tulsa hockey player,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/rape-charge-dismissed-against-retired-tulsa-hockey-player,"Last Update 13 mins ago Rape charge dismissed against retired Tulsa hockey player Email TULSA, Okla. – Prosecutors in Oklahoma have dismissed a rape charge against a retired Tulsa Oilers hockey player from Canada. The Tulsa World reports that defense attorney Kent Hudson says he believes prosecutors don't have enough evidence to prosecute 50-year-old Doug Lawrence on charges of first-degree rape and sexual battery.
District Attorney Stephen Kunzweiler says prosecutors determined the case was ""untenable,"" and dismissed the charges without prejudice, meaning his office could refile them later.
Court records show prosecutors allege Lawrence touched a woman's breast without her consent and raped her in 2017. Lawrence pleaded not guilty and was scheduled to go on trial Monday, the same day the charges were dismissed.
Lawrence, of Richmond, British Columbia, spent nine seasons playing for the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL, a Double-A hockey league.

The aftermath of Syria’s chemical weapons attacks,www.foxnews.com,Hollie McKay,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-aftermath-what-became-of-syrias-chemical-weapons-attacks,"On both occasions, President Trump ordered retaliatory missile attacks to take out the regime’s remaining stockpiles as haunting images filled the internet of babies foaming at the mouth, and tiny children choking as their moms and dads wailed as their eyes burned and burned. MALE RAPE EMERGING AS ONE OF THE MOST UNDER-REPORTED WEAPONS OF WAR
That was just the tip of the mounting rubble pile as Syria’s eight-year war inches closer to its swansong. Nonetheless, President Bashar al-Assad looks set to take back Syria, undeterred or impacted by the rash of chemical violations of civilians.

“There will probably be no further accountability of Syria for its past chemical attacks beyond the damage done after the U.S. missile attacks,” Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Senior Science Fellow, John Gilbert, told Fox News. “Russia is a major sponsor of the Assad government and a Russian national provided nerve agent technology and possibly critical precursor chemicals to Syria.”
Gilbert added that “Russia and China vetoed UN Security Council resolutions against Syria for their chemical weapons attacks, ""and prevented extension of the UN&apos;s investigative mechanism that could have provided evidence of who was behind the attacks.”
According to the most recent “credibly substantiated” data gleaned by the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute (GPPI), chemical weapons have been used at least 336 times since the war started in early 2011. The Syrian regime – led by Bashar al-Assad – stands accused of using the banned substances 98 percent of the time, while ISIS is documented as having carried out two percent of the country’s chemical bombardments on civilians.
In August 2013, more than 1400 civilians were slaughtered in the first known mass chemical attack amid the protracted war, and after the Obama administration’s failure to act on the crossing of a “red line,” the issue was handed over to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
They demanded the Syrian leadership eradicate all chemical inventory, and by August 2014 they announced the process complete.
Only it was not. The GPPI study surmised that more than 90 percent of chemical offensives on Syrian soil took place after the hollow red line declaration.
“The Assad regime did not merely ‘get away’ with its use of these banned weapons,” the report stated. “It succeeded in using them for strategic ends.”

Last month, OPCW concluded that it had “reasonable grounds” to assume that “the use of a toxic chemical as a weapon took place” in the beleaguered Douma last April. Although their “fact-finding mission” in the immediate aftermath was delayed until almost a week after arrival due to security concerns, OPCW finally pinpointed chlorine last month as the likely culprit, rather than a more lethal substance such as sarin or other nerve agents. It declined to assign responsibility.
“The symptoms were confusing, and doctors at the beginning thought it was a phosphorus compound but within hours they knew they were dealing with chlorine,” recalled Dr. Mohamad Katoub, media and advocacy leader at the Syrian American Medical Society&apos;s (SAMS) Turkey office. “Respiratory distress, oral foaming, corneal burns.”
The GPPI report found that roughly 91.5 percent of the chemical attacks in Syria have been chlorine bombs.
But according to the Arms Control Association, everything from nerve agents and choking agents, to “weaponized chlorine and blister agents have been used in Syria over the course of the civil war.”
All chemical weapons, irrespective of their severity, are internationally outlawed.
Fox News interviewed several survivors of the various attacks. One victim from the initial 2013 Ghouta attack who was exposed to the ailments said she gave birth several months later to a baby “with a distorted hand,” but doctors could not say conclusively whether it was due to the chemicals. Others claimed lingering shortness of breath and perpetual exhaustion, but almost all said the most searing scars were psychological.
“Some still aren’t breathing well, their tears flow in a rush,” said Hisham al-Skeif, a potent Syrian activist whose baby son was asphyxiated in an attack. “Some have an inability to move. And the numbers are large.”
Investigators for the Syrian Network for Human Rights told Fox News that in terms of long-term symptoms, they have recorded “shortness of breath, blurred vision and disorientation leading to inability to distinguish time and space among some of those injured in the attacks in Ghouta in August 2013, with these symptoms continuing for several weeks after the attack.”
Moreover, in the large-scale chemical attacks such as the attack on those in Ghouta, the attack on Khan Sheikhoun, and in the last Douma attack, the Syrian Network for Human Rights documented effects on the soil in the area around the missiles’ impact sites with plants being destroyed, as well as recording the deaths of a large number of animals.
DESPITE CRUMBLED CALIPHATE, HUNT FOR BAGHDADI CONTINUES IN SYRIA
The activist group estimates that almost 10,000 people have been injured in the chemical attacks – some 9,753 in attacks ignited by the Syrian regime and a further 132 launched by ISIS.
Yet the Syrian government has staunchly and repeatedly denied ever having used chemical weapons, and its top supporter, Russia, has instead blamed rescue workers such as the White Helmets for staging the chemical incursions and proliferating fake news.
In turn, the U.S. has pointed the finger at Russia for contriving its own narrative about the Syrian rebels.

Yet activists and rescue workers like The Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets, haven’t given up the quest for accountability.
“As eyewitnesses, we are still calling out the international community to take immediate action against those responsible,” a spokesperson said. “What needs to happen is crystal clear; the permanent members of the security council need to stand up against Russia, who is holding justice hostage for its own political gain.”
Many still accuse of the Syrian government of stockpiling and manufacturing even more weapons in its array of “undeclared sites.”
“This is also to disrupt the work of inspectors of the OPCW,” the Syrian Civil Defense representative asserted.

The Syrian conflict has displaced more than ten million Syrians and claimed the lives of more than half a million. What’s worse, it may not be the end of large-scale attacks – including those chemical in nature. In a joint statement last week, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain and France cautioned that they will “act strongly and swiftly” in the circumstance of another attack, especially as Syrian troops – backed by Iran and Russia – edge closer in their plans to take back the final opposition bastion of Idlib.
“We have prepared 20 facilities with protection gears and treatment equipment. Our staff received some training,” noted Katoub. “In Syria, there are no red lines. Again, this might happen.”

Woman dodges flying ax in viral video,www.foxnews.com,Janine Puhak,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/woman-dodges-flying-ax-in-viral-video,"On April 8, Instagram user Ainsley Rae shared video footage of the close call to the social media platform, where it has since been viewed over 126,000 times to date, Inside Edition reports. In the clip, the woman holds the ax above her head, and throws it with force towards a target – though the heavy tool quickly rebounds back and flies towards her head. Rae ducks down instinctively, while others shriek in the background.
""At first I didn’t know what actually happened but then over time, watching it over and over again, I just started laughing at myself,” Rae told Inside Edition of the terrifying moment. “Oh my gosh, I am so glad I didn’t get hit in the head.”
She added that she had not been drinking while ax throwing.
A representative for Bad Axe Throwing, which operates several ax-throwing entertainment venues, confirmed to Fox News that the incident took place at its Denver location, but described the event as a ""one-in-fifteen-million"" occurrence.
“I think in the past year alone, all of our guests have thrown over 15 million axes, so to say it’s literally a one-in-a-million throw, it’s more like a one-in-fifteen-million throw,"" said Mario Zelaya, a representative for Bad Axe, who compared the incident to a freak accident that a runner or a bowler might suffer.
Zelaya further confirmed that while all guests are required to sign waivers, they are also paired with coaches who give them safety training before they participate in any ax-throwing. In this case, Rae&apos;s coach was standing just off-screen. The camera also didn&apos;t capture the arc of Rae&apos;s ax, Zelaya says, which showed that it hit the ground handle-side down, bouncing off the floor first, then the wall, and then over her head.
“That axe almost got me,” Rae wrote on Instagram of the now-viral clip, tagging her boyfriend, Cam Huber, who caught the unbelievable moment on film.
“So glad it missed you!” she concluded of the post, which has since won over 6,000 likes.
“That was way too close,” one Instagram commenter exclaimed.
“Oh my goodness,” another agreed.
Coaches at Bad Axe have since been trying to replicate Rae&apos;s throw for research purposes, though they have yet to be successful. Bad Axe also confirmed that it is taking measures to prevent anything like this from happening again, including looking at new types of handles.
But according to Zelaya, Rae was ""super cool"" during her visit and actually quite good at throwing, as she stuck the ax directly in the center of the target just before her now-viral throw. She&apos;s also coming back for one-on-one lessons with the current ax-throwing world champion.
Rae did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment on the story.

Dr. Marc Siegel on measles and the controversy shaking Rockland County,www.foxnews.com,Marc Siegel,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dr-marc-siegel-on-measles-and-the-controversy-shaking-rockland-county,"On the surface the conflict would appear to be an issue between the rights of the individual versus the rights of the community, where close to 170 new measles cases have occurred in mostly unvaccinated children. But the problem goes deeper and is really about the necessity for public health paradigms to supervene an individual’s rights to place others knowingly at risk. Almost two weeks ago, County Executive Ed Day issued a public ban for all those under the age of 18 who haven’t been vaccinated against measles. He was right, and the ban was mostly a warning - the intention was not to put anyone in jail. At first, more than 500 additional vaccines were given, but then on April 5, State Judge Rolf Thorsen ruled that unvaccinated minors could return to schools, churches, synagogues and shopping centers.
I believe this was wrong, that the county executive had every right to issue the 30-day ban. Consider that according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, “Public health quarantine and isolation are legal authorities that may be, but rarely are, implemented to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. Isolation may be used for ill people, to protect the public by preventing exposure to infected people. Quarantine may be used to restrict the movement of well people who may have been exposed to a communicable disease until it can be determined if they are ill, for example, people who have a communicable disease but do not know it, or may have the disease because of close contact with ill people but do not show symptoms.”
The threat to others was significant not because of the sheer number of cases but because measles has a high infectivity rate of over 90 percent in unvaccinated individuals. It also can lead to serious complications including pneumonia (1/20), brain swelling or death (1-2/1000).
Video As a practicing Jew, I can tell you there is also nothing in Orthodox Jewish teaching against vaccines. In fact, the Torah (old Testament) favors public health. The anti-vaccine movement in the area is led by a propaganda group, PEACH, Parents Educating and Advocating for Children’s Health (a title which is the exact opposite of what they are doing) - which is spreading untruths to the community including the myth that vaccines cause autism. Luckily, a group of Orthodox Jewish nurses are countering this propaganda.
The county is currently working on legislation banning non-medical exemptions to end the gridlock. The problem with that solution is that there will still be many who will simply be non-compliant and refuse to get vaccinated.
There need to be consequences, and as long as the numbers continue to climb, I believe that extending the ban is warranted. Consider that two doses of the vaccine are 97 percent effective. Since MMR is a live virus vaccine, pregnant women, infants, chronically ill, and those who are immune-compromised cannot take it. Currently, only 72 percent of minors in Rockland County have received the MMR vaccine. But compliance needs to be over 90 percent (90 to 95 percent) in order to properly protect the community and the U.S. from measles regaining a foothold here.
Measles, which once killed millions, still kills more than 100,000 per year around the world. MMR vaccine is a life saver, and the last measles death in the U.S. was in 2015, with none in the 12 years prior to that. We certainly don’t need anymore.
Now that’s public health 101.

Texas teen bitten by rattlesnake flown to Arizona after allergic reaction to anti-venom,www.foxnews.com,Alexandria Hein,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/texas-teen-bitten-by-rattlesnake-flown-to-arizona-after-allergic-reaction-to-anti-venom,"“My eyes started getting swelled up bad, started getting puffy and they said they had to stop it,” Anthony Rodriguez, who was playing soccer with friends when the snake bit him, told Fox 10 Phoenix. Rodriguez was transferred to Banner Medical Center and is now receiving Anavip, an anti-venom developed in horses. Dr. Steven Curry, the hospital’s director of the Department of Medical Technology, told the news outlet that the medication is an alternative to the older anti-venom, which is made in sheep.
“We have seen evidence suggesting that patients who receive it are less likely to have a recurrence of swelling or a recurrence of bleeding problems after being discharged from the hospital,” he told Fox 10 Phoenix.
The hospital has reportedly treated 18 rattlesnake bite patients since February, with Curry telling another outlet that they aren’t sure why there has been an uptick in the number of cases. He said some cases involve hikers.
“It tends to jump from year to year,” he told AZCentral.com. “But we just don’t know why.”
For Rodriguez, the snake struck when he entered tall grass to retrieve the soccer ball.
“I went in there and I grabbed the ball, and on my way back I stepped on something and heard a snake rattle under me,” he told Fox 10 Phoenix. “And I heard it hiss and it just bit me I guess. I wasn’t sure it was actually a snake.”
Curry told the news outlet it’s important to seek medical care immediately rather than trying to administer first aid.

Masked men grabbed Italian soccer player Ignazio Barbagallo -- who was on the pitch playing in the final match of his career last week -- and tossed him in a helicopter, a stunning scene that appeared to those in attendance like a brazen kidnapping. But Barbagallo, who played for Citta Di Viagrande of the Sicily League, turned out never to have been in harm's way. One of the masked men left a sign on the field to indicate the whole ordeal was a hoax.
The sign read, “SERVICIO ELIMINAZIONE GIOCATORI FINITI,” which means “Elimination for finished players,” according to The Sun .
The stunt didn’t appear to put league officials in a joking mood, however.
FOX Sports Italia reported Citta Di Viagrande was fined more than $220 for the incident. The team was also suspended from playing until June.

(Credit: NAOJ and NASA/JPL-Caltech) No, that's not a faraway alien world you're looking at. That's an infrared image of Jupiter and its poles, courtesy of NASA . NASA's JPL has released images of the gas giant showing the impact that solar winds are having on the planet's poles, which are causing a hotter atmosphere than previously thought.
""The solar wind impact at Jupiter is an extreme example of space weather,"" said NASA JPL's James Sinclair, who led new research published April 8 in Nature Astronomy, in a statement . ""We're seeing the solar wind having an effect deeper than is normally seen.""
NASA IS SENDING ROBOTIC BEES TO SPACE
Similar to the auroras on Earth's poles (the aurora borealis and aurora australis), energy particles from the Sun interact with the heat in the gases of the atmosphere on Jupiter. But it's the level of activity and how deep it is going, extending into the stratosphere, that is surprising scientists.
""What is startling about the results is that we were able to associate for the first time the variations in solar wind and the response in the stratosphere — and that the response to these variations is so quick for such a large area,"" said JPL's Glenn Orton, co-author and part of the observing team, in the statement.

The researchers found that a day after the solar wind hit the planet, the chemistry in its atmosphere changed and the temperature rose. The scientists used the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii and recorded the images using the telescope's Cooled Mid-Infrared Camera and Spectograph.
The researchers hope to understand how the solar winds from the Sun impact other planets environments, as well as our own.

NYC orders mandatory vaccinations for areas of Brooklyn amid measles outbreak,www.foxnews.com,Ryan Gaydos,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-york-city-declares-health-emergency-over-measles-outbreak,"The order covers people who live in four ZIP codes in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where more than 250 people have contracted measles since September. The order requires all unvaccinated people in those areas who may have been exposed to the virus to get vaccinated, including children older than 6 months. Those who didn’t get the vaccine or are not immune to the virus may be fined $1,000.
“There’s no question that vaccines are safe, effective and life-saving,” de Blasio said in the news release. “I urge everyone, especially those in affected areas, to get their MMR vaccines to protect their children, families and communities.”
Health commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot blamed those against vaccines for causing the outbreak.
“As a pediatrician, I know the MMR vaccine is safe and effective. This outbreak is being fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods. They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science,” he said in the news release. “We stand with the majority of people in this community who have worked hard to protect their children and those at risk. We’ve seen a large increase in the number of people vaccinated in these neighborhoods, but as Passover approaches, we need to do all we can to ensure more people get the vaccine.”
The New York City Health Department on Monday ordered all ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools in the Williamsburg neighborhood to exclude unvaccinated students from during the measles outbreak.
Any yeshiva in Williamsburg that doesn’t comply with the order will face fines and possible closure, the health department said.
New York City accounted for about two-thirds of all U.S. measles cases reported last week, according to the Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Petros Karadjias) EPISKOPI, Cyprus – Police at a British military base in Cyprus said Tuesday they have successfully wrapped up a four-year campaign against illegal gambling by shutting down nine casinos that operated within their jurisdiction. Superintendent Dinos Petrou said the casinos generated hundreds of thousands of euros annually in illegal proceeds. Ten people received prison sentences, while 30 others were fined heavily.
Petrou said many of the casinos were built in areas adjacent or partly falling within Cyprus' jurisdiction and that complicated matters. To circumvent that, base police carried out raids together with Cypriot law enforcement.
Petrou said police will remain vigilant against any resurgence of illegal gambling and that there would be no-let up in prosecuting law-breakers even after Britain's departure from the European Union.

The judge hearing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman has reversed a ban on what video evidence may be viewed by the media and public.
Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Tuesday that body camera video introduced as evidence in the murder trial of Mohamed Noor will be shown to the entire courtroom.
Quaintance had earlier said such video would be shown only to the jury, citing a desire to protect the privacy of the victim, Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Quaintance said she has to follow the law even if she disagrees with it.
Noor shot Damond when she approached his squad care minutes after calling 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home. The video doesn't capture the shooting but shows efforts to save Damond.

With a jury in place, opening statements are set to begin Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman.
Thirty-three-year-old Mohamed Noor, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Justine Ruszczyk Damond's death. Damond, a 40-year-old dual Australian-American citizen who was white, was killed in July 2017 after calling 911 to report a possible rape near her home.
It took a week to select a jury. After 75 prospective jurors answered questions about their views on Somalis and police officers, as well as their experiences with firearms and other issues, 12 men and four women were selected Monday to hear the case. In the end, only 12 will deliberate.

The government has been getting more money every year for 50 years. It’s one of the reasons people are so frustrated with politics. The problems seem to fester whether it’s immigration or healthcare or deficits.” Fiorina says she wrote her new book “Find Your Way: Unleash Your Power and Highest Potential,” to help people who feel “helpless and powerless and frustrated by the fact that problems just fester all around them.”
Fiorina added that she agrees with former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz , who says America has “a small crisis of capitalism” and that businesses and business leaders must do more for their employees and their communities.
“I also believe that as a conservative, that power concentrated is power abused and we have too much power concentrated in some companies,” she said. “I would also say that when government gets in and tries to fix it, that’s not always capitalism. Technology is the least regulated industry in the world… the most competitive industry in the world and it delivers incredible innovation year after year at lower and lower prices.”
Video Fiorina had a controversial record as CEO. During her tenure at HP between 1999 and 2005, the company struggled under her management and eventually she was fired by the board.
Fiorina, who lost her bid for the GOP nomination in an extremely crowded field, also weighed in on the crowded Democratic field vying for the presidency.
“We have become way too obsessed with politics and what goes on in Washington,” she said. “We’ve become observers…bystanders…we sort of look at all this political toxicity and the political campaign back and forth and think it’s going to fix things for us.”
Fiorina also believes Attorney General William Barr , who testified before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday, should make the full Mueller report public.
“Barr hasn’t been transparent enough. …In any circumstance, when people don’t know what’s going on, they assume the worst. Never the best,” she said.

Children at ‘Peppa Pig’ movie screening left in tears after trailers for horror movies shown in theater,www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/children-at-peppa-pig-movie-screening-left-in-tears-after-trailers-for-horror-movies-shown-in-theater,"Gwen Stefani’s lips, hair criticized by fans following ACM Awards
Children eagerly waiting to see the new film “Peppa Pig: Festival of Fun” began their theater experience in tears after trailers for horror movies featuring blood and violence were played before the screening.
Parents briefly removed their children from the screening at Empire Cinema in Ipswich, England, on Saturday after trailers for the films “Ma” and “Brightburn” were played before the children’s movie.
“Brightburn,” a superhero horror film featuring Elizabeth Banks, shows a child wearing a mask and seemingly killing a bloodied woman at the end. The trailer shows flashes of hanging bodies. The trailer for “Ma,” starring Octavia Spencer, is filled with sexual violence, blood, bodies and includes a scene of a teen being hit by a truck.
Charlie Jones, a BBC journalist, said she took her daughter to the film screening and attempted to cover her eyes when the scary trailers were played.
“Normally I would expect her [my daughter] to be singing and dancing when watching something like [Peppa Pig] but she was just really subdued,” Jones said. “I tried to cover her eyes during the trailers and told her they were silly films for mommies and daddies, but there were lots of kids crying and she was very confused and started crying too.”
Jones said she went “mad” at the manager after the incident.
“It was meant to be a special day for Annie. I don’t think he understands the impact of it,” she added. “Annie is very imaginative and scared of monsters and things like that at the moment.”
“You go to the movies and you expect it to be a safe family day out, you don’t expect her to be exposed to anything which could do harm,” Jones said.
An Empire Cinemas spokeswoman apologized for “any distress” caused by the incident.
“As soon as the staff on site were made aware of the situation, the program was stopped and trailers were taken off-screen immediately. We do sincerely apologize for this and for any distress caused and will be reviewing our internal procedures to ascertain how this came to be,” the spokeswoman said in a statement to the BBC.

Rabbi Avi Shafran: Assisted suicide bills highlight a society in conflict about suicide,www.foxnews.com,Avi Shafran,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/assisted-suicide-bills-highlight-a-society-in-conflict-about-suicide,"The driver behind him, Tuli Abraham, saw him and stopped and left his car too, to see what was wrong and if he could help. When the elderly man announced that he was going to jump, the young Orthodox Jewish man lurched for the would-be suicide, who turned out to be surprisingly strong, and held him back. Eventually, Mr. Abraham, some other civilians and law enforcement personnel who had been summoned managed to pull the man to safety. EIGHTH STATE TO ALLOW PHYSICIAN -ASSISTED SUICIDE That same week, New Jersey’s legislature voted to pass a bill allowing doctors to help patients kill themselves, joining several other states and a number of European countries that allow physician-assisted suicide.
When it comes to people who wish to kill themselves, it seems, we are a deeply inconsistent society. Should suicide be something that society seeks to prevent, even if it means tackling a man on a bridge? Or is it an expression of autonomous will, a right that must be accepted – even aided?
The Jewish religious tradition, of which I am a product and adherent, falls clearly on the side of preventing suicide. Judaism considers life to be not about rights but about right – that is to say, about responsibilities. And that we have no permission to end lives, even our own.
The source of the societal double standard on suicide lies in a fundamental philosophical issue: whether life has inherent or only utilitarian value.
How else to understand that the anguish or fear or pain of someone expected to have only months to live is reason enough to allow him to end his life, while someone with years ahead of him is perceived as a victim of psychological imbalance that we must do all we can to recalibrate?
The person lying in a hospital bed might be distraught and convinced that he will be better off leaving living to others. But it can’t be denied that even a tiny slice of time can be used to accomplish much. A smile can be shared, a kind word spoken; an apology can be offered, or a regret confronted; repentance can be achieved or peace made with an alienated friend or relative.
Then there are the non-philosophical problems with accepting physician-assisted suicide. Doing so puts us on a dangerous path, at the end of which may lie overzealous doctors and “mercy killers.”
But, fears of misguided do-gooders profit-driven insurers and impatient heirs aside, the question of suicide and aiding it remains an essentially ethical one, about the worth of life.
Instead of offering terminal patients – and that’s a label that applies in a broad sense, of course, to us all – the means to end their lives, might we not do better to focus on convincing them of what they can accomplish, whatever their medical, mental or physical states, in mere moments of time on earth?

Thieves targeting the Jackson Police Department in Mississippi swiped the tires of the patrol cars in two different occasions. (istock) Brazen tire thieves have targeted the police department in Mississippi 's capital city in recent weeks, stealing the wheels from patrol cars -- including one parked at the city's police academy. Three police cruisers that were parked behind a police museum in downtown Jackson were vandalized over the weekend when a thief stole all twelve wheels.
A photo shared on social media showed the three vehicles being towed away Saturday.
Jackson police spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes confirmed to local media Monday the vehicles were towed after they were discovered without their tires. He said police are investigating the crime and they are not sure when the wheels were stolen.
Holmes did not respond to Fox News’ requests for comment early Tuesday.
This is the second time thieves have targeted the Jackson police department’s vehicles.
In March the wheels were taken from a patrol car parked at the Jackson Police Training Academy. The vehicle was left on blocks after the thieves stole tires and rims.
No arrests have been made.

Friendly's closes up shop at 23 Northeast locations,www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/friendlys-closes-up-shop-at-23-locations-in-the-northeast,"Known for its ice cream and family-friendly restaurants, Massachusetts -based Friendly’s decided to close 23 more locations in the Northeast in an effort to recover from bankruptcy and reposition the brand in today’s competitive market, The Boston Globe and Mass Live reported. Fourteen restaurant locations in upstate New York, three in Massachusetts, three in Connecticut, two in New Hampshire and one in Maine will be shut down. Friendly’s will hold 77 corporate-owned locations and 97 franchised-owned restaurants following these closures.
“After a months-long evaluation and careful consideration, we have decided to close 23 corporate-owned restaurants, effective immediately,’’ CEO George Michel said in a letter to franchisees Monday, according to WNBF-TV . “While this was a tough decision, we are confident it will best position the brand for a bright future.’’
Friendly’s filed for bankruptcy in 2011. When it emerged from bankruptcy the following year, the company held 254 locations around the country and has been steadily closing up shop since then. Friendly’s has been working to revamp its menu and has been rolling out new services, including catering options and delivery service through DoorDash and Uber Eats.
“While there’s much work ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum we’re generating,” Michel reportedly wrote. “The energy and enthusiasm for the plans we unveiled at our February meeting was both gratifying and inspiring, as we seek to re-energize our marketing efforts with the addition of a new agency roster, refresh our menu, focus on delivery and catering options, and improve the overall restaurant experience for our customers.”
In 2016, the owner of Friendly’s, Sun Capital, sold the ice cream manufacturing and supermarket sales sides of the business to Dean Foods Co. for $155 million. Dean Foods will produce Friendly’s ice cream for its restaurant locations under a 10-year contract.
Friendly’s was founded in 1935 by two brothers, Brothers S. Prestley and Curtis Blake, who operated a single storefront in Springfield, Massachusetts. When Hershey Foods sold the chain in 1988, Friendly’s had 850 locations in 15 states.

Gabriel Etzel: THIS is what March Madness shows us about Easter,www.foxnews.com,Gabriel Etzel,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gabriel-etzel-this-is-what-march-madness-shows-us-about-easter,"This past weekend, my son’s basketball team played three games, all of which were blowouts. Fortunately for our team, we were only on the receiving end of one of the lopsided scores, but it was to a team that was not better than we are. It is one thing to lose to a better team, but quite another to lose by 30 to a team that is, at best, your equal. So, how is it we lost by 30? Simply put, we lost hope. A few things didn’t go our way, and we stopped believing we could win. Losing hope isn’t reserved for high school sports. Fans see the effects of hope every year during March Madness. In 2018, it was the 16-seed UMBC Retrievers pulling off the upset over 1-seed UVA. This year it was 12-seed Oregon making the Sweet 16, 12-seed Liberty University getting their first tournament win in school history, and UVA winning in overtime to claim their first national championship. Things that seemed unlikely became possible, and the possibility propelled the teams forward. Hope is a powerful force within sports; it moves us to try harder, to believe, to stop holding back.
Where there is hope, there is a chance, and even in the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, hope can restore strength, change perspective, and propel a team to victory.
If we pay attention, sports can teach us so much about life; it’s one of the things I love about sports. So, when my son’s team lost over the weekend, it reminded me of the power of hope for us every day. It is hope that causes us to ask the “what if” questions, and hope that gives us the perspective we need to face life’s challenges. It is the anticipation that helps us think beyond ourselves and beyond what we can currently see.
For the millions celebrating Easter across the globe, we recognize that we have hope. Not hope to win a game, but hope that there is more to life than what we currently see and experience. But, our hope moves beyond even the “what if” questions to a “not yet” perspective on the world. This perspective means we don’t focus on what could happen; rather we have an assured confidence about what will happen. We have a hope that there is someone that can help make sense of the brokenness around us.
The Christian message is filled with hope. The story of humanity is a story that started “very good,” but was quickly affected by brokenness and separation. Yet, in the midst of that brokenness, a splinter of hope was found; in the midst of the darkness, a light was shone to point to the ultimate restoration of all things.
In our brokenness, humanity is offered a chance; humanity is given an invitation to dream, we are given an opportunity to hope. The Christian message is built on the foundation of a God who cared enough to sacrifice for us, a God who desires to be with us, a God who humbled himself to come to us. At the center of the Christian message is Jesus, who willingly laid down his life for us that we may be restored to him. This invitation gives us hope that even though we experience trouble in this world, he has overcome the world. We have confidence that in the end, he works all things out for the good of those who love him. We have hope that the brokenness in the world is not all there is, but that there is a time when he will make beauty from ashes.
This hope is provided for us by someone who knows what it is like to go through the depths of despair, only to be raised to the heights of glory, yet in Jesus, his depths and his heights are far beyond what we can even imagine. The message of Easter is a message of hope; it is a story of relationships reconciled; it is a message of healing, of restoration, of redemption. At the center of the message is the recognition that although Jesus was in a grave on Friday he was alive on Sunday, and through him, all of humanity can experience hope!
The message of Easter gives us hope that there is more than what we see or understand in the present. Easter reminds us that good really is overcoming evil, and eventually, all things will be made right. As you consider hope this season, recognize the true hope we celebrate on Easter: Jesus overcame the insurmountable; he overcame death and has made a way for us to do the same through him.

Wilson picked up the passengers, including the homeowner, from the home Thursday and dropped them off at the airport.

But instead of picking up more customers on the ride-sharing app, Wilson returned to the riders&apos; home, knowing they wouldn’t be there, and attempted to burglarize it, authorities said. His efforts were thwarted when the home’s alarm system went off, San Mateo police said.
Wilson then allegedly went to a different home a few blocks away and “completely ransacked” it. The homeowners, later identified as Shana and Scott, uploaded their home surveillance video onto Ring’s community sharing platform where a resident identified Wilson as the Uber driver, police said.
Surveillance video from the first San Mateo home showed a man believed to be Wilson lurking outside the front porch about an hour after the airport drop-off. The man eventually abandons his suspected burglary attempt and walking down the street to look for his next target.
Police arrested Wilson and searched his Rancho Cordova home where they said he found items he stole from the second house.
“Stuff is just stuff and I’m happy that we’re safe. But there were family heirlooms that I’m really, really hoping that I can get back. They are from my grandmother [and] they go way back to the Holocaust,” Shana told KTVU.
Scott added: “I’m definitely thinking twice about taking ride-shares further after this. I think everybody should this is a big deal. He used this to facilitate committing a crime.""
Uber said in a statement to KTVU that it has removed Wilson from the ride-hailing app.
“We removed the driver’s access to the app as soon as we were made aware of the allegations and stand ready to assist police in their investigation,” the statement read.
Police said they are investigating to see whether Wilson is linked to other burglaries.

Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) issued the most high-profile call to get rid of it. Pointing to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’s (R-Ky.) blockade and slow-walk of many of President Barack Obama ’s judicial nominees…” California man says he too is running for president - LAT: “ Eric Swalwell , a four-term Bay Area congressman who’s grown into a cable TV fixture as a slashing and unremitting critic of President Trump, formally announced Monday his long-shot bid for the 2020 Democratic nomination. Fittingly, he chose national television as the venue to declare his intent, saying on CBS’‘Late Show with Stephen Colbert ’ he would ‘go big on the issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer and do good in the way we govern.’ Swalwell, 38, has essentially been running for president for the better part of the last two years. Still, he will have to work to distinguish himself in a crowded field approaching 20 contestants. He is neither the youngest candidate nor the only millennial in the Democratic race … and he shares his Northern California political base with Sen. Kamala Harris , a former district attorney across the bay in San Francisco.” Klobuchar misses the top tier on fundraising - Politico: “Sen. Amy Klobuchar raised more than $5.2 million for her presidential bid since launching her campaign in mid-February, trailing behind top contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Amy for America, Klobuchar's campaign committee, announced Monday that it finished the first quarter of the year with $7 million in the bank after adding in an additional $3 million that Klobuchar raised for her Senate campaign last year. … Unlike some Democratic candidates, Klobuchar's campaign has solicited money for the general election at some fundraisers, which means she can't spend all of the money she raised during the primary. Klobuchar's campaign did not outline how much general election money she raised during the first quarter.” How Twitter gets it twisted - NYT: “Perhaps the most telling poll of the Democratic primary season hasn’t been about the Democratic primary at all — but about the fallout from a 35-year-old racist photo on a yearbook page. … Yet the majority of ordinary Democrats in Virginia said Mr. [ Ralph ] Northam should remain in office, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll a week later. … Today’s Democratic Party is increasingly perceived as dominated by its ‘woke’ left wing. But the views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those of the wider Democratic electorate. The outspoken group of Democratic-leaning voters on social media is outnumbered, roughly 2 to 1, by the more moderate, more diverse and less educated group of Democrats who typically don’t post political content online, according to data from the Hidden Tribes Project. This latter group has the numbers to decide the Democratic presidential nomination in favor of a relatively moderate establishment favorite, as it has often done in the past.” Tim Miller: ‘Joe Biden Deserves Better Than This’ - The Bulwark: “In a convergence of the tribalistic crazy that has infected our politics, the former vice president has managed to find himself a target … But here’s the thing about these critics, left and right: Vanishingly few of them seem to sincerely believe that Biden’s enthusiastic shoulder rubbing would inhibit him from being a successful president. Their real complaints with him are along much different vectors: That he is a ‘neoliberal capitalist’ (the Bernie bros); or that there are women or people of color who are better options (intersectional progressives); or that he’s a liberal who needs to be owned (Trump supporters). In a way, this isn’t surprising. … We’re long past the point where people try to convince others of the rightness of their arguments. These days, people don’t even really believe their own arguments. They’re just trying to score points, or get retweets, or whatever.” Booker bags an endorsement - Politico: “ Cory Booker isn’t soaring in the national polls or in the 2020 fundraising race. Still, the New Jersey senator is quietly making early presidential state inroads. On Monday, Booker captured his first legislative endorsement in New Hampshire when state Sen. Jon Morgan gave him his official backing. Morgan has met numerous 2020 candidates and attended recent campaign events for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney . But he said Booker’s message, which centers on uniting a deeply divided nation, is what most resonated with him. … Booker has made an early investment in New Hampshire, marked by multiple trips to stump and fundraise for local candidates — including Morgan — in the 2018 midterm elections. Booker raised more money for New Hampshire Democrats than any other national Democrat…” PLAY-BY-PLAY Voter intensity equally matched, already at near-election levels - Georgetown University Pergram: Senate pays tribute to former Sen.

Riot policeman stand by as French yellow vest protesters are rallying to support an older woman activist injured in a confrontation with police, Saturday, March 30, 2019 in Paris. In 2019, 24 police officers in France have committed suicide, raising alarm over increased demand on the nation's police force. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus) French police officers commit suicide once every four days, a new report shows, revealing 24 officers have taken their own lives just four months into 2019. Two police officers in France died of “suspected” suicides during the weekend, The Information and Communication Service of the National Police confirmed to France 24 on Monday, adding the investigations into the officers’ deaths are still ongoing and no final conclusions have been made on the causes of death. The 24 officers confirmed to have committed suicide do not include the two suspected of doing so this weekend, and all numbers come from the Directorate General of the National Police.
FRANCE'S YELLOW VESTS CLASH WITH RIOT POLICE IN PARIS, WATER CANNON AND TEAR GAS DEPLOYED WITH AT LEAST 20 ARRESTED
""A policeman kills himself every four days, it's too much,"" Denis Jacob from the French Democratic Confederation of Labor Union told The Local.
One officer, a 37-year-old woman who worked night shifts in the northwestern Paris suburb of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, was discovered dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound Saturday evening, Le Parisien reported . Police found the woman’s body in her car in the town of Guainville by using GPS tracking in the officer’s phone.
The second officer, a 49-year-old man who worked in the town of Alès in the Occitanie region of southern France, was found dead Sunday one week after he had been reported missing, the regional newspaper Midi Libre reported .
""It's a massacre,"" Thomas Toussaint from the Unsa-Police union told The Local, adding that in 2018 it took until August to reach the same number of suicides already seen in 2019.
Police labor unions have spoken out about how increased terrorism, the influx of migrants and rioting have increased the demand for the nation’s police force.
""A new type of aggression appeared in recent years, clearly intended to cause physical harm to the police, even to kill,"" one of the directors of France's riot police, the CRS, told The Local in 2018.
In 2015, French interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve launched a program to address the rising number of officers committing suicide by recruiting seven extra psychologists to the police departments with the most need. Locker systems were also installed at police stations so that officers could store their weapons after work, in theory, lessening the temptation to commit suicide at home with their issued pistols.
The 2015 program has received criticism for being ineffective in reducing the number of police suicides in the country. A 2018 investigation into police working conditions also revealed officers endure strenuous work schedules, dilapidated office spaces and outdated computer systems and equipment, The Local reported.

The number of officers committing suicide in France peaked in 2014 when 55 officers took their own lives. In 2008, 49 officers committed suicide. In 2005, 50 officers took their own lives, and, in 2000, 54 officer suicides were reported.
The highest year on record for police suicides in France is 1996, when a total of 70 officers killed themselves. Trending in World "

“And I said, ‘Yes, I am,” he continued. “Thank you for being here. I was wearing the hat you couldn’t tell!”
Video The student, Matthew Rowland, told the Iowa City Press-Citizen that he bumped into O’Rourke in the bathroom and the two made small talk.
""I was in the bathroom, minding my own business, and I was washing my hands,"" Rowland told the media outlet. ""And this guy asked me how it was going, and I said good, &apos;How&apos;s it going,&apos; going for some small talk.”
When he asked the politician if he was there to see O’Rourke, he said the stranger looked at him and said, “That’s me.”
""I was in awe and shook his hand,"" Rowland said. ""A super polite guy. I&apos;m just glad I got a chance to meet him.""
O’Rourke announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic nomination in March. The former congressman said he raised $6.1 million online in the first 24 hours after his announcement. He is part of a crowded field of 20 people who are in the running for the Democratic ticket, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen.

Ellen DeGeneres has awkward moment with guest Jodie Comer of 'Killing Eve',www.foxnews.com,Tyler McCarthy,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-has-awkward-moment-with-guest-jodie-comer-of-killing-eve,"Comer appeared on “The Ellen Show” earlier this week where she got to talking about her role on the hit BBC America series as well as a previous part in the BBC drama ""Doctor Foster."" DeGeneres noted that she was told she would be surprised by the actress’ real accent after watching her on the show. “Liverpool, home of The Beatles,” the star said of her accent.
“I’m so shocked to hear that,” DeGeneres says. “In ‘Doctor Foster’ you had an American accent, right?”
“No, she was British,” a puzzled Comer says. “I didn’t do a good job there. No, she was British, she’s from London.”
The two laughed off the moment as Ellen stammered a brief apology. She then quickly moved on to ask about the accents that Comer does on “Killing Eve.”
The actress plays Villanelle, a Russian assassin on the drama series and is forced to do a slew of varied accents and languages.
She told Ellen that she didn’t think much of telling producers that she could handle the many speech patterns of her character during her audition. However, when she ultimately got the part she was a bit overwhelmed at how much work would go into making the character work.
“I view Villanelle as an actress in many ways. She puts on these personas, she dresses up, she uses the accents and the languages and it’s all a ploy to kind of trap her victims and lure them in,"" she told the host.

"New York Democrats propose new bill cracking down on Airbnb, other home-sharing sites",www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/new-york-democrats-propose-new-bill-cracking-down-on-airbnb-and-other-home-sharing-sites,"The proposed legislation would restrict New Yorkers from listing more than one property on home sharing sites. Affordable housing and rent-stabilized units would be prohibited from being rented out on a short-term basis, and all short-term rental properties would be required to be registered with the state. The new measure would replace current legislation that subjects some New York City residents to fines for renting out their apartments on a short-term basis. Under current New York state legal code, it is against the law in most buildings for an apartment to be rented out for less than 30 days unless the permanent tenant is living in the apartment at the same time, The New York Times reported.
The two Democratic sponsors of the bill -- state Sen. James Skoufis and Assemblyman Jospeh Lentol -- affirm that the new legislation creates a needed balance by providing regulation for home-sharing sites while also realizing the sites are not going away.
A federal judge in January pumped the brakes on a New York City law that would have required online rental services to disclose the addresses of its listings and the identities of its hosts to the city’s Office of Special Enforcement on a monthly basis, The New York Times reported. The ruling claimed such measures violated the right to protection against illegal searches and seizures guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who signed the bill into law in August 2018 after it unanimously passed the City Council, and other Democratic lawmakers have criticized Airbnb and HomeAway for contributing to rising rent in the city. The home-sharing platforms have been blamed for turning apartments into illegal hotels and aggravating the city’s housing shortage.
Airbnb’s head of policy and communications, Chris LeHane, announced his company’s support for the new legislation in a joint press conference with state legislators in Albany Tuesday.

A menorah is tested outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in preparation for a celebration service at sundown on the first night of Hanukkah, in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, on Dec. 2, 2018. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube are fertile breeding grounds for white supremacists and white nationalists – enabling acts of real-world violence and fueling bigotry – and Big Tech must do more to stop it, advocacy groups that monitor and combat hate and discrimination say. During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and other organizations detailed how tech platforms have fueled an uptick in hate crimes against Muslims, immigrants, African-Americans and Jews by enabling perpetrators to self-radicalize, locate extremist hate groups and find like-minded users.
Facebook and Google, meanwhile, defended measures their companies have taken in the wake of horrific incidents such as the Tree of Life Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the New Zealand mosque massacre, both of which were allegedly perpetrated by gunmen who espoused white supremacist or white nationalist views online.
FACEBOOK BLASTED AS 'MORALLY BANKRUPT LIARS' BY NEW ZEALAND PRIVACY CHIEF
""The white supremacist movement has sought to re-brand itself and become more palatable to broader audiences,"" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, in her prepared remarks. ""Instead of 'white supremacy,' they say 'white nationalism.' Instead of hiding behind masks, they hide behind computer screens.""
The ADL's senior vice president for policy, Eileen Hershenov, explained that white supremacist violence accounted for 78 percent of all extremist-related murders in the United States in 2018.
""White supremacists in the United States have experienced a resurgence in the past three years,"" Hershenov said. ""There is also a clear corollary, as our research shows, to the rise in polarizing and hateful rhetoric on the part of candidates and elected leaders.""

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)
Hershenov called on tech giants like Facebook and Twitter to share their granular data regarding hate groups, which is one thing they have not done.
Representatives from Facebook and Google both said they made the removal of white supremacists and white nationalists a priority, and both explained that they are still improving their artificial intelligence systems to better detect hateful content in advance. Facebook has 30,000 people working broadly on health and safety, although the social network was blasted after the New Zealand shooting for allowing the gunman's livestreamed video to spread.
FACEBOOK, GOOGLE IN CROSSHAIRS OF NEW UK POLICY TO CONTROL TECH GIANTS
In 2017, following the deadly white nationalist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va., tech giants began banishing extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence.
Even so, as recently as Tuesday afternoon, there was one Facebook account called ""Aryan Pride"" that was still visible on the platform.
The hearing, which at times devolved into more partisan bickering over the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies, and their impact on the global spread of white nationalist violence, also featured Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of two daughters and a son-in-law murdered by a hate-filled shooter in North Carolina in 2015.
AIR FORCE F-16 GETS F-35 SENSORS, WEAPONS AND RADAR
""I taught my children our faith every Sunday. That is why they were all loving and caring,"" Abu-Salha said. ""Yusor was a vibrant 21-year-old woman who always found ways to give to others. Razan was 19 years old and was so full of life, a gentle soul.""
Advocates called for more resources from law enforcement agencies, more coordination between tech companies and transparency about their methods for stopping hate groups and better enforcement of Big Tech's existing policies against extremism. During the hearing, the comments became so hateful on the YouTube livestream that the company disabled them .
“The companies that create and profit from online platforms where white supremacy is prevalent, also have a responsibility to address this crisis. We call on all online platforms to fully and fairly enforce their terms of service, and terminate purveyors of hate who violate those terms by promoting and inciting violence,"" said Clarke. ""We urge greater transparency by the tech sector regarding the prevalence of hateful activities on their platforms.""

Hershenov emphasized that digital platforms must do more to battle extremism.
""Individuals can easily find sanction and reinforcement online for their extreme opinions or actions,"" she said. ""This enables adherents like white supremacist mass shooters such as [Tree of Life gunman] Bowers to self-radicalize without face-to-face contact with an established terror group or cell.""

A lawsuit backed by the National Rifle Association has been filed in opposition to Pittsburgh's new gun control laws.
Four Pittsburgh residents are suing the city, Mayor Bill Peduto and the City Council. The suit says the legislation Peduto signed into law Tuesday infringes on the people's right of self-defense and will do nothing to prevent mass shootings like the one that killed 11 at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue last fall.
A coalition of gun rights groups filed a separate suit seeking to block the laws from taking effect. Both suits were filed in Allegheny County.
Peduto and City Council members say they expected to be sued and are pledging to fight.

Pittsburgh's mayor has signed gun-control legislation passed by City Council in response to the synagogue massacre.
Opponents immediately filed suit Tuesday to block it.

Pennsylvania law prohibits local regulation of guns and ammunition, and a coalition of gun-rights groups filed a lawsuit minutes after Peduto signed the bills.
The legislation restricts military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 rifle that authorities say was used in the rampage at Tree of Life Synagogue that killed 11 and wounded seven. It also bans most uses of armor-piercing ammunition and high-capacity magazines, and allows the temporary seizure of guns from people who are determined to be a danger to themselves or others.

The Latest: Defense: Officer who killed woman feared ambush,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-latest-defense-officer-who-killed-woman-feared-ambush,"1:10 p.m. The defense attorney for a former Minneapolis police officer on trial in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman in 2017 says his client drew his gun to protect his partner and himself.
During opening statements Tuesday, Mohamed Noor&apos;s attorney, Peter Wold, told jurors the fatal shooting of Justine Ryszcyk Damond was a ""perfect storm with tragic consequences.""
Wold said that as Noor and his partner were responding to Damond&apos;s report of possible rape behind her home, they saw a bicyclist and heard a ""bang."" He says that in Noor&apos;s mind it was a classic setup for what could have been an ambush.
Noor, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of Damond, a 40-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia.
Prosecutors charged Noor with second-degree intentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, saying there was no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force.

11:30 a.m.
A prosecutor says just 1 minute and 19 seconds passed from the time an unarmed woman hung up from a cellphone conversation with her fiance to the time she lay on the ground dying from a gunshot fired by a Minneapolis police officer.
That officer, Mohamed Noor, is on trial in Hennepin County accused of murder and manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. The 40-year-old was shot after calling police to report a possible rape in the alley behind her home. Damond told her fiance in a phone call that police had arrived to take her report.
Noor and his partner were in a squad car in the alley. During opening statements Tuesday, prosecutor Patrick Lofton told jurors that Noor fired his gun across his partner through the driver&apos;s side open window without saying a word. Lofton says there&apos;s no forensic evidence that Damond touched the police vehicle before being shot.
The defense is expected to argue that Noor acted in self-defense.

11 a.m.
The judge hearing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman has reversed a ban on what video evidence may be viewed by the media and public.
Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Tuesday that body camera video introduced as evidence in the murder trial of Mohamed Noor will be shown to the entire courtroom.
Quaintance had earlier said such video would be shown only to the jury, citing a desire to protect the privacy of the victim, Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Quaintance said she has to follow the law even if she disagrees with it.
Noor shot Damond when she approached his squad care minutes after calling 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home. The video doesn&apos;t capture the shooting but shows efforts to save Damond.

Midnight
With a jury in place, opening statements are set to begin Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman.
Thirty-three-year-old Mohamed Noor, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Justine Ruszczyk Damond&apos;s death. Damond, a 40-year-old dual Australian-American citizen who was white, was killed in July 2017 after calling 911 to report a possible rape near her home.
It took a week to select a jury. After 75 prospective jurors answered questions about their views on Somalis and police officers, as well as their experiences with firearms and other issues, 12 men and four women were selected Monday to hear the case. In the end, only 12 will deliberate.
Six of the jurors are people of color.

Judge refuses bond for man accused of IS-inspired attack,www.foxnews.com,MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-refuses-bond-for-man-accused-of-is-inspired-attack,"But a defense attorney urged the court to be skeptical of authorities&apos; claims about 28-year-old Rondell Henry, a naturalized U.S. citizen who moved here from Trinadad and Tobago about 11 years ago. Federal public defender Michael CitaraManis argued the government ""is trying to fit certain facts into their narrative"" that Henry intended to carry out a terrorist attack last month at the National Harbor, a popular waterfront destination just outside the nation&apos;s capital.
The defense lawyer asked for his client to be freed on house arrest, but U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas DiGirolamo ordered Henry held without bond while he awaits trial. The judge agreed with prosecutors that the defendant poses a danger to the public.
A court filing by prosecutors Monday says Henry watched Islamic State propaganda videos of foreign terrorists beheading civilians and fighting overseas, admiring their actions and considering them brave. Henry told investigators he believed in an ""eye for an eye"" and thought inflicting pain and bloodshed was the best way to achieve a ""balance,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom told the magistrate.
""He wanted bloodshed. He wanted chaos. He wanted panic,"" the prosecutor added.
Henry isn&apos;t charged with any terrorism-related offenses. Police arrested him March 28 on a charge of driving a stolen vehicle across state lines. The charge, which carries up to 10 years in prison, is likely a placeholder count, with prosecutors expected to present evidence before a grand jury and secure an indictment that could have new charges.
CitaraManis said his client is a college-educated computer engineer who has a tight-knight family, including a mother and sister who live in Maryland and a brother who lives in Florida. Family members filed a missing persons report after Henry walked away from his job during the middle of his shift March 26.
After his arrest by local law enforcement, Henry was taken for a psychiatric evaluation. He was held at a mental health facility for several days before FBI agents took him into custody, his attorney said.
Windom said Henry also notified his landlord in Germantown, Maryland, that he was breaking the lease on his apartment. Henry intended to die in an attack and had recently spent time with relatives because he thought he wouldn&apos;t see them again, according to the prosecutor.
Henry stole a U-Haul van from the parking garage of a mall in Virginia and initially considered an attack at Dulles International Airport on March 27, trying unsuccessfully over two hours to breach the security perimeter by slipping in through a checkpoint or accessing a restricted area, prosecutors said.
Instead, he drove to the National Harbor later that morning but also found a similarly small crowd, so he parked the truck, broke into a boat and hid there overnight, according to prosecutors. Police arrested him the next morning after they found the stolen van and saw Henry jump over a security fence from the boat deck.
Questioned by investigators, Henry allegedly said he planned to carry out a truck attack similar to one that killed dozens of people in Nice, France, in July 2016.
""I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving. I wasn&apos;t going to stop,"" he said, according to Monday&apos;s court filing.
Prosecutors say investigators recovered a phone that Henry discarded on a highway in an apparent attempt to conceal evidence, including images of the Islamic State flag, armed Islamic State fighters and the man who carried out the massacre in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub three years ago.

Deputy accused of planting heroin and meth in car of ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend,www.foxnews.com,Anna Hopkins,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/deputy-accused-of-planting-heroin-and-meth-in-car-of-ex-girlfriends-new-boyfriend,"Deputy David Scott Burroughs&apos; coworkers became suspicious when he told them about anonymous tips he&apos;d received in May 2018 that the unnamed victim was dealing drugs out of his car. “This started on a Sunday afternoon,” Anson County Sheriff Landric Reid said, according to FOX13 . “By Wednesday, when we made the stop, drugs were at the same place in the car. That was a red flag because anyone selling drugs wouldn&apos;t have them Sunday to Wednesday in the same place.""
The County Sheriff&apos;s office then contacted the State Bureau of Investigation to probe the matter further, who found that Burrough allegedly purchased heroin and meth, and placed them in the victim&apos;s car in retaliation for dating his ex-girlfriend.
""This was a revenge case where he planted drugs in this male&apos;s car,” Reid continued. “This male was dating his ex, and he wanted revenge, and he wanted his ex-girlfriend back.""
Burrough was promptly fired when the investigation was completed, and he was arrested last week. He has since been released on bail and will appear in court next Tuesday.

Rep. Andy Biggs: Nielsen resignation puts Democrats' Trump Derangement Syndrome on full display,www.foxnews.com,Rep. Andy Biggs,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-andy-biggs-nielsen-resignation-puts-democrats-trump-derangement-syndrome-on-full-display,"Kirstjen Nielsen resigns as Homeland Security secretary Democrats truly have Trump Derangement Syndrome. Kirstjen Nielsen is out as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and Ron Vitiello’s name was pulled from the nomination to direct Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Yet the president’s political opponents are howling about these changes as if they were supporters of Nielsen and Vitiello. In reality, change comes in political circles, and sometimes very often. The president has sent a strong signal over the past two weeks that the emergency he declared on the border is real and that it must be addressed with a sense of urgency that we haven’t always seen under previous leadership.
President Trump has been down to the border. He has taken away foreign aid funding to the three Central American nations, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, that have done nothing to stop the formation of an exodus from their countries to the United States. The president has used his bully pulpit to threaten Mexico to stop this massive flow of illegal immigration from those nations across Mexico to the American border .
IF TRUMP CRITICS THINK DHS RESIGNATION WILL CHANGE HIS MIND ON THE BORDER, THINK AGAIN
The president has vowed to accelerate building of the border fence and warned illegal border crossers that they are unwelcome in a country that already accepts over 1 million legal immigrants every year (and has a waiting list of millions who want to come into our country the right way and become part of the fabric of this great nation).
The president has made a clear direction change in his policy and wants his subordinates -- the leaders of our homeland security apparatus to be simpatico. It is important that he has people who will carry out his policy objectives, especially when one considers that the border has become a truly important national security risk. And, the opposition party still argues that there is no border problem. Video
And that becomes a big problem because the Democrats who control the United States House of Representatives will do nothing to build a border wall, tackle the laws that facilitate amnesty fraud or support our ICE and CBP agents. Instead, Democrats want to eliminate ICE altogether and tear down border barriers we already have.
President Trump needs vigorous and supportive leaders of his homeland security agenda. But there are several things he can do with his lawful authority to enact change without the do-nothing Congress. He can give greater authority to the military on the border by declaring that drug and human trafficking cartels are terrorist organizations. That will allow our border protectors expanded the ability to tackle these inhumane transnational criminal syndicates.
Congress failed to pass my legislation in the last term (leaders wouldn’t even give it a hearing) that would tax remittance payments to countries that facilitate illegal immigration. That money would be used to help pay for a border wall and upgraded equipment for our border guardians. Since Congress failed to act, and will not do this under Democrat leadership, I suggest that the president use existing financial service laws to prevent these remittances. In 2017, more than $30 billion was transferred to Mexico. Freezing those transfers would have a profound effect on our southern neighbor.
The president should also begin having his customs officials inspect southbound traffic at the border. We are not effectively interdicting the transfer of cartel dollars heading south from the U.S. because we do not inspect traffic leaving the U.S. Border agents have told me that some of these vehicles carry significant amounts of U.S. cash – profits from drug and human trafficking cartels. In the past, we had K9 units trained for currency, and do not have that now.

Finally, the president can insist that Mexico accept international protocols that would require it to detain asylum seekers in Mexico if they are attempting to cross Mexico in order to enter the United States.
President Trump’s changes at the top of the Department of Homeland Security will be meaningful if we see a stronger implementation of border enforcement that will allow the U.S. to wrest control of its southern border away from Mexican crime cartels, back into the hands of our Border Patrol agents. And that has to be done in spite of the existing Trump Derangement Syndrome. Republican Andy Biggs represents the 5th Congressional District of Arizona. Trending in Opinion"

(Everett Herald) A 17-year-old girl and two men have been arrested by Washington state authorities in a murder-for-hire plot in which a 24-year-old woman was killed two years ago -- even though authorities say she wasn't the intended target. Alisha Canales-McGuire was shot to death in the early morning hours on Sept. 20, 2017 in Everett, the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office said Monday. Her body was found in the doorway.
“She had been staying at her sister’s home and it is believed her sister, who was out of town at the time, was the intended target of the murder-for-hire by her ex-husband,” the news release says.

The sheriff’s office announced that the ex-husband, Kevin Lewis, 31, his cousin, Jerradon Phelps, 19, and the female teen, who was not identified because of her age, are facing murder charges after their arrests.
Lewis stands accused of offering Phelps and the girl $2,400 to kill his ex-wife, the Everett Herald reported.
Currently, Lewis is behind bars, doing a stretch for beating his ex, the paper reported.
Cell phone records show Phelps and the girl driving from Spokane to Everett in the time leading up to Canales-McGuire's murder, according to the sheriff’s office news release.
It says that a few hours after the murder, Phelps posted photos on social media “showing off several hundred dollar bills.”
Investigators on the case got a break last summer, KING-TV reported.
""Patrol received a phone call from somebody in the Spokane area who said she had been at a social gathering and a young woman there claimed she had been hired to kill someone in Snohomish County,"" the sheriff office’s Shari Ireton told the station.

What is ‘Democratic socialism’? Bernie Sanders' political ideology explained,www.foxnews.com,Madeline Farber,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-is-democratic-socialism-bernie-sanders-political-ideology,"Bernie Sanders calls Democratic socialism a 'vibrant democracy' Once largely considered “taboo” and a “ dirty word ,” socialism — particularly, Democratic socialism — has seemingly started to trickle into the political mainstream in recent years, thanks, in part, to self-proclaimed Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. An August 2018 Gallup poll found Democrats had a “more positive image” of socialism than of capitalism, with 57 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents saying they had a positive view of socialism compared to 47 percent who had a positive view of capitalism.
Sanders will join Fox News Channel for a town hall co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum on Monday, April 15, at 6:30 p.m. ET in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
“Views of socialism among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are particularly important in the current political environment because many observers have claimed the Democratic Party is turning in more of a socialist direction,” Gallup noted at the time.
3 BERNIE SANDERS POLICIES NOW EMBRACED BY THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD
Socialism — a term that first hatched in the early 19th century, per The Washington Post — has “meant different things to different people in different times and places, while maintaining a stable core of themes and objectives: social (as opposed to private) control of the means of production, and of all the societal, humanitarian and political-economic changes that entails, especially where the freedom and autonomy of working people are concerned,” Opinion columnist Elizabeth Bruenig wrote in August 2018.
But what exactly does it mean to be a Democratic socialist? And how have Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders and other politicians who align with the political philosophy describe its meaning to them?
Read on for a brief look Democratic socialism. First, what is Democratic socialism?
Democratic socialism pulls from both Democracy and socialism, per the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) website. Political theorist and activist Michael Harrington helped form the DSA in 1982.
“Democratic socialists believe that both the economy and society should be run democratically — to meet public needs, not to make profits for a few,” the group states, noting to achieve a more “just society” many “structures of our government and economy must be radically transformed through greater economic and social democracy so that ordinary Americans can participate in the many decisions that affect our lives.”
Democratic socialists favor decentralization; they don’t necessarily want to create “an all-powerful government bureaucracy” but are not in favor of “big corporate bureaucracies to control our society either,” reads the website.
Those who align with the political ideology typically support pro-union politics, tuition-free public universities, universal healthcare and using tax money from the wealthy to fund social welfare programs, among other ideas, reported TIME in October 2018.
“[What they want] is not a violent overthrow of capitalism, but working within the system through legal and peaceful means [such as] electoral and social movements,” Maurice Isserman, a professor of History at Hamilton College, told the magazine at the time. What issues are Democratic socialists focused on right now?
""Medicare for All,"" strong unions and electoral power are three of the DSA’s current campaigns. What has Sanders said about being a Democratic socialist?
Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and now one of the many vying for the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2020 election, explained what the political ideology means to him during a CNN town hall in February.
“These are not radical ideas,” said Sanders, 77.
“What democratic socialism means to me is having, in a civilized society, the understanding that we can make sure that all of our people live in security and in dignity,” he said. “All people should have health care. You can’t get ahead in this country, in this world, unless you have a decent education.”
""We have got to, as a right, end the kinds of discrimination — the racism, the sexism, and the homophobia — that exists. To me, when I talk about democratic socialism, what I talk about are human rights and economic rights,” he continued, before going on to list his policies — such as tuition-free public universities, raising the minimum wage and universal health care — he would enact if elected president. What about other Democratic socialists like Ocasio-Cortez, Julia Salazar and Rashida Tlaib?
New York Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, echoed Sanders when speaking to Business Insider in March.
""So when millennials talk about concepts like Democratic socialism, we're not talking about these kinds of 'Red Scare' boogeyman,"" she said. ""We're talking about countries and systems that already exist that have already been proven to be successful in the modern world.""
""We're talking about single-payer health care that has already been successful in many different models, from Finland to Canada to the UK,"" she added, before going on to say Democratic socialism enforces “basic levels of dignity so that no person in America is too poor to live.”
Julia Salazar, who represents New York’s 18th State Senate District, is also a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, telling October, a beer-centric magazine, she has been a DSA member for two years and is “committed to trying to build Democratic socialism.”
On a personal level, Salazar, 28, said being a Democratic socialist “means fighting to make sure that every person is empowered to be able to determine their own destiny.”
“That all of us have access to not only basic needs, but to what we need to thrive in society. Housing is a human right, not something that should be at the mercy of the market. Health care is a human right, similarly, that shouldn’t be accessible only by income or status,” she added.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who represents Michigan’s 13th congressional district, has also spoken on the political ideology — telling In These Times in August of 2018 “it means a strong partner.”
“When I talk about equitable, just fairness, I lean on a whole group of people who understand just how much the structures in place are set up against the people, people of color, and the working class. It helps me have an organization and people to lean on. It’s important to have that kind of partnership,” Tlaib, 42, said. Democratic socialism and American politics
Isserman told NPR in July 2018 “this is the most important moment in DSA history.”
The group has garnered an increasing amount of visibility in recent years, increasing from roughly 7,000 members to 50,00 since President Trump’s election in 2016, according to a 2018 Axios report.
The growing membership, combined with big wins for Democratic socialists are solid examples of the group’s “growing movement,” the publication added.
BERNIE SANDERS' BIGGEST STAR-STUDDED BACKERS: MARK RUFFALO, DANNY DEVITO AND OTHERS Are there any models of Democratic socialism in the world today?
No country to-date has fully instituted Democratic socialism, per the DSA’s website, which noted some countries — Canada, Sweden and France, among others — have pulled from the political ideology in terms of health care, childcare and beyond.

Elisabeth Moss says 'The Handmaid's Tale' runs 'parallel' to her Scientology beliefs,www.foxnews.com,Tyler McCarthy,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/elisabeth-moss-on-how-the-handmaids-tale-meshes-with-her-scientology-beliefs-political-views,"The former ""Mad Men"" actress opened up about her current role and how it meshes with her personal beliefs. “‘The Handmaid’s Tale’ lines up so perfectly parallel with my own beliefs in freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the things that this country was actually built on,” Moss told the Daily Beast , noting that she doesn&apos;t like to preach her political or religious beliefs in interviews.
“I will say that the things that I truly believe in are the things that I’ve mentioned, and I think that they’re very important. I think people should be allowed to talk about what they want to talk about and believe what they want to believe and you can’t take that away—and when you start to take that away, when you start to say ‘you can’t think that,’ ‘you can’t believe that,’ ‘you can’t say that,’ then you get into trouble. Then you get into Gilead,” she continued, citing the fictional country in “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

The actress typically avoids talking about her religion whenever possible. In her latest interview, Moss dodged questions about the controversial church’s views against the LGBTQ community. However, she made it clear that she personally is a staunch supporter of LGBTQ rights, regardless of what the Church of Scientology may teach.
As for her political views, that star was able to be a bit more direct in her response. Moss spoke candidly about the parallels she sees in the show&apos;s treatment of social issues and the current administration.
“We went to D.C. and shot at the Lincoln Memorial, and I find it incredibly moving what Lincoln stood for, what’s written on the walls, what those monuments stand for. The principles that this country was built on are important and we’re losing them—and perhaps we’ve already lost them,” she said. “You feel a sense of responsibility and you feel honored telling this story at this time. When you’re kneeling on the steps in front of the Lincoln Memorial, you’re looking at where MLK gave his ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, you’re in the outfit of complete lack of freedom, and your president is a few blocks away arguing about putting up a wall, you can’t help but feel that you have the responsibility to tell this story.”
Moss was previously asked by a fan about her views on how the show stacks up against her religion.
""Question though, does it make you think twice about Scientology? Gilead [the fictional country in the TV show] and Scientology both believe that all outside sources (aka news) are wrong and evil…it’s just very interesting,"" one fan asked Moss in August.
Moss responded at the time, ""That’s actually not true at all about Scientology. Religious freedom and tolerance and understanding the truth and equal rights for every race, religion and creed are extremely important to me. The most important things to me probably. And so Gilead and &apos;THT&apos; hit me on a very personal level.""

WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Netflix documentary scene shocks viewers,www.foxnews.com,news.com.au,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/warning-graphic-images-netflix-documentary-scene-shocks-viewers,"A gut-wrenching scene in Netflix’s new David Attenborough series ""Our Planet"" brings that reality into sharp focus. It’s been labeled the Walrus scene and if you haven’t watched it yet, consider yourself warned. It’s no walk in the park.
It takes place in the Bering Strait, which separates Russia and Alaska slightly south of the Arctic Circle. Filmmakers captured a large group of Pacific walruses engaging in behavior that once would have been quite unusual.
According to the show’s producers, because their icy habitat is shrinking, walruses are being driven on to land to haul-out in large numbers where they can be a danger to themselves.
In the Netflix footage, a conflict between walruses is believed to have prompted others to scramble to safety, some climb up a steep cliff face to find solace.
But it’s not a usual place for animals that can weigh up to two tons to find themselves. In their clumsy and desperate attempts to get back to the water, they stumble from the cliff’s edge.
(Credit: Netflix)
Horrified filmmakers look on as they bounce off the jagged rocks below. Many dying on impact, or crushing other walruses beneath them.
As their preferred habitat disappears, deadly scenes like this one are becoming a more common occurrence, the World Wildlife Fund says. Ordinarily, they would gather in smaller groups and often lay about on ice.
(Credit: Netflix)
Even the show’s producer, Sophie Lanfear, was startled by what she saw and recalled how hard it was to witness during filming.
“The walrus scenes were the hardest things I’ve ever had to witness or film in my career,” she told The New York Times.
When planning the story, she chose the location because she knew about the mega haul-outs that were taking place in the region, which are the largest in the world. But she wasn’t aware of the potential carnage.
“I was expecting that perhaps the walruses would tumble down, but at the end, they’d be okay. I really wasn’t prepared for the scale of death,” she said.
(Credit: Netflix)
“What we think is going on is that the ones at the top can probably hear the ones in the water, and they can sense that there is water below. They teeter on the edge, and they just can’t work out how to get down there.
“A small group of maybe six or seven would make it down safely, and we’d all celebrate. But the vast majority do not. They basically walk themselves off the cliff.”
‘EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION AT ITS WORST’
The show’s creators partnered with the WWF, as well as a team of scientists, to depict how various ecosystems around the world are being impacted by human-led climate change. The series is unapologetic in its advocacy.
Some critics have questioned the link between the grisly scene and climate change, instead asserting it was the threat of polar bears that drove the animals off the cliff during an event in 2017. At the time, it was reported that hundreds of walruses fell to their death after being frightened by polar bears in the Russian Arctic, where the Netflix scene was filmed.
“This must be the most ridiculous thing ever ascribed to “climate change’” said Patrick Moore , a self-proclaimed sensible environmentalist and Greenpeace co-founder.
Those who believe the circumstances around the Netflix scene have been misportrayed have labeled the episode “tragedy porn” and fake news.
Speaking to the UK’s Telegraph, zoologist Dr. Susan Crockford called the narrative of the scene “contrived nonsense”.
“This powerful story is fiction and emotional manipulation at its worst,” she said .
However, the reaction to the show — and particularly the hard to watch scenes like this one — show it is having the desired impact for filmmakers.
A behind the scenes segment (seen above) shows the impact it had on filmmakers.
“There’s probably two or three hundred dead walrus on probably a half-mile stretch of beach here,” a cameraman explains through tears.
“They’re exhausted because they’re having to swim a hundred miles now to get to food and then coming back here because it’s the only place to sleep,” he says.
“They used to sleep on the ice and dive down, eat the food and sleep on the ice.
“And now they’re swimming a hundred miles, coming to this place and climbing cliffs, getting exhausted and falling down and either being killed falling or crushing each other because there’s several thousands crammed onto little tiny bits of beaches.”

UK grocery store Waitrose pulls its Easter chocolate duckling trio amid racism complaints,www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/waitrose-easter-chocolate-ducklings,"The ""Waitrose Trio of Chocolate Easter Ducklings"" contained a white chocolate duckling named “Fluffy,” a milk chocolate duckling named “Crispy” and a dark chocolate duckling named “Ugly.” The grocery store took action to remove the packaging that named each of the chocolate Easter treats after one Twitter post went viral. On March 7, Livia A. Aliberti posted a picture of the trio’s packaging, questioning why the darkest duckling had to be named “Ugly” out of “thousands of other options.”
“Overheard women saying ‘this is not right’, I agree, doesn’t look good at all,” Aliberti wrote.
Waitrose said in a statement to CNN that the company removed the product from sale several weeks ago in order to redesign the packaging. The chocolate trio is back on sale, available for purchase in packaging without names for the ducklings.
""We are very sorry for any upset caused by the name of this product, it was absolutely not our intention to cause any offense,"" the statement said.
The name for the darkest duckling was a reference to the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale ""The Ugly Duckling"" in which a bullied young duckling feels out of place before developing into a beautiful swan.
Aliberti returned to Twitter Tuesday to thank Waitrose for changing its “outdated” packaging.
“Thank you #waitrose for changing the packaging. Ref to the 50s tale was a tad outdated,” she wrote. “Thank you to those who contributed w comments: change happens when something is brought out into the open and discussed.”

"Alarming rise in children taken to the ER with suicidal thoughts or attempts, analysis finds",www.foxnews.com,Hollie McKay,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-analysis-alarming-rise-in-children-taken-to-the-er-with-suicidal-thoughts-or-attempts,"The report, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics and based on data extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, concluded that diagnoses of suicide-related behavior of children aged between 5 and 18 burgeoned from 580,000 in 2007 to 1.12 million in 2015 – marking an uptick of 2.17 percent of all visits to 3.5 percent in the eight-year period. The average age of the child sampled for data collection was 13, but some 43 percent of those taken to the ER with suicidal attempts or tendencies were between 5 and 11 years old.
“The trend of increased rates of suicide ideation and suicidal thoughts amongst the most precious of our society is more than alarming: it is also disheartening,” Dr. Melanie Burkholder, a Board Certified Counselor, told Fox News.
While the causes of the chilling increase are hard to precisely pinpoint, medical professionals say the problem is varied – but not entirely surprising.
“To think that the children are so stressed due to things like academic achievement, social stressors – like social media & cyberbullying on the rise – combined with parents who are disconnected from their kids but plugged-in to their devices, it’s no wonder we are seeing a rise in this in our emergency rooms,” Burkholder continued.
Depression continues to plague America's youth (iStock)
Dr. Dominic Gaziano, Director at Body & Mind Medical Center in Chicago, concurred that the new analysis signifies a “multifaceted problem,” but a problem he said is largely driven by isolation and an inadequate healthcare system.
“Being on the screens about 10 hours a day on average excluding school does not leave time to develop good communication skills and stress management skills they need for their life,” Gaziano said. “The other difficulty is that teenagers and young adults when they need psychiatric or other help it’s very hard to get mental health appointments in our health care system.”
In addition, Florida-based Dr. Dena Grayson pointed out, “kids are feeling more stress and pressure to succeed, which may come in part from increased stress felt by their parents that is passed to their children.”
And the suicidal struggles plaguing the young may very well continue to worsen.
“This trend is very alarming and I do foresee the numbers of ER admissions for suicidal thoughts increasing,” noted George Livengood, assistant national director of operations at the Discovery Mood and Anxiety Program. “But there may be a positive side to all of this, which is that parents are now listening to their children more than ever before and are focused on getting them to express their feelings. Parents today are more in tune with their kids and less likely to minimize their distress and take it seriously.”
However, it’s not only the mental health of America’s children that is continuing to be a growing cause for concern.
Last week, the American College of Emergency Physicians ( ACEP ) further discerned – based on CDC data – that more than 5.5 million patients nationwide visited the emergency department with a “primary mental disorder,” and around 2.4 million were tended to by a mental health professional in the emergency area.

Macy was straight-faced as he hopped on his motorcycle Monday — just as his wife, Felicity Huffman , agreed to plead guilty in the college admission cheating scam and announced that she had ""deep regret"" and ""shame"" over what she had done. The 69-year-old actor was spotted wearing dark pants, a white button-down shirt and shades as he walked outside of Los Angeles' Century City Mall after his wife released an apology, according to People . Paparazzi images, which were obtained by the magazine, show Macy traveling through a parking garage before speeding off on his bike Monday afternoon.
Before hitting the road, Macy covered up in a brown jacket, riding gloves and a white helmet.
Many social media users were quick to speculate about his state of mind at that moment.
""He looks stressed,"" one Twitter user observed.
""Please be kind,"" another pleaded.
""He doesn’t seem warm and fuzzy. Prob doesn’t really phase him about her sitch. Sadly,"" a third user claimed.
The Department of Justice revealed on Monday that Huffman was one of 11 defendants, who was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud and agreed to plead guilty pursuant to plea agreements.
Huffman was accused of paying $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation so her daughter could take part in an apparently rigged college entrance exam. Court documents stated that a cooperating witness met with Huffman and Macy at their Los Angeles home and explained to them that he ""controlled"" a testing center and could have someone secretly alter her daughter's answers. The person told investigators the couple agreed to the plan. Macy has not been charged in the alleged scheme.
In an emotional — and lengthy — statement on Monday , Huffman expressed regret over her actions.

A small group of protesters and supporters gathered Thursday April 4, 2019 outside the embassy in London where Assange has resided for 12 years. (AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File) QUITO, Ecuador – Ecuador is reminding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange once again that he can't stay indefinitely in the nation's London embassy. Foreign Minister Jose Valencia told Teleamazonas Tuesday that a permanent stay wouldn't be good for Assange's ""state of mind, his health.""
He said that if Assange were to appear before the British justice system he'd be guaranteed a fair trial and right to a defense.
London's Metropolitan Police force said last week that officers would be obliged to execute an active warrant for Assange's arrest if he were to leave.
Assange also fears the possibility of extradition to the U.S. for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic cables through WikiLeaks.
Assange has lived in Ecuador's embassy for over six years and relations with his host country have grown increasingly tense. Trending in World "

""Time to show some humility Lori. You may be wealthy but no one, not even Aunt Becky, is above the law.. #fromfullhousetothebighouse #CollegeAdmissionsScandal #LoriLoughlin,"" another individual tweeted , referring to Loughlin&apos;s character on ""Full House.""
Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli, 55, are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as crew team recruits, even though neither of them played the sport.
A rep for Loughlin did not immediately return Fox News&apos; request for comment. She and her husband appeared in a Boston federal court briefly last week and were not asked to enter a plea. The couple has not publicly commented on the allegations.

More than four dozen people have been charged in the nationwide scam , which is alleged to have placed students in top-tier schools like Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, the University of Southern California, UCLA and the University of Texas. A federal investigation into the matter – dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" – has been ongoing for more than a year.
On Monday, fellow actress Felicity Huffman , 12 other parents and a coach agreed to plead guilty — signaling an escalation in the case against the parents who are continuing to fight the allegations against them. Huffman, 56, announced her decision to plead guilty, explaining that she accepts ""full responsibility"" for her actions .

The Latest: Fiance describes night Justine Damond died,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/the-latest-fiance-describes-night-justine-damond-died,"3:30 p.m. The fiance of an unarmed woman shot and killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2017 sobbed as he described hearing the news that she had died.
Don Damond was the first witness called by prosecutors in the trial of Mohamed Noor, who shot and killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond. She called 911 to report a possible assault behind her home and was shot minutes after she approached Noor&apos;s squad car.
Don Damond was in Las Vegas when he got a call from investigators saying Justine was dead. He says he learned from a second call that she had been shot by an officer.
Damond said calling Justine&apos;s family in Australia to tell them of her death was the ""worst phone call"" he&apos;s ever had to make. Members of her family also cried in the courtroom Tuesday as Damond testified.
Justine Damond had taken her fiance&apos;s last name professionally before their marriage. She died a month before their scheduled wedding.

1:10 p.m.
The defense attorney for a former Minneapolis police officer on trial in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman in 2017 says his client drew his gun to protect his partner and himself.
During opening statements Tuesday, Mohamed Noor&apos;s attorney, Peter Wold, told jurors the fatal shooting of Justine Ryszcyk Damond was a ""perfect storm with tragic consequences.""
Wold said that as Noor and his partner were responding to Damond&apos;s report of possible rape behind her home, they saw a bicyclist and heard a ""bang."" He says that in Noor&apos;s mind it was a classic setup for what could have been an ambush.
Noor, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in the death of Damond, a 40-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia.
Prosecutors charged Noor with second-degree intentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, saying there was no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force.

11:30 a.m.
A prosecutor says just 1 minute and 19 seconds passed from the time an unarmed woman hung up from a cellphone conversation with her fiance to the time she lay on the ground dying from a gunshot fired by a Minneapolis police officer.
That officer, Mohamed Noor, is on trial in Hennepin County accused of murder and manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. The 40-year-old was shot after calling police to report a possible rape in the alley behind her home. Damond told her fiance in a phone call that police had arrived to take her report.
Noor and his partner were in a squad car in the alley. During opening statements Tuesday, prosecutor Patrick Lofton told jurors that Noor fired his gun across his partner through the driver&apos;s side open window without saying a word. Lofton says there&apos;s no forensic evidence that Damond touched the police vehicle before being shot.
The defense is expected to argue that Noor acted in self-defense.

11 a.m.
The judge hearing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman has reversed a ban on what video evidence may be viewed by the media and public.
Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Tuesday that body camera video introduced as evidence in the murder trial of Mohamed Noor will be shown to the entire courtroom.
Quaintance had earlier said such video would be shown only to the jury, citing a desire to protect the privacy of the victim, Justine Ruszczyk Damond.
Quaintance said she has to follow the law even if she disagrees with it.
Noor shot Damond when she approached his squad care minutes after calling 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home. The video doesn&apos;t capture the shooting but shows efforts to save Damond.
___
Midnight
With a jury in place, opening statements are set to begin Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman.
Thirty-three-year-old Mohamed Noor, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Justine Ruszczyk Damond&apos;s death. Damond, a 40-year-old dual Australian-American citizen who was white, was killed in July 2017 after calling 911 to report a possible rape near her home.
It took a week to select a jury. After 75 prospective jurors answered questions about their views on Somalis and police officers, as well as their experiences with firearms and other issues, 12 men and four women were selected Monday to hear the case. In the end, only 12 will deliberate.
Six of the jurors are people of color.

Maryland van attack plot suspect held without bond after prosecutors say he'd kill if released,www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/rondell-henry-maryland-van-attack-plot-suspect-held-without-bond,"They said 28-year-old Rondell Henry planned to mow down innocent people using a U-Haul van at National Harbor in an ISIS-inspired attack similar to 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, France. Federal prosecutors said that Henry felt his was a “noble cause” when he decided to steal a van and drive it to Dulles International Airport in Virginia on March 27.
Federal prosecutors said a man inspired by the Islamic State group stole a U-Haul truck with plans to drive it into a crowd at National Harbor, a convention and tourist destination just outside the nation's capital. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)
Officials said he wanted to ram his vehicle into “disbelievers” and keep “driving and driving and driving” but when he was unable to make it past airport security, he turned his attention to National Harbor.
Court documents revealed that Henry allegedly intruded onto a boat and hid overnight. By the following morning, March 28, police officers had discovered the location of the stolen U-Haul. When Henry jumped over the security fence from the boat dock, observant Prince George’s County Police officers arrested him.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas DiGirolamo ruled in favor of federal prosecutors who argued that Henry might flee or be a risk to the community if freed.
Public defender Michael CiteraManis said there was reason to be ""suspicious"" of the government&apos;s story, and he believed his client&apos;s rights had been violated.
Henry was charged with driving a stolen vehicle across state lines, which carries up to 10 years in prison, but prosecutors were expected to seek additional charges.

Last WWII ‘Doolittle Raider’ dies at 103,www.foxnews.com,Talia Kaplan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/last-wwii-doolittle-raider-dies-at-103,"The president of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders Association told T he Air Force Times that Cole died in San Antonio on Tuesday morning with his son and daughter by his side. Cole, originally from Dayton, Ohio , was mission commander Jimmy Doolittle&apos;s co-pilot in the 1942 bombing attack less than five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The bold raid on Japan is credited with providing the United States with a morale boost and helping turn the tide of the war in the Pacific.
""I think the main thing was that you had to go in with a positive attitude,"" Cole said in September of the against-the-odds mission. ""I really didn&apos;t worry about it. It was our job, and we knew what to expect.""
In 2015, the Raiders, including Cole, were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal for their ""outstanding heroism, valor, skill and service to the United States.""
Cole parachuted to safety, and he and other Raiders were helped by Chinese partisans. But seven crewmembers died – three were killed during the mission; three others were captured and executed, and one died in captivity.
In 2015, Cole’s book about his service called “Dick Cole’s War: Doolittle Raider, Hump Pilot, Air Commando (American Military Experience)” was published. Proceeds from the book go to a scholarship fund in Doolittle’s name for students in the aviation field, according to Fox 13 .
Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan tweeted Tuesday: “Our Nation has lost a legend. Our thoughts are with the family of Lt. Col. Dick Cole, the last of the Doolittle Raiders, who passed away at age 103. He was a true trailblazer, and his selfless legacy of service lives on in our Airmen of today and tomorrow.”
A memorial service is being scheduled at Joint Base San Antonio. Cole will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Google and Goodwill ramp up effort to provide job seekers with digital skills,www.foxnews.com,James Rogers,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/google-and-goodwill-ramp-up-effort-to-provide-job-seekers-with-digital-skills,"YouTube stream for hearing on white nationalism flooded with hateful comments
Google and Goodwill are ramping up an initiative offering digital skills training to job seekers.
Last year the tech giant joined forces with Goodwill to launch the Goodwill Digital Career Accelerator. The project aims to “jump-start” career opportunities for 1.2 million people by 2021, according to Google.
Backed by a three-year, $10 million grant from Google’s charitable arm, Google.org, the program is currently active in 93 Goodwill locations across 34 states. Another 33 Goodwill sites will be added to the effort in 2019, according to Google.
There were 7.1 million job openings in the US on the last day of February, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Tuesday. Advanced skills such as computer support or programming are increasingly essential for many well-paying jobs, according to Google.
One year into the project, the organizations have helped 27,682 job seekers find employment, according to a new report from Google and Goodwill. Some 252,025 job seekers have improved their digital skills, with 16,398 people learning software skills and 1,261 job seekers acquiring mid-level and occupation-specific skills.
“In just over a year since we began our work with Goodwill to launch the Goodwill Digital Career Accelerator, 27,000 Americans have found a job and a quarter million more have gained digital skills that they need to succeed,” said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, in a statement provided to Fox News. “We’ve also learned important lessons about making digital job training effective that we’ll build on as we continue our efforts to bring opportunity to everyone across the country.”
“The Goodwill Digital Career Accelerator helps job seekers and mid-career professionals attain the skills they need to find work and enhance their earnings potential,” said Steven C. Preston, CEO of Goodwill Industries International, in a statement provided to Fox News. “Thanks to the early success of this program, Goodwill and Google.org are extending its reach to workers across the country as we aim to train more than 1.25 million workers with the digital skills needed to succeed in today’s job market and prepare for the changing workforce.”
The effort is supported by over 1,000 Google volunteers and seven Google employees who are working full-time at Goodwill. Share this:"
UN to help human rights training of Mexico's National Guard,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-to-help-human-rights-training-of-mexicos-national-guard,"High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet said that her office will offer technical assistance to ensure that Mexico&apos;s new security force respects human rights. ""Experience shows us that you can&apos;t have security without full respect for human rights and you can&apos;t enjoy human rights without security,"" Bachelet said.
U.N. human rights experts had been outspoken in their criticism of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador&apos;s efforts to reform the constitution to give the military a formal role in the country&apos;s policing. He eventually agreed to place the National Guard under the civilian public safety minister, but has insisted that it will be led by an active duty military officer.
López Obrador said he will name the force&apos;s commander Thursday. It will initially be made up of military police from the army and navy, as well as some federal police, but recruitment is underway.
Mexico is coming off its most murderous year in at least the past 20. Previous administrations used the army and marines to combat the drug cartels in many parts of the country after determining that local police forces were hopelessly corrupt. Human rights abuses ensued by soldiers not trained for police work, from torture to extrajudicial killings.
López Obrador took office in December ready to scrap the Federal Police, which he said never came together as expected and replace it with the National Guard. The leftist president has lavished praise on Mexico&apos;s military, surprising some, insisting that only the military has the necessary discipline and respect of the public to get a handle on the country&apos;s internal security.
""We are going to carry out this change to guarantee security without violating human rights,"" López Obrador said. ""We want Mexico to open to international observation.""
Bachelet sidestepped questions about the essentially militarized nature of the new National Guard, whose officers will apparently be given military training and be under military discipline.
Bachelet said ""the creation of the National Guard could open the opportunity to create a new civilian police force capable of fighting the overwhelming challenge of organized crime,"" without explaining how.
Bachelet called Mexico&apos;s crime numbers ""terrifying,"" noting ""Mexico has numbers of violent deaths worthy of a nation at war; 252,538 since 2006.""
She also mentioned the murders of nine human rights activists and four journalists so far in 2019, coming on top of a dozen journalists murdered each year in 2018 and 2017.
Bachelet said the U.N. would be willing to help Mexico integrate its forensic files on the country&apos;s 40,000 missing people, and strengthen its capacity to find clandestine graves and identify bodies.

Kim Jong Un's bizarre North Korea propaganda photos,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/kim-jong-uns-bizarre-north-korea-propaganda-photos,"Last Update 1 day ago Kim Jong Un's bizarre North Korea propaganda photos Kim Jong Un’s most bizarre claims From yachting champion to mountaineer, North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un has claimed he’s done it all Whether at a lubricant factory, orphanage, potato company or fish-pickling plant, Kim Jong Un has conducted sporadic visits to odd and quirky North Korean sites throughout the years. Through the years, Kim has visited several companies, including a “newly-remodeled” Pyongyang Teacher Training College and trackless trolley factory, around the regime’s capital to provide ""field guidance,"" according to North Korean propaganda. The despot is often photographed with a massive grin and interacting with factory workers as several officials stand in the background taking notes -- about something -- during the visit. The only details released about the trips come through the official state news agency, KCNA.
Kim usually includes praise for the workers.
At times, he’s joined by his rarely-seen wife, Ri Sol Ju, and his sister, Kim Yo Jong, with the women often seen peering at glass cases of beauty products or standing -- smiling -- behind the despot.
Here are some of the more bizarre photos of Kim during his visits. 2013 to 2016: Kim at a foodstuff factories

Kim was photographed visiting foodstuff factories several times since assuming power in 2011. He inspected biscuits at Foodstuff Factory No. 354 in 2013 while officials took notes behind him. The leader visited Pyongyang Chidren’s Foodstuff Factory in 2014 wearing a large furry hat and lab coat while holding a package of food. Another visit in 2015 had him giggling in front of a glass case of packaged food.

Trump tax returns center stage at Capitol Hill hearings,www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tax-returns-center-stage-at-capitol-hill-hearings,"Following the formal request by House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal , D-Mass., for copies of the last six years of the president’s tax returns, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig visited Capitol Hill, where they faced questions about when – and if – Trump’s returns would be handed over the Congress. Fielding questions from the House Appropriations Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee, Retting said that the final decision came down to him – with Mnuchin’s supervision.
Rettig told a House panel Tuesday that the IRS was preparing a response to last week&apos;s letter from Neal.
During the 2016 campaign, Rettig defended Trump&apos;s decision to break with decades of tradition by refusing to release his tax filings. Under questioning at his confirmation hearing last August, Rettig pledged to uphold the political independence of the IRS.
Earlier in the day, Mnuchin told the House Appropriations Committee that his department intends to ""follow the law"" and is reviewing the request to hand over the returns.
Video Mnuchin also revealed that Treasury Department lawyers have talked to the White House counsel&apos;s office about releasing Trump&apos;s returns, telling lawmakers that the consultations occurred before the request arrived last week. Mnuchin said the conversations were ""purely informational,"" and he has not been briefed on their content.
But Mnuchin told a House panel that he has had no communication with the president or his top staff about the department&apos;s decision on whether to provide Trump&apos;s tax returns.
""It is our intent to follow the law and that is in the process of being reviewed,"" Mnuchin told a House Appropriations subcommittee with responsibility for his budget.
Tuesday’s hearings come just two days after acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told ""Fox News Sunday"" in an exclusive interview that Democrats would ""never"" see President Trump&apos;s tax returns.
""That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.""
Video Mulvaney added that Democrats know they won&apos;t get the returns, and ""just want attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy."" A fundamental purpose of tax law, Mulvaney continued, is to protect the privacy of tax filers.
""If they don&apos;t get what they want in the Mueller report, they&apos;re going to ask for the taxes,"" Mulvaney said. ""If they don&apos;t get what they want in the taxes, they&apos;re going to ask for something else. It doesn&apos;t surprise anybody.""
In framing his request for the filings, Neal relied on a 1924 statute that says the Treasury Department ""shall furnish"" them when requested. The IRS is part of Treasury.
Video Trump has broken with tradition by not voluntarily releasing his tax returns. He routinely says — as he did Friday — that he&apos;s under routine audit and therefore won&apos;t release his returns. But IRS officials have said that taxpayers under audit are free to release their filings anyway.
