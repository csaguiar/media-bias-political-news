North Korean Ship Seized for Violating Sanctions | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/north-korean-ship-seized-for-violating-sanctions/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter May 9, 2019 1:02 PM Kim Jong-un gives field guidance to the newly-built Pyongyang City Mushroom Farm in an undated photo released by the Korean Central News Agency, January 10, 2015.

U.S. authorities have seized a North Korean ship that was transporting coal in violation of international sanctions, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.
The North Korean ship, the Wise Honest , is the first seized by U.S. authorities over sanctions violations. It is now approaching U.S. territorial waters accompanied by the U.S. Marshals and Coast Guard. “This sanctions-busting ship is now out of service,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers said in announcing the seizure. U.S. banks, unaware of the Wise Honest ‘s home port, financed its servicing and equipment, according to the Department of Justice. A civil complaint seeking the ship’s forfeiture was filed in the Southern District of New York on Thursday after the ship was taken into U.S. custody. The complaint indicates that a warrant was issued for the seizure in July 2018, after Indonesian authorities seized the ship and convicted its North Korean captain of “offenses related to improper documentation for the ship.” The seizure comes after North Korea launched two short-range missiles early Thursday morning in its second weapons test in less than a week.
“The US and South Korean intelligence authority is conducting analysis for additional information,” the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. “Our military has currently heightened its surveillance and alertness against possible additional launches, whilst maintaining combat readiness in close coordination with the US.”"

‘Avengers: Endgame’: American Heroes Popular Worldwide | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/avengers-endgame-american-heroes-popular-worldwide/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter May 9, 2019 5:41 PM Girls take a selfie with a Captain America figure during an early premiere of The Avengers: Endgame in La Paz, Bolivia, April 24, 2019. (David Mercado/Reuters) Because they embody the America that other nations admire
T hose Americans who have traveled widely and well, instead of merely spent the odd week in Paris fretting about whether they look cool enough to hang with the locals, understand a critical point about America’s place in the world. Even when a Republican is president, foreigners don’t hate us. Overseas, people are somewhere between respectful of and awed by us. Our presence is electric, not toxic. Even the 1940s cliché about the supposed British attitude toward Yanks — “oversexed, overpaid, and over here” — betrays awe. How could Americans have so much sexual energy? How did they get so preposterously wealthy? Why couldn’t they leave Britain to its soggy self instead of rubbing its collective nose in all of this? Advertisement Advertisement
Polls designed to reassure American progressives, in times of Republican presidencies, that “our image is suffering irreparable harm overseas” are really just measuring opinions about our national leadership, not our American nature. That essence doesn’t fluctuate with U.S. presidential results. It remains consistently impressive worldwide: Others admire our swagger, our friendliness, our purchasing power. During a period of what American liberals imagined must have been a difficult time for an American to be in France, I spent a lot of time in that country in the years following 9/11 and during the Iraq War and never experienced even the slightest hint of anti-American sentiment. If you want bitter animosity toward America, head for an American college campus, not France. For all of the Left’s yelping back home about anti-French propaganda and those fabled “freedom fries,” what gravely concerned the French was not Washington’s diplomatic problems with Paris but the steep drop-off in tourism after 9/11. The French love America because we come and spend our dollars there. America’s post-9/11 funk was their funk. When America sneezes, the world catches cold. The world is rooting for us.
Which brings me to The Avengers: Endgame , the world’s new favorite movie. It’s about to break the record for worldwide box-office gross (in nominal dollars, at least). The traits of the superhero all-star team are unmistakably American: Iron Man embodies America’s tech dynamism and Silicon Valley arrogance, Doctor Strange is the emblem of our amazing medical advances, and Black Panther personifies America’s long, fraught history of race animosity turned proud multiculturalism. When Tony Stark has some rude thoughts about Captain America’s derriere, Scott Lang corrects him: “As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass.” Just so. Captain America has America’s ass. He’s also got America’s heart and his brawn, his impossible boy-scout goodness. What other country could give the world an equivalent to Captain America? Captain Ecuador? Captain Russia? Captain Azerbaijan? To a certain extent, James Bond is Captain England, but that example highlights the differences, doesn’t it? 007 is not a crusading knight. He is a cynic, not a choirboy. Bond is to Captain America what Humphrey Bogart is to James Stewart. Advertisement
The Hulk, meanwhile, bears comparison to American foreign policy: Emotions can get the better of him. He doesn’t always think things through. When the Hulk does a lot of damage, though, it’s in the service of doing what’s right. He is a bit sloppy but he is also benevolent. You want him to be on your side, not to go away. The world would be less safe without him. Advertisement
The motley nature of the team channels the spirit of e pluribus unum. Nick Fury’s gang are ethnically diverse, an assortment drawn from every corner of the galaxy. The way the Avengers embody American openness to outsiders mirrors the American story, just as the might of the Avengers within the film equates with the cultural hegemony of the country that made it. Thanks to filmed entertainment, American dominates world culture in much the same way its military might reigned supreme in 1945. Advertisement"
Trump Administration's Iran Policy and Sanctions Successful | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Fred Fleitz,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/iran-tensions-american-foreign-policy-sanctions/,"May 9, 2019 6:17 PM The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln transits the Atlantic Ocean in January. (Mass Communication Specialist Third Class Clint Davis/US Navy) Tehran's new threats are a sign that U.S. policy is working.
O ver the weekend, the White House announced it was sending an aircraft-carrier strike group and bombers to the Middle East in response to “troubling and escalatory indications and warnings” related to Iran. These warnings reportedly were Israeli intelligence reports indicating Iran was planning attacks against U.S. personnel and allies in the Middle East. Advertisement
Press reports differed on the nature of the planned Iranian attacks. There were reports that Iranian officials gave a green light to its terrorist proxies to attack U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Syria. Other reports said Iran planned to orchestrate drone attacks in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. There also was a report that Iran had moved short-range ballistic missiles by boat in waters off its shores.
There has been speculation that Iran was planning these attacks in retaliation for damage done to the Iranian economy by sanctions the U.S. reimposed after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA). These attacks may also have been planned in response to the Trump administration’s recent designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization.
President Trump’s critics are claiming that a surge in tensions with Iran in response to his withdrawal from the JCPOA prove the U.S. withdrawal from this agreement was a mistake and increased the threat from Iran. But the facts suggest otherwise. Iran is desperately trying to reverse the effects of President Trump’s successful Iran policy, known as the maximum-pressure strategy. Advertisement
The Trump administration recently toughened its sanctions against Iran. Last month it ended exemptions to oil sanctions. Nuclear sanctions also have been strengthened, including a demand that Iran cease uranium enrichment. Yesterday, the Trump administration extended U.S. sanctions on Iran’s steel, aluminum, copper and iron sectors. Advertisement
The Obama administration told the American people that the JCPOA would improve relations with Iran and bring it into the international community. However, Iran’s behavior actually worsened after the JCPOA, especially with its decision to send troops to Syria. President Trump decided not to rely on the weak nuclear deal to restrain Iranian behavior and protect American interests in the region. Reminiscent of President Reagan’s “Peace through Strength” dictum, the deployment of military forces is a show of U.S. force to prevent hostilities, not to start a war with Iran.
In addition, although European governments still oppose President Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA and new U.S. sanctions against Iran, European corporations are honoring U.S. sanctions and have left Iran in droves, including Air France, British Airways, KLM, Total, Siemens, and Volkswagen. Advertisement
Iranian president Hassan Rouhani announced yesterday that in response to European companies’ cooperating with reimposed U.S. sanctions, Iran will soon violate elements of the JCPOA by increasing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water, which is needed for a plutonium-producing reactor. Rouhani also said Iran would increase uranium enrichment above the limit of 3.67 percent enriched uranium set by the JCPOA if European firms do not cease honoring U.S. sanctions. Rouhani’s threats to withdraw from the nuclear deal probably will further dissuade European companies from doing business in Iran. Advertisement
Rouhani’s threats to partially withdraw from the JCPOA will have a negligible effect on Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons because the agreement is so weak. The nuclear deal already allows Iran to pursue nuclear-weapons-related activities, permitting it to enrich uranium with 5,000 centrifuge machines while the agreement is in effect. Its inspection provisions are likewise very weak and Iran has violated them by not permitting inspections of military sites. Iran also has refused to fully account for its past nuclear-weapons work.
Israeli intelligence discovered last year from a trove of Iranian documents (the “Iran nuclear archive”) the existence of a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran that may have contained 300 tons of equipment and 15 kilograms of radioactive material. Rouhani’s threats are therefore absurd because he is threatening to withdraw from an ineffective nuclear agreement that Iran is already cheating on. Advertisement
Iran’s attempt to blackmail Europe over President Trump’s withdrawal from the JCPOA is also likely to backfire. An EU statement issued today said “We reject any ultimatums and we will assess Iran’s compliance on the basis of Iran’s performance regarding its nuclear-related commitments.” Rouhani’s ultimatum will alienate European leaders who were already concerned about Iran’s belligerent behavior, including its troop presence in Syria, meddling in Iraq and Yemen, and sponsorship of terrorism.
In response to Iranian assassination squads operating in Europe to kill Iranian dissidents, the European Union imposed sanctions on Iran in January 2019, the first EU sanctions since the JCPOA was implemented. The EU is also considering sanctioning Iran over its ballistic-missile tests. Rouhani’s blackmail threat and new reports that Iran is planning attacks against U.S. interests in the Middle East could push Europe closer to the Trump administration. Advertisement
Iran’s recent threats and alleged plans to attack U.S. interests reflect the success of President Trump’s maximum-pressure strategy on Iran. U.S. sanctions have isolated Iran and deprived its ruling mullahs of funds to spend on the military, terrorism, and meddling in regional disputes. The sanctions also have caused Iran’s oil exports to drop to about 1.3 million barrels a day, down from 2.8 million before the U.S. left the JCPOA. Iran’s oil exports probably will drop much further due to the Trump administration’s recent decision to end all exemptions to U.S. oil sanctions. Iran’s economy is expected to shrink by 6 percent in 2019 after having shrunk 3.9 percent in 2018. Inflation could reach 50 percent this year. Advertisement
At the same time, President Trump remains open to dialogue with Iranian leaders. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a list of twelve U.S. requirements for a new agreement with Iran on nuclear and regional issues in a May 2018 speech at the Heritage Foundation. So far, Iranian officials have shown no interest in dialogue with the U.S. and are sticking to hostile rhetoric to divide and threaten America."
Movie Review: ‘Tolkien’ Is Pretentious and Banal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/tolkien-movie-pretentious-banal/,"May 10, 2019 6:30 AM Nicholas Hoult as J.R.R. Tolkien in Tolkien (David Appleby/Twentieth Century Fox) It reduces J. R. R.’s life to fantasy fodder and cliché, while downplaying his Catholicism and injecting PC pieties.
T he new movie Tolkien , about British scholar John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings books, feels sketchy as a bio-pic, but it’s almost a full-blown sequel to the Peter Jackson serial (2001–2003) that altered Millennials’ movie expectations. Turning Tolkien’s life story into fantasy distraction — the childhood perspective — is the film’s paramount aim. Advertisement
Going from impecunious circumstances to a university academic, Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult plays the young-adult scenes) befriends several Oxford schoolmates, and the luxuries of their privileged clique encourage his own idiosyncrasies — the hermetic development of a personal language system that eventually became the basis for conceiving “Middle Earth” and the medieval realm of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings .
Most bio-pics that depict how famous people achieved success are sold as inspirational, but Tolkien avoids that cliché for another: It urges filmgoers to see Tolkien’s experiences (and perhaps their own) as the source for self-mythologizing flights of whimsy. His life is a mere pretext for transforming history into unreality.
The historical details of Tolkien’s poverty, social and religious influence, individual ambition, and military service during World War I are blended into evocations of Peter Jackson imagery. Finnish director Dome Karukoski and cinematographer Lasse Frank Johannessen are not fantasists, but they work in the deluxe mode of BBC realism that used to be identified with Miramax-style Anglophilia, a distinct brand of pretentious cultural fantasy. It set the fashion for indie-movie dogma that can be seen in the ways that Tolkien follows a liberal agenda: His private imagination is unrelated to any specific belief system; Edith Bratt (Lily Collins), the boarding house occupant he loves, is a budding feminist; and his Platonic friendship with Geoffrey Smith (Anthony Boyle) indicates open-minded sexual solidarity. Advertisement
It’s all analogous to the Peter Jackson franchise, making each person a stand-in for Ring figures that fans can identify: Tolkien himself is a surrogate for Bilbo Baggins and Aragorn; Bratt, for Arwen; and Smith, for Sam. That fantasy world closes in on itself, but there’s something worse than this pop cannibalization: Tolkien’s near-death WWI experiences in the trenches at the Battle of the Somme structure the film’s flashbacks and flashforwards that subordinate everything to Ring legend. Giving priority to Peter Jackson’s blockbuster doesn’t make what Tolkien lived through profound; it distorts historical and cultural reality. On the battlefield, he envisions fire-breathing dragons as if emphasis on fantasy outweighed the experience of war itself. Advertisement
All of life is seen as a boyhood tentpole adventure — from the Hobbits to Harry Potter, with the Twilight , Hunger Games , and Marvel franchises not far behind. Advertisement
By normalizing Hollywood pandering in this way, the filmmakers erase our cultural foundations: Tolkien and Bratt argue that “words without meaning are just sound,” using as examples “trees,” “cellar door,” and “hands,” yet the latter never inspires Karukoski, and screenwriters David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford fail to make a culturally unifying association, such as to Shakespeare’s “let lips do what hands do” (from Romeo and Juliet ). The English language itself is never used romantically. Hoult and Collins are both pretty, but their characterizations need fervor beyond pubescence — such as the way Kate Bush’s sensual, ghostly, utterly English update of “Wuthering Heights” gave pop-culture force to myth.
Such force is missing when Bratt’s passion for Richard Wagner is reduced to playing dress-up backstage at a performance of The Ring Cycle . She describes Wagner as “an agent of emotion,” yet the first stirring strains of the The Ring Cycle overpower everything in this movie — why should children be encouraged to seek out anything less? Advertisement
Tolkien’s Catholic background also gets simplified, reduced to a surreal battlefield vision of a crucifix and a passing reference to religious prejudice. This diminishment doesn’t necessarily go against Tolkien’s stated dislike of obvious religious allegory (that’s an important difference between his books and those of friend and colleague C. S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia ), but it’s slippery-slope stuff. And the indie-movie messages that the filmmakers slip in seem designed to prevent viewers from thinking more complexly about a man’s life and his work. Advertisement"

Higher Education in America Is Failing: Why? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/higher-education-in-america-is-failing/,"About George Leef May 10, 2019 11:40 AM
According to the Left, it has gotten bigger and better and just needs more money to perform its job of properly shaping young minds.
On the other hand, Ted McAllister and Bruce Frohnen think that higher education has mostly become a costly trap for Americans. They argue their case in today’s Martin Center article .
A trap? They write:
Years (usually more than the advertised four) of indoctrination in the classroom and, more harshly, the dormitories, followed by decades of crushing debt, all made far worse by the realization that our degrees have qualified us for very little.
Furthermore, there’s the ideological twist that most students encounter on a daily basis. As the authors state:
Free inquiry has been replaced by “safe spaces” and the shouting down of anyone who speaks out against anti-Western ideologies and the cult of victimization. Bureaucracies that smack of the old Soviet Union enforce a code of political correctness infusing every aspect of university life with suspicion and resentment. Having banished all but a tiny remnant of conservatives and even most liberals from the professoriate, universities become ever more determined to undermine all aspects of American culture and higher learning.
McAllister and Frohnen hope that American higher education can be salvaged.
To reclaim higher education for our culture, and for its own proper ends, it must again be the product of local communities serving local needs. We are not saying that the large research university should be abolished. But it is long past time for American taxpayers to stop supporting its maintenance, let alone its expansion. We currently spend billions of dollars subsidizing a system that rewards ideological malpractice, seeking to undermine our way of life as it enriches a few top administrators, enables self-indulgence among all too many professors, allows educrats to hector and indoctrinate our young people, and fails to serve our common interests.
I’d say that hits the nail squarely on the head."
Robert Mueller Report: Ex-Australian Diplomat On Why He Turned Papadapoulos Info over to FBI | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/ex-australian-diplomat-explains-why-he-turned-papadapoulos-info-over-to-fbi/,"May 10, 2019 12:43 PM George Papadopoulos leaves after his sentencing hearing at U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., September 7, 2018. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)
During a Thursday interview on Sky News, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer explained his decision to turn over to the FBI information about George Papadopoulos that eventually prompted an investigation into the Trump campaign.
Two month after meeting with Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, in May 2016, Downer, then serving as Australia’s ambassador to the U.K., sent a memo to the FBI in which he relayed Papadopoulos’s claim that Russian intelligence planned to release damaging information about Hillary Clinton ahead of the election.
“I don’t know why he told me this, but he did, and we reported it. And the rest is history,” Downer said. “There’s no defense for him saying it’s some sort of weird conspiracy. I mean, it’s what he told me.”
“I have no idea why he was blabbering this, but if you say that sort of thing to somebody who is part of the Five Eyes intelligence community, I mean I would regard myself as a warrior for the Western alliance,” said Downer, seemingly pushing back on Papadopoulos’s claim that he was sent to ensnare the young campaign aide as part of a coordinated Western intelligence operation.
The memo, which served as a pretext for the opening of an investigation into the Trump campaign, did not indicate that Papadapolous or anyone else on the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russia to obtain the information, Downer said.
“There was no suggestion — [neither] from Papadopoulos nor in the record of the meeting that we sent back to Canberra — there was no suggestion that there was collusion between Donald Trump or Donald Trump’s campaign and the Russians,” Downer said.
“All we did is report what Papadopoulos said, and that was that he thought that the Russians may release information, might release information, that could be damaging to Hillary Clinton’s campaign at some stage before the election,” he continued.
Papadopoulos, who was living in London at the time, was introduced to Downer by Australian diplomat Erika Thompson, who also attended the meeting in which he and Downer allegedly discussed the Russians’ plan to damage Clinton. Papadopoulos has publicly speculated that Downer was working with Joseph Mifsud — a Maltese academic who reached out to him claiming to have access to damaging information about Clinton — to entrap him and damage the Trump campaign.
Papadopoulos was also contacted in September 2016 by Stefan Halper, an FBI informant who offered him $3,000 to write a policy paper on the natural-gas market in the Mediterranean.
Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers last month that he has formed a team to examine whether the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign was properly predicated, addressing top Republicans’ concerns that the probe was motivated by political bias.

Chuck Schumer and Bob Casey Eat Their Own | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Carrie Severino,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/chuck-schumer-bob-casey-eat-their-own/,"About Carrie Severino May 10, 2019 10:50 AM Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D., N.Y., speaks after a Democratic policy lunch on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., January 29, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
On Wednesday the Senate confirmed Judge Joseph Bianco to be President Trump’s 38th judge of the United States Courts of Appeals. Since 2006, Judge Bianco has served as a U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York, where he was confirmed by voice vote and with the support of Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) fourteen years ago. Once so noncontroversial that he did not even require a recorded vote, Judge Bianco somehow managed to become so controversial in the intervening years that he was confirmed this week by a near party-line vote. Controversial on what basis? Because Senator Schumer says so.
Indeed, without citing any evidence whatsoever and ignoring Judge Bianco’s “well-qualified” rating from the American Bar Association, Schumer issued the following statement after Bianco and fellow Second Circuit nominee Michael Park were voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee along party lines in March:
Another day, another partisan push by Senate Republicans for hard-right nominees to get lifetime appointments on the federal bench . . . Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans voted to advance the nominations of Michael Park and Joseph Bianco for the Second Circuit, despite objections from Senator Gillibrand and me.
The same Chuck Schumer who said in November 2005 while introducing Bianco at his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that he was a “great, great guy” and that he was “proud to support someone as outstandingly qualified and well respected as Mr. Bianco” apparently changed his mind when President Trump decided to elevate Judge Bianco to the Second Circuit. Just another day in the Senate Democrats’ obstruct-at-all-costs approach to judicial nominations, a resistance effort that has only intensified since Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation battle.
Judge Bianco’s case proves that Senate Democrats are now more than comfortable openly flaunting their disrespect for the White House’s good-faith consultation process that produced consensus circuit court nominees from states represented by Senate Democrats including Illinois (twice), Michigan, Hawaii, New Mexico, Indiana, North Dakota, and even New York, with the relatively easy confirmation of another former district judge, Richard Sullivan.
What’s more, in addition to Schumer and Senate Democrats’ post-Kavanaugh non-engagement with the White House, we are now seeing a recurring bad-faith trend regarding their treatment of sitting district judges they previously recommended to Republican presidents. District judges who were previously considered non-controversial are now assailed as partisan hacks by the same home-state Senate Democrats who helped them ascend to the bench in the first place. The latest example is current U.S. District Judge Peter Phipps , President Trump’s newest nominee to the Third Circuit announced last week. Just over a year ago, Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced Phipps to the Committee as a jointly recommended nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. With the help of Senator Toomey, Senator Casey shepherded him to a voice vote out of Committee and to a unanimous confirmation vote by the full U.S. Senate in October. In supporting his nomination to the U.S. District Court last April, Senator Casey praised Judge Phipps’s “academic record . . . experience . . . temperament . . . character, and of course . . . commitment to the rule of law. I think Peter Phipps does well on all of those criteria.” Advertisement Advertisement
What a difference a few months make. To most everyone’s surprise, within hours of Phipps’s nomination, Senator Casey took a page right out of the Schumer playbook and announced that he would oppose Phipps because he has “significant concerns about Judge Phipps’s judicial and constitutional philosophy.” Since when? Advertisement Advertisement
After law school, Judge Phipps clerked for a judge nominated by President Bill Clinton. He spent the majority of his professional life as a career trial attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice. In the seven months Phipps has served as a district judge, he has not issued any decisions on hot-button issues.
Perhaps lack of judicial experience is the issue given that Senator Casey also stated that he does not believe “six months on [the district court] bench is sufficient experience or preparation to sit on the Circuit Court of Appeals.” Of course, the fact that Cheryl Krause, President Obama’s first Pennsylvania nominee to the same court, had no judicial experience whatsoever did not stop Senator Casey from returning her blue slip and voting to support her confirmation five years ago. Thus, history teaches that Senator Casey has not required judicial experience to support a Pennsylvania nominee to the Third Circuit—at least not when the President was of his political party.
Senator Casey’s only real objection to Judge Phipps is that President Trump has nominated him to the court of appeals. While some Senate Democrats negotiated with the White House in good faith on circuit court nominees earlier in the administration, those days are clearly over. Currently there are only two circuit court vacancies without named nominees, although more vacancies are expected to arise before the 2020 election. The White House—and those who care about President Trump’s efforts to reshape the judiciary — should anticipate more gamesmanship from Senate Democrats. The Constitution grants the president alone the power to nominate judges, and as all but two past Senate Judiciary Committee chairmen have recognized, the blue slip was never intended to be a weapon to block nominees on ideological or political grounds.

Bizarre Ruling Forcing Rushed Redistricting in Ohio | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/bizarre-ruling-forcing-rushed-redistricting-in-ohio/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter May 10, 2019 11:27 AM
The state of Ohio has filed an emergency application in the Supreme Court seeking a stay of last week’s 300-page three-judge district-court ruling that invalidated Ohio’s congressional districting map as an unconstitutional “partisan gerrymander.” I will pass over debating the merits of that ruling here.
As Ohio points out, what is particularly bizarre about the ruling below is that the court has given Ohio’s General Assembly only until June 14 to enact a new map. That deadline is some two weeks before the end of the Supreme Court’s term, when the Court is expected to issue its redistricting decisions in Rucho v. Common Cause and Lamone v. Benisek . Those decisions could well effectively overrule the district-court’s ruling on Ohio’s map. Advertisement Advertisement
The district court’s June 14 deadline is also bizarre in light of the fact that the court has recognized that a new map adopted as late as September 20 could be used for the 2020 congressional election. Indeed, the district court purports to be “committed to working with that timeline for establishing a remedial plan.” (Opinion, p. 294.)
So why didn’t the court stay its own ruling until the Supreme Court issues its decisions in Rucho and Lamone ? Why is it pressuring the Ohio legislature to (as Ohio puts it) “waste substantial resources unnecessarily passing new legislation mere weeks before [possibly] learning that there is no need to do so”? Why did it not set a later deadline?
Ohio provides a perhaps overly delicate answer to these questions: “Unfair though it may be, a great many intelligent people on the street are likely to view the lower court’s decision as an attempt to evade or frustrate Supreme Court review.” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "
Ten Things that Caught My Eye Today May 10 2019 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/ten-things-that-caught-my-eye-today-may-10-2019/,"Follow Kathryn Jean Lopez on Twitter May 10, 2019 11:24 AM
1. For the past few days I’ve been in Louisville, Ky. at the annual summit of the Christian Alliance for Orphans . It’s a gathering of some 2,000 people from at least 44 different countries, many who lead foster-care or adoption ministries — CAFO includes more than 195 member organizations. Many of these leaders are also foster or adoptive parents as well. I can’t tell you how inspiring it is to see all of these people, who like, St. Peter, step out of the boat and trust that following Jesus is the only way to live. On Thursday, I listened to an 18-year-old, Trent Taylor, talk about how as a young child he was in five foster homes in eight years. It wasn’t until the fourth that his sexual abuse ended. “I was afraid all the time,” he said as he explained how he would sometimes be moved abruptly in the middle of the night.
I would test families because I had to know if they would give up on me or not,” he said. “I needed to know if I could trust them,” he continued. “Be compassionate with these kids. Love them. Show them that you are in this with them. My adoptive parents would cry with me. “I cry because you cry,” my mom would say to me. This was healing.
Not everyone is called to be a foster parent, but goodness are we all called to see what our role in supporting family life and their flourishing is!
2. As you’re probably aware by now, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Indiana is one of the Democrats currently running for the Democratic nomination. On Thursday he tweeted: “A woman has enough to deal with when it comes to her health care without also having to worry about male politicians telling her what she ought to do with her body. Georgia’s abortion ban is a cruel attack on women’s autonomy and freedom — one that we must continue to resist.” We really are all smarter than this. Women and men both have a responsibility to the most vulnerable unborn and their mothers.
3. Kendrick Castillo was an 18-year-old who was murdered this week in the Colorado school shooting while trying to defend his fellow classmates. Castillo, who wanted to be a Knight of Columbus just like his Dad, has been described by friends and family as a living saint who always looked out for the lost or forgotten. He died, literally laying down his life for his friends. May we all be known for such love. Advertisement

Rich : David French? Advertisement
David : Yeah I mean, I totally agree. It’s in the negative range. I mean, the idea that we’re looking at anything substantially different than what we’ve seen from previous administrations – in fights with previous administrations – I’d say the only true substantial difference we’re seeing is that this administration, this DOJ, has been extremely resistant to the precedent and being more transparent than the president himself wants. So, you know, these are guys from Sessions to Rosenstein to Whitaker to Barr who have protected the special councel and then ultimately proved to be quite transparent. So yeah, we’re in the definite negative numbers.
Rich : I’m going real high compared to you guys. I’m going to say two, just because you can see this leading to an impeachment of the president, which, you know, has happened only very rarely in our history. Advertisement

Zero: No one cares.
Five: It’s a devastating strike against his image.

CC : I think maybe a two, because there are people out there who worship Trump and think that we need business men in charge of everything and that he’s the best of all businessmen available. But I don’t think it’s going to make too much difference. If you’re at the point where you’re hero-worshiping Donald Trump, you’re probably not going to be put off by a New York Times report.

DF : 0.001. I think that there are at the very very very edges at least a few people who are engaged and interested and have a hope in mind who also think that Trump has had a record of unbroken brilliance in business who might be impacted by a report like that. But I think that that number is really really small and very much on the margins.

“She is an old white lady, who is going to try to avoid showing you her face,” Sims said of the woman from behind the camera, angling it to capture her on tape. He then harassed her for several minutes, calling her “disgusting” and “racist,” and repeating “shame on you.” At one point, he asked viewers to identify her and give her address so that he could protest outside her house.

The surprise about the big New York Times story on Donald Trump’s tax returns is that there are no real surprises.
Trump’s taxes have been an obsession of the Left since he, in violation of a longstanding norm, reneged on his promise to release his returns during the 2016 campaign.
Pieces were written urging some brave whistleblower to come forward with them, and Democrats counted as one of the advantages of taking the House that they could demand Trump’s returns. The dispute resulting from the administration’s refusal to turn them over is now probably headed to the Supreme Court."

Russiagate: Law in the Service of Partisan Politics | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-russia-investigation-partisan-politics/,"May 11, 2019 5:30 AM (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) This is an exquisitely planned political campaign.
R ussiagate has always been a political narrative masquerading as a federal investigation. Its objective, plain and simple, has been twofold: first, to hamstring Donald Trump’s capacity to press the agenda on which he ran (immigration enforcement, conservative judicial nominees, deregulation, and a military build-up, along with skepticism about military interventions, free trade, and NATO); and ultimately, to render him unelectable come autumn 2020. Advertisement Advertisement
That’s it. That’s what FBI agent Peter Strzok so aptly called the “insurance policy.”
Yes, of course, if some grievous misconduct had emerged, something so egregious that Beltway Republicans could chance the wrath of the Trump base by hopping aboard the impeachment train, Democrats might take a shot at removing the president. But that, as they say in the Green New Deal biz, was just “aspirational.”
The real work in the here and now is hardball politics: Hem Trump in. Politicize the intelligence and law-enforcement apparatus. Signal to the public through intelligence leaks and suggestive official public statements that the president was suspected of conspiring with the Kremlin. Convince Trump that using the presidency’s arsenal to fight back would just bolster the obstruction case against him. Sic a special counsel on him if he lashed out anyway. Use the investigation as a rationale for slow-walking Trump nominees and for refusing to deal with him on such critical issues as border enforcement. Drive his numbers down.
It’s working. Advertisement Advertisement
It had to have been clear to investigators as of late 2017 that there was no “collusion” case against the president — no proof of a conspiracy with the Kremlin to undermine the 2016 election.
In September 2017, five months after Robert Mueller took over the Russia investigation, the Justice Department stopped seeking surveillance warrants — i.e., it decided to stop peddling the Steele dossier to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That means the government no longer stood behind the Clinton-campaign-sponsored opposition-research screed, which alleged — based on anonymous Russian sources — that there was a Trump–Putin conspiracy to undermine the election.
In the months that followed, Mueller returned several indictments. His charges against two sets of Russians indicated that the Kremlin sought no collaboration with Americans; his charges against Trump associates had no connection to Russia.
Notwithstanding the absence of proof, though, the collusion investigation continued for over a year, until late March 2019. Is it any wonder, then, that over 40 percent of Americans continue to believe the Trump campaign was in cahoots with Moscow — even after the announcement that Mueller concluded there was no Trump–Russia conspiracy?
This is an exquisitely planned political campaign. Advertisement Advertisement
On CNN this week, Jim Comey, former director of the FBI — i.e., of the nation’s domestic security service — hinted that, the Mueller report notwithstanding, Russia may very well have leverage over the president. Last year, the former director was more expansively suggestive: The lurid dossier allegation about Trump in a Moscow hotel in 2013 with peeing prostitutes — the claim Comey had dismissed as “ salacious and unverified ” in sworn Senate testimony — might be true after all . . . he just can’t say for sure.
This is of a piece with former CIA director John Brennan’s unhinged tweeting since leaving office — the nod-and-wink exploitation of his public trust; the implication that if only you knew what he knows from having had access to top-secret information, you’d demand that Trump be removed from office.
Access to sensitive law-enforcement information and classified intelligence is a trust. It is extended with the understanding that it won’t be politicized or used to smear people.
Abuse of this privilege mirrors the most objectionable aspect of the Mueller investigation: The abuse of the criminal-justice process — converting it into a political weapon to smear a person the government has not charged with crimes. Advertisement
Understand: Congress does not need a prosecutable crime to impeach the president. If House Democrats believe the president has abused his powers so outrageously that he should be stripped of them, they have it within their power to file impeachment articles and trigger a trial in the Senate. Impeachment is a political process. It would be perfectly appropriate for all anti-Trump partisans to make the public case that the president should be removed from office.
But the anti-Trump partisans are not going that route. They know they’d lose by a humiliating margin that would strengthen the president. Advertisement
Instead, they are perverting the criminal-justice process they claim Trump has obstructed. With the transparently eager cooperation of Mueller’s team, they intimate that the president could have been charged and would have been convicted. They suggest that, although not charged, he has not been “exonerated,” effectively imposing on him the burden to establish his innocence.
I don’t want the criminal-justice system to be the prism through which we conduct politics. But if you insist on evaluating the president’s conduct as a criminal-justice issue rather than a political impeachment issue, then he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. He is entitled to have the evidence discounted (indeed, it should have been concealed) unless and until he is formally charged. He is entitled to have the burden of proof imposed entirely on the government. For current and former officials who have been involved in the investigation to refrain from charging him, publicize the evidence, and then suggest he is guilty is a willful undermining of the justice process. Advertisement
That is, they are doing what they accuse Trump of doing.
They are too smart not to know this. So there is only one conclusion to be drawn: This grandstanding has nothing to do with the law. The point has never been to make a prosecutable legal case against the president. Nor is it to pursue impeachment, though there will be plenty of talk about impeachment. The point is to place the tools of the criminal-justice process in the service of the Democrats’ 2020 political campaign."
Did Maximum Security Win the Kentucky Derby? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Todd Zywicki,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/kentucky-derby-maximum-security-disqualification-law-economics/,"About Todd Zywicki May 11, 2019 5:30 AM Luis Saez rides Maximum Security (at right) during the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., May 4, 2019. (Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports) Law and economics’ seemingly simple, but profound, insight is that legal sanctions create incentives to promote or deter certain behavior.
B y now, Americans are familiar with the controversial ending to the Kentucky Derby this weekend that resulted in 65-to-1 longshot Country House being crowned the surprise winner. After leading the race wire-to-wire, Maximum Security was disqualified after a 20-minute review by the track stewards concluded that he had improperly switched tracks in the final turn, thereby impeding the horses behind him. Advertisement Advertisement
The decision has met with widespread confusion and condemnation, including from the nation’s Chief Race Steward . So which horse should have won the race?
Law and economics can help clear the post-race fog. Law and economics’ seemingly simple, but profound, insight is that legal sanctions (such as awarding civil damages or imposing criminal punishment) create incentives to promote or deter certain behavior. Thus, if reckless drivers are held liable for the accidents they cause, then they will take more care and cause fewer accidents.
Consider the traditional distinction in tort law between strict liability and negligence. Under a strict liability regime, when A is determined to have “caused” an accident to B, then B has a right to compensation, regardless of whether A did the act intentionally or unintentionally. Under a negligence regime, by contrast, not only must A be shown to have caused the accident, B must also show that A was driving in a negligent (i.e., careless) fashion at the time, such as by driving too fast on a rainy road. Thus, even if a driver causes an accident, he is liable only if he was acting in a negligent fashion at the time.
Because the implicit goal of the common law is to deter careless and intentional behavior, negligence is the normal standard. Strict liability traditionally was relegated to unusual situations, such as abnormally dangerous activities (such as blasting) or ownership of dangerous wild animals. No matter how careful you are about trying to prevent escape by your pet tiger, you will still be liable if he mauls your neighbor. All that matters is the end effect , not your intent or whether you were negligent in forgetting to lock his cage. Advertisement Advertisement
So can law and economics tell us which horse should wear the Derby crown? Maybe.
Kentucky’s horse racing rules provide for a foul where a horse swerves in such a manner at to “interfere with, intimidate, or impede any other horse or jockey,” but only if “in the opinion of stewards,” the foul “alters the finish of the race.”
Equine experts offer two different rationales for the rule: the impact of the swerve on the results of the race and the safety of the horses and jockeys. Television commentator Simon Bray articulated the latter explanation , stating: “Do we need to have horses hit the deck to have a DQ? War of Will was close to that happening.”
Post-race coverage treated these two rationales as interchangeable. Under principles of law and economics, however, they are not. Advertisement
According to Luis Saez, Maximum Security’s jockey, the young horse was startled by the unexpected roar of 150,000 spectators as the horse rounded the final turn, almost tripping up War of Will, who was close on Maximum Security’s heels. Saez righted the horse almost immediately, but it was too late to prevent the $3 million swerve (and an additional $40 million that was wagered on Maximum Security).
If the purpose of the rule is to punish any action that impacts the result of the race regardless of the explanation, then Maximum Security’s excuse for swerving and Saez’s game efforts to minimize its effect are irrelevant. This objective points to a regime of strict liability, where all that matters is the effects of the action, not the intent or carelessness of the jockey. Advertisement"
Democrats’ Real Agenda: Impeach President Trump | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/democrats-agenda-impeach-trump/,"May 11, 2019 5:30 AM Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at a Capitol Hill press conference, February 28, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) It’s all that holds the different factions of the party together.
A nd you thought that Democrats won the House out of fear Republicans would drop coverage of preexisting conditions. That they wanted to spend this Congress addressing the cost of prescription drugs, building roads and bridges, resolving the legal status of DACA recipients, expanding gun background checks. Don’t be silly! Rashida Tlaib let spill the real Democratic agenda back in January, when she said they were going to “impeach the motherf***er.” Advertisement Advertisement
Democrats have a problem. The base wants to impeach President Trump, ASAP, but the public does not. Indeed, Trump’s approval rating is the highest it’s been in the Gallup survey, right around Obama’s at this point in his term. The brute facts of public opinion suggest that the impeachment of Trump would look more like Bill Clinton’s trial than Richard Nixon’s. Not only would Trump remain in office; the backlash might deprive the Democrats of their 17-seat House majority.
For months, Nancy Pelosi’s solution has been to walk right up to the line of impeachment without actually crossing it. Unleash committee chairmen to fire their subpoena cannons in every direction. Make unrealistic demands of Attorney General Barr. Have Swalwell and Lieu and the rest of the cable gang keep alive the conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign was in criminal cahoots with Russia. Drag out the process into next year, when a weakened and bedraggled Trump faces the eventual Democratic nominee. That way Pelosi gets the political benefits of impeachment without the costs.
It’s not working. Pelosi’s rhetoric has moved in the direction of Rashida’s (minus the profanity). She’s gone from saying Trump isn’t worth impeachment, to saying Trump is goading the Democrats into impeachment, to saying Trump is “self-impeaching,” if that’s even a thing. She jokes about the jail cell in the basement of Congress, her Judiciary Committee has found Barr in contempt, and she shares Jerry Nadler’s hysterical opinion that the United States is in the midst of a constitutional crisis because he can’t read the grand-jury information of a report you can download for free. On the other side of the building, Chuck Schumer is accusing Mitch McConnell of aiding and abetting a crime that Robert Mueller could not bring himself to say actually happened. Advertisement
What changed? President Trump’s preference for confrontation over consensus is part of the reason, but only a part. Congress and the president fight all the time. The reality is that impeachment talk is the only thing holding the Democrats together. Pelosi’s heralded agenda is a flop. Her party is divided on health care, on immigration, on abortion. Whatever legislation she does pass is destined to meet the Grim Reaper in the Senate. The two dozen 2020 candidates are uninspiring. There’s no war to defund. And the economic headlines are dynamite. Advertisement
Legal warfare against Trump obscures these weaknesses. Doesn’t matter if no voter brings up Mueller outside the Beltway. Without teasing impeachment, no one would care about Democrats inside the Beltway. Two of three cable news channels are desperate for Trump scandals, real or imagined. The Democrats might as well give it to them. Or at least pretend to. Advertisement
In recent weeks the Democrats have turned into a bizarre version of the caricature of Trump they regularly denounce. They lambaste Trump for indulging in conspiracy theories, but the Russia investigation has become their Benghazi, a scandal too complicated and not quite substantive enough to inflame the public imagination. They went after Trump for the “lock her up” chants at his rallies but flirt with jailing both the attorney general and secretary of the Treasury, passed a New York state law directed at a single individual (forbidden in the Constitution as a bill of attainder), and speculate endlessly about how the president might one day end up behind bars. Pelosi says she worries Trump might not accept a loss in 2020 as Hillary Clinton says the election was stolen from her and the entire Democratic party indulges in the ludicrous fantasy that Stacey Abrams is the legitimate governor of a state she lost by more than 50,000 votes amid record minority turnout."
Georgia Heartbeat Bill: Alyssa Milano Calls for ‘Sex Strike’ in Protest | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/alyssa-milano-sex-strike-protest-georgia-heartbeat-bill/,"May 11, 2019 4:05 PM Actress Alyssa Milano (center) at a protest against Trump administration policy in Manhattan in 2017. (Caro Allegri/Reuters)
In response to a Georgia law prohibiting abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected — which usually occurs after about six weeks of pregnancy — actress and progressive activist Alyssa Milano suggested that women practice abstinence until the bill is no longer in effect: Our reproductive rights are being erased.
Until women have legal control over our own bodies we just cannot risk pregnancy.
JOIN ME by not having sex until we get bodily autonomy back.
I’m calling for a #SexStrike . Pass it on. pic.twitter.com/uOgN4FKwpg
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) May 11, 2019
A few feminists and “ male feminists ” echoed Milano, suggesting that a “sex strike” would be an effective way for women to exercise their agency while their “reproductive rights” are being eliminated. A former congressional candidate in Florida made a similar argument yesterday morning, albeit a slightly more moderate one, calling on women to refrain from having sex with conservative men. Advertisement Advertisement
Milano’s suggestion is intriguing for at least a few reasons, not least of which is the fact that she’s urging women to exercise bodily autonomy as a means of proving that they are being denied the ability to do so. The abortion-rights movement spends an enormous amount of energy insisting that no one ever uses abortion as emergency contraception, yet here Milano is clearly admitting that’s the case. Not only that, but groups such as Planned Parenthood and NARAL base much of their activism on the assertion that abstinence education is entirely ineffective, and that birth-control methods, if used properly, will never result in an unwanted pregnancy that ends in abortion. But in articulating the rationale for her “sex strike,” Milano concedes the obvious fact that abstaining from sex is the only guaranteed way to avoid pregnancy and thus to avoid a situation where a woman wants an abortion."
Georgia Heartbeat Bill Won't Imprison Women Who Have Abortions | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/georgia-heartbeat-bill-will-not-imprison-women-who-have-abortions/,"May 11, 2019 11:18 PM Women protest Georgia’s “heartbeat bill” at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, Ga, May 7, 2019. (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)
Last week Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed perhaps the most impressive and comprehensively pro-life “ heartbeat bill ” in the nation. The law (set to go into effect in 2020) not only bans abortion when the baby has a “detectable human heartbeat” it declares the scientific, philosophical, and theological truth that an unborn child is a “natural person” under state law. The law — like other state heartbeat bills — defies controlling Supreme Court authority, and expect pro-abortion activists to immediately challenge it in court.
I expected activist resistance and protest against the bill. I expected radical voices to urge corporate boycotts of Georgia. But I must confess that I did not expect to see a series of stories with lurid headlines and fundamentally mistaken premises to go viral — and to stay viral for days. Here’s a sampling:

Since Georgia declared all unborn children to be natural persons, then — according to these articles — Georgia’s conventional murder statute must apply to women who “self-terminate.” If the woman has a miscarriage in part through her own neglect, then Georgia’s second-degree murder statute applies. If a person helps another person obtain an abortion across state lines, then they’re guilty of “conspiracy” under Georgia statutes.
But this is fundamentally wrong. The heartbeat bill did not repeal a number of Georgia criminal statutes that explicitly apply to abortions and unborn children, and it does not overrule controlling legal authority holding that these statutes bar prosecution of a woman for terminating her own pregnancy. Let’s walk through these statutes and the key case.
First, there is a specific code section that applies to unlawful abortions. Georgia Code Section 16-12-140 states:
(a) A person commits the offense of criminal abortion when, in violation of Code Section 16-12-141 , he or she administers any medicine, drugs, or other substance whatever to any woman or when he or she uses any instrument or other means whatever upon any woman with intent to produce a miscarriage or abortion.
(b) A person convicted of the offense of criminal abortion shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than ten years.
Code Section 16-12-141 is the exact section that was amended to include the heartbeat provision. If a person performs an abortion in violation of the heartbeat bill, then Code Section 16-12-140 applies. It does not impose life imprisonment on anybody, and Georgia courts have held that it does not apply to a woman who self-terminates, only to third parties who perform an abortion. In Hillman v. State , the Court of Appeals of Georgia rejected the prosecution’s effort to imprison a woman who shot herself in the stomach to kill her unborn child. Interpreting Section 16-12-140, it said, “This statute is written in the third person, clearly indicating that at least two actors must be involved.” Accordingly, it “does not criminalize a pregnant woman’s actions in securing an abortion, regardless of the means utilized.” Advertisement
Second, the Georgia code section that criminalizes “feticide” (such as when a man attacks a woman for the purpose of killing her unborn baby) specifically states that “nothing in this Code section shall be construed to permit the prosecution of . . . any woman with respect to her unborn child.”"

M y first assignment as an intern at National Review was to cover Occupy Wall Street, which I did for three months or so during the summer of 2011 until the encampment imploded and the participants moved on to the Next Big Thing.

Of all the bad pennies in all the world, socialism is the most persistent. I am sometimes asked, “Could it happen here?” Sure it could. Human beings are imperfectible creatures who are no less likely to be tempted by shiny objects in our age as in the ones that came before. There is no such thing as an argument that is won, no such thing as an ideology discredited, and no such thing as the End of History. Every birth represents a resetting of the argument—or, at the very least, a new intellectual challenge. The Founders were as worried about Caesar as about George III, and they were right to be so.
This is where National Review comes in. The ideas that underpin the United States — limited government; individual liberty; free markets; the rule of law; peace through strength — are the greatest ideas that have ever underpinned any nation in human history. But they are not self-executing, and nor are they delivered with the mother’s milk. On the contrary: They have to be fought for — day in and day out, without respite, without falter, and without exception. We live in a country in which a 28-year-old freshman has authored a proposal that, if adopted, would entirely remake the modern world; in which one of the two major parties is hurtling toward a health-care model that would require the doubling all taxation and spending; in which the First Amendment is put up for a vote each year in Congress; in which the sanctity of life is being threatened not just in the womb, but outside of it, too. It was necessary in 1955 to yell Stop! It is necessary now, too. And the year after. And the year after that. And . . .
One of National Review ’s greatest attributes is that, far from being the vanity project of one or two individuals, it is a family of like-minded people who wish to maintain the United States as the last great hope of mankind. One of those people is you. If I might paraphrase the Book of Ruth, our fight is your fight, our faith is your faith, and our people are your people. We remain a fixture in the firmament because you have kept us there—from 1955 to today."

2005 —Federal district judge Joseph F.

One year later, a unanimous Eighth Circuit panel reverses all of these rulings.

No thanks to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who in 1974 co-authored a report proposing that Congress abolish Mother’s Day and Father’s Day and replace them with an androgynous Parents’ Day.

In that same report, the oh-so-“moderate” Ginsburg stated her strong sympathy for the proposition that there is a constitutional right to prostitution and a constitutional right to bigamy; criticized the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts for perpetuating stereotyped sex roles; and urged that prisons be co-ed rather than single sex.

Homelessness: Denver Voters Reject Proposal to Legalize Vagrancy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Fund,05-12-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/denver-voters-reject-homeless-referendum/,"May 12, 2019 4:49 PM A homeless man takes shelter under a freeway in San Francisco, Calif., January 6, 2016. (Beck Diefenbach/Reuters) In a referendum last week, the idea that vagrancy should be legalized was shot down by a resounding 83 percent of Denver voters.
T he more that progressive policies have failed to address the homelessness problem in urban areas, the more that progressives are doubling down on bad solutions.
Take Denver. The Mile High City presented voters last week with Issue 300. It was placed on the ballot by advocates for the homeless who wanted to legalize “camping” in parks and in vehicles on city streets, including in front of homes and local businesses. This was too much for voters, even in a city that gave Donald Trump only 19 percent of the vote in 2016. The idea of legalizing vagrancy was shot down by a resounding 83 percent of local voters. Advertisement Advertisement
Liberal mayor Michael Hancock said the city had dodged making a bad situation worse. Noting that tent cities had already begun already sprouting up in parks and alleyways, he maintained that “300 would have created an unsanitary problem for the homeless and for Denver residents.”
But that doesn’t mean the courts elsewhere aren’t stepping in to impose what voters rejected. Last September, the notoriously liberal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that officials in Boise, Idaho, had violated the Eighth Amendment rights of the homeless when they issued citations for sleeping or camping in public. In 2015, the Obama Justice Department backed a lawsuit against the Boise anti-vagrancy laws, arguing that “if a person literally has nowhere else to go, then enforcement of the anti-camping ordinance against that person criminalizes her for being homeless.”
But it’s not as if cities aren’t already spending vast amounts on the homeless. In 2017, the Puget Sound Business Journal in Seattle reported that Seattle-area governments were spending $1.06 billion a year on programs for homeless people. “Having failed to build enough shelters for the growing numbers of homeless, the activists will soon be back with a rock-stupid big-government solution — and all they’ll need to implement it is a massive amount of taxpayer funding,” says John Carlson, a Seattle radio talk-show host. Advertisement Advertisement
Peter Droege is a former executive director of Step 13, an innovative homeless shelter in Denver. “What these activists do not understand is that people struggling with homelessness, mental health issues, or addiction do not want to be enabled in their behavior,” he wrote last month in the Washington Examiner . “Nor do they need greater access to drugs or alcohol. What they need is community support and supportive services that require them to be accountable and self-sufficient.”
When I first toured Step 13 some 20 years ago, it was an eye-opening experience. The late Bob Cote, a homeless man who picked himself up off the streets and founded Step 13, had a high success rate in rehabilitating people with his “no drugs, no booze, find a job” program. “My biggest adversaries are government homeless shelters that don’t ask people to do anything for themselves, and Social Security Disability programs that allow people to continue the same mistakes they’ve been making,” he told me. Cote was constantly battling local bureaucrats who oversaw homelessness issues. It’s one reason he would not accept government money, or the strings that came with it. Advertisement
Every homeless person has a different story, and some are truly down on their luck through no fault of their own. But most are mired in a cycle of behavior that they refuse to change. I once reported on an effort in San Francisco to encourage pedestrians and tourists to hand out coupons instead of money to the homeless. The coupons were redeemable for many things: a free meal, clothing, haircuts, and laundromat services. Over the course of several days, I tried to distribute such coupons myself and met rejection about 80 percent of the time. Cash was what homeless people wanted — and for you know what. Advertisement
Allowing people to remain mired in problems involving mental illness, drugs, or alcohol affects the wider community. In Seattle, Scott Lindsay, a former public-safety adviser to the mayor’s office, has written a new report called “ System Failure .” He found that a mere 100 “prolific offenders” among the homeless are responsible for more than 3,500 criminal cases. Often they are released from jail the same day they are taken in. Advertisement
“We need help, I have businesses broken into every single night,” says Erin Goodman, head of a local Seattle Business Improvement Area. “Something has to change.” Goodman says crime is up 31 percent this year in her area because of the “prolific offenders.”
There are options out there. Rhode Island has had great success with its Medically Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, which blends punishment with treatment, managing to keep most addicts from straying into old alliances and bad habits. Several people in the MAT program say that jail, accompanied by treatment, saved their lives. Rhode Island authorities are hosting a two-day workshop at the end of the month for cities around the country that have asked about it. But progressive Seattle can’t be bothered and isn’t sending anyone. The city attorney, Pete Holmes, told a local podcast that the Seattle’s problems are caused in part by its failure to impose a new city income tax.
Last month, Michael Gordon, a former vice president for grants at the San Francisco–based Thiel Foundation, wrote in NRO that a walk through his city is a sobering experience:
You notice homeless men and women — junkies, winos, the dispossessed — passed out in the vestibules of empty storefronts on otherwise busy streets. Encampments of tents sprout in every shadowy corner: under highway overpasses, down alleys. Streets are peppered with used syringes. Strolling the sidewalks, you smell the faint malodorous traces of human excrement and soiled clothing. Crowded thoroughfares such as Market Street, even in the light of midday, stage a carnival of indecipherable outbursts and drug-induced thrashings about which the police seem to do nothing.
The confused mumble, the incoherent finger-pointing tirade, the twitch, the cold daemonic stare, the drunken stumble and drool — these are the rhythms of a city on the edge of a schizophrenic explosion.
Whatever cities like San Francisco, Seattle, and Denver have been doing isn’t working."
"'Game of Thrones' Final Season: There Was No Justice, Only Genocide | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,David French,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/game-of-thrones-no-justice-only-genocide/,"May 13, 2019 2:18 AM Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in Game of Thrones (Helen Sloan/HBO)
Warning, spoilers are ahead for episode five of the final season of Game of Thrones .
If you’ve watched Game of Thrones (or read the books), you know full-well how George RR Martin delighted in upsetting the conventions of fantasy fiction. The moment that the sword fell on Ned Stark’s head at the end of the first season, viewers knew they were in for something completely different. Heroes failed. Evil triumphed. Advertisement Advertisement
This reality was brought home again in the Red Wedding, when fans (who hadn’t read the books) felt certain they knew the true story arc. Thrones wasn’t Ned Stark’s story; it was the tale of Robb Stark’s righteous vengeance — until it wasn’t. But then when Robb died ignominiously, we still didn’t lose hope. Daenerys Targaryen in the East was the breaker of chains. In the North, Jon Snow inherited his father’s legacy, and when the knives took his life, he overcame death itself. At long last, we knew who would win, and we eagerly awaited their victory.
But no. Even as we perceived the hero in Jon and the liberator in Dany, we also could see the seeds of their failure. As Dany’s power grew, so did her thirst for death and vengeance. She crucified enemies in the East, she fed her dragons with the noblemen of Meereen, she roasted the Tarlys, and she was talked down from darker deeds by her advisers. But by the end, she was alone, wounded at the loss of all those who truly loved her, and enraged at the multiple betrayals by all those who remained close. When Jon pulled away from her, the die was cast. Advertisement
And what about Jon? At a fateful moment, the hero was a pawn. He was completely helpless as Drogon burned innocent people to ash. He was helpless to stop the bloodlust of his own men. He had empowered Daenerys, and she became a monster. Jon may have another heroic stand before the series ends, but the ruins of King’s Landing stand as a monument to his failure. The best man in Westeros could not stop his queen’s genocide. Advertisement
There was a moment in the episode that showed clearly that Dany’s descent was predestined — that she was truly her father’s child. As she passed over the city again and again — raining fire from above — Drogon’s breath started cooking off the remaining wildfire stored beneath the city by the Mad King. As his green fire mingled with her red and orange, she truly became his heir. She completed the task he started. Advertisement
The moment was particularly jolting in part because the last two seasons had been full of what critics derisively call “fan service.” Characters we loved triumphed. Characters we hated died. And in Episode Three of this season, we were given the greatest fan service moment of them all — when all hope seemed lost, Arya Stark killed the Night King. In Episode Five, the fan service ended, decisively. One of the great heroic characters in fiction took the darkest possible turn. It was as if Aragorn became Sauron. We wanted her to defeat her demons. Instead, she indulged them. She became the evil she despised.
We have no idea how the series will end. We don’t know who — if anyone — will sit on the Iron Throne. Jon pulled the soldiers of the North out of King’s Landing, possibly betraying his vengeful queen. Arya is in the city, and we haven’t heard the last of Sansa Stark. But it’s hard to imagine anything like a truly happy ending to one of the greatest shows in television history. In an NR cover story two years ago, I described Game of Thrones as “Calvinism without Christ.” Human depravity is unleashed, and even the good men and women are terribly burdened by the weight of their own terrible flaws. And there is no great good any person can appeal to for redemption and hope. Advertisement"

To make matters even worse: Barkett’s dissent adopts the position taken in an amicus brief submitted in the case by the Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers.

Why Joe Biden Should Not Apologize for His Opposition to Busing | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Howard Husock,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/joe-biden-opposition-busing-1970s/,"About Howard Husock May 13, 2019 6:30 AM Joe Biden joins Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on a campaign stop in Los Angeles, Calif., May 8, 2019. (Kyle Grillot/Reuters) Black communities wanted better schools, and busing was the tool the law offered, even though it never promised to accomplish much.
T here are many reasons to believe that Joe Biden should not be the next president — but his 1970s-era opposition to busing as a means to school desegregation should not be one of them.
There’s little doubt that this could prove to be a litmus test for the current generation of race-conscious Democrats. Northwestern history professor Brett Gadsden has begun to make this case against Biden in Politico : “A sincere critique of Biden’s busing record would require a broader reckoning of the Democratic Party’s — and by extension the nation’s — abandonment of this central goal of the civil rights movement.” Of course, to agree one must accept the idea that busing was rightly a central civil-rights goal — and that those who opposed it were irredeemably racist. Advertisement Advertisement
That was, to be sure, my own view as school desegregation began in Boston, in the fall of 1974. I was a young reporter for a left-wing weekly newspaper, the Boston Phoenix, and was convinced that I was seeing a northern version of the “segregation now, segregation forever” George Wallace had endorsed. (Indeed, Wallace actually carried the city of Boston in the 1976 Democratic presidential primary .) It was only over time, as I became exposed to the anti-busing movement, and to the neighborhoods where it was strong, that my views “evolved,” as is said these days. It became clear that there were not only competing values at stake but that the blue-collar Democrats in South Boston, Charlestown, and East Boston who took up the slogan “bus the liberals” had a good point.
That was not at all obvious to me at first. The Boston School Committee, after all, had been convicted in federal court not of de facto but of de jure segregation for the way it drew neighborhood school-district lines. Its goal was to ensure, for instance, that those assigned to South Boston and Charlestown high schools (both grand buildings set on hills in the middle of their “towns,” next to the Dorchester Heights and Bunker Hill Revolutionary War monuments, respectively) would come only from those overwhelmingly white, Irish-American neighborhoods. Black students from the Columbia Point public-housing project, adjacent to South Boston, were in fact bused to more-distant, predominantly black schools. Elected school-committee members made crude political appeals, including, most notably, Louise Day Hicks’s slogan “You know where I stand.” Advertisement
It became easy to see racism run rampant as the buses began to roll. Advertisement
White families launched a year-long school boycott. A group called ROAR (Restore Our Alienated Rights) organized angry crowds to intimidate the black students being bused into South Boston from the Roxbury ghetto. Rocks and bottles hit the windows of school buses, including one on which a black city official I knew was riding. I covered the violence: A clueless Haitian immigrant beaten when he was stuck in traffic in South Boston. A pre-med student from Jamaica forced to move out of a South Boston public-housing project after a friend’s car was firebombed. These were tough places, not unlike Belfast in the throes of the Troubles. (“Twenty-Six Plus Six Equals One” Ireland unification bumper stickers were common.) I was warned to be wary of “guys with nicknames”: Knocko, Whacko, and, of course, Whitey. When I covered School Committee meetings, I would be singled out for criticism — or, more often, taunting — by one prominent anti-busing member, which was unnerving. Violence simmered in the city; shots fired at the school football field in Charlestown, post-busing, struck and paralyzed a black football player. (The shooter was of school age but not in school; he told me he was just shooting at targets on a rooftop.)
This all made it unlikely that my view of the situation would change — but eventually, it did. Much of that change was due to the relationship I developed with Ray Flynn, a South Boston state representative and later the Boston mayor and U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. Although an anti-busing leader, Flynn was no hater, it was clear to me at once. He’d been an all-American basketball player at Providence College and nearly made it with the Celtics but chose to move back to Southie. He’d run along the waterfront there and knew everyone. He’d been a star at South Boston High School, made good — and came home. Community mattered most to him. He understood that the high school — like the parish, youth hockey league, and the St. Patrick’s Day parade — was a community institution. In Charlestown, the imposing granite-faced high school across from Bunker Hill was the site of the annual community-organized World Halfball Tournament: a local street game formalized. (I’d later make a documentary film about the tournament.) But in time, that high school would close. Community was put at risk by busing, as key threads of the social fabric were pulled apart. Advertisement
And for what? No one thought that either Charlestown or South Boston was a good school, academically. The brightest kids went to nearby Boston College High School (which drew black students as well), while aspiring hockey players attended St. John’s Prep, hoping for a college scholarship. (Flynn once told me he lost out on a college athletic scholarship after being told that everyone knew that Southie kids are dumb.) But the law, and courts, were blunt instruments. They had no way to distinguish between the gilded white schools of the Jim Crow South and shabby Southie High. The medicine — cross-district busing — would have to be the same. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
It was not even clear, to those who knew the city well, that Boston’s black community wanted to integrate the schools. The federal-court action was the culmination of a long struggle by those known as Boston’s black Brahmins — an old black aristocracy dating back to the Abolitionist era, many of whom even had Boston accents. They wanted to do something to help their newly arrived black “homies” (recent arrivals from the South), who came to the city beginning in the early ’60s. They would not have objected to the campaign slogan coined by the preening white School Committee member John Kerrigan: “Quality Education. Neighborhood Schools.” Busing seemed to be the only tool at hand, though not necessarily the best. But in the calculus of the court, a community’s social ties mattered not at all. Indeed, for Boston’s liberal elites, its white working class seemed, well, deplorable. The elites were, of course, sheltered from the chaos, their children comfortably ensconced in private schools or the suburbs. (Suburban towns enrolled some black students through the Metco program, but that integration was a one-way street, and the suburbs were paid for their trouble by the state.)
The situation in Joe Biden’s Wilmington and New Castle County, Del., was a bit different. He was pushing back against a city–suburb cross-boundary busing plan. But, as in Boston, in Wilmington the black community itself mainly wanted better schools, and busing was the tool the law offered. Indeed, two of four black school-board members in Wilmington voted against pursuing legal action to force cross-district busing. “For the first time, blacks had their own school board and many blacks felt they should build up” the Wilmington schools, noted University of Delaware history professor Raymond Wolters, author of The Burden of Brown: Thirty Years of School Desegregation . Instead, “what came to be known as ‘the busing order’ was unprecedented,” according to one historical account , “and changed the face of public education in northern Delaware with racial quotas, sweeping pupil reassignments, school closings and reconfigurations, and bus rides up to an hour each way.” Among the poignant details: Traditional community sports rivalries were swept away. Community fabric, after all, has no salience in a court of law. Biden, of course, understood well that it matters most of all in politics — and, most of the time, that it should. Advertisement"
Progressive Plans to Change the Senate: A Response to Jamelle Bouie | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Cost,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/progressive-plans-change-senate-response-jamelle-bouie/,"May 13, 2019 6:30 AM Tourists walk past the U.S. Capitol in 2013. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) A response to Jamelle Bouie of the New York Times .
I n a provocative Sunday opinion piece for the New York Times , Jamelle Bouie takes aim at the United States Senate. It is “is highly undemocratic and strikingly unrepresentative” institution, dominated by a “Republican coalition of rural whites, exurban whites and anti-tax suburbanites.” This needs to be changed — because everybody knows it is un-American to oppose higher taxes! Advertisement Advertisement
Bouie offers an outside-the-box idea. Rather than change the Senate via constitutional amendment, progressives should look to increase the number of Democrats in the Senate by giving representation in the Senate to non-state units—“Washington, D.C., the Atlantic territories, the Pacific territories and the Native tribes.”
Normally, I do not write columns responding to other columns. But Bouie’s piece is typical of the progressive Left’s frustration with the Senate, as well as of an inability to reckon with its role in our constitutional regime. For these reasons, it merits a thorough examination.
For starters, full disclosure: I get it . The Senate is not democratic, and in a republic, that is problematic. All else being equal, I would agree with Bouie. But all else is not equal. This is in fact a very old debate, whose context demands some thoughtful appreciation before slashing changes are made. Why do you think the Constitutional Convention dragged on through the entire summer of 1787? James Madison, James Wilson, and other federalists from the large states insisted on a fully majoritarian system. But the small-state representatives, including John Dickinson and Roger Sherman, said, No dice — you want our assent to this Constitution, we need guarantees .
Interestingly, Bouie seems to be on the side of Dickenson and Sherman — or at least sympathetic. He calls the population disparity between Delaware and Virginia “a large disparity, but not a yawning one.” I do not understand this difference from the standpoint of the principle Bouie is defending. Is the implication that a little bit of anti-democratic bias okay, but past a certain point it is a bad thing? Was the Senate fair in 1787, but not in 2019? When did it become unfair? Advertisement Advertisement
I’ve never figured out why progressives think that shifts in population disparities are a salient historical point. Assume that the disparity between Delaware and Virginia in 1787 was as great as the disparity between California and Wyoming. Wouldn’t Dickenson have fought even harder for the Senate as it’s currently apportioned ? If anything, he would have probably fought to retain the original structure of the Continental Congress. Otherwise, Delaware would be swamped in the House of Representatives!
And I am not at all sure how giving senators to Guam and Northern Mariana Islands will make the Senate more democratic. Won’t it in fact make it less democratic? How are Los Angelinos and New Yorkers going to have their interests and views better represented in the Senate because the U.S. Virgin Islands is also included? Is Bouie advocating the idea of virtual representation, akin to what the British Parliament backed in the face of colonial protests in the 1770s, whereby progressives in the underrepresented populous states will be “represented” by the progressive senators added from the non-states? Or is it simply okay for the Senate to be anti-democratic, just so long as it is not anti- Democratic ? Advertisement
Regardless, enough is enough for Bouie. The Senate has become a threat to our way of life, and that requires action! Bouie, like many progressives­, pushes in two directions. The first is to make it easier for the Senate to act by eliminating the filibuster. The second is to make the Senate more “democratic” by increasing the number of Democrats. Advertisement
But won’t these aims be contradictory in practice? Bouie suggests that eliminating the filibuster should be a priority for the next Democratic Senate — presumably before his structural reforms (which would be more difficult) would take effect. So what happens if the GOP gets the Senate back before American Samoa gets representation in the Senate? Without the filibuster, evil Republicans will be able to run roughshod over the land like the Visigoths of late antiquity, using net neutrality and tax reform to slaughter untold millions. Advertisement
And forgive me if this sounds gauche, but how about progressives . . . y’know . . . try to win over rural America ? Bouie dismisses this proposal with a wave of the rhetorical hand. “And while this coalition — or its Democratic counterpart of liberal whites and the overwhelming majority of nonwhites — isn’t set in stone, it could be years, even decades, before we see meaningful change in the demographic contours of our partisan divides.” So much for that idea! The way Bouie and many progressives present the divide in this country, rural America is hopelessly committed to a kind of ideological revanchism.
Yet even a cursory reading of American history illustrates that, in many ages, it was rural America that was more progressive. Who propelled William Jennings Bryan and his firebrand populism in 1896? Rural America. Who secured Woodrow Wilson a second term in the White House, vindicating the progressive reforms of his first term? Rural America. Which faction in the Democratic party backed the more progressive FDR over the more conservative Al Smith in the 1932 nomination? Rural America. Who pulled Harry Truman across the finish line in 1948? Rural America. Advertisement Advertisement
Why can’t the Left win these people over once again? One might actually argue that the task is not as hard as it once was. The current split between rural and urban America really became solidified with the rapid growth of labor unions in the 1930s and ’40s. But organized labor has since fallen by the wayside, all but eliminating this longstanding division. Why can’t the Left yoke urban and rural voters together by, for instance, focusing on issues like the oversized influence of the big banks (a key point of unification during the Progressive Era)? I’m not saying this would be an easy task to accomplish. I’m saying, maybe make an honest effort to do that before packing the Senate.
And if some grand ideological vision cannot yoke the different regions together, why not employ a good old-fashioned logroll? That has been a tried and true tactic since the Tariff of 1824.

Religious Persecution in Russia: Dennis Christensen Case | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/religious-persecution-in-russia-a-jehovahs-witness-on-trial/,"About Marlo Safi May 13, 2019 10:07 AM Dennis Christensen, a Jehovah’s Witness accused of extremism, leaves after a court session in handcuffs in the town of Oryol, Russia, January 14, 2019.

Dennis Christensen, a Dane who moved to Russia in 1995, has been in custody by the Federal Security Service (FSB) of Russia for nearly two years. He faces charges for “extremism”; in Russia, being a practicing Jehovah’s Witness qualifies as extremism after a law was enacted in 2017 targeting them for being a threat to “public order and public security.” His case was initiated in May 2017, and last week was Christensen’s appeal hearing in Oryol.

According to Jarrod Lopes, spokesman for Jehovah’s Witnesses at the New York headquarters, May 7th was the first day of the hearing, where many came to support Christensen, including diplomats from Australia, Denmark, Sweden, as well as fellow Witnesses. On Wednesday, the court denied all petitions, including the defense’s motion to verify the “evidence” that formed the basis of the unjust verdict.
But Yaroslav Sivulsky, a representative for the European Association of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brussels, tells National Review that it’s “difficult to expect an acquittal,” and attacks on Jehovah’s Witnesses are expected to escalate following Christensen’s hearing. “The verdict of Dennis Christensen drew a wide response, after which authorities increased the pressure on Jehovah’s Witnesses.” he adds.
Christensen has faced four extensions of his detention, and the court requested he spend six years in prison — the verdict decided on February 6, 2019, which he appealed. On the day of his conviction, ten homes were raided and seven criminal cases were initiated, Lopes says. Between the verdict date and May 3rd, there was a surge in mass searches, arrests, and in Surgut, torture — nearly three times as many criminal cases were initiated in the three months following his conviction than the three months prior in 25 Russian cities. There have been 141 home raids, and 74 criminal cases similar to Christensen’s initiated. Advertisement
“We have always said that the Dennis Christensen case is a precedent for other criminal cases against Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia,” Sivulsky said. Advertisement
In February 2017, the FSB began wiretapping Christensen until about two weeks before his arrest. The FSB also recorded a conversation between Christensen and theologian Oleg Kurdyumov from Oryol State University in an attempt to fabricate evidence against Christensen, and Kurdyumov later testified in court anonymously. On three different dates leading up to his arrest and beginning just after the wiretapping began, an FSB officer covertly surveilled Christensen. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
As I described in a prior piece for National Review , Russian president Vladimir Putin had equivocated on the topic when pressed on it, and at the at the Presidential Human Rights Council meeting in December, Putin called the classification of Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremists “complete nonsense.” “It is true that we should treat representatives of all religions the same,” he said, “but it is also necessary to take into account the country and the society in which we live.” Advertisement
As of May 8th, 188 men and women are facing criminal charges in Russia and Crimea for their faith. Since April 2018, there hasn’t been a month without home raids — since the beginning of 2019, there have been over 100 home raids in nearly 20 regions of Russia and Crimea. In February 2019, seven Witnesses claimed they were tortured while in custody by the Russian Investigative Committee, reporting that they’d been strangled with plastic bags, doused with water, and tasered. Advertisement
Following Putin’s support of legislation enacted in July 2016 that classifies Jehovah’s Witnesses as extremists, Witnesses began fleeing Russia for refugee camps in Finland in search of freedom from persecution. In 2019, they only expect conditions to worsen. While Witnesses in Russia continue to face threats, there is growing awareness of their plight, and Lopes says that the world is watching.

Barack Obama White House Tracked FOIA Request for Clinton Emails | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/barack-obama-white-house-tracked-foia-request-hillary-clinton-emails/,"May 13, 2019 1:51 PM Former President Barack Obama speaks at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Urbana, Ill., September 7, 2018. (John Gress/Reuters)
The Obama White House made an effort to track a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in 2012 that sought communications related to then-secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, according to newly released emails.
Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group, obtained emails Friday that show Obama White House officials were aware of a FOIA request submitted to the State Department by liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), which was ultimately denied. The FOIA request, filed in December 2012, was rebuffed by the State Department on the grounds that no responsive records existed — a response the State Department described as “inaccurate and incomplete” in a 2016 report.
One day after the FOIA request was filed, Sheryl Walter, the State Department official in charge of FOIA requests, emailed a number of State Department officials to inform them that the White House was interested in learning about the specifics of the request:
WH called – have we received a FOIA request from CREW (Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington) on the topic of personal use of email by senior officials? Apparently other agencies have. If we have it, can you give me the details so I can call the WH back? I think they’d like it on quick turnaround. Thanks! Sheryl”
Walter went on to communicate at length with Clinton’s top aides, Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson, about when and how to comply with the FOIA request in a series of emails and a conference call.
“As a practical matter given our workload, it won’t be processed for some months. Let me know if there are any particular sensitivities,” Walter wrote in a subsequent email to Samuelson.
The emails, when considered in light of the State Department’s eventual improper response to the FOIA request, suggest a cover up orchestrated by White House officials, according to Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton.
“These documents suggest the Obama White House knew about the Clinton email lies being told to the public at least as early as December 2012,” Fitton said in a statement released Friday. “A federal court granted Judicial Watch discovery into the Clinton emails because the court wanted answers about a government cover-up of the Clinton emails. And now we have answers because it looks like the Obama White House orchestrated the Clinton email cover-up.”
The public eventually learned of Clinton’s use of a private email server via a 2015 New York Times report. Samuelson and Mills conducted a review of Clinton’s emails to determine which were related to official business. They ultimately turned over 30,000 emails to the State Department in December 2014 while deleting another 30,000 that they claimed were entirely personal.

Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) listens during a House Oversight and Government Reform hearing in Washington, D.C., May 9, 2019. (Leah Millis/Reuters)
CNN’s John King corrected Representative Rashida Tlaib’s (D., Mich.) revisionist history of the Holocaust on Monday, pointing out that Palestinian leaders supported the German extermination of Jews and violently resisted the creation of a Jewish state.
“It was my ancestors — Palestinians — who lost their land and some lost their lives, their livelihood, their human dignity. Their existence, in many ways, had been wiped out,” Tlaib said last week on the Yahoo News Skullduggery podcast. “I mean, just all of it was in the name of trying to create a safe haven for Jews, post-the Holocaust, post-the tragedy and the horrific persecution of Jews across the world at that time.”
“[Tlaib] ignored the fact that Palestinian leaders at the time allied themselves with Hitler and that total war is how the Arab world reacted to the declaration of Israeli independence,” King said Monday. “She can’t rewrite that history and you can’t project revisionist history,” he added before introducing his guest, Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to six secretaries of state, who castigated Tlaib for enflaming divisions by resorting to ahistorical Holocaust references.
“They were considering extermination of the entire Jewish community there as well,” Miller said of Palestinian leaders who believed German forces might arrive in the region after defeating allied forces in North Africa. “So this was ill-timed, ill-advised, and I think it clearly is simply going to antagonize and polarize the already polarized debate in Washington.” CNN Fact Checks Dem Rep.

U.K. Elections: Conservative Party Losses Are a Warning and Opportunity for Tories | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Chris Gavin,05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/local-election-losses-are-a-wake-up-call-and-an-opportunity-for-britains-tories/,"May 13, 2019 2:38 PM Tellers announce the results of the vote on Brexit in Parliament in London, England, March 13, 2019. (Reuters TV via REUTERS ) The Conservative party would have a real opportunity to stop its bleeding and orchestrate a political resurgence under a new, pro-Brexit leader.
O n May 2nd, voters across the U.K. went to the polls to vote in local elections. Given the Conservative government’s continued failure to deliver Brexit, the Tories were long expected to lose big in the vote. Brexit Minister James Cleverly predicted that the party could lose 800 seats of the more than 5,000 it won in 2015. Conversely, many predicted that the opposition Labour party and its hard-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would capitalize on Prime Minister Theresa May’s weakness to win scores of seats across the country. Advertisement Advertisement
But in the early hours of Friday morning, the biggest losers were both main parties. Surpassing even Cleverly’s dire prediction, the Conservatives awoke to losses of 1,335 seats and control of 49 local councils. Labour lost 86 seats and control of six councils. The far-right United Kingdom Independence party (UKIP) also failed to capitalize on pro-Brexit sentiment, losing 145 seats. The biggest winners? The staunchly pro-Remain, center-left Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems), who won 704 seats and control of twelve councils. The Green party and independents also scored important victories , winning 194 and 661 seats, respectively.
The disastrous results for the Conservatives and tepid support for Labour reflect an electorate growing frustrated with the dysfunction of the political class. The inability of the Conservatives to deliver Brexit and the ongoing turmoil in May’s cabinet amid countless leaks , firings , and turnover no doubt contributed to scores of voters defecting. The Lib Dems managed to make huge inroads in affluent, predominantly Tory-leaning strongholds across southern England, both among pro-Leave and pro-Remain voters. Even in Windsor and Maidenhead, home to Theresa May’s constituency, the Tories lost 15 seats to the Lib Dems and independents. Advertisement
Not all was disastrous for the Tories, however. The party managed to take some important victories from Labour, notably in pro-Leave, one-time Labour heartlands like the Midlands and North East Lincolnshire, reflecting ire at Labour’s noncommittal, neither-Leave-nor-Remain Brexit stance. The Lib Dem victories are no doubt impressive, but they are not necessarily indicative of growing support for Remain. Just as independents saw wins across the country, Lib Dem wins likely stemmed from a combination of soft-left Remain supporters and a pox-on-both-their-houses attitude from frustrated Conservative and Labour voters alike. After near total wipeout in 2015, the Lib Dems were always expected to make major gains this election, and have traditionally done well in many of the southern shires where they won seats. Success at the local level has not always translated to parliamentary seats for third parties.
Instead, the biggest takeaway from Thursday’s election is the realignment of British party politics. Party strength in the U.K. has traditionally broken down along geographic and class lines, but with growing discontent with the status quo, both parties will have opportunities for electoral success amid the realignment. The once-solidly Labour North hemorrhaged support to the Conservatives, while true-blue Tory heartlands flipped to the Lib Dems and independents. The Green party’s increased vote share across the country also bodes poorly for Corbyn; an ascendant, leftist Labour party would be expected to sweep up those who voted Green, and these dissatisfied voters could cost him crucial votes at the next general election. Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party is predicted to top all major parties in the European Parliament elections at the end of May; should it stand in domestic parliamentary elections, both Conservatives and Labour alike can expect to see defections.

Alyssa Milano’s Sex Strike over Georgia Heartbeat Bill Achieves Nothing | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/alyssa-milano-sex-strike-georgia-heartbeat-bill/,"May 14, 2019 6:30 AM Actress Alyssa Milano speaks at a protest outside the White House, July 17, 2018. (Mary F. Calvert/Reuters) It’s always amusing to get a lecture about the interests of women from representatives of Hollywood.
L ysistrata, the character from the Aristophanes play of the same name, declared a sex strike to try to stop a devastating war in ancient Greece.
Alyssa Milano, the actress and political activist, declared a sex strike to try to stop Georgia from protecting unborn children in the womb.
The state just passed and signed into law a so-called heartbeat bill to outlaw abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detectable. This led Milano to conclude that women can’t risk pregnancy until further notice, and that they must stop having sex, at least stop having sex with “cis men.” Advertisement Advertisement
It’s apparently never occurred to Milano that women, not just cis men, support pro-life legislation, and that unborn babies are both boys and girls. In her fictional cause, Lysistrata had mercy and humanity on her side. Milano has neither, although her lack of seriousness makes her a perfect spokesperson for the backlash against the Georgia bill.
It is one of a spate of heartbeat bills around the nation that are sure to get enjoined in the courts, but have highlighted the hysterical opposition to the idea that a tiny human being with a heartbeat should be afforded protection under the law. Advertisement
Georgia has come under Hollywood pressure, and not just from the latter-day Lysistrata. Fifty actors and actresses signed an open letter against the law several weeks before it passed. The missive included the condescending line that these worthies find Georgia’s restaurants and hotels “to be comfortable and of a high quality.” The state’s determination to protect the unborn, on the other hand, is completely unacceptable. The signatories thundered that should the heartbeat law pass, “we will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women.” Advertisement
It’s always amusing to get a lecture about the interests of women from representatives of an industry that produced and shielded so many predatory creeps for so long, but Hollywood hasn’t let its own sins stop its nonstop hectoring of everyone else.
The left-wing trope online — repeated by multiple news outlets — is that the Georgia bill would give women life in prison if they have an abortion. This is a stupid lie. The relevant section of Georgia abortion law makes it clear that it applies to third parties, and has been interpreted as such by the Georgia courts. Nor does it call for life imprisonment of anyone. Advertisement
The common arguments against restrictions on abortion are that they infringe on women’s health and bodies. But the vast majority of abortions are made out of discretionary choice, not medical necessity. And the heartbeat bills underline how another body is involved in the equation. Advertisement
An appendix or a kidney doesn’t have its own separate heartbeat. The pro-abortion case is that a fetus is a blob of cells of no account — with a heartbeat. That the fetus is a non-human being — with a heartbeat. That the fetus isn’t truly alive — but has a heartbeat.
The heartbeat bills, even if blocked by the courts, have an educative effect. Most people don’t realize how soon a fetal heartbeat begins — around six weeks into a pregnancy. The pro-life bumper sticker “Abortion Stops a Beating Heart” isn’t just a slogan, but a fact.
As a pro-life tactic to get a test case in front of the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade , the heartbeat bills may be lacking. Chief Justice John Roberts is cautious and unlikely to use a sweeping piece of pro-life legislation to overturn Roe , if he is inclined that way at all.
But the heartbeat bills show, despite the Supreme Court’s effort to stifle it, that the debate over abortion policy in the United States is still very real. The pro-life movement has survived setbacks in the Supreme Court, the disdain of the country’s cultural elite and predictions of its inevitable demise. Advertisement"
"China Strategy: Build Economic, Military, and Technological Superiority | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/china-strategy-build-economic-military-technological-superiority/,"Follow Victor Davis Hanson on Twitter May 14, 2019 6:30 AM Chinese President Xi Jinping reviews honor guards before boarding the destroyer Xining for the naval parade celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy in Qingdao, China, April 23, 2019. (Xinhua via Reuters) Slowly but steadily they build up their economic, military, and technological superiority at our expense
T he Chinese Communist government does not have so much a strategy to translate its economic ascendance into global hegemony as several strategies. All of them are brilliantly insidious.
On matters of trade, China is always flexible in responding to critics of its asymmetrical, 30-year mercantilism. In the initial stages of Westernization, China was exempted from criticism over serial copyright and patent infringement, dumping, and espionage. Western elites assumed that these improprieties were just speed bumps on the eventual Chinese freeway to liberalism. Supposedly the richer China got, the more progressive it would become. Huge trade deficits or military technological appropriation were small prices to pay for an evolving billion-person Palo Alto or Upper West Side. Advertisement Advertisement
After a time, the now-worrisome huge trade deficits and Chinese cheating were further contextualized as “our fault.” The Tom Friedman school of journalism chided our clumsy republican government as lacking Chinese authoritarian efficiency that could by fiat connect new planned utopias by high-speed rail and power them with solar-panel farms. The Wall Street–investor version of this school saw flabby, pampered Americans getting their just deserts as more productive and deserving Chinese workers outhustled and outproduced us. In such tough-love sermonizing, the more Michigan or Pennsylvania rusted, the quicker culpable Americans would either emulate China or die. China of course again agreed.
Then there came a third phase of Chinese contextualization — one of Western arrogance that confused China’s emulation with supposed admiration. We were not to worry about China, because they love buying our rich homes, visiting Stanford, and going to Disneyland. In short, they love being us. Advertisement
Somehow, we forgot that nations that copy the West do not do so out of empathy or veneration. More often, they pick and choose what to buy, steal, or copy, entirely in their own interest. They often see superior Western science arising despite, not because of, Western freedom, and therefore they think it can be improved upon when grafted to a properly authoritarian or totalitarian root. Advertisement
Trump has been an unlikely truth-teller. But as a disrupter who screamed about Chinese mercantilism, he made it acceptable even for liberals to do an about-face and now fault China for human-rights abuses and religious persecution of minorities. As long as such new Western critics do not mention the word “Trump,” they feel empowered suddenly to say about China what heretofore they have repressed.
It was Trump, remember, who challenged the gospel that even asymmetrical free-market exchanges were a national advantage. Even the most flagrant Chinese cheating supposedly had benefits for Americans, who “rented” free stuff from stereotyped sweatshop-toiling Chinese. Cheap imported consumer goods were lapped up by the strapped American middle classes and poor, allowing them to obtain things that their stagnant wages would not. Advertisement
Chinese state subsidies, we were told, would in the long run bankrupt China long before they bankrupted us. And insidious Chinese commercial cheating would force Americans to recalibrate, creatively destroy and rebuild, and in the end become more competitive, productive, and streamlined. China again oddly agreed — ostensibly dismissing the importance of trade deficits as long as they ensured that Americans, not Chinese, would have them. Advertisement
China is patterning its neocolonialist agenda after both the British Empire of the 19th century (without the pretensions of a Western nation’s paternalistic “burden” of spreading civilization) and the Pacific expansionism of Japan’s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of the 1930s and 1940s (this history might explain why Japan, of all its Asian neighbors, knows all too well what China is up to).
As the British did with their coaling stations, which dotted the globe and served British warships and commercial vessels in the 19th century, China is buying up leases on dozens of ports in key strategic areas from the Piraeus to the Horn of Africa. In theory, in time the Chinese could pressure these ports’ host countries to deny entrance to hostile military or commercial rivals. Or in periods of crisis, they could empower supposed merchant ships with all sorts of advanced weaponry — sort of like the stealthily armed German merchant-marine raiders of early World War I. The strategic advantages of linking such ports to facilitate a nexus of Chinese military and commercial ships allow the imagination to run wild. Advertisement
That these massive investments in ports and infrastructure might seem to be bad financial deals makes their acquisitions even more astounding and strategically germane. Beijing is not at all sure that China will ever receive, in the short term at least, a good return on the trillions it is investing to update cargo terminals and transit routes in and out of foreign port facilities. China, recognized as a more or less global commercial renegade, might have a hard time collecting its investment debts in the event of defaults. Short of using military power, what would China do to coerce a debtor? Appeal to multilateral trade and banking oversight institutions, whose protocols it has so commonly ignored with impunity?
It also has no major alliances or pacts that might allow it to pressure nations in arrears. Who collects for China its $50 billion investment in a collapsing Venezuela? If Greece defaults on the multibillion-dollar Chinese investment in the Piraeus, will the Chinese use the European Union or NATO to coerce Greece? Advertisement Advertisement
Like the Japanese of the 1930s and the Russians of the 1960s and 1970s, but unlike the British of the 1870s, the Chinese are not very good imperialists. To know their colonial agents is to distrust them — given the authoritarian, and often racialist, presumptions of the Chinese government.
In military terms, China’s naval strategy is somewhat reminiscent of the ideas of Nazi admiral Karl Dönitz, the sometime genius of Hitler’s U-boat fleet, who argued with varying degrees of success that it was idiotic to repeat imperial Germany’s former failed and bankrupting efforts to match the battleships of the superior British navy ton for ton, when German submarines more cheaply and effectively could tie up the Royal Navy’s assets and deny its ships easy transit in the Atlantic.
The threat of China is not that it will in the near future match America’s eleven carrier battle groups, but that it will, in an effective cost-to-benefit manner, deploy small and more numerous submarines, frigates, and shore-to-ship batteries to create storms of sophisticated anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles that would ensure that key areas of the South China Sea were no-go zones for the fossilized multibillion-dollar flagships of the American navy. Advertisement
More insidious is the Chinese effort to send hundreds of thousands of students to the West in general, and in particular the United States. Again, in theory it is a brilliant strategy. Like the madcap effort of late-19th and early-20th-century Japan, following the Meiji Restoration, to place a quarter-million students in Britain, France, and Germany to soak up everything from army organization to nautical engineering, China has appropriated trillions of dollars in sophisticated Western technology through espionage, well apart from the legitimate Chinese expatriate mastery of Western science, technology, and engineering.
Arrogant Westerners assume that Chinese investors, owners of American real estate, and legions of students will be eventually overwhelmed by American popular culture, liberality, affluence, and freedom, and that they will therefore repatriate to China as subversive agents of change.
More likely, Chinese expatriates will return to China in the fashion of early-20th-century Japanese residents, attachés, and students in the United States, whether a future admiral Isoroku Yamamoto or foreign minister Yōsuke Matsuoka. They equated their experience of Western affluence with license and decadence and, as a result, were determined to marry Western engineering expertise with superior Asian discipline, nationalism, and patriotism to nullify the United States as a great Pacific power.
China is not Russia. It differs in underappreciated ways that transcend its obviously vastly greater population, far-larger economy, and ascendant military. China brilliantly plays on the fact that its expatriates are temporarily part of the American “other.” As marginalized peoples, by feigned surrogate empathy with Asian Americans, they can cite grievances against prior “yellow peril” racism — at least anytime Chinese students are caught spying or engaging in protests against Chinese dissidents.
Recently at a colloquium Kiron Skinner, director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department, tried to point out some of these paradoxes in outlining the totality of the Chinese threat, but she was quite unfairly demonized for an impromptu exchange in which she used the politically incorrect “Caucasian” to emphasize aspects of the Chinese challenge (“So in China we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a kind of global reach that many of us didn’t expect a couple of decades ago, and I think it’s also striking that it’s the first time that we will have a great-power competitor that is not Caucasian”).
Aside from the fact that imperial Japan was a great-power Asian competitor during the lead-up to World War II, Skinner’s general implications were nonetheless valid: China, not Russia, can more easily pose as a historical victim of Western oppression by its status as an Asian nation. And it can more easily both bully and entice dynamic Asian countries. Its message, like Imperial Japan’s earlier narrative, is that European powers and indeed the United States itself are themselves tired, spent, and increasingly impotent in Asia and the Pacific, and either cannot or will not challenge the inevitable Chinese ascendency to hyperpower status.
Skinner’s implication is that central to the Chinese government’s sense of confidence is both its racial and its cultural chauvinism — an unspoken reality that is not so easily appreciated when our own diplomatic elite is often neither culturally nor politically diverse and may exaggerate the European Russian threat and in either condescendingly or politically correct fashion ignore the far greater Chinese challenge. As bad as Russian absorption of Crimea was, there were at least long historical and cultural ties between the two nations and a shared bloody history of resisting foreign conquests at iconic sieges such as Sevastopol. In contrast, China simply stole the far more strategically important Spratley Islands, ignored its neighbors’ claims, created military bases, and may soon adjudicate traffic in the South China Sea — and face no pushback of the sort accorded Putin. Advertisement
We also see the effects of multipronged Chinese financial, cultural, and political influence in popular culture. Hollywood remains in deathly fear of negatively portraying Chinese characters, or the Chinese government in particular. Is it apprehensive of the power of Chinese markets and money, and attuned to the delicacy of portraying supposedly “nonwhite” characters in a negative light?
Contrast that touchiness with the graphic portrayals of Russians, who are action cinema’s most common 21st-century villains. They are ad nauseam usually cast as evil oligarchs, cartel thugs, assassins, or die-hard Soviet fossils, appearing on screen with shaved heads, creepy tattoos, often dotted with czarist and Orthodox runes, and speaking in harsh guttural accents.
No wonder: Hollywood producers do not fear offending Vladimir Putin, or a few hundred Russian students in southern California, or the domestic politically correct Twitter lynch mob. In our superficial identity-politics-obsessed culture, who would speak out against Russian bashing and stereotyping? Russians are seen by Hollywood as the perfect heavies, akin to other common villains such as southern hillbillies and diehard South African racists. Do any social-justice warriors know that the number of those interned in Chinese reeducation and detention camps for incorrect thoughts, religiosity, or minority racial status constitutes a vast archipelago that dwarfs Putin’s decaying gulag?
China understands the often blame-itself-first Western mind (and there is such a thing) far better than Westerners themselves do. It assumes that it will not really suffer blanket criticism for its inhuman treatment of religious minorities and dissidents, or its ruthlessness in Africa. Instead, it figures that many will side with it as victims of a Western racism that supposedly prevents Western liberals from appreciating genuine Asian efforts to join the family of nations. The old myth of missing the bus on a supposed Lincolnesque Ho Chi Minh, or the Jeffersonian Mao, has until Trump been updated to give a soon-to-be-Westernized China a pass on the sorts of human-rights abuses and regional aggressions that earn Putin’s Russia (with a far greater nuclear arsenal) sanctions and threats."
Philadelphia’s Leading Institutions Embrace Political Correctness | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/philadelphia-leading-institutions-embrace-political-correctness/,"May 14, 2019 6:30 AM The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, Pa. (Charles Mostoller/Reuters) Nihilism and petty PC tyrannies have dragged the city far from our Framers’ principles.
W hen most Americans think of Philadelphia — although probably fewer do today than ever before, given the low level of history education in American schools — they probably think of the founding of the United States, the Liberty Bell and the city’s nickname, the City of Brotherly Love.
Having been to Philadelphia at least 20 times, I am among the many Americans who have warm feelings toward America’s founding city. My daily radio show has a large and enthusiastic listener base there, and I have a son who lives nearby. Advertisement Advertisement
So it is with no joy that I write about the transformation of Philadelphia into something far removed from the principles of the country it helped birth. Philadelphia’s leading institutions — such as the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Philadelphia Flyers — provide depressing evidence.
We’ll begin with the Philadelphia-based University of Pennsylvania, one of the country’s Ivy League colleges. When Harvard Professor Steven Pinker, a liberal and an atheist, recently described American universities as a “laughingstock,” he could have been referring specifically to the University of Pennsylvania, which, among other Philadelphia institutions, is committed to dismantling American and Western civilization.
For decades, a portrait of William Shakespeare, the greatest English-language playwright who ever lived and the most widely read playwright in the world, hung over the main staircase of Fisher-Bennett Hall, home to Penn’s English department. Advertisement
Given Shakespeare’s stature as an English-language writer, what other writer would an English department so honor? But that question makes sense only to those who believe that excellence should dictate which writer’s portrait should hang in a university English department. The idea that excellence is all that matters in assessing artists is fundamental to Western civilization and is a primary reason for its ascent. It took a long time for humanity to transcend ethnic, racial, tribal, and economic criteria for assessing art. Advertisement
But the English department at the University of Pennsylvania, dominated as it is by those who equate Western civilization with “white supremacy” (a.k.a. leftists), voted to remove the Shakespeare portrait. As reported in the Daily Pennsylvanian , the university’s student newspaper, “The English Department voted to relocate and replace the portrait . . . in order to represent a more diverse range of writers, according to an emailed statement from [Department Chair Jed] Esty, who declined to be interviewed.”
A few years later, in December 2016, students took down the portrait. Advertisement Advertisement
In its place they put up a portrait of Audre Lorde, a black feminist lesbian poet who died in 1992.
Equally nihilistic is a story out of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. On August 9, 2017, tenured Penn Law professor Amy Wax and University of San Diego School of Law professor Larry Alexander co-authored an opinion piece titled “Paying the price for breakdown of the country’s bourgeois culture.”
Its thesis was that the rejection of American bourgeois middle-class culture is the primary reason for most social ills in America today. Referring to America’s bourgeois culture, they wrote:
That culture laid out the script we all were supposed to follow: Get married before you have children and strive to stay married for their sake. Get the education you need for gainful employment, work hard, and avoid idleness. Go the extra mile for your employer or client. Be a patriot, ready to serve the country. Be neighborly, civic-minded, and charitable. Avoid coarse language in public. Be respectful of authority. Eschew substance abuse and crime.
Within a few weeks, a petition was signed by 4,000 people calling for Wax’s dismissal, and the dean of Penn Law, Ted Ruger, wrote an op-ed in the Daily Pennsylvanian , ostensibly about Charlottesville but really about Wax, in which he implied that her views were “divisive, even noxious.” Most significantly, he wrote, “It is important that I state my own personal view that as a scholar and educator I reject emphatically any claim that a single cultural tradition is better than all others.” (He was referring to Wax’s position that those bourgeois values are superior values).
After hundreds of her colleagues demanded that Wax be fired, Ruger forbade her from teaching any first-year required courses at Penn Law.
Now to the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the world’s greatest. The orchestra recently received more than 500 applications for the position of assistant conductor. According to my Philly sources, the four finalists included only one male (a black male, for the record), despite the fact that males make up the overwhelming majority of orchestra conductors in the world and therefore the overwhelming majority of the applicants for the Philadelphia Orchestra position. There is little reason to believe that, as talented as they may be, the four were chosen on the basis of artistic excellence alone. The orchestra’s gifted conductor, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, has declared this the year of the woman conductor and the year of the woman composer. Advertisement
Most musicians are on the left, but Nézet-Séguin makes it more obvious than most. In a recent concert, the Philadelphia Orchestra featured the premiere of Philadelphia Voices , “a political rant put to musical garbage,” as some Philadelphians associated with the orchestra described it to me. In the fifth movement, named “My House Is Full of Black People,” the black teen narrator chants: “The county is full of black people / All wanting to be heard / While old white men draw lines on maps / To shut all of them up.” Later in the movement, he yells, “If you would all just f***ing listen!” Advertisement
And this year, the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team removed the statue of American singer Kate Smith that the team had erected in 1987. Her rendition of “God Bless America” was played at every Flyers home game since 9/11, and she herself sang it for the Flyers in the 1970s. But last month, the team learned that Smith had sung a song with racist lyrics —“That’s Why Darkies Were Born”— in 1931. That Paul Robeson, the great black singer — and enthusiastic supporter of Josef Stalin — also recorded the song doesn’t matter. To the Flyers (and New York Yankees), Smith’s whiteness undid all the good she did for America. Advertisement"
Donald Trump Administration's Immigration Basket of Deplorables | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mark Krikorian,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/basket-of-deplorables-trump-administration-edition/,"Follow Mark Krikorian on Twitter May 14, 2019 10:23 AM White House senior adviser Jared Kushner at a dinner symposium of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) in Washington, D.C., May 2, 2019. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)
The White House immigration plan, whose development is being overseen by Jared Kushner, is an attempt to show what the administration is for, not just what it’s against. This is a useful exercise, even though there’s zero chance it will be approved by Congress. The goal appears to lay out a roadmap of where Republicans want to go on immigration. Advertisement Advertisement
The package isn’t fully cooked yet, but its broad outlines are clear. It won’t try to address everything “ comprehensively, ” focusing instead on enforcement and the legal immigration system. It thus isn’t expected to include an amnesty or any changes to the myriad guest-worker programs. Enforcement measures will reportedly address the border crisis (a Flores fix, etc.), as well as mandate use of the E-Verify system to confirm the information collected by an employer when taking on a new hire.
The legal-immigration portion includes the changes the president has long talked about, including a narrowing of the family categories to limit chain migration, an end to the visa lottery, and an overhaul of the skills-based portion of the system to stress merit in the form of educational attainment, and other factors.
While the details, once they’re announced, will matter, this is all generally positive. Advertisement
But there’s a fundamental problem that suggests the brain trust overseeing this effort is out of touch with the president’s base. The proposal will not include any reduction in the overall level of legal immigration, not even a symbolic one. In other words, all the reductions in green cards from ending the visa lottery and narrowing the family categories would be reallocated to the newly revised merit system. (This is unlike the approach of the Raise Act, which the president has endorsed, which would not shift the green cards from the family categories over to the skilled categories.) Advertisement
This is especially important because the proposal is not really a legislative vehicle; there’s no chance an immigration bill even remotely acceptable to Republicans can make it through this Congress. That means this proposal is more of a campaign platform, outlining the official Republican approach to immigration. Formally embracing the current legal-immigration level of more than one million each year would mean that the GOP, as on so many issues before, would simply be the Democrat-lite party, wanting to go in the same direction, just more slowly.
You’d think bringing down the annual number of green cards issued from the current 1.1 million to, say, “ just ” one million wouldn’t be controversial for an iconoclastic president who’s in the White House mainly because of his hawkishness on immigration. But you’d be wrong. Advertisement
Ever since this year’s State of the Union address, President Trump has been signaling his desire for an increase in immigration because of the low unemployment rate. This despite explicit commitments to the contrary during the campaign and earlier in his term. Advertisement
Of course, the idea that we’re running short of potential workers is absurd; as Jason Richwine noted in these pages recently, “ [w]ith one in nine prime-age males still sitting idle, terms such as ‘ full employment’ and ‘ labor shortage ’ ring hollow. ” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
So the president is wrong about this, but if he really wants to follow in the footsteps of the Bush and Obama administrations (and the stillborn Jeb and Hillary administrations) and push for increased immigration to please “ our corporations , ” he can make his case, gauge the pushback, and decide if he’s willing to pay the political price.
But the tone from unnamed White House sources working on the Kushner plan has recently turned from attempted persuasion of skeptical Trump supporters to Hillary-ish contempt. Advertisement
To begin with, the authors of the White House plan seem to consider that they’ve already made a grudging but significant concession to the Deplorables simply by not including an increase in immigration, despite the president’s rhetoric.
Then, last week McClatchy quoted “ a person familiar with the plan ” as saying that E-Verify was included “ to calm concerns on the right over the lack of reduction of immigration numbers on the skills side. ” This is absurd, and contains a whiff of “ boob bait for Bubba . ” E-Verify really is vital to any meaningful effort to limit illegal immigration, but why would anyone think it has anything to do with the excessively high level of legal immigration?
And in a Politico story Monday, a “ senior administration official ” went full basket-of-deplorables , “ telling POLITICO that immigration restrictionists are a ‘ pretty fringe’ group that have not ‘ been an important part of the president’s base. They have bullied a lot of the most rational people out of the conversation. ’ ” Advertisement
If Republican voters wanted a White House that thought skeptics of mass immigration are an irrational fringe they would have voted for Jeb! On the other hand, the increasingly contemptuous tone suggests the team assembling the immigration plan are getting pushback for their decision not to include even a token reduction in numbers.

Steve Bullock 2020: Yet Another Democrat Jumps into the Presidential Primary | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/yet-another-democrat-jumps-into-the-presidential-primary/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter May 14, 2019 10:53 AM The U.S. Capitol is reflected on the skylights of the new Capitol Visitors Center (CVC) at dawn before the opening ceremony of the CVC in Washington December 2, 2008.

Making the click-through worthwhile: Yet another Democrat hops into the 2020 primary field, Brett Kavanaugh sides with his activist colleagues to rule that iPhone users can sue Apple over app prices, and U.S. officials say Iran was likely behind the attack on two Saudi Arabian oil tankers and two other ships over the weekend.

Montana Governor Enters the Democratic Primary
Montana governor Steve Bullock has become the latest Democrat to throw his hat in the ring for the 2020 presidential nomination, bringing the grand total of Democrats running to 23. Bullock had reportedly been mulling the run for quite some time before deciding to enter the race, and he’ll officially launch his campaign today with a rally at a high school in Montana before making his way to Iowa for a series of campaign stops.
According to Morning Consult data from the first quarter of 2019, Bullock is among the 15 most popular governors in the country, and one of the top Democrats to make the list (13 out of the top 15 most popular governors are Republicans; the other Democrat is Delaware governor John Carney). But that fact makes Bullock’s decision to run for president a bit more puzzling.
In a field of 23 candidates, where Biden continues to lead the pack by double digits in many polls, it’s hard to imagine the Montana governor will have an easy time making an impression on primary voters. But it’s much easier to imagine Bullock putting up a decent fight against Republican senator Steve Daines, who is up for re-election in 2020. Advertisement Advertisement
Bullock is one of several rising Democratic politicians who declined to run for a Senate seat in order to run for president, along with Colorado governor John Hickenlooper and former representative Beto O’Rourke. Some Democrats would like to see Hickenlooper challenge Republican senator Cory Gardner for his seat this cycle, while many believe O’Rourke would have a decent shot at unseating Republican senator and former Senate majority whip John Cornyn.
In Georgia, meanwhile, failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams — who has still refused to concede the governor’s race — has already declined to challenge Republican senator David Perdue for his seat this cycle. Abrams does, however, say that she’s still considering whether she’ll hop into the Democratic presidential primary.
These decisions must be frustrating for Democrats, who face a difficult but not impossible map in their effort to take the Senate out of GOP hands in 2020. They need to flip three seats in order to gain the majority, but not many of the Republican incumbents are particularly vulnerable. Susan Collins, the moderate Republican senator from Maine, is perhaps one of the weaker incumbents, but a recent poll found her leading a possible Democratic challenger by more than 20 points. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Beto, Hickenlooper, and Bullock join nearly two dozen of their fellow Democrats in fighting over the same donors and primary voters, angling for a spot on the debate stage to somehow break out from the shadow cast by Biden and Bernie. Perhaps the problem is that there is essentially no downside to running for president. It’s a fairly easy path to more TV hits, more press attention, the possibility of a book deal, and so on.

Supreme Court Rules against Apple in Big Anti-Trust Case Advertisement
In a 5-4 decision, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sided with the four activist members of the Court on Monday in Apple v. Pepper , allowing an anti-trust class-action suit against the tech company to proceed. The majority ruled that consumers can sue Apple over the high app prices that result from its monopolistic control over the “the iPhone apps aftermarket.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The ruling merely allowed an original lawsuit, brought by a group of iPhone users, to proceed, but did not take a stance on the merits of that case. The class-action lawsuit deals with fees that Apple takes on sales in its App Store, which millions use every day. Apple charges developers up to 30 percent commission when they sell apps through the store, prevents them from selling those apps elsewhere, and has some influence over prices.
Writing for the majority, Kavanaugh upheld the Ninth Circuit’s ruling, determining that Apple, rather than app developers, controls the point of sale and therefore can be sued for exercising a monopoly over prices. From NR’s own Jack Crowe:
“It is undisputed that the iPhone owners bought the apps directly from Apple,” Kavanaugh wrote , splitting with a district court that previously held the app developers responsible for pricing.
Kavanaugh took issue with Apple’s defense that it does not have a monopoly because it doesn’t set the retail price for individual apps, pointing out that the fee the company charges developers (30 percent of sales revenue plus $99 annually) significantly affects retail pricing.
“In the retail context, the price charged by a retailer to a consumer is often a result (at least in part) of the price charged by the manufacturer or supplier to the retailer, or of negotiations between the manufacturer or supplier and the retailer,” Kavanaugh wrote.
Writing for the dissenting four justices, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote, “If the proximate cause line is no longer to be drawn at the first injured party, how far down the causal chain can a plaintiff be and still recoup damages?” Gorsuch also claimed that the majority opinion relied on “convoluted pass-on theories,” in which damages to the consumer inflicted by app developers are instead passed on to a third party such as Apple.
Iran Likely behind Attack on Saudi Tankers
U.S. officials report that Iran was likely behind the attack on two Saudi Arabian oil tankers and a Norwegian ship over the weekend near the Persian Gulf. From the Wall Street Journal ’s reporting on the incident:
The assessment, while not conclusive, was the first suggestion by any nation that Iran was responsible for the attack and comes after a series of U.S. warnings against aggression by Iran or its allies and proxies against military or commercial vessels in the region.
The U.S. official, who declined to be identified, didn’t offer details about what led to the assessment or its implications for a possible U.S. response. The U.S. has said in the past week that it was sending an aircraft carrier, an amphibious assault ship, a bomber task force and an antimissile system to the region after it alleged intelligence showed Iran posed a threat to its troops.
“If they do anything, they will suffer greatly. We’ll see what happens with Iran,” President Trump said while meeting with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the White House earlier on Monday.
Iran’s office at the United Nations didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates has blamed Iran for the attacks, while Iran’s foreign-ministry spokesman has said the incident should be investigated and called it dreadful, according to Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency. "
Foreign Disinformation in Europe: A Conversation | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/well-timed-discussion-about-foreign-disinformation-in-europe/,"May 14, 2019 10:07 AM (Kacper Pempel/Reuters)
I’m in Vienna, Austria, for a few days, speaking to groups such as the Austrian National Defense Academy, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and later today, the University of Vienna about foreign disinformation, social media, and media coverage of elections.
I couldn’t have asked for a more newsworthy topic to discuss; the top story in this morning’s international edition of the New York Times is “ Hackers sow discord as vote looms in Europe ,” discussing “a constellation of websites and social media accounts linked to Russia or far-right groups is spreading disinformation, encouraging discord and amplifying distrust of the centrist parties that have governed for decades” in advance of elections to the European Parliament. (In case you’re wondering, there are no Netanyahu cartoons in today’s edition.) Advertisement Advertisement
So far, the responses from the audiences are encouraging. They’re in that sweet spot of taking the phenomenon seriously but not panicking about it. It’s still not clear that the efforts in 2016 spurred any Americans to change their minds or change the way they voted, but even if it didn’t effect a single vote, we still don’t want foreign-intelligence services mucking around in our discourse around election time and trying to surreptitiously influence American public opinion. We generate enough social and political division on our own, thank you; we don’t need anybody else trying to throw gasoline on the fire.
Russia may have blazed the trail, but other regimes are now running plays from the same playbook. Last year, Facebook, Twitter, and Google shut down a slew of accounts with ties to the Iranian government who “spread memes, articles, and other posts about political topics including race relations, the upcoming midterm election in the US, and the recent confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It also hosted seven events.” Advertisement
As with Russian efforts in 2016, featuring over-the-top messaging such as the “Army of Jesus” portraying Hillary Clinton in a mixed-martial-arts battle against Jesus Christ and calls for Southern secession , there was a clumsy heavy-handedness to the Iranian efforts. My favorite detail is “inauthentic social media personas, masquerading as American liberals supportive of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, heavily promoting Quds Day, a holiday established by Iran in 1979 to express support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.” Advertisement
You think a lot of Sanders supporters are big on celebrating Quds Day? Ever see a lot of folks in Vermont putting up lights and decorations for the big Quds Day parade?
I plan to turn my prepared remarks into an article for National Review , but for a short preview, there are some reasons for optimism. Russia’s main tool for spreading social-media discord, the Internet Research Agency. On America’s Election Day 2018, the IRA could not access the Internet, and remained disconnected for 48 hours. Maybe this was the work of the Department of Defense’s Cyber Command. Maybe this was the National Security Agency. Or maybe some Russian just tripped over a wire somewhere and unplugged something. Advertisement
Social-media companies are shutting down accounts when they identify them, but the process of setting up an account is meant to be quick and easy — meaning the bad guys will probably always be able to set up new ones. Advertisement
A key point I’m attempting to emphasize over here is that this represents a circumstance where ordinary citizens can do something to help protect their country; what is threatened by a foreign power is not land or sea or airspace but the realm of our discourse. When we see something false, we can call it out. When we see Twitter accounts with the familiar handle of NAME-INITIAL-SEVEN-OR-EIGHT-RANDOM-NUMBERS, operating during regular business hours in Moscow or St. Petersburg, we can call it out (and I see people doing that more frequently).
Some worry that we won’t be able to tell the difference between foreign disinformation trying to exploit divisions and genuine political activism. But I noticed that almost nothing produced by the IRA proposed any solutions, and when they did propose a solution, it was usually something extreme like “secede from the union!” Nothing they generated suggested that any societal problem could be fixed; it was all about just making you angrier. Genuine political activists are usually pushing for some reform or change in the laws; foreign efforts just want discord for the sake of discord. Advertisement"
CIA Enlisted by William Barr to Investigate Russia Probe Origins | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/cia-joins-william-barr-in-investigating-origins-of-trump-campaign-surveillance/,"May 14, 2019 11:19 AM (Jason Reed/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr has enlisted the help of the CIA to investigate whether the FBI’s surveillance of the Trump campaign was motivated by partisan bias, CNN reported Tuesday.
CIA director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, and FBI director Chris Wray are all participating in the investigation, which Barr first announced publicly during a congressional hearing last month.
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday evening that Barr has tapped Connecticut U.S. attorney John Durham to help examine the origins of the FBI counterintelligence investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election, which served as the pretext for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment.
The investigation was launched in response to long-held Republican concerns that the FBI’s surveillance of the Trump campaign was politically motivated and relied on dubious opposition research. These concerns were in part fueled by the revelation that the FISA warrant obtained to surveil Trump campaign national-security adviser Carter Page was based on information provided in the unsubstantiated Steele dossier.

Tulsi Gabbard & Facebook -- 2020 Democrat Blasts Big Tech Censorship | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/tulsi-gabbard-becomes-first-2020-dem-to-speak-out-against-facebook-censorship/,"May 14, 2019 3:35 PM Representative Tulsi Gabbard speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Pa., July 26, 2016. (Mike Segar/Reuters)
During a recent appearance on comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast, Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D., Hawaii) became the first and only Democratic presidential contender to voice opposition to the censorship of Facebook users.
During the interview, Gabbard split with fellow Democrats — many of whom have cast conservative concerns about tech censorship as a “ conspiracy theory ” — arguing instead that companies like Facebook have betrayed the longstanding American commitment to free expression by ousting unpopular political commentary from their platforms.
“There’s just been news recently about Facebook banning certain individuals . . . because of their speech. They disagree with the speech they’re using or the ideas they’re pushing forward. Unchecked, First Amendment rights going out the window,” she said, referring to Facebook’s recent purge of users on the political fringes such as Infowars reporter Paul Joseph Watson and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.
“The argument is [the First Amendment] doesn’t apply because they’re a private company, right?” Rogan responded.
“Yes, but they re trying to get the best of both worlds. The fact that they are claiming to say, ‘Hey, this is a free space for open communication for everyone’ while at the same time saying ‘You know, what Joe, I don’t like what you’re saying about this, so we’re going to ban you and whoever your friends are from this conversation’— I think that’s a big problem.”
Gabbard’s description of Facebook’s desire to have “the best of both worlds” refers to the company’s claim that it is a neutral platform, rather than a publisher, and as such cannot be held liable for the content it disseminates. Gabbard, like a number of prominent Republicans including Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, believes that stance is incompatible with Facebook’s selective censorship of certain viewpoints.
Gabbard, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a military veteran, first addressed tech censorship in a March tweet. Stay Updated with NR Daily

New York Times & Sandeep Jauhar -- Medical Conscience for Me but Not for Thee | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/medical-conscience-for-me-but-not-for-thee/,"May 14, 2019 3:52 PM (Thomas Peter/Reuters)
The New York Times has published an opinion column by cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar that decries the Trump administration’s increased enforcement of medical conscience. But he actually promotes a one-way conscience right that favors protecting the predominate ideological views of the medical intelligentsia, while forcing dissenters to sacrifice their own religious and moral beliefs.
First, he endorses “futile care,” the bioethics authoritarianism that allows doctors to refuse wanted life-sustaining treatment based on the doctor’s values. From, “ Can Doctors Refuse to Treat a Patient ? ”
A consensus exists among legal and bioethics experts that doctors can refuse to provide treatment in certain situations. For example, courts have ruled that doctors may refuse to treat violent or intransigent patients as long as they give proper notice so that those patients can find alternative care. Forcing doctors to treat such patients, courts have said, would violate the 13th Amendment’s prohibition on involuntary servitude….
Doctors may also refuse to provide treatment if it conflicts with good medical practice. Physicians in intensive-care units, for example, routinely limit treatment they believe will provide no benefit, especially in cases of terminal illness.
Did you see the sleight of hand there? The doctor may think that living longer provides “ no benefit ” and limit treatment even though the patient/surrogate/family does . That’s not a medical decision, it is a value judgment .
So in a situation of life and death — Jauhar believes the doctors values should trump those of the patient — presumably, even if stated by a competent patient or instructed in an advance directive. But when it comes to elective interventions identified by the Trump rule — such as abortion, assisted suicide, and transgender interventions — Jauhar is all “ patient rights! ” :
Doctors have an obligation to adhere to the norms of their profession. In my view, as long as treatments are safe and approved by medical organizations, doctors should have limited leeway in refusing to provide them. Patients’ needs should come first. At the very least, patients whose medical needs violate a doctor’s deeply considered beliefs should receive a timely referral to an alternative provider.
So a pediatrician who believes circumcision is child abuse — as some do — should be forced to remove his patient’s foreskin because it is approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)? No! That is an elective procedure. The parents can find another doctor on their own. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Jauhar’s advocacy would also force a doctor who believes it is wrong — and indeed, harmful — to inhibit the normal onset of puberty in a child diagnosed with gender dysphoria, to do it, procure a willing doctor, or face litigation or professional discipline. After all, puberty blockers are now considered a norm for treating transgender pre-adolescents by the AAP . Advertisement
And what if the vaunted “ norms of the profession ” should one day approve the amputation of a healthy limb, blinding , or severing the spinal cord (as the case may be) as a “ treatment ” for “ body identity integrity disorder ” — in which the “ transable ” patient identifies as a disabled person — as is sometimes now advocated in bioethics? Should a doctor be forced to mutilate a patient too?
Or what if organ harvesting as a form of euthanasia became acceptable, as has been pushed in some prominent medical and bioethics journals ? Should transplant surgeons then be force to kill by procuring organs?"
Donald Trump Jr. Strikes Deal to Testify Before Senate Intel Committee | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/donald-trump-jr-deal-testify-senate-intelligence-committee/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter May 14, 2019 5:26 PM Donald Trump Jr. speaks during a campaign event for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone in Elizabeth Township, Pa., March 12, 2018.

After weeks of contentious negotiation, Donald Trump Jr. agreed on Tuesday to comply with the Republican Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr’s (R., N.C.) subpoena-backed demand that he sit for a private interview with members of the panel, the New York Times first reported.
Trump Jr. has reportedly agreed to speak to lawmakers about a limited range of topics for between two and four hours sometime in mid June.
Burr told fellow Republican senators last week that he was forced to issue a subpoena demanding Trump Jr.’s appearance after he skipped two previously scheduled appointments to sit for an interview, the Times reported on Sunday.
Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, President Trump called the Senate Intelligence Committee’s move to subpoena his son “unfair.”
“It’s really a tough situation because my son spent over 20 hours testifying about something that Mueller said was 100 percent okay. And now they want him to testify again. . . . I have no idea why, but it seems very unfair to me,” Trump said, referring to the closed-door testimony his son provided about the infamous Trump Tower meeting.
In the wake of Robert Mueller’s report, Democrats and a subset of Republicans have argued that the meeting, in which Trump Jr. and other campaign officials met with a Kremlin-linked attorney, warrants further investigation. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Like the president, Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has argued that compelling further testimony from Trump Jr. is an unnecessary act of political theater.
“You just show up and plead the Fifth, and it’s over with,” Graham told reporters on Monday. “You’d have to be an idiot as a lawyer to put your client back into this circus, a complete idiot.”
Other prominent Republicans, such as Kentucky senator Rand Paul, have chastised Burr from breaking ranks by continuing to pursue his investigation into Trump campaign activities after the conclusion of Mueller’s probe. Apparently the Republican chair of the Senate Intel Committee didn’t get the memo from the Majority Leader that this case was closed… https://t.co/jvV5PIX266"

The state just passed and signed into law a so-called heartbeat bill to outlaw abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detectable. This led Milano to conclude that women can’t risk pregnancy until further notice, and that they must stop having sex, at least stop having sex with “cis men.”
It’s apparently never occurred to Milano that women, not just cis men, support pro-life legislation, and that unborn babies are both boys and girls.

(Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) The times are good and his opponents are not.
T he full proportions of the debacle that awaits the Democrats next fall is starting to penetrate their complacent disdain and revulsion toward President Trump. Rank-and-file Democrats are so ecstatic at the arrival of a known candidate whose views on principal policy issues cannot be invoked by Republicans to frighten children into eating their breakfast cereal that they have accorded Joe Biden a levitation in the polls. Biden is a shopworn, moth-eaten, malapropistic journeyman about whom, when asked to assess him as a potential president, former bipartisan defense secretary and CIA director Robert Gates took four seconds to emit: “I don’t know.” In the land of the Ocasio-Cortez sound-alikes, a track-worn perennial candidate is king. Given how verbally accident-prone Biden has been throughout his nearly 50 years of public life, his present formidable lead in the polls against an immense field of candidates should be seen as the fulfilment of Democratic yearning for someone who would not alarm the voters in policy terms. The only other such candidate is the relatively unknown Amy Klobuchar. All Americans, even the president’s most strenuous supporters, should be comforted that the majority of Democrats can still think and count. It is a party infested with lunatics, but not controlled by them. This is in the same reassuring category as the Mueller investigation’s conclusion that no one in the United States colluded with Russians to influence the result of the 2016 election. Advertisement Advertisement
Beneath the initial success of the Biden campaign, the Democrats are sharply divided between those who are still trying to place their bets on the presidential unsuitability of the incumbent, those who seek a radical démarche to the left and over the political cliff, and those trying to get back to essentially the old slightly-left-of-center coalition of Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson. President Clinton, and even, with a stretch, Mrs. Clinton, were also in that tradition, but the ominous approaching clouds of investigative curiosity about the Clinton Foundation and the malodorous ethics of the 2016 Clinton campaign have caused the Clintons’ party to stampede from under them. Advertisement
Even Barack Obama, who was cozily settling into a good 30 years as a respected ex-president, is already in the crosshairs of the investigation, conducted against the Clinton campaign, of illegal espionage on the Trump campaign through fraudulently obtained FISA warrants and planted agents and sting operations. The rabidly Trumpophobic texting between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page reveals that “the White House” was closely monitoring the investigation of the Trump campaign, which raises the question of the involvement of the former president in illegal surveillance. Obama’s name is still bandied about with respect by most of the Democratic candidates, especially Biden (“Barack and I . . .”), and he is still better esteemed by most Americans than the other ex-presidents. But apart from the admirable and necessary shattering of the bar of color, his entire legacy has been discredited: the mad obsession with unproved climate alarmism, the foolhardy Iranian nuclear treaty, and the Obamacare shambles.
Going back to the Humphrey-Mondale tradition represented by Klobuchar (also a senator from Minnesota), or the Clinton-Obama Democrats without the Clintons or Obamas, Biden will avoid a disaster at the polls: All good Democrats and the bipartisan Trump-haters could vote for either, but they won’t be a majority. Answering the sirens on the left and nominating Sanders or a kindred leftist spirit, however, would enable Trump to surpass Richard Nixon’s record plurality of 18 million in 1972 (in an electorate of 77 million, against next year’s likely 140 million). Apart from working out where the party is and what it seeks, the Democrats are going to have to come to grips with three facts that, combined, should make this president insuperable in 2020. Advertisement
The first is that he will have the comparative moral high ground once the investigation of the Clinton campaign gets going. The Democrats and their media choristers have grown hoarse and risible with their endless screeching and whining about the president’s character. He lost money in the 1980s, as everyone knew, though most of it was non-cash items of the type that accrues in property development (where depreciation, a non-cash loss, is heavy). The egregious Don Lemon’s opener on CNN (“The president of the United States is a fraud and a con-man”) didn’t fly. He’s still the wealthiest person in the history of the presidency, the only serious businessman to hold that office, and his comeback from his financial difficulties was a triumph: Napoleon at the Beresina, not the (rightly) forgotten bankruptcies of the elderly Thomas Jefferson or the young Harry Truman. Advertisement
The second important fact to consider in the electoral equation is that this president is a fierce combatant. He is not in the Ford-Bush-Dole-Bush-McCain-Romney school of gentlemanly Republican presidential candidates who could win only with a cunning manager such as Lee Atwater (G. H. W. Bush in 1988) or Karl Rove (G. W. Bush). In a brilliant column in RealClearPolitics on Monday, Frank Miele recounted the extent to which Trump is employing the playbook of Saul Alinsky, supreme tactician of the Democratic Left, in attacking the Democrats. Mr. Miele credits Trump with the use of Alinsky’s Rules 3, 4, 8, 9, and 13: “Go outside the expertise of the enemy,” “Make the enemy live up to its own . . . rules,” “Keep the pressure on,” “The threat is more terrifying than” reality, and “Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.” Miele cited as illustrative the threat to send illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities, something that caused the New York Times ’ Tom Friedman to agree that there was a crisis at the border and the liberal vocalist Cher to tweet asking that such people not be sent to Los Angeles. Miele cited Trump’s attacks on the media as maintaining the pressure, and as examples of picking the target, he mentioned his denigrations of “Low energy Jeb Bush,” “Crooked Hillary,” John McCain, CNN, NATO, illegal immigrants, Congress, Democrats, Michael Cohen, Robert Mueller, Robert Corker, James Comey, Kim Jong-Un (“Rocket Man”), and George “Mr. Kellyanne Conway.” He could also have mentioned Senator “Pocahontas” Warren. Trump’s nomination-campaign references to Senator “Lyin’ Ted Cruz” may have contributed to the closeness of the reelection battle Cruz had with the arm-flapping nitwit Beto O’Rourke, whose presidential campaign, as predicted, has sunk without a trace. The Democrats thought they had an Alinskyite opponent in Richard Nixon, but he only tolerated “dirty tricks,” and tactically was more sportsmanlike than history has generally recognized. The Democrats have, evidently, no idea how to deal with this president, and their moral crusade against him is about to be swamped by the unmasking of the skullduggery and chicanery of the Clinton and Obama Democrats in 2016. Advertisement Advertisement
The last fact that the Democrats have not begun to deal with in the effort to unseat the president is his extraordinary success. The economic performance is phenomenal, and the pathetic attempts of President Obama to claim credit for the economic recovery, like his fatuities about “the magic wand,” will be mocked with vicious hilarity. The success of this president in proclaiming a border emergency and doing something about it will be noted. So will Speaker Pelosi’s claims that Trump’s tax bill was a “disaster” of “doggy-do” and that immigration is “a fake crisis” and a border “wall is immoral.” The president is almost sure to win the tussle with North Korea because he has privately made it clear that if Kim resumes progress toward a deployable nuclear ICBM, the three-carrier U.S. task force offshore will eliminate all of North Korea’s nuclear facilities and decalibrate the artillery targeted on Seoul.

"Trump Trade War Will Hurt Poor, Working-Class Americans Most | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Michael Tanner,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-trade-war-china-tariffs-hurt-poor-working-class-americans/,"Follow Michael Tanner on Twitter May 15, 2019 6:30 AM A container ship arrives at Yusen Terminals at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, Calif., January 30, 2019. (Mike Blake/Reuters) Trump’s trade war will hurt poor and working-class Americans the most.
C onventional wisdom holds that it is the “elites” who are opposed to President Trump’s protectionist policies, including his recent ramp-up of tariffs on Chinese goods, and it is true, insofar as support for free trade increases with education and income. But the reality is that poor and working-class Americans will be hurt the most by Trump’s trade war. Advertisement Advertisement
Trump’s insistence to the contrary notwithstanding, most of the cost of tariffs is paid by American consumers (through higher prices), not by the countries being sanctioned. For instance, it is estimated that the president’s latest round of tariffs on China will cost the American family an average of at least $767.
But that cost does not fall equally on poor and rich alike. To state the obvious, $767 means a lot more to a poor family struggling to pay its bills than it does to a wealthy one. Moreover, tariffs are more likely to fall on goods and services that the poor depend on, daily necessities of which they often lack a reserve supply.
Consider that among the companies that have announced they will be most impacted by the China tariffs are Walmart, Target, and Costco, none of which are known as the store of choice for global elites. Advertisement
Studies show that the lower your income is, the harder you’ll be hit by tariffs. Tariffs imposed by Trump last year have already cost poor families 0.33 percent of after-tax income, as opposed to 0.28 percent for wealthy families, and hurt single parents even more than they hurt families. Trump’s latest tariffs will likely be even more regressive. And while each new tariff’s impact is relatively small, they cumulatively take a big hit out of poor people’s income. Advertisement"
Critics Overestimate Prosecutors' Role in Incarceration | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Barry Latzer,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/the-war-on-prosecutors/,"May 15, 2019 6:30 AM A guard escorts inmates at San Quentin state prison in San Quentin, Calif., in 2012. (Lucy Nicholson/Reuters) Critics overestimate DAs’ role in ‘mass incarceration.’
N ow that there’s a truce of sorts in the war on cops, the anti-incarceration Left has found a new enemy: your local district attorney. Progressive reformers still obsessing over so-called mass incarceration think that the best way to reduce imprisonment is to curtail the power of prosecutors’ offices. They believe that prosecutors caused the prison buildup and that DAs persist in maximizing incarceration even though crime is down. These critics are mistaken, and their proposals are unnecessary, risky, and misguided. Advertisement Advertisement
A new book by Emily Bazelon is typical of the anti-prosecutor genre. The title, Charged: The New Movement to Transform American Prosecution and End Mass Incarceration , is revealing. The book is a mix of polemic and illustrative cases, except that the two cases she places under the spotlight don’t prove her point. Neither case demonstrates that prosecutors caused mass incarceration or that they “have breathtaking power, leading to disastrous results for millions of people.”
Bazelon thinks that because the prosecutors could have charged the defendant under any one of three statutes, each carrying prison time — New York’s gun laws are strict but provide for fine distinctions — they have too much discretion. But that discretion is what enabled prosecutors to fashion a rehabilitative outcome. Advertisement
In one of the cases, involving a young black man caught red-handed with an illegal handgun, the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office showed great leniency, agreeing to divert an obviously guilty defendant. With diversion the charges are suspended for a year, then dropped after completion of a community-service program and no further arrests. While Bazelon pushes for a new, progressive type of district attorney, it was an old type of district attorney who set up and maintained Brooklyn’s diversion program 15 years ago.
In Bazelon’s second case, a brutal knife murder in Memphis, the prosecutor did go too far to obtain a conviction. She made an overly aggressive remark in her closing statement at trial, and the conviction was reversed on appeal. But this kind of error is not common, partly because trials are uncommon relative to plea bargains, so it could not have contributed much to mass incarceration. If anything, the case demonstrates the power of courts to check prosecutors. Advertisement
Bazelon thinks that a progressive groundswell will usher in a slew of reformist prosecutors and fix the system. Unlikely. There are over 2,400 elected DAs in the United States, and only a handful of leftists may be expected to garner public support. Advertisement
Another new book on the subject, Rachel Barkow’s Prisoners of Politics , is skeptical about the election solution. But Barkow goes much further than Bazelon; she wants to transfer the powers of local prosecutors to statewide agencies. This would diminish local control over criminal justice, an American tradition that provides responsiveness to community conditions.
More broadly speaking, the obsession of the anti-incarcerationists with prosecutors is misplaced. First of all, the incarceration buildup was a product of the beefing-up of the entire criminal-justice system, not just prosecutors. For instance, the number of prosecutors increased 58 percent from 1974 to 2001. But the number of full-time police rose nearly 95 percent for the same period, and it’s the police who bring offenders into the system. Advertisement
The prosecutors didn’t cause the incarceration buildup; soaring crime and public demand for a more punitive criminal-justice system did. The continuation of the high incarceration rates after the mid-1990s, when crime began to fall, was due to the continuing fear, which was rational: Nobody knew if crime would rise again, as it had in the 1980s. Advertisement
The further decline in crime in the 2000s has led to a contraction of the system. Imprisonment rates have been steadily falling and are now at their lowest point since 1997. Black imprisonment rates tumbled a whopping 29 percent between 2006 and 2016.
Moreover, if one examines the actual time served in prison, and not just initial sentences, one sees that the system is not overly punitive. For all prisoners released in 2016, the median time served was only 1.3 years; the mean was 2.6 years. For violent offenders the median was 2.4 years, the average 4.7 years.
Second, the work of prosecutors is caricatured by the reformers. They assume that prosecutors always seek the harshest punishments, threatening defendants with mandatory sentences in order to extract guilty pleas. In fact, however, prosecutors frequently evade mandatory sentences. The handgun case in Bazelon’s book is a good illustration of this. Numerous empirical studies prove that prosecutors commonly seek alternatives to mandatory sentences where they consider them unjustly harsh, or when defendants are cooperative in conspiracy cases.

"Movie Review: ‘Pasolini’ Explores Disgusting, Brave Work of Filmmaker | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/pasolini-explores-disgusting-brave-work-great-filmmaker/,"May 15, 2019 6:30 AM Willem Dafoe in Pasolini (Kino Lorber) Willem Dafoe plays the radical Italian artist who focused on human depravity, including in himself.
‘I s sex politics?” In the biopic Pasolini , that question is posed to legendary Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini (played by Willem Dafoe), who responds, “In life, everything is politics.” His answer brings this movie close to understanding the discord now roiling American public intercourse. For Pasolini, sex was a metaphor for spiritual dysfunction, the anguished expression of human desire and its opposite, vengeance — that is, politics. Advertisement Advertisement
This ambitious biopic, directed by the renegade American filmmaker Abel Ferrara (whose films Bad Lieutenant , King of New York , The Funeral , and Welcome to New York make him something like an American counterpart to Pasolini), arrives just as unfathomable gamesmanship and political theatrics have frustrated the current administration and discombobulated American society. Pasolini (now playing at Metrograph) explores a filmmaker’s personal and public responsibility in an era when political society races to the bottom. It asks, as did Pasolini himself, How low can we go?
Pasolini’s interest in sexual behavior shocked the polite humanism of the Italian neorealist tradition, starting with his brilliant debut Accattone (1961) and then Mamma Roma (1962), The Hawks and the Sparrows (1966), and his final film Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1977). He deserves a biopic because his audacity helps us think through the vindictive motivations of the recent political backbiting that ignores everyday social problems in favor of settling personal grievances and grabbing partisan power. Advertisement
For a culture that overthrows the sacred for the political, Pasolini’s vision of the profane takes on fresh relevance. Ferrara and Dafoe probably did not intend their very personal, Eurocentric drama to reflect American turmoil. But Dafoe, perfectly cast as the bespectacled Pasolini, speaks with a timbre that recalls how Arthur Kennedy’s middle-American intonations in Lawrence of Arabia reoriented a foreign experience, giving it American immediacy.
Ferrara sets his essay-film just before the artist’s death, when Pasolini is at a desperate point, only days before releasing the sure-to-be-controversial Salò . Pasolini questions his own aesthetic ideas and political philosophies as a poet and cineaste. The film shifts into fantasy sequences of a proposed novel about sexual libertinism and Italian history. It’s a jumble of ideas centered on images of Italian Fascist art. Advertisement
Awed by Pasolini’s sharp perspective, Ferrara and Dafoe take a respectful approach that is not an artistic failure so much as an indication that we live in a period when it’s difficult to ascertain the complexity of political and artistic radicalism. (What’s that? Marvel and Pixar fans might ask.) Ferrara and Dafoe confront an important quandary: that liberals might be as afraid to look deeply into the human abyss as conservatives are. Advertisement
Ferrara starts by dealing with Salò , Pasolini’s most extreme film — a key work of political provocation and anxiety (as a clip in Godard’s The Image Book indicated). Whereas Nanni Moretti’s Caro Diario (1993) paid sentimental homage to Pasolini’s violent death, the explicit clips from Salò permit Ferrara to portray Pasolini’s rough-trade sex life — made all the more startling by Dafoe’s appetitive smile. A scene of raunchy street sex that fades to morbid black, followed by daylight shots of the famous Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana, connects debased behavior to the high artistic aspiration of Italian Fascist art. The Palazzo, built by Mussolini in 1935, bears the inscription “A nation of poets, of artists, of heroes, of thinkers, of scientists, of navigators, of migrants,” about which Pasolini had to be ambivalent.
Pasolini is the only great director to make a movie as truly disgusting as Salò , a political allegory that explicitly depicts outrageous scenes from its source material, a 1785 novel by the Marquis de Sade. As the most audaciously realistic and yet inventive political filmmaker, Pasolini converted Sade’s wicked theology into a parable and critique of Fascism as a system that corrupts even its own doctrine. Salò ’s conceit is also an unsettling rebuke of the threat that Marxist Pasolini saw in his political adversaries who blurred the line between power and insensitivity. (It was Pasolini who directed both the Bach-influenced The Gospel According to St. Matthew and the ribald Second Coming allegory Teorema— a title that translates Pasolini’s allegorical reasoning as “Theorem.”) Advertisement Advertisement
Set in the Salò Republic, the Italian puppet state of Nazi Germany, Salò begins with a unique preamble of footnotes (including by Roland Barthes) to validate its portrayal of the last days of Mussolini’s regime. Pasolini takes an intellectual view of the fictionalized exploits of several town nobles who use their authority to commandeer young members of the Italian resistance and submit them to sexual humiliation, physical and mental torture, and murder.
Salò demonstrates Ferrara and Dafoe’s pronouncement: “Narrative art, as you well know, is dead. This is a parable. The meaning of the parable is the relation of the author to the form he creates.” Salò ’s four sequences (Anteinferno, Circle of Mania, Circle of Shit, Circle of Blood) evoke Dante’s Inferno . This high-brow stuff (even quoting Ezra Pound’s Cantos ) gets quite low down. It’s an atrocity exhibition. That explains Ferrara and Dafoe’s valiant attempt to extrapolate from inside Pasolini’s mind. Among Salò ’s most unsettling aspects is the incontestable fact that this alarming film shows Pasolini bravely admitting his own depraved temptation. His social criticism did not lack self-awareness.

AFL-CIO Marxism: A Daft Class Analysis | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/afl-cio-marxism-daft-class-analysis/,"May 15, 2019 6:30 AM Freight trucks on the road in Detroit, Mich. (Rebecca Cook / Reuters) The union enjoins workers to seize the means of production — of which they already own a great deal.
T he AFL-CIO, whose constituents once expended some effort expelling the Communists from their ranks, apparently has decided on another course and is now using its social-media accounts to distribute Marxist propaganda . This comes hot on the heels of the same organization suggesting guillotines as the solution to the nation’s economic troubles. Advertisement
There are many objections to this line of thinking, beginning with the 100 million people the champions of this philosophy murdered in the 20th century and the horrors they are inflicting today on the people of Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea. Our friends on the left like to lecture conservatives about the occasional outburst of violent rhetoric in our midst, and they are not entirely wrong to do so. But what the AFL-CIO refers to here is not violent rhetoric but actual violence in the form of mass murder.
Beyond the niggling details of gulags, the Holodomor, anti-Semitic purges, etc., there’s also the matter of hilarious illiteracy.
The daft little propaganda video the union is circulating features a very confident young man identified as “Dan Whelan: Marxist, roofer,” who is here to explain that the existence of the middle class is a great fiction perpetrated on the feckless victims of American capitalism in order to blind them to the truth of relations between labor and capital as understood in Marxist orthodoxy. Advertisement
The working class, Whelan explains, consists of all those who “sell their time and skills to members of the ownership class,” irrespective of the kind of work they do. Under this analysis, “working class” encompasses roofers, farmworkers, factory labor, and industrial personnel — and also most of the investment bankers down at Goldman Sachs, and the lawyers around the corner from them, and the AI scientists at Google, who also sell their time and skills to the owners of companies. Advertisement
A definition of “working class” that lumps in pickers of peaches with writers of algorithms is functionally useless and intellectually sterile — except in the context of a narrow ideological framework such as Marxism. Marxism is predicated upon certain notions of class interest, and it is difficult to imagine, say, M&A lawyers having a great deal in common as a matter of class interest with over-the-road truckers.
Or maybe the truckers should be excluded from the working class. Many of them are owner-operators, and as owners of capital are excluded from the working class in this analysis. So, truckers are the capitalist class, and neurosurgeons are the working class. Advertisement
What about teachers? Advertisement
The middle class, which is said not to exist, turns out to own a great deal of capital. Among the nation’s largest institutional investors — owners of capital — are organizations such as CalPERS and CalSTRS, which invest on behalf of teachers and other government employees in California. Investment funds representing public employees, unions, and the like are very large holders of capital. Other large institutional investors include funds such as Vanguard Asset Management (second only to BlackRock in assets) through which a great many ordinary people with ordinary jobs invest in publicly traded companies.
The AFL-CIO, repeating a slogan under which millions of people have been murdered, advises that working people “seize the means of production.” But they already own a considerable amount, and there is nothing stopping them from buying more. You need the AFL-CIO’s permission to work in a closed union shop, but there is no similar gatekeeper blocking anybody’s access to the stock market. They’ll sell shares to anybody who wants them. Capitalists do not discriminate. Unions do. Ask around in Philadelphia.
When Barack Obama was president, certain Republicans spoke of the “carnage” of American life, while Democrats sang the praises of a rising stock market; now that Donald Trump is president, the roles have been roughly reversed. (Let us set aside, for the moment, the risible and primitive superstition that the performance of the economy is a quasi-divine judgment on the president and his performance in office.) The American middle class is right out there, sited prettily easily in the suburbs of Houston or Boston, in the aisles of the Home Depot or Whole Foods, at the bank, watching Game of Thrones . The middle class has its ups and downs, its triumphs and disappointments, comforts and anxieties — that’s what being in the middle is all about. Advertisement"

In my posting yesterday on the White House immigration proposal that’s expected to be rolled out as soon as this week, I quoted Politico to the effect that a “ senior administration official ” said “ that immigration restrictionists are a ‘pretty fringe’ group that have not ‘been an important part of the president’s base.’ ” The point of this anonymous comment (which I’ve been given to understand did not come from Kushner) was to dismiss as irrelevant those concerned that the proposal is not expected to include even a token reduction in the level of legal immigration. Advertisement Advertisement
This is obvious balderdash, but I neglected to include some very recent polling data that debunks it. The April Harvard Harris poll (no fringe group) asked “ Which of the following should be the top priority for President Trump? ” and included “ Reducing the total amount of immigrants allowed in the United States. ” (You’d think Harvard, of all places, would know the distinction between “ amount ” and “ number, ” but I digress.) The other nine options were the usual — build the border wall, stimulate jobs, trade deals, infrastructure, repeal Obamacare, tax reform, etc.
( See the full results here — the “ top priority ” responses are on p. 157 of the PDF, which is numbered on the document as p. 155.) Advertisement
Even among all registered voters, reducing immigration tied for third place with building the wall, after only “ stimulating American jobs ” and “ passing an infrastructure spending bill. ” But among Republicans, conservatives, and Trump voters, reducing immigration was the top priority for one in five, second only (and by just a couple of points) to building the wall, and ahead of all the other, more establishment-oriented priorities like the Iran deal, ISIS, tax reform, infrastructure, ahead even of more populist goals like repealing Obamacare and renegotiating trade deals.

Harvard Deans Fired: Right to Counsel Under Fire by Left | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonathan S.

Sullivan Jr. (left) and Jose Baez attend a hearing for film producer Harvey Weinstein in New York City, N.Y., January 25, 2019. (Steven Hirsch/Reuters) Harvard follows in the ACLU’s footsteps by ditching deans who are defending Harvey Weinstein.
N ext year, Boston will have the opportunity to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Boston Massacre. The victims in the confrontation and shooting outside the Boston Customs House have long been considered the first casualties of the American Revolution, and the fact that one of the fallen was an African American (Crispus Attucks) helped make the incident even more relevant in recent decades. Advertisement Advertisement
However, one of the most important lessons of the massacre won’t get the same respect it did in the past: the importance of the right to counsel.
When the British soldiers who had fired into the crowd on the night of March 5, 1770, were put on trial, it was John Adams — one of Boston’s top lawyers and a leading member of the Patriot political faction that had helped incite the protests against the government — who took their case. His successful defense of the most unpopular defendants in the colonies at the time was the moment when the future president entered history. And by choosing to face down the hostile mob of fellow Patriots organized by his cousin Sam Adams, he also stood for a principle — the right to effective counsel — that has become a hallmark of the American legal system.
But Adams’s alma mater, Harvard University, has broken with the spirit of what he achieved. In a shocking development, the school announced last weekend that their first African-American faculty deans would be terminated. Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and his wife, Stephanie Robinson, may continue to teach at Harvard Law. But they lost their jobs as deans because of their decision to join the defense team of former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who faces charges of sexual misconduct. Advertisement
Rhakesh Khurana, the dean of Harvard College, described the decision as a result of concerns about “the climate” at Winthrop House, the institution that Sullivan and Robinson had led since 2009. While there was some attempt to portray the pair as having been the subject of prior controversies, there was little doubt that the main reason for climate change at Winthrop was the fact that the two legal scholars had become part of a new “dream team” that would attempt to keep the country’s most notorious #MeToo villain out of prison. Advertisement
Student protests about Sullivan and Robinson’s legal activities had been in the news throughout the last semester, with a small but vocal group calling for Sullivan’s resignation as dean. Critics of the lawyers vented their anger in graffiti depicting slogans such as “down with Sullivan,” “our rage is self-defense,” and “whose side are you on?” Advertisement
Those against Sullivan and Robinson weren’t objecting in principle to their defending controversial clients. During the last decade, while both taught at Harvard Law and presided over Winthrop House, Sullivan — who has specialized in attempts to overturn what he considers to be wrongful convictions — represented Ussaamah Rahim, an accused terrorist who had been shot by the Boston Police.
But Weinstein was the first controversial Sullivan client who fit into categories toward which academic elites are generally unsympathetic. The former Hollywood mogul is the poster child for #MeToo villainy, with more than 80 women having alleged that he was guilty of sexual misconduct against them, up to and including rape. Advertisement
Sullivan clearly expected students to understand that even the most repulsive defendants are entitled to legal representation. But he underestimated two factors. Advertisement
First, the presumption of innocence has been undermined by the #MeToo movement that took off in the fall of 2017 — a movement catalyzed by the accusations against Weinstein. The increased attention paid to all forms of sexual harassment and assault was long overdue. But #MeToo brought with it the idea that one must simply “believe accusers.” Crowd-sourced accusations, such as those on the the so-called Sh***y Media Men list, trafficked in unsubstantiated charges of misconduct and threatened to end careers with no due process whatsoever.
This was very much in tune with the way that sexual-misconduct cases have been handled on college campuses. At many if not most institutions of higher education, the accused have been subjected to a process that required them to prove their innocence rather than the other way around, and that shielded accusers from questioning.
Indeed, some of those who defended Sullivan’s firing by Harvard said that his defense of someone accused of sexual misconduct was in conflict with his status as a dean responsible for the welfare of the students who lived, ate, and socialized at Winthrop House. According to one student writing in the New York Times , Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein would discourage victims from coming forward and “infringe on students’ safety.” Advertisement
But the negative “climate” at Harvard is not solely related to #MeToo’s influence. A shift in the culture of political liberalism is also part of the story. Advertisement
With conservatives asserting their First Amendment rights in cases seeking to push back against the power of big government and a politically correct legal establishment, liberals have lost faith in the defense of civil liberties for their own sake. Justice Elena Kagan has complained of conservatives’ “weaponizing” the First Amendment, as if it were valid only if used in the service of the Left. The American Civil Liberties Union, once the stalwart defender of the free-speech rights of Nazis as well as labor unions, has recently signaled that it will not expend resources defending anyone associated with a cause that the liberal group opposes.
The result is an atmosphere where the actions of John Adams — the legal defense of the despised — either are impossible or result in serious censure. Advertisement"

(Loren Elliott/Reuters)
Kamala Harris wants to ban the importation of what she calls “ AR-15-style assault weapons. ” Per Politico :
At a presidential campaign event Wednesday in New Hampshire, Harris pledged to take executive action banning the importation of AR-15-style assault weapons — a move that came just three weeks after the California Democrat rolled out her sweeping gun-control proposal.
Er, why? The majority of “ AR-15-style ” weapons — also known as “ the most commonly owned rifles in America ” — are built in . . . America. Suppose that Harris became president and enjoyed the authority to prevent the importation of whatever arbitrary set of features she found the time to string together into an order. What exactly does she think would happen next? The demand for modern sporting rifles is pretty high already, and it would presumably get considerably higher if the President of the United States were running around explaining that she hoped to ban them. Should imports be banned, that demand would be met by American manufacturers. And then what?"

The State Department on Wednesday ordered all non-critical government employees to leave Iraq and warned American citizens not to travel to the country over fears that growing tensions between the Trump administration and neighboring Iran could spark a conflict endangering them.
In a statement announcing the decision, officials cited a “high risk for violence and kidnapping” and said “normal visa services will be temporarily suspended” at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and the U.S. consulate in Erbil. Some employees in Baghdad “will continue to provide consular services to U.S. citizens in Basrah,” the statement said.
The move comes a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made an unannounced trip to Baghdad, meeting with Iraqi officials and discussing the “importance of Iraq ensuring that it’s able to adequately protect Americans in their country.”
Pompeo said he made the visit also to warn Iraq about U.S. intelligence that suggested Iran was planning strikes on U.S. forces in the country. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“We don’t want anyone interfering in their country, certainly not by attacking another nation inside of Iraq, and there was complete agreement,” Pompeo said. “These were attacks that were imminent, these were attacks that were going to happen fairly soon. We’ve learned about them and we’re taking every action to deter them.”

Josh Hawley: GOP Needs Populist Shift to 'Great American Middle' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/josh-hawley-calls-on-gop-to-revitalize-great-american-middle-in-maiden-floor-speech/,"May 15, 2019 12:30 PM Senator Josh Hawley (R, Mo.) in Springfield, Mo., September 21, 2018. (Mike Segar/Reuters)
Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri took to the Senate floor Wednesday morning for his first floor speech, decrying the Republican party’s sclerotic reliance on Reagan-era free-market orthodoxy and advocating a populist move toward the “great American middle.”
Channeling the anti-elitist current that swept President Trump into the Oval Office, Hawley lambasted America’s academics, media figures, video-game designers, financiers, entertainers, and pharmaceutical executives, casting them as uncaring “aristocrats” who have chosen profit over patriotism time and time again, for decades.
“Today’s society benefits those who shaped it, and it has been shaped not by working men and women, but by the aristocratic elite,” he said, reading from prepared remarks obtained by National Review . “Big banks, big tech, big multi-national corporations, along with their allies in the academy and media — these are the aristocrats of our age. They live in the United States, but they consider themselves citizens of the world. They operate businesses or run universities here, but their primary loyalty is elsewhere, to their own agenda for a more unified, progressive — and profitable — global order.”
Just months into his tenure as a freshman senator, Hawley has already begun to cement his reputation as a gadfly among congressional Republicans by urging a more active role for the government in reversing the cultural and economic losses suffered in recent years by Americans like those he grew up with.
“If you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your goals are not to found a tech startup but to carry on the family business, to serve on the PTA and in your local church, well, you’re told you’re not a success, and you’re on your own.” Hawley said. “This is hardly an accident. The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, who set the tone for our popular culture, all belong to the same class. This economy has been their economy. They made it for themselves.”
“But in places like the one where I grew up in middle Missouri, good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on are moving away,” he added.
Hawley’s populist leanings and distrust of status-quo Republican politics have found expression in a number of unorthodox bills, none more so than legislation he introduced last week that would prohibit video-game makers from “exploiting children” by encouraging them to spend money in order to advance in a particular game.

Google and Facebook have also emerged as favorite targets of Hawley’s populist ire.

Donald Trump's Joe Biden Attacks are Fair | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/why-donald-trump-is-right-to-attack-joe-biden/,"Follow Matthew Continetti on Twitter May 15, 2019 1:12 PM President Donald Trump speaks at the 38th Annual National Peace Officers Memorial Service on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., May 15, 2019.

Advisers to President Trump worry he’s spending too much time attacking Joe Biden, the New York Times reports. “Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mr. Biden have defied the pleadings of his own aides, who think almost any other candidate would be easier to defeat, and left Republicans puzzled while delighting Biden supporters,” write Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman. They quote Democratic congressman Cedric Richmond, who says, “It just shows everybody that the vice president is the candidate Trump is most concerned about.” Advertisement Advertisement
Well, okay. But if Representative Richmond ever found himself concerned about an opponent — he won in his gerrymandered district last year by 72 points — wouldn’t he attempt to head off the threat? It’s not as though Trump waited for Hillary Clinton to win the Democratic nomination before beginning his campaign against her. Nor is Trump focusing exclusively on Biden. He’s gone after Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, and Elizabeth Warren, too. Biden’s front-runner status is why he receives the most attention from the president."

(In this post , I explained why I found Judge Hudson’s initial ruling deeply troublesome in several respects.) Advertisement Advertisement
Kudos to Judge Hudson for having the humility to recognize his error and to correct it.
According to the article, Hudson intends to address at trial factual disputes that supposedly bear on whether the physicians-only law imposes an “undue burden.” For the reasons stated in point 1 of my previous post, I believe that existing Supreme Court precedents entitle Virginia to a ruling in its favor as a matter of law.

Trump’s China Trade Policy: U.S. Needs to Get Smart on Tariffs | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-trade-policy-china-tariffs/,"May 15, 2019 5:16 PM President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. (Damir Sagolj/REUTERS)
P resident Trump has some bipartisan support for playing hardball with China over trade, and it’s easy to see why. The Chinese regime has pursued mercantilist policies that harm Americans (and others in the developed world), notably through the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology. It is also now clear that policymakers in both parties had too optimistic a view of how rapidly China’s integration into global markets would improve the character of its government. Chinese trade negotiators seem also to have surprised their American counterparts by retracting concessions they had already made. While their tactics may have been a response to mixed signals they got from the Trump administration, they are not ones that should be rewarded. Advertisement Advertisement
Trump responded to the setback in talks by raising tariffs, and China reciprocated. The escalation of the trade war poses increasing risk to our economy, as stocks have been signaling. The best course for the U.S. now would be to reach a swift resolution in the current talks — getting back to the deal that seemed to be on the table before China miscalculated — and then switch to a strategy for changing Chinese behavior that does not depend so thoroughly on possibly backfiring tariffs.
The president has already hinted at what such a strategy would look like when urging companies to move their supply chains from China to other countries such as Vietnam. That suggestion was doubtless glib, overlooking the costs of re-siting and the distinctive advantages that can accompany investment in China. The intuition that trade with other countries in the region can be useful in exerting pressure on China is, however, correct. It is the same thought that underlaid the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The president took the U.S. out of it, in part because he did not focus on its utility in reshaping the economic environment in favor of our economic model rather than China’s. But the other countries involved are moving ahead with the idea, and we should find a face-saving way to revive our participation. Trump has reportedly been open to this suggestion. Advertisement"

Editor’s Note: The following is adapted from Jim Geraghty’s presentation earlier this week to the Austrian National Defense Academy, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the University of Vienna.
I t is absolutely fair game and legal — in free countries, at least — for anyone to get online and say whatever he wants about American presidential candidates. If you want to say this candidate is a fool and that candidate is a bad guy, you’re perfectly free to do so. Advertisement Advertisement
What you cannot do is go online and pose as someone else. And if you’re a foreign intelligence service, we really don’t want you impersonating citizens of our free society in a surreptitious effort to sway public opinion, and even elections. Using deception to mask a foreign effort to influence an election violates the United States’ election laws. In 2018, 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies were indicted on a variety of charges, including criminal conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft — all in attempt to influence our elections.
The Internet Research Agency, or IRA, is Russia’s primary tool for spreading disinformation and propaganda on the Internet. Beginning in 2013 and accelerating from 2014 to 2016, the IRA used social-media accounts and phony interest groups to sow discord in the United States through what it called “information warfare.”
In 2015, Marat Burkhard, a former employee of the IRA, spoke publicly about his time there , describing hundreds of people working twelve-hour shifts at the IRA headquarters in Saint Petersburg. He described the IRA recruiting people who could write and construct arguments in foreign languages. They were expected to write 135 comments or messages per twelve-hour shift, some assigned to argue in favor of the Russian government’s point of view persuasively and others assigned to argue against the Russian government’s point of view badly. He was himself assigned to write 135 posts about President Barack Obama chewing gum and spitting it out, and told to use a lot of profanity. The IRA began with message boards and website comment sections and eventually migrated to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Advertisement
Separately, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army — known by the abbreviation GRU — hacked into the Democratic National Committee, which is the organization that runs Democratic presidential primaries, and the private email accounts of figures associated with Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
One of their intrusions into these email accounts was frighteningly simple. On March 19, 2016, the chairman of the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, John Podesta, was sent an email that said
Hi John
Someone just used your password to try ˜to sign in to your Google Account john.podesta@gmail.com.
Google stopped this sign-in attempt. You should change your password immediately.
CHANGE PASSWORD –
It offered a link to a site that looked like a password-reset form . . . where the bad guys could steal his new password, log into his account, and copy all of the emails in there. Advertisement Advertisement
This story gets worse. Podesta’s chief of staff forwarded the email to the operations help desk of Clinton’s campaign in Brooklyn, where a staffer wrote back concluding, “This is a legitimate email. John needs to change his password immediately.” The email looked genuine enough to fool the young tech guy who was supposed to know the real messages from the fake ones. In an effort to prevent his email from getting hacked, Podesta opened the door for his email to get hacked.
Which isn’t to say it was all that clever. If you need to change your email password, you can just go into the settings and change the password. You don’t have to click on any special link embedded in an email. The Clinton campaign’s operations help desk should have caught that.
This is called “spearphishing,” and the idea is to send messages to everyone in an organization and hope that at least one person chooses to follow their instructions. There’s an old saying that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Similarly, an institution’s computer network is only as secure as the most gullible people using it, and unfortunately for the Clinton campaign, that turned out to be Podesta and the help-desk staffer. Advertisement
On April 12, 2016, the GRU gained access to the computer network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), using credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully “spearphished” the week before. The committee focuses on electing Democrats to the House of Representatives, and they share a virtual private network with the Democratic National Committee, which oversees elections at all levels — House, Senate, state governors, and the president. Once the Russians could get into the DCCC, they could get into the Democratic National Committee. That’s how they got the second batch of emails that they revealed to the public through WikiLeaks.
Now let’s turn to what Russia’s Internet Research Agency was doing on social-media networks. Advertisement Advertisement
Facebook
From Saint Petersburg, the Internet Research Agency started creating “groups” on Facebook that normal users could join. All told, they created 470 Facebook groups meant to exploit political tensions around the U.S. elections. Most of these groups had names that sounded similar to existing political activist groups: “Tea Party News,” “Blacktivist,” “LGBT United,” “Stand for Freedom,” “United Muslims of America.” One of these groups, “Heart of Texas,” proposed that Texas secede from the United States and take the rest of the Southern states with them.
Some of these groups ended up attracting a lot of members. By the time Facebook deactivated them in mid 2017, the IRA’s “United Muslims of America” Facebook group had more than 300,000 followers, the “Don’t Shoot Us” group had more than 250,000 followers, the “Being Patriotic” group had more than 200,000 followers, and the “Secured Borders” group had more than 130,000 followers. Of course, it is worth keeping in mind that not everyone who joins a group on Facebook pays that much attention to it.
According to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee , IRA-related pages created roughly 80,000 pieces of content — basically, posts and graphics — and this content was seen by more than 126 million Americans. Advertisement
At first, that sounds terrifying. But there are a few caveats we should keep in mind. First, the majority of those Facebook pages and groups had almost no engagements or reaction from actual users. The top 20 IRA-created Facebook pages received 99 percent of the engagements. The IRA approach was to throw everything against the wall and see what would stick. They spent three dollars or less on about half of their ads. They would put it out there, see if it got any reaction, and if it did, they would spend more to get it in front of more people; if not, they would drop it and move on to another idea.
It’s also important keep in mind that we’re dealing with content that was created by Russians who, by and large, had studied American culture and politics only from a distance. The result was a lot of posts that were so exaggerated, so over-the-top, that they seemed too ridiculous to be genuinely persuasive. For example, a group called the “Army of Jesus” posted photoshopped pictures of Hillary Clinton, with devil horns protuding from her forehead, about to box with Jesus.
In fact, most of the materials generated by “Army of Jesus” are in this same over-the-top tone. If images like those influenced your decision, you were pretty likely to vote against Clinton already. Advertisement
In fact, we know that these ads weren’t reaching people who were genuinely undecided. Facebook is constantly collecting information about its users, including age, gender, education and income level, job title, relationship status, hobbies, political leanings, favorite TV shows and movies, what kind of car they drive, and what kinds of products they buy. This is what makes the site attractive to advertisers: You can target and reach a particular kind of person.
The Russians weren’t so interested in targeting undecided people with their intense, divisive messages. They were more interested in amping up the anger and enthusiasm of people who already had political opinions.
We know from Facebook’s records that the IRA targeted people by location, job title, and preexisting political interest. One ad set from late September and early October 2016 targeted people in regions of Pennsylvania, ages 18 to 65, whose interests included “Donald Trump” and who had the job title “coal miner.” Being so precise may have hurt them; that ad was seen by 1,225 people, and only 77 people clicked on it.
Russian social-media efforts also focused on Bernie Sanders supporters who were frustrated by his narrow loss in the primaries to Hillary Clinton. One of the images the Russians used to court Sanders supporters, particularly targeted at Facebook users who were identified as gay and lesbian, was of a cartoon Sanders as a bright-yellow bodybuilder.
Bernie Sanders is not bright yellow like a character on the Simpsons, and he is not a bodybuilder. In the United States, we don’t make bodybuilders president; we just make them governor of California. That ad was seen by only 848 people and only 54 people clicked on it.
Having created these groups, the Internet Research Agency tried to organize protests and rallies. They would announce an event, promote it — they spent about $100,000 on advertising on Facebook. And then, when they found someone in the United States who reacted enthusiastically, they’d say that they couldn’t make it to the event and they’d ask that person to take over coordinating the event. Some of these operations were more successful than others — a few had about 200 people turn out, and some had almost no one. Advertisement
Some of the Russian efforts were clumsy, unsuccessful, and just plain weird. One plan was to recruit someone to walk around New York City dressed up as Santa Claus in a Donald Trump mask. It seems they believed this would get people in New York, which Clinton won 79 percent to 18 percent, to vote for Trump.
The recently completed report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller determined that, on several occasions, Trump campaign officials retweeted, shared, or otherwise promoted pro-Trump messages from IRA accounts, not knowing that they were generated from Saint Petersburg. That’s a little unnerving, but it illustrates a reality of modern political campaigns: If somebody on social media is saying that your candidate is great, you don’t often spend much time checking that person out; you just retweet or share it with your audience because you want to believe that this reflects genuine grassroots enthusiasm for your candidate.
One fact that’s been overlooked in much of the public discussion over Russian efforts on Facebook is that, while 44 percent of total ad impressions (number of times ads were displayed) were posted before the U.S. election on November 8, 2016, the other 56 percent came after the election. Roughly 25 percent of the ads were never shown to anyone because Facebook’s algorithm didn’t deem them relevant to any users.
Some of the ads that ran after the election were designed to stir up opposition to Trump. During the election, Russian efforts aimed to promote Trump over Hillary Clinton, but the ultimate goal of the Russians was not merely a Trump presidency; it was to have American society as divided and angry as possible. The more divided we are, the less likely we are to effectively stand up to them when they do something we oppose.
Twitter
If you’re on Twitter long enough, and particularly if you write about politics, you will get a reaction from someone, or maybe multiple people, whose Twitter identities are a name, initial, and seven or eight random numbers. Often, but not always, those folks will have something nasty to say to you.
Back in August 2017, one social-media analyst studied accounts that used two hashtags, “#UniteTheRight” and “#FireMcMaster” (referring to former U.S. national security adviser H. R. McMaster, who was seen as a particularly tough-on-Russia figure in the first year of the Trump administration). He found 824 accounts with handles that used a name and random digits. Then he collected all the followers of those Twitter accounts, and all the followers of those followers. He found more than 63,000 accounts that were using “Marcus,” “Margaret,” and other names followed by random numbers.
One of the users who had the most of these accounts following him, named “David Jones,” claimed to be a pro-Brexit activist who lived on the Isle of Wight. The analyst found that “David Jones” always tweeted all day long from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Moscow time. Almost like it was his job or something . And “David Jones” seemed to feel strongly that Ukraine should not join the EU and that the United Kingdom needed to “team up with Russia to put the EU in its place.”
By January 2018, Twitter publicly identified 3,814 Twitter accounts associated with the IRA. According to Twitter, in the ten weeks before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, these accounts posted approximately 175,993 tweets, “approximately 8.4 percent of which were election-related.” This means that 91 percent of the tweets weren’t election-related. Maybe the IRA folks figured out that to be seen as a believable account, they had to tweet about non-political topics as well.
Twitter also announced that it had notified approximately 1.4 million people who may have been in contact with an IRA-controlled account.
And it gets worse. Once Twitter identified the IRA-controlled Twitter accounts, one group of media-watchers and technology analysts decided to investigate how many of those IRA accounts were quoted by professional news organizations . They looked at 33 news outlets; 32 quoted at least one IRA account. And few corners of the media were spared: The left-of-center Huffington Post quoted them 16 times, the right-of-center Daily Caller quoted them 15 times. USA Today , nine times. Most of the time, the tweets were quoted as examples of public opinion. Advertisement
The study noted that the liberal outlets often mocked right-leaning IRA accounts. Russian users in Saint Petersburg were providing the ridiculous over-the-top “conservative” perspective that liberal publications wanted to see. Liberal publications treated them as if they were real. “Don’t treat everything you read on the Internet at face value,” isn’t just good advice for ordinary users; it is a message that some professional journalists need to hear.
Instagram
Much like their activity on Facebook, while the Russians created a lot of pages on Instagram, some had a huge level of engagement while the majority had almost none. Forty pages received 99 percent of the 185 million “likes” received by IRA content.
It is possible that the IRA’s Instagram engagement was the result of “click farms,” an artificial way of generating lots of clicks, shares, and other engagement.
Interestingly, there was less media coverage of Russia’s efforts on Instagram compared with Facebook and Twitter. This is for three reasons. First, while Facebook and Twitter combine visuals and written text, Instagram is more photography-focused, which leaves less room for political messaging. Second, Instagram’s content focuses less on politics and recent events, so the people using it are less likely to react to political messaging. Third, the Instagram user population is younger. A study earlier this year calculated that 60 percent of its users are between 18 and 24 years old, and 90 percent are younger than 35. Younger voters are less likely to show up on Election Day. If you’re seeking to influence voters, you may decide that the Instagram users aren’t as high a priority as Facebook or Twitter users.
YouTube
The IRA appears to have begun making YouTube videos in September 2015, producing 1,107 videos across 17 channels. A few channels were active until July 2017. Interestingly, the IRA YouTube effort focused overwhelmingly on one topic: 96 percent of its channels’ content related to Black Lives Matter and police brutality. Some have speculated that because African Americans generally vote Democratic and would be more likely to vote for Hillary, the IRA messaging aimed at these communities didn’t mention the election. Those that did mention the election pushed the message that Hillary Clinton was a liar, that there was no difference between Clinton and Trump, and that African Americans should stay home because neither candidate “deserved” their vote.
Russia blazed the path here, but other countries and regimes are following. In August 2018, Twitter announced it had suspended 770 accounts — all appearing to originate in Iran, with potential ties to its government — for engaging in “coordinated manipulation.” Facebook and YouTube similarly spotted and took down Iranian content , some of which had been linked to state-owned media.
These accounts were uncovered not by the NSA or other U.S. law-enforcement agencies but by a private cybersecurity firm. The firm figured out that the contact emails for sites such as the “Liberty Front Press” and “Instituto Manquehue” were associated with advertisements for website designers in Tehran and with Iranian sites. They found supposedly American Twitter accounts that were linked to phone numbers with the Iranian country code. And they found a number of accounts, supposedly belonging to American Sanders supporters, heavily promoting Quds Day, a holiday established by Iran in 1979 to express support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.
Again, the people who do this sort of thing are often clumsy and sloppy. They’re heavy-handed with their propaganda because the client — meaning the foreign government — doesn’t want nuance or a balanced perspective. They’re trying to imitate the tone of a person in a country that isn’t their own, and it often shows.
So why don’t social-media companies just ban these accounts? In most cases, as the companies identify these accounts, they do. But we should keep in mind the difficulty of the task.
It doesn’t take much time or cost any money to set up a Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram account. You don’t have to pass any background check other than maybe providing a phone number. Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram want people to be able to set up accounts easily and at no cost. Advertisement
But this means that the bad guys can set up accounts quickly and easily too. Facebook can shut down one account and they can go and set up another one with a new name.
Social-media advertising that is secretly funded or run by foreign intelligence is going to be tough to stamp out. It’s not hard for a foreign intelligence service to move money to some front company, group, or individual, and have them start pumping out memes and messages to favor one candidate, attack another, or divide Americans or any other group of voters.
So how can we respond to this?
One bit of good news is that United States government is on the case. Before Election Day 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Cyber Command announced that it would be sending text messages, emails, and pop-ups to Russian operatives meddling in the midterm elections, informing them that their actions were being monitored — sort of a “shot across their bow” to signal that we know who they are, what they’re doing, and how to find them.
Then, on Election Day 2018, the professional trolls at Internet Research Agency in Saint Petersburg showed up for work and could not access the Internet. At all. For two days, they couldn’t log on to any of their social-media accounts.
Maybe this was U.S. Department of Defense’s Cyber Command. Maybe this was the United States National Security Agency. Or maybe some Russian just tripped over a wire and unplugged something.
For whatever reason, the Internet Research Agency could not spread any rumors about illegal votes being cast or votes not being counted or anything else to undermine public faith in the election.
But what do we do if we’re not working at Cyber Command or the NSA, or in cybersecurity at one of the big social media companies?
Again, most producers of disinformation on social media are pretty clumsy. Earlier this year, someone forwarded me an email that claimed to tell the tale of two Americans who went to Paris and found streets filled with trash, African and Middle Eastern refugees everywhere, Muslims putting down prayer mats and praying on the subway, and that the Louvre was deserted except for the army on patrol. The email clearly meant to deliver the message that Paris was overrun by refugees and terrorists and that we can’t let that happen to our country. It included some photos that were allegedly taken by the couple.
I did an image-search on Google for all of the photos in the email and found that the photos were mostly from a riot in Calais in 2016. The picture of a praying guy was from Copenhagen, Denmark. My favorite was an image that supposedly showed a guy urinating on the Paris Metro. The map on the inside of the car shows the New York subway system.
The people who generate this sort of disinformation tend to be sloppy.
But perhaps most important, disinformation doesn’t work on people who already know the truth. If I try to persuade you that your president has two heads, you’re probably not going to believe me. You’ve already seen your president and you can count.
The best defense against disinformation is a better-informed and less credulous public that doesn’t automatically believe everything they read on the Internet and doesn’t gleefully share any information they encounter that reaffirms their preconceptions.
The person who sent me that email about Paris and immigrants felt embarrassed for being fooled and angry at the person who sent it to them. There’s room for legitimate debate about immigration, refugees, security, terrorism, multiculturalism, and assimilation. You can’t advance that debate by making up a story and looking around for any photo you can find that makes someone with dark skin look bad.
Those of us in the news media have a duty to keep our eyes on what’s being spread around social media and to carefully and even-handedly separate truth from fiction. Fact-checking is important, and it’s also really important to not be condescending or snide to the people who may be initially fooled by provocative posts. If you attack someone or call him a fool, he’s going to dig in further.
Forewarned is forearmed. We know that it’s very likely that Moscow and other hostile regimes are going to try stunts like this again. Now it’s easier to call them out when a Twitter account named with a random sequence of numbers is suddenly passionately arguing in favor of Russia’s position. Advertisement
Russia, like any other regime in an unfree country seeking to influence the elections and political decisions of free countries, has a lot of tools to spread disinformation. But its agents are not super-geniuses. They’re not ten feet tall. And they can’t brainwash you. They can’t make you believe something you weren’t already inclined to believe.
Two final thoughts. First, we should not use the problem of Russia or other countries trying to exploit political or social divisions as an excuse to try to shut down discussion of divisive issues. The fact that Russians generated a lot of content designed to get African Americans upset about police brutality doesn’t mean that African Americans don’t have legitimate concerns about police brutality. The fact that Russians generated a lot of content designed to stir up animosity about illegal immigrants doesn’t mean that Americans don’t have legitimate concerns about illegal immigration. Nothing will add more fuel to the fire than telling people, “What’s bothering you is not a real problem.”"
Globalization: The Modern World and the Rome of ‘Satyricon’ | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Victor Davis Hanson,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/globalization-modern-world-rome-satyricon/,"May 16, 2019 6:30 AM Traffic moves past the Colosseum in Rome, Italy, in 2010. (Tony Gentile/Reuters) Even as we brag of globalizing the world and enriching the West materially and culturally, we are losing our soul in the process.
S ometime around a.d. 60, in the age of Emperor Nero, a Roman court insider named Gaius Petronius wrote a satirical Latin novel, The Satyricon , about moral corruption in Imperial Rome. The novel’s general landscape was Rome’s transition from an agrarian republic to a globalized multicultural superpower.
The novel survives only in a series of extended fragments. But there are enough chapters for critics to agree that the high-living Petronius, nicknamed the “Judge of Elegance,” was a brilliant cynic. He often mocked the cultural consequences of the sudden and disruptive influx of money and strangers from elsewhere in the Mediterranean region into a once-traditional Roman society.
The novel plots the wandering odyssey of three lazy, overeducated, and mostly underemployed single young Greeks: Encolpius, Ascyltos, and Giton. They aimlessly mosey around southern Italy. They panhandle and mooch off the nouveau riche. They mock traditional Roman customs. The three and their friends live it up amid the culinary, cultural, and sexual excesses in the age of Nero.
Certain themes in The Satyricon are timeless and still resonate today.
The abrupt transition from a society of rural homesteaders into metropolitan coastal hubs had created two Romes. One world was a sophisticated and cosmopolitan network of traders, schemers, investors, academics, and deep-state imperial cronies. Their seaside corridors were not so much Roman as Mediterranean. And they saw themselves more as “citizens of the world” than as mere Roman citizens.
In the novel, vast, unprecedented wealth had produced license. On-the-make urbanites suck up and flatter the childless rich in hopes of being given estates rather than earning their own money.
The rich in turn exploit the young sexually and emotionally by offering them false hopes of landing an inheritance.
Petronius seems to mock the very world in which he indulged.
His novel’s accepted norms are pornography, gratuitous violence, sexual promiscuity, transgenderism, delayed marriage, childlessness, fear of aging, homelessness, social climbing, ostentatious materialism, prolonged adolescence, and scamming and conning in lieu of working.
The characters are fixated on expensive fashion, exotic foods, and pretentious name-dropping. They are the lucky inheritors of a dynamic Roman infrastructure that had globalized three continents. Rome had incorporated the shores of the Mediterranean under uniform law, science, institutions — all kept in check by Roman bureaucracy and the overwhelming power of the legions, many of them populated by non-Romans.
Never in the history of civilization had a generation become so wealthy and leisured, so eager to gratify every conceivable appetite — and yet so bored and unhappy.
But there was also a second Rome in the shadows. Occasionally the hipster antiheroes of the novel bump into old-fashioned rustics, shopkeepers, and legionaries. They are what we might now call the ridiculed “deplorables” and “clingers.”
Even Petronius suggests that these rougher sorts built and maintained the vast Roman Empire. They are caricatured as bumpkins and yet admired as simple, sturdy folk without the pretensions and decadence of the novel’s urban drones.
Petronius is too skilled a satirist to paint a black-and-white picture of good old traditional Romans versus their corrupt urban successors. His point is subtler.
Globalization had enriched and united non-Romans into a world culture. That was an admirable feat. But such homogenization also attenuated the very customs, traditions, and values that had led to such astounding Roman success in the first place.
The multiculturalism, urbanism, and cosmopolitanism of The Satyricon reflected an exciting Roman mishmash of diverse languages, habits, and lifestyles drawn from northern and western Europe, Asia, and Africa.
But the new empire also diluted a noble and unique Roman agrarianism. It eroded nationalism and patriotism. The empire’s wealth, size, and lack of cohesion ultimately diminished Roman unity, as well as traditional marriage, child-bearing, and autonomy.
Education likewise was seen as ambiguous. In the novel, wide reading ensures erudition and sophistication, and helps science supplant superstition. But sometimes education is also ambiguous. Students become idle, pretentious loafers. Professors are no different from loud pedants. Writers are trite and boring. Elite pundits sound like gasbags.
Petronius seems to imply that whatever the Rome of his time was, it was likely not sustainable — but would at least be quite exciting in its splendid decline.
Petronius also argues that with too much rapid material progress comes moral regress. His final warning might be especially troubling for the current generation of Western Europeans and Americans. Even as we brag of globalizing the world and enriching the West materially and culturally, we are losing our soul in the process.
Getting married, raising families, staying in one place, still working with our hands, and postponing gratification may be seen as boring and out of date. But nearly 2,000 years later, all of that is what still keeps civilization alive.

National Review Spring Webathon: Help NR Expose the Lies Socialists Tell,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/spring-webathon-exposing-lies-socialists-tell/,"May 16, 2019 6:30 AM Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey discuss the proposed “Green New Deal,” February 7, 2019 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) With your support, we can keep exposing the lies that socialists tell.
B y nearly every metric, the Democratic party is becoming increasingly extreme. One of the party’s front-runners for the 2020 presidential nomination is an avowed socialist. Some of the loudest and most prominent young Democrats in the House are self-described socialists, too, and they’ve wasted no time in pushing policies to socialize our health-care system and overhaul our economy with their Green New Deal. Advertisement Advertisement
Keeping track of these frightening developments is pretty much a full-time job. And it just so happens that the job is mine.
Here at National Review , we know that socialist policies will take America in the exact wrong direction and make all of us less free, and that we have to keep our readers informed about just how radical the Left is becoming. We need your help to do that and to reach as many people as possible with our factual reporting and careful analysis. That’s why we’re working to raise $175,000 in our Spring 2019 Webathon, to which you can donate here .
For decades, the best writers and thinkers in the conservative movement have found a home at NR to make the argument against socialism. Unfortunately, that fight now has to be renewed yet again, this time as growing numbers of Americans — especially younger Americans — say they prefer socialism to capitalism. Democrats want voters to believe that socialism is just another word for “free things the government does for more people.” Advertisement
But that’s a lie, and if they get a chance to implement these policies, Americans will be worse off. In fact, even Democratic politicians themselves are afraid to champion their own policies. I reported in late March that not a single Senate Democrat voted for the Green New Deal, even though they had spent months insisting that the proposal was the only hope to save our planet from the existential threat of climate change. Advertisement
Every Democratic senator currently running for the 2020 presidential nomination chose to vote “present” on the Green New Deal instead of voting in favor of the bill — even though six of them are signed on as co-sponsors. Shouldn’t the men and women who wish to be our next president have the courage either to vote for the proposals they say they support or to publicly oppose the policies for which they refuse to vote?
Medicare for All, meanwhile, is all but financially impossible — and that’s the least of its problems. Almost all of the Democrats running for president have said they support this fiscally irresponsible plan. I wrote an article this spring explaining that the Democrats’ Medicare for All proposal would mandate government coverage of abortions, guaranteeing “free” abortions for all women funded entirely by U.S. taxpayers. It’s a violation of the principles on which our nation was founded."
"Vladimir Bukovsky: A Conversation with the Legendary Dissident, Part IV | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/heroes-and-villains-a-talk-with-vladimir-bukovsky-part-iv/,"May 16, 2019 6:30 AM Vladimir Bukovsky in Moscow in 2007 (Sergei Karpukhin / Reuters)
Editor’s Note : Jay Nordlinger recently interviewed Vladimir Bukovsky, the legendary Soviet-era dissident, at Bukovsky’s home in Cambridge, England. Parts I-III of the series are here , here , and here . The series concludes today.
W e are talking over the waterfront — or a good deal of the waterfront — here on the back patio in Cambridge. But, as I’ve mentioned, I also talked by phone with Vladimir Bukovsky last September. At that time, I asked him about Crimea: Putin’s swallowing of. Advertisement Advertisement
He said that Putin “did it for his own internal reasons.” He wanted to show Russians, along with the world, that “he doesn’t care about anyone or international law.” He is a big, strong man. He is “playing on people’s emotions.”
Crimea is a test, said Bukovsky. There has long been a principle about the changing of international borders. Putin has broken a taboo. He rubbed the nose of the West in the annexation of Crimea, to show that he is a criminal and that he can do whatever he wants, without anyone standing in his way.
From here on out, instability — including the changing of borders — becomes easier. That’s the game. Advertisement
Also (said Bukovsky), there is the idea of bringing back the Soviet Union as much as possible. Even a morsel helps. Revanchists regret keenly the loss of Ukraine. Advertisement
• You remember Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian intelligence defector who was murdered in 2006. He and Bukovsky were friends. In May 2015, Bukovsky was set to testify in Britain’s Litvinenko inquiry. Then his home was raided, and he was subsequently prosecuted “for having ‘prohibited images’ on his computer.”
I am quoting from Bukovsky’s bio at the Oslo Freedom Forum, where he has been a speaker. The bio continues, “It is widely believed that Bukovsky was framed and a victim of KGB kompromat, the planting of fabricated and compromising evidence.”
Let me now quote a piece I wrote in 2017, about Yuri Dmitriev:
Probably the dirtiest card in the Kremlin’s hand is child pornography, or any other kind of child abuse. Everyone recoils from it, everyone is repulsed by it. The person accused of such a crime is stained forever. The Kremlin played this card in Soviet days, and it is playing it now. The longstanding word is kompromat , i.e., compromising material.
In a December 2016 article, the New York Times reported, “The idea that Europeans and Russian opponents of the Kremlin are sexual deviants with a taste for pedophilia is a strange but recurring theme in Russian propaganda.”
The Kremlin’s latest victim, where the child-porn card is concerned, is Yuri Dmitriev.
Yes, outrageous case.
That Times piece is written by Andrew Higgins, and it is superb. Bukovsky is featured in it. I will quote a little:
“The whole affair is Kafkaesque,” Mr. Bukovsky said in an interview. “You not only have to prove you are not guilty but that you are innocent.” He insisted that he was the victim of a new and particularly noxious form of an old K.G.B. dirty trick known as kompromat …
In February 2018, Bukovsky’s case was postponed indefinitely, owing to his ill health. The case has enraged his friends and, of course, delighted his enemies. The great Bukovsky tainted, in the late years of his life? A Soviet dream.
I talked with Bukovsky about the case, in our September phone call. He said he could not say much, owing to legal constraints or precautions. But he did tell me something interesting, on the matter of proving one’s innocence: “As we say in Russia, ‘One cannot prove that one is not a camel.’” Advertisement
If you ask a Russia expert whether the FSB (i.e., the KGB) framed Bukovsky — and I have experience here — he will likely look at you as though you were an innocent child and say, “Um, yeah. That’s what they do.” Advertisement
• Here in Cambridge, I ask Bukovsky, “How do Russians abroad treat you?” “I have no idea,” he answers. He then says, “It depends on who, of course.” He continues, “I must say, I was surprised when I fell very ill and required very expensive heart surgery. A lot of very rich Russian refugees actually contributed. It was amazing. I didn’t even know them, but, for some reason, they were impelled. Including Khodorkovsky.”
He means Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the tycoon who was imprisoned by Putin for ten years and is now in the West, leading his organization Open Russia. (I have talked at length with Khodorkovsky, as well as Bukovsky, and will tell you about this in due course.)
“Do you get fan mail?” I ask Bukovsky. “I used to,” he says, “but that has now stopped, because I’ve changed my e-mail address several times.” “Do you get hate mail?” I ask. “Not for a very long time,” he says. “The last time was something like five years ago. I was accused of being a Zionist spy.” Advertisement Advertisement
“An honor,” I say. “The Mossad is a distinguished outfit.”
• He talks about the Russian government, up to its old tricks (so many of them — so many tricks). They claim to be “encircled” by the West, as we’ve mentioned before. They always have to pretend that a Western wolf is at the door, so as to keep the masses riled up and distracted.
And they spout this nonsense that “Russia is spiritually different from the West, and it is the spiritual that binds us together.” Bukovsky notes that they (the Kremlin) are “trying to promote the Orthodox Church into an ideological leader of Russia.” He remembers, with a sardonic laugh, “That church was singing hymns to Stalin! Half of them were KGB agents!”
I ask Bukovsky, “Were you ever religious?” No, he says. Advertisement
• There was a rift — a painful rift — between Richard Pipes and Solzhenitsyn. I am oversimplifying, but the rift came down to something like this: Pipes thought that Soviet Russia had its roots in Russian history; that Soviet Russia reflected patterns in Russian history. Solzhenitsyn thought this was a tremendous slander, or libel, on the Russian people.
What does Bukovsky think of this debate?
“Look, they both were my good friends, particularly Pipes. With Solzhenitsyn, actually, you couldn’t be friends. It was good if you didn’t have a quarrel with him. That was already a great achievement. And, you know, I managed not to have quarrels with him. I hushed down my disagreements with him. Pipes and I were very open friends, very good friends. But mind you, he was wrong.”
Later, Bukovsky says, “We are talking about a nation that was beheaded . That went through a genocide . And, after that, judging a nation is unfair.”
• I bring up the question of illiberalism — illiberalism coming from the Left and Right. He mentions the Polish government and the Orbán government in Hungary. Advertisement
Some people get carried away, he says, with being anti-EU and anti-Left. This comes, mind you, from the man who co-authored EUSSR: The Soviet Roots of European Integration .
Anyway, some people, wittingly or not, are led into the arms of Vladimir Putin. If Orbán is not careful, “his country will be swallowed by the KGB, and he won’t even notice how it happened,” says Bukovsky. And “since he has been my personal friend for many years, I did tell him this.”
(I wrote more on this issue in a blogpost yesterday, here .)
• What does Bukovsky think of Trump?
“Well, I like the whole thing. For me, it is a very good joke. My American friends are angry and argue with me. ‘You shouldn’t laugh at this.’ But I do laugh. It’s like a bull in a china shop. Trump is not a politician. He doesn’t know the ropes, he’s too self-centered, he talks too much — a person like that should never have been elected to any public office. But the good thing is, he disturbed the consensus of the swamp. He suddenly disrupted the universal consensus on political correctness and things like that. It’s very good he blew it up. Someone had to. For me, it’s very funny.”
Bukovsky, by the way, has never been a fan of the United States. On the contrary. He is open about this, as he is in general.
• What should be the stance of the West toward Putin?
“Don’t believe in all his bluffing. The man is good at bluffing. When people start being frightened that Putin will start a war in Europe or the Middle East or something — total rubbish. He wouldn’t venture anything like that. He will bluff his way to the top of the news, he will engage in brinkmanship, he will always test the will of the West.”
He will test it to the limit, says Bukovsky, but not step over the limit.
• “There are obvious heroes of the Soviet Union,” I say: “Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov, you. But I know there are unknown heroes, too. Can you tell me about some people you especially admire? People whose names I might not know?” Advertisement
Bukovsky says, “There was an extensive group of Old Bolsheviks who completely disagreed with Stalin and went against him. Lots of them were murdered — killed, executed, tortured. I was privileged to know several of them who survived. They were great people. I did not agree with their philosophy at all.
“It was funny, because they would advise me to join the Communist Party. Why? ‘The party became degenerate, so it needs an influx of honest people to rejuvenate it, so why don’t you join them and try to do that from the inside?’ For Chrissakes. Our good friend Anatoly Yakobson — he died in Israel — he said, rudely, but correctly, ‘It’s like trying to cure a lady infected with VD by sleeping with her. You’re not likely to cure her, but you’re very likely to catch VD.’ He was absolutely right.
“Nevertheless, I had to respect these people.”
Bukovsky mentions a few names, including that of Sergei Petrovich Pisarev: “a guy who was tortured so severely, they broke his backbone, and the rest of his life he had to wear a special corset. But he didn’t sign any papers, he didn’t sign any false accusations, and they couldn’t break him. He was an Old Bolshevik, but, in all humility, I have to admit he was a great man.”
• One thing about this conversation, I have not really conveyed. Well, several things, but here is one: Bukovsky laughs frequently. Heartily, warmly, and enjoyably. He has any number of health problems, and he has been through a lot, heaven know, but he laughs and laughs, and there is obviously a deep humanity in him. (He is also smart as hell.) He may be gruff from time to time, and with good reason — but he is lovable."
The Export-Import Bank and the Essence of Socialism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/export-import-bank-socialism-government-allocation-capital/,"May 16, 2019 6:30 AM Models of Boeing aircraft at Aviation Expo China 2015 in Beijing, China. (Jason Lee/Reuters) It is a redundant reminder that the rhetorical discord between the parties exaggerates their actual differences.
Washington — Briefly suspending their warnings about the rising tide of socialism, a large majority of Senate Republicans recently joined with almost all their Democratic colleagues in affirming the essence of socialism, which is government allocation of capital. The Senate’s revival of the Export-Import Bank is a redundant reminder that the rhetorical discord between the parties exaggerates their actual differences. Advertisement
The Ex-Im bank has been reauthorized 16 times since it was created in 1934 as a filigree on the New Deal’s overarching project of politicizing the allocation of financial resources. The reauthorization requirement is a way of pretending to refute Ronald Reagan’s axiom that there is nothing as immortal as a temporary government program, because programs acquire “reliance interests” the way a ship acquires barnacles.
Between 2015 and the Senate’s recent confirmation of three board members, Ex-Im has been without a quorum and hence unable to approve guarantees of large loans (those over $10 million). So, we have had a sustained test of the theory that Ex-Im is vital to U.S. exporting in general, and to the few giant corporations that get the lion’s share of benefits from Ex-Im’s subsidies of foreign entities. The theory has been slain by many facts.
Ex-Im has always been peripheral to U.S. exporting. In the four years since Ex-Im became largely dormant, the portion of American exports it subsidized fell from less than 2 percent to 0.3 percent — and exports have risen. Advertisement
Ex-Im has prudently distributed subsidies to enough small businesses to blur its (accurate) reputation as primarily an ally of corporate behemoths such as General Electric, John Deere, Caterpillar, and especially Boeing. Senator Mike Lee (R., Utah), who opposes Ex-Im, notes, “When Ex-Im financing was at its peak, Boeing received 70 percent of all . . . loan guarantees and 40 percent of all Ex-Im dollars.” In 2018, deprived of subsidized Ex-Im loans, Boeing, America’s 23rd largest corporation by market capitalization ($193.58 billion as of Tuesday morning), and 27th by revenue ($101 billion), had its best year ever. Advertisement
Of course, Ex-Im makes enough loans to small businesses (in 2014 about 25 percent of Ex-Im dollars went to 0.5 percent of small businesses) to purchase congressional support in the usual way: Want to build a bomber that the military does not want? Scatter subcontractors around enough congressional districts, and it will be built.
Lee says: “The No. 1 buyer of exports subsidized by Ex-Im between 2007 and 2013 was Pemex . . . . the notoriously corrupt petroleum company owned by the Mexican government. Pemex, which has a market cap of $416 billion, received more than $7 billion in loans backed by U.S. taxpayers. . . . During the same period, Ex-Im backed $3.4 billion in financing to Emirates Airlines — a company wholly owned by the government of Dubai — for Emirates’ purchase of Boeing planes.” Senator Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), identifies the second- through fifth-biggest beneficiaries of Ex-Im subsidies: (2) State-owned Kenya Airways, (3) State-owned Air China, (4) Russia’s state-owned bank VEB (currently under U.S. sanctions for bad behavior; two hands of the U.S. government, one caressing, one smiting), and (5) Roy Hill mining, owned by Australia’s richest woman, a multibillionaire. Advertisement
The Trump administration trots out its usual rationale for economic irrationality: Ex-Im is a “national security weapon.” As the bank subsidizes China and Russia? In 2014, in 17 Ex-Im transactions the primary borrower was the Export-Import Bank of China. Says Toomey, “You cannot make this stuff up”: Ex-Im is subsidizing the Chinese bank that is cited as the reason we need Ex-Im. Advertisement
Toomey notes that Ex-Im’s defenders argue that the bank takes risks that private lenders will not undertake — and that the bank does not risk taxpayers’ money by making unsafe loans. By picking some U.S. winners, Ex-Im makes some U.S. losers: For example, it subsidizes state-owned Air India’s purchase of Boeing jets, thereby enabling it to lower its fares on the New York-Mumbai route, where it competes against Delta Airlines.

Ex-Im, which exists to allocate credit by political criteria rather than the market’s efficiency criterion, is opposed by only 16 Republican senators — call them The Remnant — who, unlike their 37 Republican colleagues, mean what they say when praising free markets and limited government: Barrasso, Blackburn, Braun, Cruz, Daines, Grassley, Hawley, Inhofe, Kennedy, Lankford, Lee, Rubio, Sasse, Shelby, Toomey, and Young."

(Jeenah Moon/Reuters)
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday announced a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, joining a large field of 22 other candidates.
“As president I will take on the wealthy. I will take on the corporations. I will not rest until this government serves working people,” de Blasio said in his announcement video message. “Doesn’t matter if you live in a city or a rural area, a big state, small state. Doesn’t matter what your ethnicity is. People in every part of this country felt stuck or even like they’re going backwards.”
De Blasio reminded voters that he raised New York City’s minimum wage to $15 per hour and fought to provide workers with guaranteed paid sick leave and healthcare. He also touted that New York sent lawyers to the border to assist undocumented immigrants in dealing with the Trump administration and took steps to fight climate change when Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement.
The Democratic mayor, who is serving his second term, also did not mince words on the current president, calling President Trump a “bully” and saying he “must be stopped.”
“I’m a New Yorker. I’ve known Trump’s a bully for a long time,” de Blasio said. “I know how to take him on. Don’t back down in the face of a bully, confront him … I’ve beaten him before and I will do it again.”
Trump wasted no time clapping back at the mayor of his home city, tweeting that de Blasio is the “worst mayor in the U.S.” and New York City “hates him.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

'The Impeachment Trial of Andrew Johnson' Book Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Allen C. Guelzo,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/03/andrew-johnsons-impeachment-lessons/,"May 16, 2019 10:27 AM The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson (Theodore R. Davis) The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation , by Brenda Wineapple (Random House, 576 pp., $32)
A lthough Brenda Wineapple insists that she began her new book “six years ago — deep into the Obama presidency — when impeachment was far from anyone’s mind,” this is clearly not a book about Barack Obama, or even, for that matter, about Andrew Johnson.
But I will let her tell you that. Advertisement
Impeachment is a constitutional process that serves as a restraint on “all civil Officers of the United States.” It actually makes four separate appearances in the text of the Constitution, three of them in Article I, concerning Congress, and the other at the tail end of Article II on the presidency. But those appearances are maddeningly brief. Even more maddening, the grounds for impeachment are designated as “Treason, Bribery,” which are pinpoint specific, and “other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,” which are not, and which gave rise to James Madison’s misgivings at the Constitutional Convention about what “might be called a misdemeanor.”
Those misgivings explain why Congress reached for the impeachment weapon only four times in its first 81 years, and then only to impeach judges. But cries for impeachment, especially of presidents, continued to bubble up. Infuriated enemies of Andrew Jackson wanted Old Hickory impeached in 1831. Nineteen years later, Alexander H. Stephens (the future vice president of the Confederacy) was ready to move the impeachment of Zachary Taylor for the president’s plan to restrict slavery in the territory acquired in the Mexican War. James Buchanan suffered the indignity of having fellow Pennsylvanian John Covode introduce an impeachment resolution and convene an investigative committee. (Congress adjourned before the Covode committee could move matters forward, and the election of 1860 rendered the whole question moot.) It waited for the hapless Andrew Johnson for the machinery of impeaching and trying a president finally to come to life.
Johnson could have been a model of the self-made man, having risen from poverty to create a successful tailoring business and then moved into politics to become Tennessee’s governor and then a U.S. senator. His finest hour came in 1861, when he defied the secessionists of Tennessee and remained in his Senate seat, refusing (at least symbolically) to be dragged out of the Union. Lincoln rewarded him by designating Johnson as military governor of Tennessee when federal forces reoccupied the state, and, though Johnson was a Democrat and a small-time slaveholder, he promised the slaves freed by the Emancipation Proclamation that he would be their Moses to lead them to the promised land of freedom. In 1864, Lincoln’s Republicans attached Johnson to Lincoln’s presidential-reelection bid as his vice president, hoping to fashion a bipartisan Union ticket. No one dreamt that Johnson would become president himself until John Wilkes Booth’s fatal bullet accomplished just that. Advertisement Advertisement
Within weeks, the worst of Johnson began to show. He might have been brave, but he was also obstinate. He might have promised to be the freedmen’s Moses, but instead he became their Pharaoh, with a strong streak of anti-black racial animosity to make it worse. And though he loudly promised to punish treason, he broke with the Republican leadership in Congress by handing out pardons to all but the most notorious Confederate leaders and installing, in the defeated Confederate states, interim governments that promptly acted to reduce the freed slaves to little better than peons. When the 39th Congress assembled in December 1865, Republicans hurriedly passed a number of bills to reverse Johnson’s actions. To their astonishment, he vetoed them. Infuriated, they overturned his vetoes and passed new legislation to direct the reconstruction of the Confederacy. Congress even adopted a Tenure of Office Act to prevent Johnson from removing Republican officeholders. Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton anyway, and that became the principal ground, in February 1868, for impeaching him. Advertisement
The impeachment and trial of Andrew Johnson have been the subject of several outstanding scholarly and popular histories, most notably by Michael Les Benedict, Hans Trefousse, and David O. Stewart. Brenda Wineapple is a literary critic whose previous work has been largely defined by studies of Hawthorne, Emily Dickinson, Gertrude Stein, and Janet Flanner. Her one foray into a history of the Civil War years, Ecstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise, 1848 – 1877 , was gingerly described by David Shribman in the Boston Globe as “not of the traditional order.” Indeed. And there are moments in The Impeachers when her unfamiliarity with the 19th-century political terrain shows: She gets the year of Johnson’s vice-presidential inauguration wrong, imagines that the three-fifths clause gave “the North a net gain” in representation, claims that “there was no constitutional reason for a military trial” of the Lincoln-murder conspirators, insists that Lincoln had treated Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee during the war as “conquered provinces,” and suggests that the name of the Ku Klux Klan “referred to the sound that a cocked rifle made.” Advertisement
What Wineapple lacks in grasp, though, is more than made up by passion. For Wineapple, the impeachment was an accusing finger pointed at America’s pervasive “racial prejudice,” and it contradicts “the national myth of a democratic country founded in liberty, with abundant space, opportunity, and resources available to all.” America was “a divided, culpable nation,” and the failure of the impeachment to convict Johnson shows just how far we have yet to travel on “the path toward a free country, a just country, a country and a people willing to learn from the past, not erase or repeat it.” That’s very entertaining, even riveting. The problem is that it’s not history; it’s middle-school melodrama. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
And like melodrama, The Impeachers teems with breathless innuendo and cardboard stage-prompts (“What you saw was what you got” . . . “Johnson was definitely smashed” . . . “Sleaziness is hard to nail down”). The principal players appear as threadbare caricatures. Charles Sumner “seemed as free of mixed motives as anyone in government could be” (a judgment few of his contemporaries, starting with Lincoln, shared). New York governor Horatio Seymour was “a smooth-faced and soulless person” who “supported the murderous draft rioters” (Seymour was quite bewhiskered and issued two proclamations declaring the New York City draft rioters to be in a state of insurrection) Above all, though, Andrew Johnson was a “demagogue,” a political climber, without humor, and full of “scrappy populism.” Never mind that “populism” did not exist in the political lexicon until the 1890s — as soon as the word pops up, we know at once who the real subject of the book is, or at least whose impeachment will surely bring us to “the fair future of which men and women still dream.”
Andrew Johnson offers very little for any American to like, much less admire. The end of the Civil War ought to have been the golden moment when nearly 4 million slaves were brought into the circle of American citizenship and the Democratic oligarchs who ruled the plantation South were displaced in favor of free labor and free markets. Instead, Johnson allowed the defeated rebels the chance to catch a second wind, invent the myth of the Lost Cause, and make it nearly impossible to impose a decent Reconstruction on the former Confederacy. We can only wish that it had been Booth, rather than George Atzerodt (the Booth conspiracy’s designated assassin of Johnson), who lost his nerve on the night of Lincoln’s assassination.

Socialism as Substitute Community | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Timothy P. Carney,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/03/socialism-as-substitute-community/,"Magazine &vert; June 03, 2019, Issue Socialism as Substitute Community May 16, 2019 10:05 AM Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks during a town hall meeting in Queens, N.Y., April 27, 2019. (Jeenah Moon/Reuters) Alienated people are turning to Marx and Ocasio-Cortez
M odern conveniences, information technology, and a fairly laissez-faire morality and economy, paired with a decent government safety net, make it pretty easy for Americans to get what they need, in most respects. That makes the rising cry for socialism a bit baffling at first.
But there’s a deeper need going unfilled that is driving college students and twentysomethings to their Marx, Engels, Sanders, and Ocasio-Cortez. Advertisement Advertisement
And there obviously is something missing in people’s lives.
Suicides hit an all-time high in 2017. Opioid deaths are skyrocketing. Even with employers desperate for workers, 7.1 million prime-working-age men remained out of the labor force as of 2016.
Families are forming less often. Americans are increasingly saying they feel like strangers in their own land. Advertisement
We shouldn’t be surprised that people are turning to radical solutions, considering how many are finding modern life in America so wanting. Just because most economic indicators are good doesn’t mean this sense of lack is imagined. It turns out there’s a lot more to the good life than shows up in the reports of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The real reason American socialists are enjoying a moment today is social and cultural poverty. The root cause is something like loneliness. To borrow a term from Marx himself, you could blame alienation.
When I camped out at Occupy Wall Street in 2011, I was most surprised by how little talk there was of bailouts, bank regulations, or really any policy at all. I had come up to New York from Washington, where the nascent Occupy D.C. crowd was complaining about toothless enforcement of the Volcker Rule and the need for a new Authorization for Use of Military Force in our War on Terror. Advertisement
There were no such hippie wonks in Zuccotti Park. When I asked what their occupation was a protest against, the typical answer was something like “corporate control of government.” Then the conversation went like this: Advertisement
What do you dislike that corporations are doing with their control of government?
“Buying politicians!”
And what are those bought politicians doing that is bad?
“Silencing the voice of the people.”
Okay, the corporations are in control, the people are silenced, the politicians are bought. They’re all in a smoke-filled room. What policies do they pursue or not pursue that you think harm the country?
“They oppose campaign-finance reform!” Advertisement
It seemed there was no there there. This was a protest about nothing, I thought.
But it was about something. When I counted the signs at Occupy, the most common themes were disenfranchisement and the erosion of democracy.
They were protesting the “hollowing out of democratic institutions,” as occupier Rob Eletto put it.
“This is a movement for direct democracy rather than corporatocracy,” Sinead Lamel told me during one evening’s “General Assembly.”
Throughout the day, occupiers took in barn-burning leftist speeches, but the General Assembly was something different. It was all logistics and legislating. It was the formation of a sanitation committee and a library committee. It was debating and passing rules about when the drum circle had to go quiet. It was “direct democracy.”
This laborious rule-making was the point of Occupy Wall Street, occupier Julia Shindel told me. Having an actual voice in shaping this little society was “extremely intoxicating.”
The dream of forming a fledgling civilization in a flagstone-covered park in Lower Manhattan drew many of these left-leaning Millennials to the Occupy encampment in 2011. While the crowds at Zuccotti Park gave up the dream a few weeks later, the same spirit (and many of the same faces) resurfaced in 2015 and 2016 as the Bernie Sanders movement. Advertisement
At the 2016 Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Berniecrats were as likely to talk about disenfranchisement and democratic revitalization as they were to go on about Medicare for All or “free college.” Of course they agreed with Bernie on the policy stuff, but what brought them through the door was the promise that Bernie would give them a voice in politics.
The root cause of both Occupy Wall Street and Bernie 2016 was a prevailing sense of political alienation. Young people felt that they had lost the ability to make a difference in the world, and so they turned to movements that, in addition to peddling a socialist policy agenda, promised political empowerment.
And while both movements placed their hope of reenfranchisement in an impossible dream (believing that, somehow, loud enough protests or restrictive enough campaign-finance regulations would give ordinary people a voice in Washington), the problem they identified was real: Young Americans had lost agency , the ability to make a difference, in modern society. Advertisement
Man is a political animal. We are meant not only to control our own lives but also to shape the world around us. Traditionally, most of us have flexed our political muscle in and through local, mostly voluntary, institutions such as a town government, a parish council, or a PTA chapter. Community institutions have eroded over the decades, though, leaving people without arenas in which to express their political and social nature. Advertisement
Without a local “political” institution in reach, many young people reached for something that promised enfranchisement and political power. In so doing, they landed in the camps of Occupy and Sanders. Once there, they began singing hymns to Medicare for All, free college, and wealth taxes.
The desperate desire for a political voice in the 2010s has led young people to the far left. Advertisement
Put another way, modern American society, in which community is weaker and people are more alienated, has proven a fertile ground for socialism.
People need other people. The American Right sometimes neglects this basic fact and ends up deifying the individual or the nuclear family.
When Hillary Clinton wrote, “It takes a village to raise a child,” conservatives replied, “It takes a family.” Being pro-family is one thing. Denying that child-rearing is in part a community undertaking is another.
Anyone who has raised children knows how that undertaking requires assistance from people outside the nuclear family — in-laws, teachers, coaches, neighbors, religious leaders, and sometimes the neighborhood cops. What connects parents to these figures are institutions. Without these support structures, raising a family is far more difficult.
In wealthy, highly educated neighborhoods, support structures still exist: private schools, strong public schools with involved parents, country clubs, a higher proportion of stay-at-home moms or mothers working part-time, Boy Scout troops, Little Leagues, and so on. In some tight-knit religious communities, such as the Mormons of Utah, or the Dutch Reformed of western Michigan, families can rely on plenty of church-based institutions.
For most of the working class and the poor, though, these institutions are disappearing. People left isolated and alienated find marriage and child-rearing more difficult. The result is more out-of-wedlock births, fewer marriages, fewer children, more divorce.
The political reaction is a demand for a bigger federal safety net.
For instance, the People’s Policy Project, a socialist think tank, recently released its “Family Fun Pack,” a proposal for a raft of federal programs designed to help poor and working-class people raise families.
The policy paper explains that the capitalist system is not oriented to helping families. “Because income is paid out to the factors of production without any regard for its final family-level distribution,” it states, “families with children wind up in dramatically worse financial circumstances than families without children.”
The paper then calls for 36 weeks of federally funded paid parental leave, federally funded child care, a federal benefit for stay-at-home mothers, federally funded (and even federally operated) pre-K, and plenty more expansions of the state into the lives of parents and kids.
More and more Democratic politicians will presumably endorse these proposals between now and the 2020 primaries, since many have already proposed socialist policies in other issue areas. And these big-government proposals will have a real constituency.
Two of the ideas undergirding these efforts are correct: The market itself doesn’t account for the costs and difficulties of being a parent; and raising a child without help is very difficult, even for married parents with income.
If you read “Family Fun Pack,” you come away asking, “How does anyone manage to raise a family without already being rich?” Then you remember: community. Extended family, neighbors, parishes, shuls, civic associations, dinner clubs, swim clubs, and so on. These institutions help families keep their stuff together, help mothers and fathers stay sane, help new parents navigate the daunting path of parenthood.
The erosion of these little platoons has left people seeking a replacement. Socialism is increasingly perceived to be the answer.
Family is just one area where socialism rushes in to fill the void left by the erosion of community. Experience and social science suggest that community erosion increases the demand for regulation.
That is, laissez-faire never worked if it actually meant “anything goes.” Instead, strong norms, a sense of duty to one’s neighbors, social pressure, and shame have always played a regulatory role.
When communities are weaker, these social “regulations” become toothless. That’s when government regulations come in. Advertisement
“In a cross section of countries,” four economists wrote in The Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2010, “government regulation is strongly negatively correlated with measures of trust.”
The causality goes both ways, the study suggests. “Distrust creates public demand for regulation, whereas regulation in turn discourages formation of trust.” Put another way, “individuals in low-trust countries want more government intervention even though they know the government is corrupt.”
In western Michigan, I saw the flipside of this dynamic firsthand.
When you think of Michigan, you may think of union workers in Detroit and Flint. But western Michigan traditionally has had far lower rates of unionization, while still being dominated by manufacturing and connected to the auto industry. At a McDonald’s in Holland, Mich., in April, I asked a couple of retirees why that was.
“A lot of these businesses are started by local people,” explained Gary Gunnich over his breakfast, pointing toward the many small manufacturing plants in the small city. Holland is defined by the Dutch ancestry of its residents and the Reformed churches rooted in Dutch Calvinism. The business owners and their workers typically worshiped together on Sundays, Gunnich and his breakfast companion Bill Stehouwer explained. That obviated the need for unionization, he argued.
“A community like this,” Gunnich said, “you’re not going to screw people over and then survive. It’s gonna get out in a hurry.”"

• Don’t tear up your tickets just yet: We hear the Kentucky Derby loser is appealing to the Ninth Circuit.
• Joe Biden has held on to a solid lead after a few weeks in the race. Anita Hill’s barbs against him, the complaints of some women about his invasions of their personal space, his opposition to busing in the 1970s: None of it has so far made a dent. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris is said to be retooling her campaign, reportedly in recognition that she has been too concerned about courting the Left. The other candidates should come to the same realization. What Biden’s strength shows is that a lot of Democratic voters don’t speak in the buzzwords of intersectionality, don’t want to see their insurance deleted, and don’t spend their lives being woke on Twitter. That doesn’t mean Biden will definitely win the nomination. His solid lead is giving all the other Democrats — and there are a lot of them — a motive to take shots at him. But elections are, not for the first time, proving to be a way for normal people to remind the political class of what their actual concerns are.
• Chinese trade negotiators backed away from concessions they had seemed ready to make. Reportedly, they read President Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve as a sign that our economy is weaker than it looks and therefore concluded that they had leverage. Trump then boosted tariffs on China, and China responded in kind. Not to worry, says Trump, who encourages U.S. companies to shift their supply chains from China to Vietnam. There is a certain strategic logic to that move, which is why policymakers in both parties with concerns about China had proposed a Trans-Pacific Partnership that included Vietnam, us, and many other countries but excluded China. Trump ditched that idea as soon as he took office, and instead continues to improvise as stock traders watch nervously.
• Three weeks saw three shootings in public places: at Chabad synagogue in Poway, Calif., the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and a STEM high school in Highlands Ranch, Colo. Each was marked by striking heroism. In Poway, Lori Gilbert-Kaye died shielding her rabbi, while Oscar Stewart, another congregant, and Jonathan Morales, guard, charged the shooter and drove him off. The UNC Charlotte shooter was charged and tackled by student Riley Howell, who died in the effort. Kendrick Castillo led three other students in subduing the Colorado shooter; Castillo paid with his life. Guards at houses of worship and schools, and greater efforts by law enforcement to monitor crime groupies — the Columbine killers have an online following — would be welcome. But the exceptional behavior of ordinary people may change the calculus of the wretched souls who hope to become famous via mass murder. Let the spotlight illuminate the brave, not the sick.
• President Trump lashed out at former White House counsel Don McGahn for declining to state publicly that the president did not obstruct justice. But what McGahn told Special Counsel Robert Mueller was a boon for Trump: His cooperation with the investigation gave Attorney General Bill Barr a strong basis to conclude Trump lacked corrupt intent — an essential element of obstruction. Trump, nevertheless, is livid that McGahn testified that the president wanted him to tell then–attorney general Jeff Sessions to fire Mueller. McGahn wisely refused: Firing Mueller would have been a political disaster; having the recused Sessions do it would have made it worse. It is not McGahn’s fault that Mueller included the almost-firing story in his report but omitted McGahn’s assessment that Trump had not obstructed. And it is understandable that, after answering Mueller’s questions for hours, McGahn does not wish to comment further. The president says he was “never a fan” of McGahn’s. He should be.
• Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, demands that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin produce six years of Trump’s tax returns. Mnuchin refuses. The Democrats are relying on a decades-old federal statute that grants the chair of key congressional committees the absolute right to see any taxpayer’s returns on request. It’s an absurd law prone to abuse, but it’s the law, and it’s almost certainly constitutional. Mnuchin is claiming that the chairman must have a “legitimate legislative purpose” for the request, but that condition is not written into the law. Moreover, even if a court interprets the law as containing an implicit and constitutionally necessary requirement that the committee have a legislative purpose, controlling Supreme Court case law indicates that a “legitimate legislative purpose” will be broadly construed and encompass investigations and inquiries. Mnuchin will likely go to court to avoid producing Trump’s returns. He will likely lose. As with taxes in general, you can get an extension but eventually you have to pay.
• Democrats eager to examine President Trump’s recent tax returns had their appetites whetted by a New York Times report on ten years, 1985–94, of his last-century tax transcripts. The records the Times examined, provided by anonymous sources, show a headlong plunger who ended up a billion dollars in debt and exploited tax breaks to the fullest. The shape of Trump’s early career has long been known; he has boasted about his comeback. After a string of failed casinos and other big gambles, Trump would recover by branding himself as a celebrity developer, licensing his name to projects he only part-owned. The Times story fills in details of his early slide. Financial stories are thickets of minutiae; if the broad outlines are pre-baked into popular consciousness, Trump seems armored against future revelations. But the variety of his activities, and his aura of recklessness, will encourage investigators to keep looking. As Ronald Reagan used to say, of a boy shoveling manure out of a stable, there had to be a pony in there somewhere.
• After a contentious intra-GOP fight, Donald Trump Jr. has agreed to deliver additional testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Chairman Richard Burr (R., N.C.) had subpoenaed Trump Jr. to resolve discrepancies between his testimony and that of Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and “fixer.” Trump’s allies immediately rebelled, claiming that the subpoena violated Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s edict that the case was “closed” on Russian collusion. But the Intelligence Committee’s probe of Trump-team contacts with Russia is entirely separate from and independent of the Mueller investigation, and its mandate is broader. It’s not focused on investigating the existence of a criminal conspiracy but rather on Russian tactics and how they fit in with Russia’s broader use of so-called “active measures” to disrupt American democracy. More-over, the Intelligence Committee is also concerned with the performance of the American intelligence community as it reacted to the Russian threat. Trump Jr.’s interactions with Russians — and his knowledge of interactions with Russians by other members of Trump’s team — are highly relevant to the Intelligence Committee’s inquiry, even if there is no criminal conspiracy. Burr was right to press on, and Trump Jr. is right to agree to testify.
• “There are no second acts in American lives” — oh, yes, there are, and Valerie Plame is on her third or fourth. Along with her then-husband, Joe Wilson, she was involved in a 2003 scandal. She was a CIA officer, and Robert Novak revealed her identity in a column. He had been leaked to by Richard Armitage of the State Department. Plame wrote a memoir , Fair Game , and spy novels. Her story was the subject of a 2010 movie, also called “Fair Game,” in which she was played by (the lovely) Naomi Watts. Now Plame is running for Congress in New Mexico. She has a history of promoting kooky anti-Jewish stuff, which she has unconvincingly apologized for. No wonder she thinks she belongs in the House Democratic caucus.
• ​​Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has unveiled the most extreme set of gun-control proposals to be advanced by a presidential candidate in at least 30 years. In addition to the usual calls for a ban on commonly owned rifles, limits on standard-capacity magazines, and federal superintendence of all firearm transfers, Booker hopes to introduce a federal license for which all gun owners would need to apply every five years and to build an enormous government database that would contain records of every privately owned gun in the country — and of every gun owner , too. On its face, Booker’s plan is tyrannical: In practice, gun registries serve as giant, highly detailed maps that can be used by the government to stage a confiscation drive; most recently in Venezuela, we have seen how that tends to end. It is also unworkable. As Canada’s abandoned long-gun registry has shown, gun registries tend to cost an enormous amount of money for a tiny — or even nonexistent — return. In the United States, they are even less fruitful than they are abroad. As experience in California and Connecticut shows, many gun owners who are generally law-abiding are unwilling to cooperate with these schemes. Far too often, American politicians seem to begin their policy proposals with an implicit “Imagine we don’t live in America.” Cory Booker’s program is the worst example yet.
• Imagine taking your car to the mechanic and being informed that the necessary repairs will cost $10,000. When you ask what kind of repair costs so much, the mechanic answers: “I don’t know what kind of work I’m going to have to do, but it’s going to cost $10,000.” Raise the figure to $2 trillion and you have a federal infrastructure program. President Trump and congressional Democrats got together — usually a bad sign, that — and agreed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, a figure arrived at apparently because it is nice and round and sounds good to the president’s ears. (An earlier plan had been $1.5 trillion.) What’s to be done with all that money? Nobody knows. Where is the money to come from? Nobody knows, though Senate Republicans already have said that they are not interested in raising taxes to pay for it — and Democrats do not want to proceed unless new taxes are part of the deal. Infrastructure that requires federal support should be handled through the ordinary appropriations process, one item at a time, rather than through once-in-a-generation slop-bucket bills.
• The Trump administration is thinking about changing the way that anti-poverty programs calculate inflation, in a way that would result in fewer people being eligible over time. The idea is a good one, notwithstanding the predictable outrage on the left, because the “unchained” Consumer Price Index currently in use overstates inflation. When some things get more expensive, consumers switch to cheaper options, and the “chained” CPI the administration is considering takes account of this switching. As is so often the case, the Congress has left the executive branch with discretion, and the Trump administration is using it reasonably.
• The administration has adopted a new policy, by way of a Health and Human Services Department rule, to protect medical professionals who have moral objections to performing procedures such as abortion, physician-assisted suicide, and elective sterilization. Religious freedom is a little safer, at least when there’s a Republican administration.
• Georgia governor Brian Kemp has signed a bill that prohibits abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected, often as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Abortion-rights supporters and their allies in the media responded with characteristic vitriol, falsely claiming that the law would punish women for having a miscarriage or imprison post-abortive women for life. Some feminist activists, such as actress Alyssa Milano, have encouraged women to undertake a “sex strike” until the bill is repealed. The Left has never had a good answer to the pro-life slogan, “Abortion stops a beating heart.” If the Supreme Court does the right thing, that won’t be true in Georgia any more.
• What would it take to get the teachers’ unions to back a Republican candidate? New Jersey state-senate president Steve Sweeney knows: He is a Democrat who understands the need for public-pension reform, and the teachers’ unions want to retire him. New Jersey has a problem: The criminals, misfits, and incompetents who have long governed the state have long failed to make the necessary financial contributions to the state’s pension system, which leaves New Jersey with a lot of promises it is not going to be able to keep. By 2023, the state will be running a $4 billion deficit driven largely by pension expenses. The state’s unfunded pension liabilities already amount to $100 billion, by one estimate. Sweeney proposes doing what most sane jurisdictions have done and moving new hires and those who have been on the job for less than five years from an unsustainable defined-benefit model to a defined-contribution model — or at least a hybrid that would substantially reduce the defined-benefit obligations. The unions want tax increases instead. But even if New Jersey wanted to go that way, it is not clear that the state plausibly could raise enough revenue to keep the system going. New Jersey is not alone in this — the unfunded-liability problem is arguably a bigger and more immediate one than government debt as such. But the math is the math, and change is coming — one way or another.
• In a referendum in Denver, voters rejected Initiative 300, a proposal to reverse the city’s ban on “camping” in public spaces. The outcome wasn’t close: 83 percent voted no. Some advocates for the homeless opposed the ban but also declined to support the campaign to overturn it. It could “lower the prevailing standard of human welfare,” explained the Homeless Leadership Council which includes local leaders of Catholic Charities, the Salvation Army, and the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless in a statement. As the vote counts came rolling in on Election Night, organizers of the campaign against the initiative who had gathered at the Denver Press Club were restrained. A spokeswoman said, “What we learned from talking to people at neighborhood meetings is that people are concerned about this issue,” homelessness, but that legalization of vagrancy “isn’t the way to approach it.” Homeless people don’t need a sleeping bag and a spot in a park. They need shelter. The decisive defeat of Initiative 300 was a victory for both common sense and moral seriousness.
• Facebook banned a number of controversial, hateful conspiracy theorists from its platforms, including Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, and Milo Yiannopoulos. Loathsome though these individuals are, Facebook’s justification deserves scrutiny. It cited “dangerous” activities off Facebook’s platforms. In other words, a person could comply with the site’s terms of use and still face a ban if Facebook disapproves of his off-site speech and activities. While Donald Trump is right to express concern about social-media censorship, his tweets of support for some of the banned voices (even labeling an Infowars reporter “conservative”) are unmerited and unwise. Supporting free speech often means defending the right of even loathsome voices to speak. It does not and should not include any effort to justify or rationalize their content.
• Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, has called for the Federal Trade Commission to break up the company. Writing in the New York Times , Hughes argued that Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, have become so powerful that they now represent the type of monopoly that the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act was intended to prevent. Specifically, Hughes wants the FTC to force Facebook to sell the two largest companies it owns, Instagram and WhatsApp, and to institute greater oversight of Facebook’s free-speech and privacy rules. While certainly of the zeitgeist, Hughes’s proposal is a peculiar one, in that it would not actually “break up” Facebook so much as force it to sell other, unintegrated companies that it owns. Because those companies do different things than Facebook does, they do not help make the case that Facebook is a monopoly so much as make the case that Facebook is a conglomerate. Perhaps Facebook is dangerous. But while there are scores of people who have identified an ill they wish to solve, nobody has yet offered a coherent, workable remedy.
• Our friend Republican congressman Devin Nunes has filed two defamation lawsuits. The first targeted Republican operative Liz Mair, Twitter, and two Twitter parody accounts — one calling itself “Devin Nunes’s Mom,” and the other “Devin Nunes’s cow.” The second lawsuit targeted the McClatchy Company (including the Fresno Bee , a McClatchy newspaper) and Mair. Nunes is claiming that the defendants published inaccurate and defamatory information about him, including information designed to ruin his public reputation. In reality the lawsuits have little chance of success. There is broad constitutional protection of parody. But it can be expensive and draining to fight even meritless litigation, and an aggressive litigation strategy can have a chilling effect on public criticism. Republicans should defend the marketplace of ideas, not seek to suppress it through vexatious lawsuits.
• President Donald Trump pardoned former Army lieutenant Michael Behenna for the unpremeditated murder of an Iraqi detainee. By any measure, Behenna’s conduct was unlawful and improper for an American soldier in a war zone. Behenna stripped and interrogated the detainee without authorization, a clear violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During this unlawful interrogation, Behenna claims, the detainee lunged for Behenna’s weapon. Behenna shot and killed the detainee. Behenna’s defenders claim that military prosecutors failed to produce exculpatory evidence that supported Behenna’s claim of self-defense. The Behenna pardon is an agonizingly close call. His conduct violated Army standards, but even a soldier who is violating the UCMJ of course enjoys a right of self-defense. Behenna is no longer in the military, and he served a term of imprisonment, but now he has the opportunity for a fresh start, with a clean legal slate. In the end, perhaps a measure of justice has been done.
• Twice in a week, North Korea tested a battery of ballistic missiles. President Trump was eager to downplay these tests, saying, “These were short-range missiles and very standard stuff. Very standard.” What’s very standard is bad North Korean behavior trying to push us into concessions — and what’s becoming too standard are Trump’s expressions of complacency about it.
• The 690 rockets fired from Gaza were often intercepted in flight but still killed four Israeli citizens, damaged some property, and disrupted everyday life. A violence of calculated stops and starts has been going on for a decade, and Israel has not yet found a way to end it. Gaza is in the hands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), two paramilitary groups that simultaneously cooperate and compete, both of them financed and armed by Iran. Israel previously had a policy of restraint in self-defense in order to minimize the number of civilian casualties (for example, limiting strikes to empty buildings and giving warning). The element of deterrence was therefore lost. This time, Israel took a decision to make the commanders of Hamas and PIJ pay for their violence, striking their homes, their cyber-headquarters, and depots of arms and ammunition. The official responsible for channeling the crucial subsidies from Iran was killed in his car in a targeted assassination. Seeming close to panic, Hamas and PIJ became eager for a ceasefire that Israel was in no hurry to reach. Score one for deterrence.
• Recep Tayyip Erdogan, president of Turkey, has pioneered the modern way to deal with elections that throw up unfavorable results: declare that there have been “corruption and irregularities” — it’s not mandatory to provide a concrete example — and just order a rerun. By a fairly narrow margin, Ekrem Imamoglu of the oppositional Republican People’s party won the election to be mayor of Istanbul. Erdogan demanded a series of recounts but still could not wangle a majority. Assuming the office on April 17, Imamoglu was ordered out on May 6 at the behest of the so-called Supreme Electoral Council, rubber-stamping for Erdogan. June 23 is now the date for electing Erdogan’s mayor in a showing of real corruption and irregularities.
• Brunei recently enacted laws that would impose the death penalty (by stoning) for, among sundry other offenses, engaging in homosexual sex (for men; women get off with a whipping). The sultan of Brunei hastened to explain that his nation has no plans to enforce this penalty, that no one has been executed in the nation’s history, and that Brunei’s sharia-based penal code allows plenty of “scope for remission.” It remains to be seen whether this straddle will keep him in good stead with the international community, but with a fortune in the tens of billions of dollars, he can probably weather a boycott or two, though our gay friends might not feel quite so secure.
• Pope Francis has issued a decree mandating that every diocese establish a “public” and “accessible” system for reporting allegations of sexual misconduct by priests. The deadline is June 2020. The 3,000-word document, Vos Estis Lux Mundi (You Are the Light of the World), also includes protocol for reporting accusations, of both sexual abuse and its cover-up, against bishops, cardinals, and other prelates. Much of what Francis outlines in the document has already been instituted in the United States, which in these matters has been ahead of the Church in other parts of the world. Last fall the U.S. bishops were poised to approve further measures, relating to the handling of cases against high-ranking Church officials, when the Vatican asked them to hold off, presumably in anticipation of the directives outlined in Vos Estis , a uniform standard for the Church worldwide, although it’s broad enough to allow for differences in the legal and political systems across nations. A welcome if belated response to the sex-abuse crisis in the Church, Vos Estis should prove most helpful in those regions where bishops up to now have been reluctant to admit that the problem even exists.
• Before Vice President Pence made a speech on board the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Harry S. Truman , the ship’s senior enlisted sailor, Master Chief Jonas Carter, called on his fellow sailors to “clap like we’re in a strip club.” Within a week, Carter had handed in his resignation, ending a 30-year naval career. That draconian punishment, and not the off-color remark, should be recognized as the real scandal here.
• “I don’t think he did anything wrong,” Bill Mott, the trainer of Country House, said of Luis Saez, the jockey who rode Maximum Security to cross the finish line first in the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby. A couple of other jockeys rushed to file an objection, contending that, after the final turn, Maximum Security had veered out of his inside lane and blocked the horses behind him. Those horses then impeded the horses behind them — the equine equivalent of getting stuck in rush-hour traffic. Race officials reviewed the video and agreed. They disqualified Maximum Security. The trophy went to the second-place finisher, Country House (well, to his trainer, Mott, and to his owner, breeder, and jockey), the first time that a post-race disqualification has decided the Derby title. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission then suspended Saez for 15 days. It cited his failure to control his horse. Good for Mott, an honest rival, for defending him. The horse had a mind of its own.
• Australia’s new 50-dollar bill has images of an Aboriginal writer on one side and the country’s first female member of parliament on the other. The MP’s side includes micro-printing of an excerpt from her first speech in which the word “responsibility” is misspelled as “responsibilty” — not just once but three times. Australia’s banknotes are made of non-biodegradable plastic, which means that this typo could actually outlast the human race. Oh, and 46 million copies of the bill were printed before someone noticed. In the publishing industry, we know that you never forget an embarrassing typo, so we can only hope that the proofreader who did the final check on the bill has a tranquil soul and a good sense of humor.
• Jean Vanier was a great man. He made life better for many thousands. He was born in 1928, to a prominent French-Canadian family. Immediately after the war, he saw Holocaust survivors. “I’ll never forget the men and women who arrived off the trains,” he said. They were “like skeletons, still in the blue-and-white-striped uniforms.” Their faces were “tortured with fear and anguish.” Vanier had a deep feeling for the plights of people. In 1963, he visited an institution for the mentally disabled. The men living there asked him whether he would visit them again. He wondered, Why shouldn’t the disabled live with those who are able? He took the radical step of inviting two of the men to live with him. This led to the founding of two organizations: L’Arche (meaning “Ark”) and “Faith and Light.” Thanks to them, and their founder, Vanier, there are more than 1,500 communities around the world where the mentally disabled are living a decently satisfying life. Unlike some, Vanier was honored in his own times: by popes and more ordinary people alike. The New York Times hailed him with the designation “Savior of People on the Margins.” Jean Vanier has died at 90. R.I.P.
• For one brief shining moment in the middle of the last century, when the U.S. entertainment industry undertook to satisfy the market demand for wholesomeness, Doris Day made her mark. Her charm was in her golden voice and good looks but also in her personality and style: frank but crisp and polished, plainspoken and well spoken at the same time. She began as a teenage singer with big bands in the 1930s. Before long, Doris Kappelhoff of Cincinnati was Doris Day of Anytown, U.S.A. Her recording of “Sentimental Journey” in 1945 put her on the map. From radio she glided into movies, starring in nearly 40 of them, including Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much , between 1948 and 1968, by which time the proper lady whom Day epitomized had begun to fall out of fashion. She turned down the role of Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate , finding the script “vulgar.” After retreating from the business in the 1970s, she returned to do a little TV, first to pay off debts, then to promote animal welfare. Will future generations rediscover her genius? Que será, será . Dead at 97. R.I.P
• After surviving not one but two double lung transplants, rising opera star Charity Tillemann-Dick passed away on April 23 after a battle with cancer. A lyric and coloratura soprano, Tillemann-Dick pursued her career with passion and dedication despite suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension. Even though doctors told her she would never sing again after the transplants, Tillemann-Dick’s post-operation debut album, American Grace , landed at No. 1 on Billboard ’s 2014 “traditional classical” chart. She was the national spokesperson for the Pulmonary Hypertension Association, frequently told her inspiring story in talks, and published her memoir, The Encore , in 2017. Tillemann-Dick is mourned by her mother, ten siblings, and her husband. R.I.P.
• John Lukacs, historian and occasional contributor to NR, devoted his career to the study of World War II and the Cold War. About the latter he could be misguided: He inconsistently admired George Kennan, both for formulating the policy of containment and for turning on it. About World War II, however, Lukacs was superbly on target. He understood the attraction of Hitler and National Socialism: their air of efficiency and seeming modernity. He revered Winston Churchill for his determination to resist this malignant wave of the future. Never denying these titanic figures their role, Lukacs also honored Tocqueville’s admonition to historians of democratic ages, to study the choices and decisions of myriad ordinary people, since they too affect the course of events. His masterpiece, Five Days in London: May 1940 , brought heroes and humanity into crystal-clear focus. It is the print version of Dunkirk and Their Finest Hour , only better. Dead at 95, R.I.P.
THE MUELLER REPORT A Phony ‘Crisis’
A braham Lincoln used to tell the story of a man who was asked how he felt as he was being tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail: “If it wasn’t for the honor of the thing, I’d rather walk.”
Bill Barr might feel the same way about being held in contempt by Jerry Nadler’s House Judiciary Committee.
Nadler and other members of the Democratic leadership have declared a constitutional crisis over Barr’s handling of the Mueller report in general, and specifically a couple of redacted lines, including one footnote, in the 400-page report.
To review the plot: Nothing in the regulations required Attorney General Bill Barr to release any of the report, let alone release it in its entirety. He did anyway, with minimal, entirely defensible redactions that the DOJ worked through with Mueller. He then testified for hours in public before a Senate committee about his handling of the report, while declining to appear for more voluntary testimony before a House committee the next day over a process issue (the committee wanted a counsel to question Barr; the attorney general objected, likely because he didn’t like the optics).
Collectively, then, and often working at cross-purposes, the Trump administration has done Congress an enormous favor the last two years. It appointed a special counsel; not only let him finish his work but cooperated with him (despite Trump’s ineffectual scheming against the investigation); didn’t object to his writing a narrative for public and especially congressional consumption; and with only a brief delay handed the full report, signed, sealed, and delivered, over to Congress, potentially to use as a roadmap for impeachment. Most of Jerry Nadler’s work has been done for him.
For the New York Democrat to turn around and have his committee vote to hold Bill Barr in contempt is truly bizarre. Barr’s alleged offense is the redactions. But he has made an almost entirely unredacted report available to top Democrats to review. They have refused to do so, boycotting the further information that they say they so desperately need.
The redactions that Barr can’t undo relate to grand-jury material. These are extremely minor in the obstruction volume — now the most politically relevant part of the report — amounting to a few lines. The notion that they would change anything is absurd, and regardless, the rules written by Congress forbid their release to Congress (something Congress might have considered prior to the onset of this purported crisis)."

It’s still very early, but Biden’s initial strength should force us to contemplate a disturbing possibility, as I wrote for Politico today :
The Joe Biden polling surge has raised the frightful specter of Democratic rationality.
What if Donald Trump hasn’t driven Democrats insane, sending them into a spiral of self-defeating radicalism, but instead made them shockingly pragmatic?"
'Meeting Gorbachev' Movie Review | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ross Douthat,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/06/03/meeting-gorbachev-werner-herzogs-unexpected-documentary/,"May 16, 2019 11:22 AM Mikhail Gorbachev in Meeting Gorbachev (Werner Herzog FilmProduktion)
I am surprised to be writing this review, because I am surprised that the movie I’m reviewing, Meeting Gorbachev , even exists. Not because of its subject, Mikhail Gorbachev’s remarkable career and peculiar ghostly afterlife, which is certainly a worthy subject for a documentarian. But because that subject seems such an unlikely one for this particular director — who is Werner Herzog, existentialist documentarian, Teutonic pessimist, the most instantly recognizable narrative voice in nonfiction film. (André Singer is his co-director.) Advertisement Advertisement
Herzog has made movies over the years that touch on politics, but only glancingly and incidentally. His familiar topics are the pitiless grandeur of nature (Antarctic, Amazonian, subterranean) and the human being in isolation and extremis — whether a conquistador going mad in the jungle, a bear-whisperer meeting his demise in wild Alaska, or a POW escaping from a prison camp in Vietnam. I always imagined him regarding politics as somehow beneath his notice, its substance as mere ephemera compared with geologic time, its personalities as vain and strutting figures unaware of their animal nature, their foredoomed mortal state.
Yet here he is, sitting across from the 88-year-old Gorbachev and asking him respectful questions about glasnost, looping in Lech Walesa and George Shultz to comment on the Cold War’s final years, weaving together footage both familiar and unexpected from one of the 20th century’s most important, most unusual, most simultaneously admirable and pitiable political arcs. Advertisement
One of Herzog’s recent films, a 2016 documentary on volcanos, included a characteristically grim reflection that seems well suited to the subject of the Soviet Union’s last emperor. It’s good that we have volcanos, our German Qoheleth ruminated in that film, because they remind us that “the soil that we are walking upon is not permanent. There is no permanence. No permanence to what we are doing, no permanence to the efforts of human beings. No permanence to art. No permanence to science.”
And no permanence to statesmen, either. From the memento homo — “remember you are a man” — that a slave was supposed to whisper to parading Roman conquerors, down to Enoch Powell’s famous line about all political lives ending in failure (unless you’re fortunate enough to be assassinated), everyone knows that political success is always shadowed by eventual disappointment, the provisional triumph by the long defeat.
But it’s rare to find a case where a great man’s triumph and his failure were so tightly bound to one another, like conjoined twins feeding off the same nutrition, as they were for Gorbachev. He ended the Cold War; he lost an empire. He saved the world; he destroyed his own power. He ended a cruel era in his country’s history; he ushered in an era of ruin and collapse. Were these different chapters in his story, or just the same story seen from different angles, through different apertures? Can they be separated? If not, could they have been separated, had events fallen out differently, had Gorbachev’s own choices been different from what they were?
I didn’t come into Meeting Gorbachev expecting answers, but I did hope for some strange alchemy, in which Herzog’s harsh questions and stare-into-the-void style drew out something unexpected from either Gorbachev himself or the historical material, casting the ironies of the Soviet Union’s ending in an unexpected light. Alas, too much of the documentary is straightforward rather than deeply Herzogian, with talking heads and news footage and fairly predictable political interpretations of events, which portray Gorbachev as a prophet of peace without honor in our own forgetful time, and emphasize especially the achievements you would expect a German film to focus on — his efforts to abolish nuclear weapons, his willingness to accept the peaceful reunification of Germany. Advertisement
Meanwhile there are almost no Russian voices save Gorbachev’s own, making the movie itself an example of the dynamic that doomed him — the contrast between his elevated status in the West and his weaker political position at home, the way he became a celebrity and even a saint in Berlin and London and New York while discontent mounted in the empire he was trying to reform. Advertisement Advertisement
That discontent makes its inevitable appearance in the movie — we watch the hapless coup plotters face the cameras, and Boris Yeltsin on the tank, and the cascade of secessions that dissolved the USSR — but we never hear from anyone Russian who might challenge Gorbachev’s rosy claim that “we all won” the Cold War, who might say something more about the sense of defeat and crisis and collapse that’s as much his legacy as the nuclear treaties, who might help explain why so many of today’s Russians prefer the Putinist fist to their old leader’s talk of “cooperation and disarmament.” Advertisement
Nor does Herzog push hard enough in the moments when Gorbachev himself seems to break with the movie’s message, and you get a taste of his own realpolitik instincts, his own less-than-utopian regrets. “I should have sent him off somewhere,” he says of Yeltsin — a line that’s pregnant with themes the documentary leaves unexplored.

Abortion Heartbeat Bill & Best Way to Protect Life | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/state-level-abortion-restriction-best-way-to-protect-life/,"About The Editors May 16, 2019 1:52 PM Governor Kay Ivey (R, Ala.) signs into law the Alabama Human Life Protection Act, after both houses of the legislature passed the bill, in Montgomery, Ala., May 15, 2019. (Office of the Governor State of Alabama/Handout via Reuters)
N early three decades after the Supreme Court declared it had settled the national abortion debate with its Casey decree upholding Roe v. Wade , tens of millions of Americans stubbornly continue to believe that each human being is endowed with the unalienable right to life at her creation, not her birth.
This month, elected representatives in several states have acted upon this foundational belief: The Michigan senate passed a bill to protect unborn children from second-trimester dismemberment abortions; Georgia outlawed abortion once a baby’s heartbeat is detected (about four weeks after conception); and Alabama enacted a law to protect the lives of almost all unborn children once pregnancy is detected (about two weeks after conception). Advertisement Advertisement
Federal courts, following existing Supreme Court precedent, will certainly strike down the laws in Georgia and Alabama. But the Supreme Court should not continue to hold that state laws regulating abortion are unconstitutional, for the two simple reasons identified by Justice Scalia in his Casey dissent: (1) the Constitution says nothing about protecting a right to abortion and (2) American society had long permitted states to ban or otherwise regulate it.
Today’s Supreme Court should acknowledge that it failed to settle the national debate on abortion. It should restore the right of the American people to enact laws protecting the lives of human beings who haven’t been born. It should finally act on the conclusion of Justice Scalia’s Casey dissent: “We should get out of this area, where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining.”
All Americans who support the Constitution and the rule of law should favor dismantling an unjust and unconstitutional legal regime that imposes a policy of abortion-on-demand in all 50 states. The ultimate goal of all pro-life Americans goes beyond overturning Roe and Casey and merely returning the question to the states, of course: We work toward a society in which every child is protected by law and welcomed in life. Advertisement Advertisement
Lawmakers in both Georgia and Alabama were acting upon this sound principle, but because lives are at stake, sound principles and pure motives aren’t all that matter. Pro-life Americans should think long and hard about whether their righteous impatience is leading them to make imprudent mistakes that will ultimately set back the cause of protecting life.
The abolitionist zeal on display in Alabama in particular runs the risk of making the ultimate extinction of abortion less likely. No, contrary to some false reporting in the media, neither Alabama’s nor Georgia’s law would punish women who obtain abortions. (And Alabama’s law permits abortion in three circumstances: When a mother’s physical health is endangered; when an unborn child suffers from an anomaly that would cause its death shortly after birth; and when a psychiatrist certifies that the mother would likely commit suicide or kill her child without an abortion.) But unlike Georgia’s law, Alabama excluded a rape exception."

New York Times & Abortion -- Personhood Confusion by Mary Ziegler | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/personhood-confusion-in-the-new-york-times/,"May 16, 2019 3:23 PM (Carlos Barria/Reuters)
The central error in Mary Ziegler’s op-ed comes in its second sentence: “By passing bills that would severely restrict abortion, lawmakers in Alabama and Georgia have in effect asked the Supreme Court not only to overturn Roe v. Wade immediately, but also to recognize the personhood of the fetus.” This is simply untrue, and all the argumentation she builds atop the premise is therefore structurally unsound. Advertisement Advertisement
There is no prospect that the Supreme Court is going to rule that human beings in the fetal stage of development are “persons” for the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment. (My views on the subject of whether they are constitutional persons, and what the answer entails for the justices, are outlined here .) No justice has ever taken the position that they are.
Neither the Alabama nor the Georgia law requires the Supreme Court to declare that a human fetus is a constitutional person for its upholding. A ruling that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, and that Roe and its progeny are overruled, would allow them to be upheld even in the absence of such a declaration. Nearly every legislator who backed those laws would be overjoyed by such a ruling."
Joe Biden 2020 Campaign and Democratic Party Miscalculations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/joe-biden-campaign-democratic-party-miscalculations/,"Follow David French on Twitter May 16, 2019 7:08 PM Joe Biden joins Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti at a campaign stop in Los Angeles, Calif., May 8, 2019. (Kyle Grillot/Reuters)
I think it’s safe to say that there are many, many progressive Democrats who are more than a little surprised — and a lot chagrined — at Joe Biden’s polling dominance. Look at FiveThirtyEight’s polling roundup. Aside from a few high and low outliers, he leads the race by a solid 20 points (at least). Even better for him, he’s dominating with nonwhite voters, and after Iowa and New Hampshire — where he leads — the race is heavily weighted towards states with substantial numbers of black voters.
Look, I know it’s early. I know Hillary had massive leads in 2008 and 2016, only to lose and almost lose. I know that Biden has been a terrible campaigner in his two previous presidential races. But Biden is already demonstrating enough strength that Politico has a long piece today asking, “ Did the Left Misread the 2020 Democratic Primary ? ” Here’s a key paragraph:
It’s not just Biden’s rising poll numbers that suggest that the activist left is out of step with most Democrats; it’s the ideological makeup of the entire Democratic Party. Fifty-six percent of Democrats self-identify as “moderate” and 9 percent even embrace “conservative,” according to an April poll from the Judy Ford Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. While leftist activists pine for the end of the legislative filibuster to grease the skids for partisan legislation, a December GW Politics poll found that 66 percent of Democrats said they prefer elected officials who “make compromises with people they disagree with” over those who “stick to their positions.” Only 36 percent of Republicans said the same.
NR’s own Rich Lowry made a similar observation, also in Politico :
[A]s Harry Enten of CNN, among others, has been insisting for some time, the average Democrat is older, more moderate or conservative, and less likely to have a college degree than you’d guess from following Twitter or cable TV.
These voters were underserved by the rest of the field, and Biden is taking dead aim at them with the simple message that he can beat Trump.
The Democrats didn’t just underestimate Joe Biden’s personal appeal (at least so far), but it appears they also underestimated the size of his ideological lane. As Democrats stampeded left, with even more “ moderate ” candidates like Beto arguing for tearing down existing border walls, Biden was left largely alone to position himself as the ideal candidate for a whopping 65 percent of the Democratic electorate. Which of the “ woke ” candidates is best-positioned to challenge Biden for that enormous slice of the Democratic voting public? Meanwhile, the progressive (mostly white) wing of the primary is crowded and competitive."
Abortion Debate: Democrats Ignore Pro-Life Women | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/democrat-politicians-ignore-pro-life-women/,"May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Signs outside the Supreme Court during the March for Life in Washington, D.C., January 18, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) These stirrings at the state level may provoke an overdue reckoning about the truth of abortion.
S enator Doug Jones (D., Ala.) tweeted in response to anti-abortion legislation passed by the Alabama legislature: “I refuse to believe that these Republican men represent the views of most Alabamians. Their action is both unconstitutional and shameful. The people of Alabama deserve to be on the #rightsideofhistory – not the side of extremists. Women deserve better.” Advertisement Advertisement
It seems much more likely that Senator Jones is the one who is out of step. A 2014 Pew poll found that Alabama is among the most pro-life states in the country, with 58 percent saying the procedure should be illegal in “all or most cases.” It’s possible that among the 58 percent who oppose abortion in Alabama, some will find the legislation passed this week to be too extreme, but don’t count on it. Just last year, voters approved a state constitutional amendment declaring that it is “the public policy of this state to recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.” Fifty-nine percent of voters voted in favor.
Since the vote making abortion illegal in Alabama, Republican members of the Alabama senate have been targets of accusations — mostly that they are male and white. A number of outlets pointed to the fact that all 25 votes in favor of legislation were white, male Republicans. Okay. But the Alabama house has lots of Republican women. The bill’s sponsor in the lower chamber was a woman, as was the governor who signed the bill. Advertisement
Those who fixate on the “problem” of whiteness may think this is some sort of knock-out blow, but the truth is that these senators are accurately representing the views of their constituents, including women. A 2018 PRRI survey found that 60 percent of Republican women agreed with the statement “ Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided and should be overturned.” This compared with only 47 percent of Republican men. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake notes that women tend to be more religious than men, and this aligns with more conservative views on abortion.
Still, partisan lines remain blurry on abortion. More than a third of Republicans favor keeping abortion legal. Until Brett Kavanaugh’s ascension to the Supreme Court, the issue may not have ranked very high for them. They could vote for Republicans — with whom they agree on other issues — safe in the knowledge that nothing would threaten the regime of legal abortion throughout the nation. Now that the Court has a possible majority for overturning Roe , the calculations of moderate Republicans may change. Advertisement Advertisement
Moderate Democrats may be out in the cold too. In the aftermath of the 2018 election, Democrats burst from the gate with legislation that expanded abortion even beyond Roe ’s contours. New York passed the Reproductive Health Act that permits even late-term abortions in the “absence of fetal viability, or [when] the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.” When health is interpreted to mean “mental health,” it opens a gaping loophole. Sometimes late-term pregnancies must be terminated to save the mother’s physical health — but that doesn’t mean an abortion is required. Even very premature infants commonly survive these days.
Democrats also painted themselves as abortion extremists by opposing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, insisting — falsely — that late-term abortions are only performed when there are severe fetal abnormalities or when the mother’s life is at risk. Advertisement
But now Republicans risk being viewed as extremists. With seven states having passed abortion laws that may transgress the boundaries established by Roe , the question now is whether the pro-life cause is best served by this frontal-assault strategy. The Alabama law makes no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. And while it’s true that the child bears no guilt for the way he or she was conceived, it may not be prudent to refuse to concede that ground. A 2018 Gallup poll found that 77 percent of respondents want abortion to be legal in cases of rape and incest. The exception has long been included in other pro-life legislation, such as the Hyde Amendment."
"If Roe v. Wade Is Reversed, Abortion Fight Moves to the States | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/abortion-politics-roe-v-wade-state-legislatures/,"May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Signs at the March for Life rally in Washington, D.C., in 2017. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) If Roe v. Wade is reversed, it will be only the beginning.
T he state legislatures are full of activity related to abortion. This is as it should be.
New York passed a law making it easier to perform grisly late-term abortions and then celebrated by lighting up the Empire State Building in pink, as though a baby girl had been born rather than sentenced to death by surgical dismemberment. Other states are considering similar laws, while in Georgia abortion has been prohibited once a heartbeat is detectable, and in Alabama the procedure has been almost categorically outlawed. Advertisement Advertisement
This is what the post- Roe world is going to look like: divisive, ugly, and possibly irreconcilable — democratic , in a word.
This raises two conjoined but discrete issues.
The first is the question of Roe v. Wade itself as law. Advertisement
Roe is the great textbook case of judicial activism, an absurd and legally indefensible substitution of the political preferences of seven justices of the Supreme Court for the actual text of the Constitution, which was quite silent on the question of abortion for nearly two centuries before Justice Harry Blackmun et al. discovered an ancient constitutional right to abortion lurking in the penumbras of the law. Unless you are committed in principle to the proposition that it is the role of the Supreme Court to act as a national moral superlegislature — the American answer to Iran’s Guardian Council: black robes, scholarly pretensions, and all — then Roe is obviously indefensible as a constitutional question.
If you doubt that, try this: Rather than starting with the conclusion that the right to abortion must be protected and then searching the Constitution for support, try doing the opposite: Read the document itself with a little bit of intellectual honesty and see whether the right to abortion is sitting there so plainly that the laws made by the nation’s lawmakers on behalf of the people who elected them should be nullified. There are many abortion-rights supporters who have concluded that as a strictly legal matter, Roe is somewhere between mistaken and preposterous. Almost no one honestly believes that the case was decided on the constitutional merits— and very few abortion-rights advocates honestly expect it to be endlessly affirmed on its constitutional merits, either. This fact is often implicit in their writing, and in their sputtering vitriol. Advertisement
But the question of what is legal is separate from the question of what should be legal. It is very strange (if you are unused to enduring such great concentrations of stupidity) when a figure such as Representative Brian Sims angrily defends abortion on the grounds that it is legal . Of course abortion is legal. Abortion opponents intend to change the law. It was legal in the United States to own slaves, once. It was legal in Germany to work toward the complete extermination of Jews as a people. The abortions that are performed in the United States are, mostly, legal abortions. That is what abortion opponents propose to put an end to. Advertisement
What will that mean? Advertisement
Wired ’s Virginia Heffernan offers a hysterical account of that question, placing abortion restrictions in the company of such phenomena as “honor killings and clitorodectomies.” American progressives, being parochial, often invoke the condition of woman in backwards Islamic societies in such debates, apparently unaware of the fact that Islamic law takes a relatively liberal view of abortion. Pakistan, for example, has relatively loose abortion rules and one of the world’s highest abortion rates. There are many countries that have stricter regulation of abortion than does the United States, and the prominent ones among them are not Iran and Afghanistan but . . . France , where abortion-on-demand is permitted only through the twelfth week of pregnancy and very tightly restricted thereafter. Most European countries have stricter abortion laws than does the United States in terms of restricting terminations after the first trimester, though as a practical matter first-trimester abortions (the great majority of abortions) may be easier to procure in many European health-care systems. France, Germany, and Switzerland are not very much like Yemen. (An exception to the common European practice is the situation in the continent’s formerly Communist countries, where abortion has approximately the legal status of a minor dental procedure.)"
Movie Review: ‘John Wick 3’ Violence Is Cathartic and Fun | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/john-wick-3-parabellum-violence-cathartic-fun/,"May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Keanu Reeves in John Wick 3: Parabellum (Niko Tavernise/Lionsgate) Keanu Reeves trusts moviegoers to know the difference between fantasy and reality.
I t’s a great pop-culture moment when the title character of John Wick 3: Parabellum (Keanu Reeves) is asked, “What do you need?” and straight-faced Reeves, in the lanky hair and facial scars denoting underworld conflict, responds, “Guns, lots of guns.” Finally, the “gun violence” cliché favored by hack politicians and robotic media spokespeople becomes the butt of a joke . Advertisement Advertisement
Reeves’s answer repeats his 1999 futurist hit The Matrix , but it also defies moralizing pundits of all persuasions who repeat that “gun violence” malapropism as if screaming for redundant gun-control laws will get to the core of an American social problem. Their hypocrisy ignores the popular, real-world use of weaponry for self-protection and Second Amendment license.
John Wick 3: Parabellum is impudent fun precisely because it exults in all-American freedom from victimhood. The title comes from the Latin Si vis pacem, para bellum (If you desire peace, prepare for war). Wick, a crime-world renegade, defends himself however possible — with guns, fisticuffs, martial arts, any object at hand used as slapstick.
It’s no accident when John Wick runs through Times Square and an electronic projection of Buster Keaton — the movies’ original kinetic artist — looms overhead. Director Chad Stahelski, a stuntman-choreographer, glories in the fantasy pleasure and physics of self-defense. That is the theme of the entire survival-against-aggression John Wick series. Advertisement
Produced by Reeves, according to his uncanny pop-culture taste (proven by the Bill & Ted movies, the Speed films, and The Matrix ), this series provides his most effective role: a revenge-seeker trope that doesn’t wear thin like Liam Neeson’s gung-ho father in the Taken movies. This film-noir existentialism is filtered through video-game surrealism. John Wicks pays his way through the underworld using gold coins like a Super Mario Brother. Morality is evident in John Wick’s asking loyalty of fellow gangland denizens who live by Hobbesian desperation and observe Dante’s warning: “Consider your origins: You were not made to live as a brute but to follow virtue and knowledge.” Advertisement
As John Wick outwits the clock that is counting down his excommunication from the criminal underworld (a $14 million bounty makes him a target for all comers), he bargains for cooperation from equally lethal desperadoes: Halle Berry, Anjelica Huston, Laurence Fishburne, and Mark Dacascos. The video-game storyline hits on something primal in the masculine psyche, but when Halle Berry’s Sophia commits to her “blood bond” with John Wick, it is the most satisfying, truly feminist argument for self-defense since the Margaux Hemingway film Lipstick . Berry’s blond-streaked ponytail feminizes older-wiser aggression, which is to universalize it. She commands her two protective Belgian Malinois dogs who attack men with phantom speed, always going for the groin. This characterization is the crowd-pleasing peak of Halle Berry’s career. Advertisement
Not a pantywaist proselytizer for world peace, Stahelski knows there’s pleasure in movie kinetics. The sheer nerve of the relentless fight scenes is hilarious, and their proficiency is cinematically gratifying. Parabellum lifts him to action-movie heights.
Last year’s best trailer, for Christopher McQuarrie’s helter-skelter violence in Tom Cruise’s soulless Mission: Impossible: Fallout , promised a dazzling he-man battle in a gleaming, mirrored restroom between Cruise, Henry Cavil, and an Asian martial-arts assassin, but the snazzily designed scene never exploded. Stahelski combines gun violence and kung fu knowingly, as art. He conducts each action showpiece as a witty bullet ballet, out-wowing John Woo. John Wick’s opponents keep popping up — two, six, twelve, 30. He combats them serially like a Park Chan-wook line-up. But each bullet-bouncing, hatchet-swinging, limb-twisting encounter — starting in a weaponry archive with stained-glass windows, then a motorcycle marathon on the Williamsburg Bridge — recalls James Bond movie hyperbole done with musical rhythm. Advertisement Advertisement
The jokiness of the choreography mixes Bruce Lee’s The Chinese Connection with Michael Kidd’s Seven Brides for Seven Brothers . These are not fight scenes so much as kinetic rampages presented as whimsical interludes, such as when twin Asians congratulate Wick on his prowess, and then attack him with clam shuckers and unstoppable verve — they’re like hellbent Nicholas Brothers.
Parabellum ’s new kind of violence lacks the visual flair of Olivier Megaton’s Transporter 3 , and the video-game script departs from the classical virtues of Luc Besson’s action flicks. But through actors like Reeves, Berry, Fishburne, Huston, and Ian McShane, we’re reminded that commonplace humanity can accommodate the survival urge even if society abhors it. Russian ballet instructor Huston tells John Wick, “As you know, art is pain. Life is suffering.” Stahelski’s multiple kills give relief — they have a beautiful, quick finality, and the pummeling sound of twelve-gauge blasts almost tickles, like a punch line. Advertisement
This is the first video-game narrative I find acceptable. (The Marvel movies lack comparable skill.) On-screen subtitles distancing us from the horror of violence are part of Stahelski’s video-game sophistication. He’s not one of the ’70s movie brats hewing to traditional morality, yet he still pays homage to the aesthetic beauty of his masters: Keaton, Boorman, Leone, Kurosawa. And Stahelski takes us way beyond the Indiana Jones gun-versus-scimitar scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark . A swimming-pool fracas even makes a joke of the underwater bullet traces in Saving Private Ryan . Spielberg’s humanism has been flipped (Spielberg doesn’t even have it anymore), yet Stahelski’s talent and Reeves’s good will prevent Parabellum from turning sour or sadistic. Advertisement"
Bill De Blasio Presidential Campaign: No One Takes Him Seriously | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/bill-de-blasio-presidential-campaign/,"Follow Jonah Goldberg on Twitter May 17, 2019 6:30 AM New York City mayor Bill de Blasio attends the dedication of the new Statue of Liberty Museum on Liberty Island, May 16, 2019. (Mike Segar/Reuters) Could the unimpressive mayor of New York City stumble to the front of the parade?
T he most rational response to the news that New York City mayor Bill de Blasio wants to be president is to ask, “Of what?”
When informed that he wants to be president of the United States and not of, say, the local organic-hemp co-op, perhaps the next best response would be to take a page from the South and say, “Bless his heart.” Advertisement Advertisement
One of the more charming things about de Blasio is his amiable lack of self-awareness. He seems to have no idea that he doesn’t impress anybody. The obliviousness is somewhat understandable. He did get elected — twice. But his victories have more to do with the dysfunction of New York City politics than with any strength on his part. In 2013 he won the Democratic primary — which assured victory in the fall — in the lowest election turnout in decades. After 3 percent of New Yorkers voted for him, he saw a landslide.
He must bring a similar perspective to his poll numbers. According to a Quinnipiac survey released this month, 76 percent of New Yorkers don’t think de Blasio should run for president — and it’s not because they’re desperate to keep him on the job.
It was famously said of George H. W. Bush that he was the kind of guy who was born on third base and thought he’d hit a triple. This was always more than a little unfair to the elder President Bush, given that at 17 he signed up to become one of the youngest combat pilots in the Pacific during World War II and went on to work harder at politics and public service than arguably any president since (with the possible exception of Jimmy Carter). But the barb drew blood because it sounded clever and exploited the always reliable American resentment against affluent political dynasties. Advertisement Advertisement
The same dynamic isn’t at work with de Blasio. He didn’t grow up poor, but he didn’t grow up rich either. Politically, he is the consummate example of someone born — or in this case elected — on home plate who can’t understand why no one in the stands is cheering his home run. When he was poised to win reelection, he was asked by New York m agazine why he wasn’t more popular. He admitted that he was somewhat mystified. Given the strength of the economy and the low crime rate, “You’d assume they’d be having parades out in the streets” in his honor, he said.
They’re not, because he is a Ferris Bueller. In the movie Ferris Bueller’s Day Off , Ferris (Matthew Broderick) jumps out in front of a parade and acts like he’s leading it. De Blasio inherited the successes of Rudolph Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, two mayors who wrestled the city back from the brink of social and economic collapse. Advertisement
“De Blasio’s record as mayor doesn’t have a policy theme,” writes Nicole Gelinas in City & State New York . “It’s just a mishmash of half-executed ideas that add up to a city little different than it was before he got here. Even his biggest accomplishments, rather than striking out in a bold new direction, are building on existing trends.” Advertisement
Worse, de Blasio takes credit for the successes of his predecessors on crime, poverty, and the economy but refuses to take responsibility for the growing problems on his watch, from abysmal mass transit to an exploding homeless population.
And that points to the real problem with de Blasio: He’s lazy. He’s famous for being asleep on the job — literally. He often oversleeps, arriving late for important events such as funerals or, in one case, an event in his own residence. “Some voters have a perception that he has an up-at-the-crack-of-noon attitude,” political strategist Gerry O’Brien told the New York Post . Advertisement
This laziness isn’t just physical but intellectual. Like the president of a college chapter of the Young Socialists, de Blasio is the sort of politician who thinks rolling out of bed and announcing something is the same thing as doing something, that boldness in rhetoric is a substitute for boldness of action. New Yorkers — even very liberal New Yorkers — see that."
Biden Campaign: Poll Surge Suggests a Pragmatic Democratic Party | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/joe-biden-campaign-democratic-party-voters-pragmatic/,"May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Joe Biden at a campaign stop in Iowa City, Iowa, May 1, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Has Donald Trump made the Democrats pragmatic?
T he Joe Biden polling surge has raised the frightful specter of Democratic rationality.
What if Donald Trump hasn’t driven Democrats insane, sending them into a spiral of self-defeating radicalism, but instead made them shockingly pragmatic?
Biden’s early strength suggests it may be the latter, that the reaction to Trump is so intense that it has crossed some sort of event horizon from fevered fantasy of his leaving office early via resignation or impeachment to a cold-eyed, win-at-any-cost practicality. Advertisement Advertisement
If this is true, one of the exogenous factors that could appreciably increase Trump’s odds of reelection — a zany Democratic nomination contest leading to a nominee much too far left for the American electorate — may not materialize.
The commonsense play for the Democrats has always been to nominate a nonsocialist with appeal to Obama-to-Trump voters in former Blue Wall states — if not necessarily Biden, then someone with a similar, relatively moderate profile. Advertisement
If hardly dispositive, Biden’s robust numbers at least suggest that this play is more likely than it seemed in the very early going, when candidates were stumbling over one another apologizing for sundry alleged offenses in the Woke Olympics.
If that’s not going to be the true dynamic of the race, I’m as surprised as anyone. What’s extraordinary, though, is that almost every Democratic candidate might have been misreading it as well, and chasing the wrong rabbit down the track. Advertisement
Certainly, Bernie Sanders dominated the intellectual and policy debate in the wake of his 2016 run, driving other presidential candidates to embrace his signature proposals. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a genuine political star.
It’s only because the center of gravity of the party has clearly moved left that Biden, always a standard liberal, now sounds like a centrist when he calls himself an Obama-Biden Democrat.
But, as Harry Enten of CNN, among others, has been insisting for some time, the average Democrat is older, more moderate or conservative, and less likely to have a college degree than you’d guess from following Twitter or cable TV. Advertisement
These voters were underserved by the rest of the field, and Biden is taking dead aim at them with the simple message that he can beat Trump.
Electability is usually a wan, uninspiring rationale for lackluster establishment campaigns, but Trump may have transformed into something more urgent and exciting for Democrats in 2020. Advertisement
In this scenario, fear and loathing of Trump doesn’t drive Democrats into a politically risky dead end like impeachment — although that’s still possible — but a sensible appraisal of how to beat him at the ballot box.
In a recent CNN poll, about half of Democrats said it’s “extremely important” that a candidate have a good chance of beating Trump, much higher than any other candidate quality. Journalists on the trail have reported hearing the same thing from Democratic voters.
Of course, if we learned anything from 2016, it’s that pundits know much less about electability than we think. Biden’s paper strength may dissipate.
How often in American politics has the old candidate promising a restoration won? History shows that Democrats have had better electoral luck when they fall in love with a youthful candidate promising a fresh start. Think Bill Clinton, not Walter Mondale; Barack Obama, not Hillary Clinton.
Biden’s long record has plenty for Trump to shoot at, and after he gets beaten up over his past positions on busing and crime, he may have some of the same trouble as Hillary turning out the Democratic base. Advertisement
Biden’s electability will have to be proven not just in general election polling matchups with Trump, but day-by-day campaigning during the primaries with more incoming than he’s experienced to date."
Ray Blanchard Discusses Transgender Science and Orthodoxy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/ray-blanchard-transgender-orthodoxy/,"May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Ray Blanchard Ray Blanchard discusses transsexualism, transgenderism, and the increasing politicization of psychiatry.
R ay Blanchard is an American-Canadian sexologist who served as the head of clinical sexology services in the law and mental health program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto from 1995 to 2010. His research on paraphilias, gender-identity disorders, and sexual orientation spans nearly 40 years. From 2008 to 2012 he was a member of the Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Advertisement Advertisement
On May 11, after he posted a clinically informed opinion on transgenderism in response to a direct question, Blanchard’s Twitter account was suspended for violating its “Hateful Conduct” policy. His account was later reinstated, and Twitter apologized for this “error.” (Others have been less lucky .) Here, Blanchard expands on the content of his offending Twitter thread and discusses transgenderism with National Review ’s Madeleine Kearns.
***
Madeleine Kearns: You believe transsexualism and gender dysphoria to be a mental disorder. Am I correct in saying that’s how it appears in the DSM-5 [the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the bible of psychiatry]?
Ray Blanchard: Yes. The diagnostic entity is called gender dysphoria in DSM-5. It was first introduced in DSM-III under the name transsexualism, and it was still called transsexualism or gender-identity disorder, I forget which, in DSM-IV, but in DSM-5 the name of the entity got changed to gender dysphoria. But the diagnostic criteria are fairly similar. Advertisement Advertisement
Kearns: Why was there a name change then? Was that to avoid the word “disorder”?
Blanchard: Yes, it was primarily to make patients and also trans activists and transsexual-activist groups feel happy or that they had been listened to, but I would say that the name change probably owed more to — or owed as much to politics as it did to any change in the science.
Kearns: What do we mean by “gender identity”?
Blanchard: What do I mean by it?
Kearns: Yes. Let’s start with that.
Blanchard: Well, back in the days when I was writing a lot on that topic, which is quite a while ago now, I tended to avoid the phrase “gender identity” because I think that it’s a trivial concept when it’s applied to normal people. I mean normal men and normal woman know what sex they are, and they respond to that automatically, like when looking for a washroom. But I think it’s only at very unusual moments that a normal man or woman has a conscious awareness of “I’m a woman” or “I’m a man,” and this is often a highly emotional situation.
So, I don’t find the concept of “gender identity” useful for normal people, and the concept of cross-gender identity is really not a normal gender identity which has found itself lodged in the wrong body. Cross-gender identity is a constant preoccupation with, and unhappiness about, the individual’s gender. So, I guess you could say I believe in cross-gender identity, but I don’t much believe in gender identity. Advertisement Advertisement
Kearns: What’s the difference between transsexualism, which is a word that you actually hear less often now, and transgenderism?
Blanchard: In a word: fashion. Transgenderism was at one point meant to be a broader umbrella term that would include transsexuals who either were aspiring to, or had undergone, sex-reassignment surgery, as well as people with less or remitting forms of gender dysphoria. That was the original difference between transgenderism and transsexualism, that transgenderism was the broader category. Subsequent to that happening, transsexualism gradually became a dirty word, and who knows why. It’s this kind of word magic that always happens in contemporary politics. I’ve started deliberately using the word transsexualism again.
Kearns: So “transgenderism,” or at least my understanding of it, collapses all distinctions so that it doesn’t really matter if you’ve had surgery or if there have been no physical changes. In that sense, “transgenderism” is more comprehensive. Is that accurate? Advertisement
Blanchard: Transgenderism is definitely more comprehensive than transsexualism, but I need to, not correct you, but I want to point out one thing here, and it’s that even in the days when the standard word that people used was “transsexualism,” there was still inconsistent usage, some people reserving it for individuals who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery and some people using it simply to mean a patient who has a continuous, chronic, and unremitting sense of being or of wanting to be the opposite sex. Even in the days when transsexualism was the standard word, there was inconsistent usage as to whether or not the person had to have had surgery or be surgery-tracked.
Kearns: And in what sense do you use it? Advertisement Advertisement
Blanchard: I use it in the sense of someone who has the most extreme form of gender dysphoria and not in the sense of someone who has undergone sex reassignment. I just use it to mean somebody who feels very strongly, and at all times, that they should have been, or in some essential Platonic sense actually are, the opposite sex.
Kearns: It seems to me that many activists hold two contradictory positions simultaneously. One is that transgenderism is not a mental disorder and the other is that gender dysphoria is a mental disorder. How does one make sense of that?
Blanchard: I think it’s this kind of Talmudic reading of the DSM. It’s like, well, gender dysphoria is a mental disorder because that’s now listed in the DSM. But transsexualism isn’t a mental disorder because that’s no longer a word used in the DSM. It’s just this kind of weird, naïve outsiders’ literalist interpretation of how the DSM is written.
Kearns: Is it anything do with the fact that, obviously for insurance and medical providers, there would need to be a medical problem in order for it to justify treatment? Advertisement
Blanchard: Absolutely. There has to be a diagnosis in order for third-party payment. Whether we are talking public or private insurance, there has to be a diagnosis of some disorder to pay for sex-reassignment surgeries or for people who have drug plans in order to pay for testosterone injections or estrogenic medications for biological males. So this is something that for the trans activists is a stumbling block. If there isn’t a disorder of some sort, then all individuals who wanted to have sex-reassignment surgery or exogenous hormones would be paying the whole cost themselves.
Kearns: Right, because it would be essentially a cosmetic treatment at that point?
Blanchard : Correct.
Kearns: I’m really interested in your work on “paraphilia.” What is the difference between “paraphilia” and, say, a “disorder” or an even older term perhaps, a “perversion”?
Blanchard: Yeah sure, “perversion” was an older label for what’s now called paraphilia. Correct.
Kearns: And is the only difference a linguistic one where the morally loaded connotations of the word are removed? Or is there a substantive difference?
Blanchard: I don’t think there is any substantive difference. I mean the word “pervert” had become part of the lay vocabulary and was routinely used as an insult or as a derogatory comment whether seriously or in jest. Everybody knew the word pervert, had a vague idea of what it meant, and knew that it was something bad. So, the word paraphilia was substituted because it had a nice medical sound to it, and it had not and still has not entered the popular vocabulary as an insult.
Kearns: In the study of sexuality, how do we ascertain and define what is “normal”?
Blanchard: Well “normal” is virtually never defined. I guess the issue is how we define “disorder” — and that’s a very difficult problem. I think that a lot of lay people have the notion that some place somewhere there is this official definition of disorder and that one can decide whether or not any given behavior or constellation of behaviors is a disorder by comparing that to the official definition of disorder, conceived in something like the official kilogram stuck in some lab in Paris, and the reality is that there isn’t one single definition of disorder that you can compare anything to and decide if it is or is not a disorder.
Kearns: Do you worry at all about a sort of concept creep, where something that maybe wouldn’t have been a problem or at least a medical problem in the past is now a problem? I’m thinking specifically of gender dysphoric young people and the extent to which clinicians give out the diagnosis.
Blanchard: Well, I wouldn’t call that concept creep. I’d call that a problem with the quality of training and expertise of people doing the diagnosis.
I mean — yes. There were people concerned about concept creep during the last revision of the DSM-5, or the last revision of the DSM which eventually became the DSM-5. But I know from having been on one of the work groups that there was a constant preoccupation everywhere, among people involved in the work groups, not to keep expanding the number of things called disorders — because everyone was aware that this was an issue. I can’t say that it was an issue in the general public because the general public doesn’t concern themselves with this, but in the intelligentsia there was an issue with increasing numbers of behaviors being listed as disorders. So there was a lot of awareness of this.
Kearns: I guess that relates to the earlier point about a sort of overexpansion of definitions with the transgenderism versus the earlier concept of transsexualism. Advertisement
Blanchard: Yes. Clearly in the days when transsexualism was the standard diagnostic entity that people were concerned with, everybody was aware that there were lower degrees of dissatisfaction with biological gender.
Kearns: Let’s talk a little bit about the difference between the females and the males with gender dysphoria. You’ve noted in past research that virtually all female gender dysphorics are homosexual. Do you think that is still the case with the new “Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria” (ROGD) sub-category [a description coined by the medical doctor and researcher, Lisa Littman, in 2018, which describes the unprecedented surge of teen girls identifying suddenly as the opposite sex]?
Blanchard: No, I don’t. I think one of the things that distinguishes the ROGD cohort is a greatly larger proportion of cases who think of themselves as gay men trapped in women’s bodies. This had existed in previous decades, but it was maybe a handful of biological females who said, “I feel like a gay male, and I would like to have surgery or hormones so that I can live my life as a gay male.” It did exist, but it was very, very rare. Now among the ROGD cohort I can’t give you numbers, but I get the impression that’s it’s much, much more common for the ROGD girls to present that way than it ever has been.
Kearns : And is that a sort of body-image problem or a response to trauma?
Blanchard : I think that these ROGD kids are such a mishmash of kids with a variety of personality pathologies and social problems. I wouldn’t really know what to tell you about what’s within that mix.
Kearns : Okay but as for what Littman describes as the “social contagion” element, I obviously understand that it’s very complicated and there are lots of moving parts, but do you have any sense of any particular thing that helps explain the sudden spike of cases of these kids?
Blanchard: No, I don’t. I think there have historically been precedents, and they have typically involved more females than males, which is also true like in the ROGD phenomenon. For example, recovered memory was a fad for a while, and ritual satanic child abuse was a fad. Typically, these involved more female adolescents than males for whatever reason.
If you want to go a little further back in history and look at the Salem witch trials in the U.S. in the late 17th century, most of the individuals who were claiming to have been attacked by witches and who were executed as witches were predominantly female. While it was older ladies who were hanged as witches, it was young ladies who accused them of witchcraft. So there seems to be something about a young adolescent female population that is particularly vulnerable to certain kinds of psychiatric phenomena.
Kearns: That is fascinating. And obviously distinct from the work you did on the males who were either the autogynephilic [erotically aroused by the thought of themselves female] or homosexual transsexuals [wanting to become women, because they are uncomfortable and conspicuously feminine as men]. Do you have a sense of how these two categories relate to the new form of transgender women [males] who, other than maybe taking some hormones, haven’t really altered their male genitalia at all?
Blanchard: Well there certainly seems to be a lot more of them now than there ever was before. In the days when I was working in the field, certainly a large proportion of biological males went ahead and had vaginoplasty. I’m not sure what is with this new crop because I had left the area and was working on other things. So, this was before the Internet basically. Which seems to have somehow encouraged a different social organization of people with gender-identity disorders.
Kearns: You said in the Twitter thread, the one that got you suspended for 24 hours, that you think that sex-change surgery is still the best treatment for adults who have been carefully screened and who have tried other forms of treatment which haven’t worked. Do you have thoughts on the body of research which has contraindications and the suggestion that this can make matters worse?
Blanchard : Well that’s a very interesting question. I can’t think of any body of research that systematically identified which of your cases are going to be psychiatric catastrophes, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t any, because I haven’t worked in that area for many years now. But the emphasis was always on how you select cases for surgery and what proportion of them have regrets, which was usually considered a kind of touchstone of a bad outcome. But I don’t know about much research on the cases who actually reverted. Probably the biggest source of information on that now would be these cases who have been ROGD girls and now are starting to revert back to the female roles. There’s a group of them who have been doing YouTube videos, so there’s more activity from that quarter. Advertisement
Kearns : You suggest that 21 is a good age. Why 21 as opposed to, say, 18?
Blanchard: Any age-specific criterion of mine of course is going to be arbitrary. So why 21 and not 20? Why 21 and not 22? It could be the same question. The clinic that I worked at was 21, and were there patients who had surgery and regretted it? Yes, absolutely there were, but it was maybe 2 or 3 percent of patients who after surgery decided to go back to living in their original gender role and interestingly, none of them ever blamed us for having approved them for surgery, even though they eventually rejected their role. So I think wherever you set that line, you are going to make some mistakes.
The question is what the more serious mistake is, not approving surgery [for someone] who could benefit but has to wait a few extra years, or approving surgery [for someone] who is not going to benefit and is going to regret and now be permanently surgically altered for the rest of their life.
When you set an age cutoff, it’s not merely a question of how many errors are you going to make in the conservative direction or in the liberal direction, but it’s also a matter of what are the consequences of one kind of error versus the other kind of error. The consequences of being too conservative with regards to an age limit for surgery are basically that the person might have to live for one or two or three years with their original body unaltered when they would have been just as well if they had surgery a few years earlier. But that’s correctable. Once you’ve cut off somebody’s penis and testis or removed their uterus and ovaries, these are irreversible [procedures]. So there is an asymmetry in the two different kinds of errors, not approving surgery when it would have been okay and approving surgery when it’s not okay.
Kearns: As a lay person on this, it seems to me that the sort of vast range of treatments have now been channeled into a narrative of “affirmation” versus “conversion.” How do we make sense of this?
Blanchard: Well I think the use or the application of the words “conversion therapy” to the situation where you are just trying to see if the child can be made to accept his or her biological sex was a deliberate cynical strategy on the part of trans activists to piggyback on the success of the gay-rights movement and say, “What you’re trying to do with children, in getting them to accept their anatomical sex, is the same as what we used to do with gay people and lesbians.” It’s a deliberate attempt to try and piggyback issues that pertained to transsexualism to issues that had pertained to homosexuality, and I think the comparison is specious. It’s a deliberate attempt to confuse the two issues.
Kearns: Yes, it’s been very successful in the mainstream media and so on and so forth.
Blanchard: That’s for sure.
Kearns: Why do you think that is?
Blanchard: That’s a good question. Educated people in general have a sympathy for the downtrodden or the unfortunate that’s built into liberal-arts education in the Western world — and I think that’s a good thing. I think it’s a good thing that people should get some kind of built-in bias towards the underdog and towards the suffering. But I think in this case, that tendency and that bias on the part of liberal media has been misused by trans activists to influence treatment of cases of those who would actually do better in the long term if they could simply accept their anatomic sex, and here I’m talking about the young kids, 60 to 80 percent of whom are going to normalize in gender identity even without any clinical intervention."
"Nordic Countries Scale Back Welfare State, Embrace Free Markets | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Nima Sanandaji,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/nordic-countries-scale-back-welfare-states/,"About Nima Sanandaji May 17, 2019 6:30 AM Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Lofven reads the statement of government in the parliamentary chamber in Stockholm, January 21, 2019. (TT News Agency/Jessica Gow via Reuters) Having watched people game the welfare state, Nordic countries have scaled it back in favor of free markets.
A t a time when the American Left wants to introduce Swedish-style socialism into the U.S., we should remember that generous welfare states pose a moral hazard. Their well-intentioned policies undermine individual responsibility and create a welfare-dependency trap. This is confirmed by history as well as by current developments in Sweden, where cheaters are targeting the country’s welfare system. Advertisement
Even Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of the U.S. welfare state, understood that generous welfare could undermine social virtues. “The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence immediately before me, show conclusively that continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally destructive to the national fiber,” FDR explained in 1935. “To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. It is inimical to the dictates of sound policy. It is in violation of the traditions of America.”
Roosevelt’s views were anything but uncommon. At the beginning of the 20th century, even the proponents of the welfare state were greatly worried that the buildup of welfare programs would endanger the social fabric. To understand why, bear in mind that, for the welfare state to function properly, it is not enough that most individuals pay their taxes. Neither does it suffice for most individuals to follow the norm of using welfare services only responsibly — that is, of not claiming more than they need or are entitled to. For the welfare state to be viable in the long term, the vast majority of individuals must abide by the social contract.
A small-government system relies on its citizens to follow a basic social contract: Do not harm others or their property, and abide by the laws. A government system with generous welfare and transfer programs also relies on its citizens to do that and more: to refrain from overusing benefits. Advertisement
From the individual perspective, as transfer schemes become more generous and taxes are raised, it becomes increasingly lucrative to sideline the social contract, and so incentives in the form of monetary transfers can, and often do, undermine the motivation to depend on the fruit of one’s own labor. Advertisement
If all individuals follow the norms of working, paying taxes, and using welfare programs only when in need, the system will function properly, even when the welfare system is large. If some begin to abandon society’s prevailing norms, however, imitators might follow suit. When those people gaming the system have reached a critical mass, they are liable to change social norms in that regard, leading to an erosion of welfare-related norms and to the collapse of the social contract.
Small-government systems create incentives for people to work hard and take responsibility for their lives. As the level of economic distribution through taxes and transfers grows, the system lessons the incentives for work and responsibility, increasing the incentives to gaming the system. Large-government systems foster dependency by gradually breaking down the norms that allow society to thrive. This, at least, is what we should expect in theory. Advertisement
But in the early 20th century, the proponents of welfare policies argued that the erosion of social norms because of welfare was not a given. People could so appreciate the welfare state that they self-regulated their behavior. Perhaps generous welfare made everybody work harder and take more responsibility? Advertisement
The proponents of the welfare state grew bolder, and then they continued to do so with time. They believed that the moral-hazard risk of welfare states could be avoided, at least in the social-democratic utopias that Scandinavian countries in general and Sweden in particular were often imagined to be.
Many proponents of the welfare state regard Sweden as a model whose policies others should emulate. The country is perceived as having implemented a large-scale welfare state, with generous and broad-ranging public programs, while avoiding the moral hazards associated with welfare policy. The reality is that Sweden’s generous welfare system has been undermined by large-scale cheating that has led to a reduction in welfare-state generosity. If even Protestant Sweden, where the work ethic was once so strong, could not withstand the moral hazard associated with generous welfare, what society can? Advertisement
The World Value Survey gives strong support for the claim that norms in the Nordic countries have eroded. In the 1981–84 survey, for example, 82 percent of Swedes agreed with the statement “Claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled is never justifiable.” In the 2010–14 wave, merely 55 percent held the same view. The pattern is found in the other Nordic nations as well. This fall in responsibility seems to be stabilizing lately, following tax cuts and significant reductions in welfare-state generosity.
A number of attitude studies in Sweden conclude that a significant portion of the population has come to consider it acceptable to live on sickness benefits even if you aren’t sick. A survey from 2002, for example, showed that 60 percent of Swedes believed that it was acceptable to claim sick leave when you were not sick. Four years later, a center-right government was elected on the promise to cut the welfare benefits and taxes significantly. In fact, Swedish governments on both the right and the left have reduced the generosity of the welfare system. Additionally, gatekeeping functions have been introduced, mainly for sick-leave claims, to limit over-utilization and outright cheating. Advertisement Advertisement
Economist Martin Ljunge suggests that the reforms may need to be quite far-reaching to reverse the long-term effect that the welfare state has had. Politicians should consider that such policies can have lasting effects, in the form of eroded morale. Once other circumstances have been adjusted for, Ljunge finds , younger generations are much more likely to use welfare benefits such as sick leave. “The higher demand for sick-leave pay among the younger generations can be seen as a measure of how rapidly the welfare state affects attitudes toward the use of public benefits,” he explains (my translation from Swedish). The moral: Be careful when introducing generous welfare.
The Nordic states have reversed course in economic policies, cutting taxes and welfare benefits, but the moral-hazard problem of the welfare state remains. For example, the Swedish tax authority reports that during 2018 almost a thousand alarms were sent to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency about erroneous transactions, in some cases stemming from false identities being used to claim benefits. Advertisement
Tobias Wijk, an expert at the tax authority, explains that one form of cheating is to bring poor immigrants from other European Union members to Sweden. The person is registered in Sweden with papers for a false job and then enrolled in the welfare system. Various government authorities have been tasked by the Swedish government to tackle benefit-cheating, but, Wijk says, the tax authority expects the problem to continue to rise this year compared with last year.
The market for personal assistants for the handicapped has become a prosperous market for organized crime. The Swedish government estimates that 3 to 6 percent of the funds it distributes for such services go to cheaters. In 2005, the government launched an investigation into wrongful payments by the Swedish welfare system and found that fully 4 percent were illegitimate because of a combination of error and cheating. It is worth noting that the government survey did not distinguish in detail between error and cheating.
A follow-up investigation found that in 2010 between 0.9 and 5.8 percent of welfare benefits paid out by the Swedish government were illegitimate. The estimate is quite imprecise and, again, fails to distinguish between error and cheating. The welfare system and its over-utilization have evolved to a point where planners and researchers cannot even measure the degree of mismanagement and of cheating precisely.
Even as Sweden has reduced welfare benefits, cheating appears to have increased, as criminal actors have homed in on the welfare system. This is one of many reasons why the Swedish welfare system has severe problems with long-term sustainability, as my colleague Gabriel Heller Sahlgren and I show in a study for the Swedish think tank Timbro.
Over-utilization also explains why Sweden and other Nordic countries are gradually shifting from social democracy to free-market reforms and slimmed-down government. In the 2018 election in Sweden, the Social Democrats gained 28.3 percent of the votes, the lowest level since a proportional election system was introduced in Sweden in 1911. The socialist Left Party gained an additional 8.0 percent of the votes. Both parties have shifted their policies significantly away from socialism. The Social Democrats have gone so far as to push through a partial privatization of the pensions system, accepting broad tax cuts for the middle class, and agreeing to let private, for-profit firms compete to provide publicly funded services such as education, health care, and elder care."

A Blinkered Look at Tariffs from MarketWatch | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/blinkered-look-at-tariffs-from-marketwatch/,"May 17, 2019 1:07 PM Shipping containers at a port in Shanghai, China. (Aly Song/Reuters)
For MarketWatch , Brett Arends writes , “Most of what the public is being told about [the Trump administration’s tariffs on imports from China] is either misleading or a downright lie.” What he means is that other people who write or talk about the tariffs aren’t making points that he considers extremely important. Advertisement Advertisement
These points are that tariffs are merely taxes, and these taxes are not large as a proportion of the federal budget. He writes, “Yes, tariffs are ‘costs.’ But they do not somehow destroy our money. They do not take our hard-earned dollars and burn them in a big pile. Tariffs are simply federal taxes. That’s it. The extra costs paid by importers, and consumers, goes to Uncle Sam, to distribute as he sees fit, including, for example, on Obamacare subsidies . . .
“And the amounts involved are trivial. Chicken feed.”
The reason other people have not emphasized these points is that some of them are false and others don’t have much to do with why economists generally look on tariffs with disfavor. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
It is not, for instance, true that all the higher costs that importers and consumers pay as a result of tariffs go to the treasury. Let’s say you’re laid off because the company you work for is paying more for machinery, you’re paying a cost that doesn’t increase tax revenue. If the company is paying more for machinery from a U.S. supplier that was able to raise prices because of the tariff, the extra money it’s paying (and its customers may be paying) doesn’t increase tax revenue either. Advertisement Advertisement
Tariffs tend to be a relatively inefficient way of raising federal revenue because of these kinds of effects: They do a lot of damage to the economy per dollar raised. (You could even say they “destroy our money.”) But the words “deadweight loss” do not appear in Arends’s article."
Adversity Sores and Racial Dscrimination | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Peter Kirsanow,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/adversity-scores-same-game-different-uniforms/,"May 17, 2019 1:04 PM Library on the campus of the University of Washington in Seattle. (File photo: Lindsey Wasson/Reuters) Adversity Scores and Racial Discrimination in Admissions
The College Board’s announcement that it will begin calculating an “ adversity score ” for SAT takers appears another cosmetic attempt to boost the college-entrance prospects of black and Hispanic applicants without addressing the actual causes for the stunning achievement gap between White and Asian students on the one hand and black and Hispanic students on the other. Thus, it will perpetuate, if not exacerbate, the underlying problem. Advertisement Advertisement
The fact that the College Board declines to explain how it weighs and calculates various “ adversity factors ” gives the game away. For decades colleges have employed a variety of opaque formulas to determine admissions yet, curiously, regardless of the mechanics of a given formula, admissions office alchemists always seem to produce remarkably similar racial demographics.
College administrators are well aware that their racially discriminatory admissions policies do not meet the standards set forth by the Supreme Court in Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger. The Court sanctioned the use of racial preferences in admissions provided, inter alia, race was only one factor among many — a mere feather on the scale — in the admissions process. In truth, the race of black and Hispanic applicants is an anvil on the scale, by far the most important component in an application.
Accordingly, college administrators know that the current regime of racial preferences is in perpetual legal jeopardy. The pending case of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard has them nervous. As Stuart Taylor notes, evidence adduced in that case reveals stunning disparities in the objective qualifications of black and Hispanic admitees versus white and Asian admitees. Advertisement
For example, the average SAT scores of Asian students admitted to Harvard between 2010-2015 were 218 points higher than for black students; the average SAT scores for white students were 193 points higher than for black students. Taylor notes that the size of the gaps in high school GPAs were just as massive. Indeed, but for racial preferences the number of black students at Harvard would be only one-seventeenth its present size. Advertisement "
Equality Act & Abortion: Bill Could Mandate Taxpayer Funding | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/equality-act-could-mandate-abortion-funding/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter May 17, 2019 1:54 PM Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D, Calif.) speaks about the introduction of the Equality Act at the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., March 13, 2019. (Leah Millis/Reuters)
Aside from its other harmful elements, the Equality Act that passed the House today amends the 1964 Civil Rights Act and contains redefinitions of key terms that will likely be used to expand abortion rights. As some of the bill’s own advocates admit, the Equality Act could be read to mandate taxpayer funding for abortions and to nullify conscience protections for medical providers who object to performing abortion procedures. The Equality Act defines “sex” to include “pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition,” and, as Representative Chris Smith (R., N.J.) explained on the House floor today, the term “related medical condition” in fact means “abortion.” From Smith’s remarks: In the case Doe v. C.A.R.S. , the Third Circuit stated, “We now hold that the term ‘related medical conditions’ includes an abortion.” Furthermore, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces Title VII, interprets abortion to be covered as a “related medical condition.”
The bill also stipulates that those with “a related medical condition shall not receive less favorable treatment than other physical conditions,” a provision that would disallow physicians from refusing to perform an abortion."
Joe Biden & 2020 -- Democratic Presidential Candidate Is No Centrist | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Deroy Murdock,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/joe-biden-centrist/,"May 17, 2019 4:57 PM Former Vice President Joe Biden announces his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, April 25, 2019. (Biden Campaign Handout via Reuters) His voting record places him solidly on the left.
P oor Joe Biden.
The Delaware Democrat has served the liberal cause since he reached the U.S. Senate in 1973 as a barely legal 30-year-old, just 46 days after he fulfilled the Constitution’s senatorial-age requirement. He voted reliably with the Left and was a loyal vice president to Barack Obama, the most big-government POTUS since LBJ, if not FDR. Advertisement Advertisement
Biden’s fellow statists now slam him for not being leftist enough. Biden must feel as would Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas) if he ran for president in 2024 and other Republicans called him a RINO.
• “I think if you look at Joe’s record, and you look at my record, I don’t think there’s much question about who’s more progressive ,” Senator Bernie Sanders (Socialist, Vt.) told ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl.
• Biden “does not particularly animate [me] right now,” said U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.). “I don’t want to go back. I want to go forward.” The architect of the Green New Deal is believed to have targeted Biden’s less-ambitious approach to so-called “global warming” when she said Monday, “ I will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to find a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives.” Advertisement
• “We can’t let a so-called ‘centrist’ like Joe Biden divide the Democratic Party and turn it into the party of ‘No, we can’t,’” declared the AOC-affiliated Justice Democrats. The group’s spokesman, Waleed Shahid, told Politico in February: “There is going to be a war within the party. We are going to lean into it.” Advertisement
Biden’s legislative votes earned him an Americans for Democratic Action Liberal Quotient of 80 for 2008, his last year as senator. Conversely, the American Conservative Union gave him a 0 for 2008 and a 12.67 lifetime rating. By these metrics alone, Biden’s Democratic opponents in the Senate are to his left:
• Colorado’s Michael Bennet: 2017 ADA 90; Lifetime ACU 5.45 Advertisement
• New Jersey’s Cory Booker: ADA 95; ACU 5.10
• New York’s Kirsten Gillibrand: 100; 4.41
• California’s Kamala Harris: 100; 4.55
• Minnesota’s Amy Klobuchar: 100; 4.7
• Vermont’s Bernie Sanders: 95; 6.78
• Massachusetts’ Elizabeth Warren: 100; 4.16
Nonetheless, the notion that Biden is a closet moderate is laughable. Advertisement
“During his 36 years in the Senate, several congresses went by with Joe Biden proposing tens of billions in spending increases and not a single dollar of spending cuts,” National Taxpayers Union Foundation president Pete Sepp told me. “According to our BillTally system, Senator Biden sponsored or co-sponsored $322 million of spending hikes for every dollar of suggested decreases. His vote record was even worse. Aside from three years in the mid 1990s, he routinely landed in the lower ranks of pro-taxpayer scores, finishing dead last in 1994 and 96th in 2008, his final year as a senator.” On every NTU taxpayer-friendliness report card between 1998 and 2008, Biden earned an F .
Biden is solid-Left on taxes, too.
“First thing I’d do is repeal those Trump tax cuts ,” Biden told South Carolina voters on May 4. This was no slip of the tongue. On Monday, Biden said in New Hampshire: “When I’m president, if God willing I am, we’re going to reverse those Trump tax cuts .”
Americans for Tax Reform foresees these self-inflicted wounds , among many more, if a President Biden killed the Trump/GOP tax cuts: Advertisement
• A family of four on a $73,000 median income would suffer a $2,000 tax hike .
• A single mother of one child earning $41,000 would pay $1,300 more in taxes .
• Obamacare’s individual-mandate tax would menace millions anew.
• Killing the 20 percent income deduction would hobble small businesses’ jobs machine.
• The industrialized world’s highest corporate tax rate would return and cripple U.S. competitiveness.
Biden would stuff these tax hikes into the pockets of illegal aliens. As he explained in Los Angeles on May 8: “I think that anyone who is in a situation where they’re in need of health care, regardless of whether they’re documented or undocumented , we have an obligation to see that they’re cared for.” So, Biden would force you to finance medical care for people who have broken into the U.S., even as 29.7 million law-abiding citizens lack health coverage and some 554,000 Americans sleep on sidewalks, many sorely needing the mental-health and anti-addiction treatment that would move them indoors.
This is not centrism."
Tulsi Gabbard and the Issue of 'Russophile' Campaign Donations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/tulsi-gabbard-campaign-donations-daily-beast-story/,"May 17, 2019 6:10 PM Rep. Tulsi Gabbard at the She the People forum in Houston, Texas, April 24, 2019. (Loren Elliott/Reuters)
An odd turn of affairs: The RNC touted a Daily Beast story that reported “Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard’s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination is being underwritten by some of the nation’s leading Russophiles.” Not donations from Russians, mind you, but a couple thousand dollars in donations from Americans with publicly stated views that are more or less in line with those of Vladmir Putin’s regime. Advertisement Advertisement
Whether or not Gabbard considers herself a friend to Russia, Russian-backed media sees a potential friend in her. Earlier this year, NBC News found “at least 20 Gabbard stories on three major Moscow-based English-language websites affiliated with or supportive of the Russian government: RT, the Russian-owned TV outlet; Sputnik News, a radio outlet; and Russia Insider, a blog that experts say closely follows the Kremlin line.” On the other hand, Russia is pretty widely loathed in the Democratic party right now, so it’s not surprising that RT and like-minded outlets would be eager to spotlight a Democratic lawmaker who isn’t denouncing Putin and the Russian government. (Right now, RT television is also pretty excited by Mike Gravel’s declaration that Joe Biden’s foreign policy is American imperialism .)
No doubt, Gabbard’s worldview takes her far away from the rest of her party. In a March 2018 hearing , she suggested that the election meddling we saw from Russia in 2016 was more or less fair play considering past U.S. actions in other countries’ elections.
Gabbard said,
There was a study that was released the end of 2016 documenting 81 elections in 47 countries between 1946 and the year 2000 where the United States either overtly or covertly sought to influence the outcome of elections in these countries. We’re successful more often than not, and this doesn’t include any of the CIA or military regime change overthrows that also happened in addition to this. As recently as the Iraq War, during the Iraq War we paid millions of dollars to plant propaganda articles in Iraqi newspapers, sought to influence Russia’s elections in 1996. I say all this to raise the question about — if someone turns on cable news today, and to hear a lot of the conversations here, one would think that Russia’s actions in 2016, that this is the first time this has ever happened. And that the United States does not have the history that we do with the tactics that we have and may continue to use.
Gabbard’s overall record isn’t consistently pro-Russian; she’s voted for sanctions and condemned the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. What really sets her apart from the rest of the Democratic field (and most mainstream U.S. foreign-policy thought) was her adamant opposition to helping Syrian rebels, and her willingness to meet with Bashir Assad .

Where Russia has friends, Tulsi Gabbard is usually standing up for them, beyond Assad. She strongly objected to the arrest of Julian Assange . She accused “neocons, neolibs and the MSM” of pushing for war in Venezuela, where Russia is backing the Maduro regime, and scoffed “no wonder North Korea won’t give up their nukes.” She contended , “TV talking heads love trying to goad Trump into going to war w/ Russia.” In 2015, she defended Russia’s military operations in Syria: “Bad enough US has not been bombing al-Qaeda/al-Nusra in Syria. But it’s mind-boggling that we protest Russia’s bombing of these terrorists.” Advertisement"
Trump Administration's New Immigration Plan Emphasizes Skills | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/trump-administration-immigration-plan-emphasizes-skills/,"May 17, 2019 6:52 PM President Donald Trump delivers remarks on immigration reform at the White House, May 16, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) D onald Trump has associated himself with the radical idea that the United States should have a legal-immigration system like that of Canada. He unveiled an immigration plan on Thursday that would emphasize skills, moving us closer to the Canadian model from our current, foolishly monomaniacal focus on family reunification. The problem with letting immigrants bring in all sort of relatives is that it makes the immigration system random, and effectively takes control over picking and choosing who will come here out of our hands. The Trump plan would limit family immigration to immediate family — spouses and minor children — and eliminate the visa lottery, which is just as arbitrary as it sounds. Instead, the emphasis would be on a point system and higher-skilled immigrants with extraordinary talents, professional vocations, and academic accomplishments. The plan also includes an array of welcome enforcement measures, although it’s not clear yet if it includes the most important of all, an E-Verify system for employers that would do much to turn off the jobs magnet drawing illegal immigrants here. There is a lot to commend in the plan. It would be a significant step toward making our immigration system more rational. With so many people around the world desperate to come here, it is insane that we aren’t choosing the immigrants who best serve our interests. Under the plan, we would favor the immigrants best-suited to thriving in a 21st-century economy, and English and civics tests would select for immigrants with the best chance of easily assimilating. It is something of a breakthrough to have an administration that considers the interests of American workers in formulating immigration policy and doesn’t want to continue to flood the lower end of the labor market with greater numbers of low-skilled immigrants, a persistent feature of so-called comprehensive immigration reforms. Our complaint is that the plan doesn’t call for lower numbers of legal immigrants given the historic wave of immigration that has continued unabated for decades now. But the enforcement measures, especially if they include e-Verify, should reduce the flow of new illegal immigrants and diminish the current illegal population, reducing the level of immigration overall. Also, it would have been better if Trump had come into office with a plan along these lines ready to be immediately written into legislation when Republicans controlled Congress. If so, with the right horse-trading and a deft touch, it might have been possible to get important reforms written and signed into law.

Iran: John Bolton Is What Trump Administration Needs | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Continetti,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/iran-deal-supporters-john-bolton/,"May 18, 2019 5:00 AM White House national security adviser John (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The Iran echo chamber tries to save its nuclear deal.
W hatever the opposite of a rush to war is — a crawl to peace, maybe — America is in the middle of one. Since May 5, when John Bolton announced the accelerated deployment of the Abraham Lincoln carrier group to the Persian Gulf in response to intelligence of a possible Iranian attack, the press has been aflame with calls for America to show restraint, pursue diplomacy, and rein in the madman with the mustache before he starts a war.

Never mind that President Trump, Mike Pence, Mike Pompeo, Patrick Shanahan, and Bolton have not said a single word about a preemptive strike, much less a full-scale war, against Iran. Never mind that the president’s reluctance for overseas intervention is well known. The antiwar cries are not about context, and they are certainly not about deterring Iran. Their goal is saving President Obama’s nuclear deal by manipulating Trump into firing Bolton and extending a lifeline to the regime.
It’s a storyline that originated in Iran. Toward the end of April, Zarif showed up in New York and gave an interview to Reuters where he said, “I don’t think [Trump] wants war,” but “that doesn’t exclude him basically being lured into one” by Bolton. On May 14, an adviser to Rouhani tweeted at Trump, “You wanted a better deal with Iran. Looks like you are going to get a war instead. That’s what happens when you listen to the mustache. Good luck in 2020!” Advertisement
And now this regime talking point is everywhere. “It’s John Bolton’s world. Trump is just living in it,” write two former Obama officials in the Los Angeles Times . “John Bolton is Donald Trump’s war whisperer,” writes Peter Bergen on CNN.com. “Trump’s potential war with Iran is all John Bolton’s doing. But it might also be his undoing,” says the pro-Iran Trita Parsi on NBCNews.com. “Is Trump Yet Another U.S. President Provoking a War?” asks Robin Wright of The New Yorker . Guess her answer.
“We cannot repeat the days before the Iraq war when even many of our most reliable news outlets repeated and amplified what was, in fact, a flimsy case for war,” Wendy Sherman writes in the New York Times . She would rather our most reliable news outlets repeat and amplify anti-Bolton talking points instead. Sure, America suspects Iran was involved when “four commercial tankers were reportedly sabotaged off the coast of the United Arab Emirates,” and “Saudi Arabia also reported that drones sent by Iranian-supported Houthis attacked Saudi oil facilities.” But, look, “Iran has denied this.” What more do you need to know?

This is the Iran echo chamber at work. Recall former Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes’s admission to the New York Times Magazine in 2016, when he said, “We created an echo chamber” to attack the Iran deal’s opponents through leaks and tips to the D.C. press. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” And: “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project, and whomever else. So we know the tactics that worked.” They worked because “the average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That’s a sea change. They literally know nothing.”
And so, when President Obama framed the choice as between his deal and “going to war,” no one batted an eye. When Obama said the forces of good would triumph “despite the money, despite the lobbyists” — paging Ilhan Omar — the echo chamber repeated his words. When Obama’s administration portrayed President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif as reformers eager to join the international community, even though real power lies with Ayatollah Khamenei and Qassem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), reporters dutifully conveyed the preferred narrative. Iranian hostage taking, missile building, terrorism financing, and proxy fighting was downplayed or ignored. Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, were portrayed as the real obstacles to peace. Advertisement
What baloney. Still, President Obama got his deal — for a few years, anyway. When Donald Trump’s victory threatened Obama’s foreign-policy legacy, the echo chamber resumed operation. The same Obama officials, journalists, and foreign-policy experts who had pretended Rouhani was Gorbachev spent two years telling us that Donald Trump was a Russian asset, possibly had been since 1987, had committed “treason,” and would be driven from office after Robert Mueller exposed his crimes. They were ready to throw Trump’s incoming national security adviser in jail for violating the Logan Act, even as John Kerry, and now it seems Dianne Feinstein, talk shop with Zarif. Advertisement
Members of the echo chamber aren’t for attacking Iran, but they are all for slandering its American opponents. The latest target is Bolton. One of the most ferocious critics of President Obama, he has been an effective and hawkish national security adviser for President Trump. Why is he, not Iran, being blamed for heightened tensions? It’s because the Iran deal, and perhaps the Iranian regime, is on life support. Advertisement Advertisement
Context is all. On April 8, the president announced he was designating the IRGC a terrorist organization, threatening its financial base. On April 22, Pompeo announced that the United States would end waivers for sanctions on Iranian oil. That same day, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz. On May 8, one year after the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal, Iran threatened to follow suit.
“Rouhani did not signal the end of the deal entirely,” reported CNBC.com, “but gave Europe an ultimatum: It will have 60 days to either follow the Trump administration or resume oil trade with Iran to save the agreement, violating U.S. sanctions. A failure to do the latter would prompt Tehran to return to high level uranium enrichment, the Iranian leader said.”
This isn’t diplomacy. It’s nuclear blackmail. And it’s a sign of desperation. The Iranians are in a box. U.S. sanctions are crushing the economy, but if they leave the agreement with Europe, they will be back to square one. To escape the box, you try to punch your way out. That’s why Iran has assumed a threatening posture: Provoking an American attack could bolster waning domestic support for the regime and divide the Western alliance. Advertisement"
Steele Dossier & a ‘VERIFIED APPLICATION’ That Wasn’t | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/the-steele-dossier-and-the-verified-application-that-wasnt/,"May 18, 2019 5:00 AM (Jim Bourg/Reuters) Former officials are fighting over who deserves blame.
H ere’s what you need to know: In rushing out their assessment of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, Obama-administration officials chose not to include the risible Steele-dossier allegations that they had put in their “ VERIFIED APPLICATION ” for warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) because . . . wait for it . . . the allegations weren’t verified. Advertisement Advertisement
And now, the officials are squabbling over who pushed the dossier. Why? Because the dossier — a Clinton-campaign opposition-research screed, based on anonymous Russian sources peddling farcical hearsay, compiled by a well-paid foreign operative (former British spy Christopher Steele) — is crumbling by the day.
As I write, we mark the two-year anniversary of Robert Mueller’s appointment to take over the Russiagate probe — which is fast transforming into the Spygate probe. Special Counsel Mueller inherited the investigation seven months after the Obama Justice Department and FBI sought a FISC warrant to monitor former Trump-campaign adviser Carter Page. By then, it was already acknowledged that dossier information was “ salacious and unverified ,” to quote congressional testimony by former FBI director James Comey.
That was problematic on a number of levels. Advertisement
If dossier claims were still unverified when Comey testified to Congress in mid 2017 (and thereafter), then those claims could not have been verified when the Obama Justice Department and FBI submitted it to the FISC as a “VERIFIED APPLICATION” in October 2016. It also had to have been unverified on January 6, 2017, when the Obama administration chose to include a sliver of the dossier in the briefing of President-elect Trump — the day after intelligence chiefs met with President Obama in the Oval Office and discussed what Russia information should be shared with the incoming Trump team.

Indeed, as I’ve pointed out before , a January 2018 memo that has not gotten nearly enough attention, written by Judiciary Committee Senators Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), recounts then-director Comey’s concession that there was no meaningful corroboration of the dossier. Rather, the FBI and Justice Department included it in the “VERIFIED APPLICATION” because they trusted Steele (who, I note for the zillionth time, was not a source of information but an accumulator and purveyor of information from unverified sources. Steele’s credibility, consequently, was beside the point).
Moreover, FBI and Justice Department procedures require that information be vetted for factual accuracy before it is submitted to the FISC. The rules of the FISC require the Justice Department to notify the court promptly if misstatements or inaccuracies have been discovered. Far from alerting the FISC that information in what it boldly labeled the “VERIFIED APPLICATION” was actually unverified , the Justice Department and the FBI kept reaffirming the dossier allegations to the court — in January, April, and June of 2017.

This week, a dispute between the camps of Comey and Obama CIA director John Brennan broke out into the open — a dispute over which of them tried to force the dossier findings into the aforementioned intelligence-community assessment (ICA) . This is a remarkable rift given that the dossier allegations in fact were not included in the ICA (though, again, the infamous “pee tape” claim was included in the briefing of then-president-elect Trump). Advertisement
Behold how radioactive the dossier has become: Former officials now fight over which of them deserves credit for failing to further inflate its importance. Advertisement
Former congressman Trey Gowdy, who was privy to some of the underlying classified record, indicates that Comey has the better of the argument . There is, it is suggested, an email trail in which the former FBI director relates that Brennan was advocating the dossier’s inclusion in the ICA.
That also makes logical sense. There is good reason to believe Brennan, though he has tried to distance himself from the dossier, pushed it on congressional leaders in the late summer of 2016 — at around the same time Steele and his Fusion GPS collaborators were pushing it on select media outlets, hoping it would blow a Moscow-size hole in the Trump campaign.
One leader briefed by Brennan, then–Senate minority leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), began writing letters urging Comey to investigate the purported Trump-Russia conspiracy. Reid’s August 27 letter , apparently referring to the memos Steele was compiling into a dossier (“a series of disturbing reports”), highlights purported meetings between a “Trump advisor” and “high-ranking sanctioned individuals” in Moscow in July — an obvious allusion to the dossier’s claim that Carter Page met with Putin associates Igor Sechin and Igor Divyekin. (Page has always strenuously denied this allegation, it has never been verified, and the Mueller report implicitly rejects it.)
Brennan, however, is pushing back. Through an unidentified “ former CIA official ” (wonder who that could be!), he claims it was Comey who tried to force the dossier claims into the ICA. According to this account, Brennan, along with Obama’s national intelligence director, James Clapper, heroically refused Comey’s plea because the dossier had not been corroborated. Comey is said then to have decided unilaterally to brief Trump on part of it. Advertisement Advertisement
There are some flaws in this story. For one thing, Brennan and Clapper are both notorious for lying to Congress. Second, Comey has testified a number of times that the other intelligence chiefs wanted him to brief Trump on a portion of the dossier (see, e.g., here ), but Brennan and Clapper have not heretofore disputed his testimony. And third, it looks like the extremely abbreviated dossier briefing was little more than a pretext to elevate the dossier into a story the media would report. That is, unlike the Obama Justice Department and the FBI, media outlets that possessed the dossier had been reluctant to use it because it had not been verified. Yet, once it was leaked that intelligence agency chiefs had used it to inform the president-elect, the dossier became news regardless of whether it was true.
Why is that relevant? Because it appears that Clapper is up to his eyeballs in discussions about the dossier with CNN shortly before CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on it. Advertisement
Presumably, all of this will be sorted out now that Attorney General Bill Barr has appointed John Durham, the excellent U.S. attorney for Connecticut, to investigate the investigation.
For now, though, the telling thing is that no one wants to be associated with the dossier. Even if former director Comey is right that it was Brennan, not he, who was trying to slide the dossier into the ICA, Comey’s FBI still used it in the FISC. Plus, Comey himself did agree to brief Trump on it, though in a very incomplete way — alerting the president-elect to the lurid story about prostitutes in a Moscow hotel, but studiously omitting the tiny detail about how the FBI had used the “salacious and unverified” dossier in the FISC to contend that Trump’s campaign was in a conspiracy with Russia to undermine the election.
The urge to run from the dossier is understandable. In Washington, about ten days before the FISC authorized surveillance of Page, Steele was interviewed by the State Department official Kathleen Kavalec , who took notes that were passed along to the FBI. With very little effort (probably two minutes on Google), Kavalec was able to figure out that one of Steele’s major allegations was an invention.
Specifically, Steele claimed that the Trump-Russia conspiracy involved exploitation of the Russian consulate in Miami to transfer money and information. But there is no Russian consulate in Miami . As the Twitter investigative wiz Undercover Huber details , Steele’s source for this allegation (unidentified Source E) is also the source for the pee-tape story, as well as the foundational allegation that Donald Trump and the Kremlin were in a “well-developed conspiracy of cooperation.”
None of these allegations has ever been verified, and the Mueller report rejects the claim of a Trump-Russia conspiracy.
In the “VERIFIED APPLICATION” that the Obama Justice Department and the FBI submitted, the FISC was led to believe Steele was reliable and that there was no known “derogatory information pertaining to” him — no mention was made of the known errors in his dossier reporting. The first VERIFIED APPLICATION included a laborious footnote ( here , pages 15 to 16) vaguely “speculating” that Steele “likely” had a political motivation to discredit Trump’s campaign; the FBI and Justice Department concealed from the court that, far from speculation, they had certain knowledge — from Steele himself — that he was passionately opposed to Trump’s election, and they further failed to disclose that the dossier allegations had been sponsored by the campaign of the opposition candidate (Hillary Clinton). Moreover, the court was told that the FBI did not believe Steele was the “direct” source of dossier information leaked to the media. Yet it not only seemed highly likely Steele was a direct media source; Steele had told Kavalec that he was managing relationships with media outlets, some of which “have” his information (he mentioned “NYT and WP” — the New York Times and the Washington Post ).
No mention of Steele’s State Department interview was made to the court. In fact, the court was informed that the only government agency to which Steele had provided information was the FBI ( here , page 23). This could have been an oversight; but it could alternatively be that the State Department interview was withheld out of fear that wounds to Steele’s credibility would doom the “VERIFIED APPLICATION.” Advertisement
Meanwhile, the Daily Caller ’s Chuck Ross reports that Steele identified two of his sources for Kavalec: Russia’s former spy chief Vyacheslav Trubnikov and top Kremlin adviser Vladislav Surkov. This underscores the possibility that Steele was duped, and that the dossier is a Russian disinformation operation that U.S. intelligence agencies fell for. And there’s more: Trubnikov has intriguing ties to Stefan Halper , whom the FBI used as a confidential informant to approach Trump campaign figures Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis."
