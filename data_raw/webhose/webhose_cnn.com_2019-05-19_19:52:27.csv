Welcome to the post-Mueller presidency - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/trump-presidency-after-robert-mueller-investigation-week-in-review/index.html,"(CNN) Donald Trump's presidency -- or at least his first term -- will be measured this way: Before the Mueller Report (BMR) and After the Mueller Report (AMR).
BMR ran from the start of Trump's presidency -- when the FBI investigation that would become special counsel Robert Mueller's probe was already underway -- until this past Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. AMR began soon after as people -- media types, members of Congress, average Joes -- began to either read and digest Mueller's report or watch and read coverage of it . Like it or not -- and lots and lots of Democrats won't like it -- we are in a post-Mueller world now. And that new reality brings with it a series of critical choices for both the White House, congressional Democrats and the 2020 candidates who want to unseat the President next November. Here's a look at the choices before each group. Read More 1) Trump: He has spent much of the past year relentlessly blasting the Mueller team, the media for its coverage of the Russia investigation and even members of his own administration for their lack of perceived loyalty to him on all of it. Now, the Mueller report is (mostly) behind Trump. Does he let sleeping dogs lie? Move on to immigration and the economy full time between now and 2020? Can he? 2) Congressional Democrats: Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her House Democratic colleagues face perhaps the most difficult -- and critical -- choice in the coming weeks. Do they push forward -- as Mueller seemed to suggest -- on the obstruction evidence in the report? That would likely necessitate pursuing impeachment against Trump. Pelosi has made clear she is opposed to that move -- unless there was bipartisan support for it in the country. That seems unlikely to happen now. But Pelosi will also come under more pressure from liberals to penalize Trump. 3) 2020 Democrats: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts came out Friday afternoon with a clear message: It's time to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. But Warren's campaign was also quick to tell CNN's MJ Lee that ""Warren's decision to call on impeachment proceedings does not mean that the topic will become central theme of her 2020 campaign going forward -- Warren plans to continue to rolling out major policy proposals.""

My guess is that most 2020 candidates will follow that lead. Say Trump should be impeached -- and maybe include it as a line or three in their stump speech -- but not build a campaign around it. The Point : The Mueller report release is a pivot point in Trump's presidency -- and re-election effort. We are living in the post-Mueller political world, and all of the players need to make decisions accordingly.

Fact check: Erik Prince's public claims vs. the Mueller report - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Holmes Lybrand,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/prince-mueller-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Erik Prince , the founder of the controversial private security firm Blackwater, makes a number of appearances in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Noted for his ties to the United Arab Emirates, Prince was a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump during the campaign and spent time around senior officials with the Trump transition team, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Prince is the brother of Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
Over the past two years, Prince has come under scrutiny for connections he may have been trying to make between the incoming Trump administration and Russian officials. Of particular interest is a meeting Prince had in January 2017 with a high-ranking Russian official. Prince has made several public statements regarding these activities and testified behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. (The transcript was later released to the public.) In all of Prince's comments, he has tried to downplay the importance of the meeting, characterizing it as a chance encounter. However, the Mueller report undercuts some of Prince's assertions, and shows the degree to which the meeting was planned and was focused (at least in part) on making Russian connections with the incoming administration. Read More Here's a look at some of Prince's claims before his interview with Mueller compared to those he made to Mueller's team. Prince: Meeting with Putin-connected Russian was an impromptu casual encounter Mueller report : The meeting was established prior to Prince's trip. In January of 2017, Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean. During an interview with CNN in August 2017, Prince claimed that he was ""there on business"" with Emirati officials and that he simply ""met a guy,"" referring to Dmitriev. In this telling, the meeting was so insignificant, Prince said he couldn't ""even remember his name."" But according to the Mueller report, before going to the Seychelles, Prince met with an emissary of the UAE named George Nader several times in New York and ""discussed Dmitriev,"" with Nader who ""inform(ed) Prince that the Russians were looking to build a link with the incoming Trump administration."" Nader sent Prince the Wikipedia entry on Dmitriev and told Dmitriev that he had met ""with some key people within ... the inner circle"" in reference to Prince, the report says. This appears to directly contradict how Prince characterized the meeting to CNN, when he said he'd just ""met a guy."" There is also a disparity in the way Prince described the meeting, and whether he was acting on behalf of himself or as a bridge to the Trump team. Prince: I was not representing Trump in any way in meeting with Dmitriev. Mueller report: Prince told Dmitriev he would relay information to Trump's campaign chief executive Steve Bannon. In his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Prince was asked if ""the point of that meeting (was) for you to represent the Trump campaign or Mr. Trump in any way?"" He replied ""No."" This contradicts how both Nader and Dmitriev viewed the meeting with Prince. According to the report, Nader told Prince to meet with Dmitriev ""in light of (Prince's) relationship with the (Trump) Transition Team"" in order to ""discuss issues of mutual concern."" The report also states that, ""Prince acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team."" Prince also told Dmitriev that he would ""inform Bannon about his meeting with Dmitriev,"" and would follow-up if there was interest from the Trump team. Bannon told the special counsel that ""Prince did not tell him in advance about his meeting with Dmitriev."" Clearly, the meeting was set up by Nader for Dmitriev to meet someone who had connections to the incoming Trump administration, and according to the report Prince knew this. Prince also appears to have mischaracterized key details of his meeting with Dmitriev, including failing to mention that there were two meetings Prince: ""So I met him in the bar and had a drink."" Mueller report: They met twice, first in Nader's villa and again at a restaurant. In his testimony to the House committee, Price said that he met Dmitriev at ""at the bar and had a drink."" The meeting, Prince said during an interview with Al Jazeera, ""lasted one beer, which doesn't take me very long."" According to the Mueller report, what Prince failed to mention was that he first met Dmitriev in Nader's villa (with Nader in attendance). That meeting lasted 30 to 45 minutes. The two met briefly for a second time at a restaurant nearby. All of these contradictions raise the possibility that Prince could face legal jeopardy for perjury. Democrats have publicly suggested for more than a year that Prince lied to Congress, though Prince has always maintained that his testimony was truthful. A spokesperson for Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to comment on whether Prince lied during his House testimony when reached via email by CNN Thursday, saying, ""Erik has said all there is to say on this."""
"David Lama, pioneering Austrian climber, is among three caught in an avalanche in Canada - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/david-lama-climber-avalanche-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Climbing was in his DNA.
The 28-year-old Austrian climber David Lama is one of three professional mountain climbers caught in an avalanche in Canada's Banff National Park, according to park officials and The North Face, the company that sponsors the men. All three are presumed dead. Lama was 5 when famed climber and Himalayan veteran Peter Habeler first saw him climb. He immediately called Lama's parents to tell them their boy had ""an extraordinary feeling for rocks."" As a youth, Lama won the International Federation of Sport Climbing's European Youth Cup and the Youth World Championships, according to North Face . Read More Competing against adults, he was the youngest to win the International Federation of Sport Climbing World Cup in lead climbing and in bouldering, the company said. He climbed into a place among legends Lama was born in 1990, the son of a Nepali mountain guide and an Austrian nurse. Hiking courses and alpine clubs didn't interest him, his website says : ""He looked for the vertical from the beginning."" After reaching the summit of the competitive climbing world in 2011, Lama pivoted to free climbing. In 2013, he appeared in the documentary film "" Cerro Torre: A Snowball's Chance in Hell ,"" which depicted his bid with climbing partner Peter Ortner the previous year to free-climb the southeast face of Cerro Torre, on the border between Argentina and Chile. Some consider the route to be the toughest on earth. Austrian sport climber David Lama, climbs a Kursaal palace wall after the presentation of his documentary film ""Cerro Torre"" in Spain. In a 2017 interview , Habeler, an elder statesman of the climbing world, recognized Lama's remarkable career. He called Lama ""one of the high flyers of the current age"" of climbing. This week, Lama was with fellow climbers Jess Roskelley and Hansjörg Auer, attempting to scale the treacherous east face of Howse Peak in Alberta. They were reported missing Wednesday after apparently being caught in an avalanche, officials said."
9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ellie Kaufman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/737-max-initial-certification-review/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Government officials from civil aviation authorities in nine countries, as well as members of the three US federal agencies, will investigate how the 737 Max airplane was initially certified, according to a release from the Federal Aviation Administration.
The group, called the Joint Authorities Technical Review, will begin work on April 29, and will review the initial certification of ""the aircraft's automated flight control system,"" the release states. The review is expected to take 90 days, according to the release. The three American agencies involved in the investigation will be the FAA, National Transportation Safety Board and NASA. The 737 Max was grounded in March after one of the planes flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed, killing everyone on board. It was the second accident involving the jet model in less than six months, after another flown by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed last October. The crashes killed 346 people in total. The group's review of the initial certification is separate from the ongoing certification process that Boeing, the company that makes the 737 Max planes, is undergoing with the FAA to re-certify the planes, according to an FAA spokesman. Boeing has come under intense scrutiny since the Ethiopian airline crash in March. The company at first defended the planes and insisted they were safe to fly, but after intense public pressure, they grounded the planes and admitted that a software fix was needed. Read More On Wednesday, Boeing said they had made a ""significant step"" towards FAA certification of the new updated software for the 737 Max. They announced they had completed an engineering test flight with the updated software, which is the key technical flight prior to the certification flight with the FAA. Earlier this week, American Airlines, the world's largest airline that owns and operates 737 Max planes, announced they would extend flight cancellations into mid-August because of the Boeing 737 Max grounding. ""Based upon our ongoing work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing, we are highly confident that the Max will be recertified prior to this time,"" American Chairman and CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said Sunday in a message to airline staff. ""But by extending our cancellations through the summer, we can plan more reliably for the peak travel season."" Approximately 115 flights a day will be canceled through August 19, representing about 1.5% of the airline's total daily flights, they said."
DNA from old razor helped solve two cases of rape and murder from 40 years ago - CNN,www.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/cold-case-dna-razor/index.html,"(CNN) Police have cracked a cold case with DNA found on the razor of the man they say raped and killed two women more than four decades ago in California.
DNA from a razor used by Arthur Rudy Martinez matches that left by the attacker at both crime scenes in the late 1970s, the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office said. Martinez died of cancer in June 2014 at a prison in Spokane Washington, where he was serving life for robberies and two other unrelated rapes. The two victims did not know each other The cases of Jane Morton Antunez and Patricia Dwyer date to 1977 and 1978, respectively. Read More In November 1977, Antunez was found dead in the backseat of her car in Atascadero, California. The 30-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted and her throat slit. She was on her way to her best friend's house, but never made it, the Sheriff's Office said. Months later, in January 1978, Patricia Dwyer was found stabbed to death and sexually assaulted in her home. Like Antunez, the 28-year-old also lived in Atascadero. While the two victims had mutual friends, they did not know each other, authorities said. ""Both victims' arms were bound behind their backs by different bindings that were found at each scene,"" the Sheriff's Office said. DNA link came from another arrested relative Biological evidence was recovered from the scene in the 1970s, but DNA technology was not used in criminal cases at the time, authorities said. For years, both cases remained unresolved. Then this year, a lead from the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search team helped crack the case. It obtained a familial DNA comparison from a relative of the suspect whose DNA was in the system as a result of a prior arrest, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said. ""Essentially identifies the suspect in this case. ... It really is in simple terms ... it strongly resembles existing DNA profiles in relatives who have many of the same markers in common,"" he said. When investigators made the connection, authorities reached out to the suspect's girlfriend, who still had items belonging to him. An item from her was tested and the DNA matched that of Martinez, he said. ""This lead was generated by getting a DNA profile comparison and other evidence. The DNA profile was a close match to an inmate serving time for unrelated charges,"" the Sheriff's Office said. CNN affiliate KSFN reported that DNA collected at the scenes was compared to that taken from an old razor belonging to Martinez. Police linked him to the murders. ""Most likely this case would never have been solved if the initial investigators did not collect the valuable biological DNA evidence that was used to compare to Martinez's DNA,"" the Sheriff's Office said. The suspect was in prison for assault Martinez was in Atascadero until 1978 — shortly after Dwyer's murder, authorities said. He moved to Spokane and later that year was sentenced to life in prison after committing numerous robberies and two other additional rapes, authorities said. In 1994, he escaped from prison and was on the run until he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014, the statement said. He then turned himself in so he could receive treatment and died in prison two months later. With Martinez dead, many questions remain, including whether he knew these victims prior to their murder. ""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and are hopeful the resolution to these cases brings them some closure,"" said Sheriff Parkinson. ""With the advancements in DNA technology and having an investigative focus solely on these types of cases, this case proves the value of having this important position."" "
Tesla to shakeup its board of directors,edition.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/investing/tesla-board-steve-jurvetson/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Tesla revealed Friday that four directors will leave the company — shrinking the size of its board to seven eventually.
The electric-car maker said that it wants to ""streamline"" corporate oversight because its board has grown by four members over the past five years. That has led to ""the duplication of certain areas of experience or expertise"" among its directors, the company said in a filing. Now Tesla is shaking things up to allow the board to ""operate more nimbly and efficiently."" Two directors have agreed not to stand for reelection at Tesla's annual meeting this year, and two more will leave in 2020 or 2021. The rules on CEO tweets weren't made for Elon Musk ""Such agreements did not result from any disagreement between Tesla and any of such directors,"" the company said. Cautious Tesla investors have also been pleading for with the company to tighten oversight of CEO Elon Musk. The disclosure comes just four months after Tesla added two new board members as part of a settlement deal that Musk and Tesla reached with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency wanted Tesla to put stricter checks on Musk's power after accusing him of misleading investors with his tweets about taking Tesla private. But their dispute is far from over : The SEC has since accused Musk of flouting other settlement terms and is looking to hold him in contempt. Read More Tesla's Friday filings say the outgoing board members include Linda Johnson Rice, the chairman and CEO of Johnson Publishing, who joined the board in 2017. The others — Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson — have been with the company over nine years. Jurvetson is considered a close ally to Musk. The venture capitalist was one of Tesla's earliest investors, and he's a director at Musk's rocket company, SpaceX. Jurvetson, who is scheduled to depart in 2020, returned to his role at Tesla this month after taking a year-long leave of absence that he began amid reports of inappropriate workplace behavior and harassment. Jurvetson has denied the allegations. A new filing states that the Tesla board is confident that with three remaining independent members, it is ""poised to lead Tesla with fresh perspectives balanced by deep historical knowledge of our company, while maintaining a wealth of diverse experience and expertise."" 'Put your reasonableness pants on': Judge gives Musk and SEC two weeks to settle dispute over tweets Critics have said that some of Tesla's ""independent board members"" aren't so independent. Oracle's Larry Ellison, for example, reportedly had close ties to Musk before joining the board. He was one of the members that Tesla brought on to comply with the SEC settlement. Other independent directors include 21st Century Fox's James Murdoch and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, head of global human resources at Walgreens. Wilson-Thompson was the other independent director elected after the SEC settlement. Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, also has a seat on the board. If shareholders approve a plan to restructure the remaining board seats, director terms will be reduced to two years instead of three."
5-year-old boy thrown off Mall of America balcony showing 'real signs of recovery',edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/mall-of-america-child-recovery/index.html,"(CNN) The 5-year-old boy who was thrown off a third-floor balcony at the Mall of America in Minnesota is showing ""real signs of recovery,"" according to a post on behalf of the family.
""Our miracle child Landen is showing real signs or recovery. New test results have been positive, though he remains in intensive care with a long road ahead. Our faith in God, and our Savior Jesus, is strong and we are gaining more reason for optimism day by day. We continue our request for privacy as we focus on Landen and thank you for respecting our wishes,"" part of the post on a GoFundMe page says. The post says the boy has a long recovery ahead, with many surgeries. Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda Emmanuel Aranda, 24, of Minneapolis, is accused of throwing the young child off the mall balcony and is charged with attempted murder. According to a criminal complaint, the boy and his mother were outside the Rain Forest Café when Aranda came up close to them. The mother had never seen Aranda before, and she asked if she and her son should move. Read More Instead, Aranda picked up the boy and threw him over the railing, the complaint states. Aranda told police he had come to the mall a day earlier intending to kill an adult, but that did not ""work out,"" according to the complaint. So he returned Friday and apparently chose the boy instead. Aranda told police he knew what he was planning to do was wrong. He explained he had visited the mall for years, trying to speak to women there, but they rejected him. Aranda said that made him lash out."
Maria Butina asks to be released from jail and sent back to Russia in new filing - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/butina-sentencing-filing/index.html,"(CNN) Prosecutors have gone beyond previous expectations to ask for 18 months of jail time for Maria Butina in a case where they've alleged scandalous actions -- and had to walk back some of them -- yet still accuse the Russian woman of seeking to hurt the US in her work as a foreign agent.
""Activities at issue in this case are part of Russia's broader scheme to acquire information and establish relationships and communication channels that can be exploited to the Russian Federation's benefit,"" prosecutors wrote in their pre-sentencing memo Friday. Prosecutors wrote that Butina was not a traditional spy or ""trained intelligence officer,"" but sought to help Russia at the expense of US national security. They call her an ""access agent"" -- a person used by her foreign government to attempt to set up a backchannel through Republican organizations for communication and diplomacy. ""Had she successfully done so, the risks to the United States would have included harm to this country's political processes, internal government dealings, and US foreign policy interests,"" the prosecutors wrote. Still, they note that she ""did not get along well"" with former Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Read More In her sentencing memo also out Friday, Butina asked a federal judge to release her from prison and send her home to Russia after she spent nine months in jail since her arrest for acting as a foreign agent of the Russian government. Her defense attorneys have cast her in the court filing Friday night as an earnest graduate student in America, simply keeping in touch with powerful backers in her homeland. They add that she has cooperated with investigators. CNN previously reported that she was speaking to prosecutors about her boyfriend and, briefly, was questioned by the special counsel's investigation. She has also spoken to the Senate Intelligence Committee for a voluntary interview that lasted eight hours, her lawyers wrote Friday, and gave them ""thousands of pages of documents,"" including many related to a former Russian politician Alexander Torshin. Butina is set to be sentenced next Friday. The prosecutors have not yet made a recommendation to the judge for her sentencing. Her attorneys have explicitly asked that she be sentenced to time served in jail, following her plea in December. ""Maria Butina is a devoted daughter, genuine idealist, and compassionate civil activist,"" her defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo Friday night. ""Nearly a year ago, she graduated with a master's degree from American University with straight A's and bright career prospects. Now, her world has collapsed because of a decision to help and discuss her amateur diplomacy efforts with a Russian official."" Butina, a 30-year-old longtime gun rights activist, admitted to attempting to curry favor with conservative political groups on behalf of Russia, particularly with the support of Torshin, a former Russian parliament member and former Russian Central Bank leader. In the court filing Friday night, her attorneys described her attending a ""presidential campaign announcement"" and relaying information about it back to Torshin, an event that was ""exciting."" The relationship she had with Torshin ""triggered"" her need to notify the Justice Department of her actions working for Russians, her lawyers wrote. ""She did not infiltrate the NRA. She joined it, as millions have, by filling out an online form and paying a fee. She did not seduce the figures within it or funnel Russian money to it. Nor did anyone else instruct her to do so,"" her defense lawyers wrote. Paul Erickson, a political operative who has been indicted for money laundering in South Dakota, is mentioned in her report as her boyfriend and someone who helped her draft a plan for Russian-American diplomacy in the United States. She has been cooperating with investigators in the investigation against Erickson. George O'Neill Jr., a Rockefeller heir who CNN has previously identified as US Person 2 in Butina's case, submitted a letter in support of Butina. In it, he acknowledged that he supported her in the pursuit of her master's degree at American University, where she was a graduate student. In his letter, O'Neill also wrote, ""Over the past eight months, Maria has suffered greatly and seen many of her dreams crushed by political circumstances beyond her control. I hope, in sentencing her, the court would look at this lovely and able young woman and set her free without further punishment."" O'Neill has not faced charges. Butina's lawyers did not submit a letter from Erickson. A number of letters from Butina's supporters, including her family members, were submitted in Russian and translated into English."
"Liquor heiress pleads guilty to crimes related to New York sex cult, pyramid scheme case - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/new-york-sex-cult-guilty-pleas/index.html,"(CNN) Two women who were part of an alleged pyramid scheme that involved sex trafficking and racketeering each pleaded guilty to related charges Friday in a New York federal court.
Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor people who were not in the United States legally for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. Kathy Russell pleaded guilty to one charge of visa fraud. Keith Raniere, founder of Nxivm Bronfman and Russell were indicted in March on racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges as part of the cult-like organization known as Nxivm, founded by Keith Raniere, who also was indicted and is now in federal custody. He faces sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Bronfman was a member of the Nxivm executive board, according to a US Justice Department news release , and faces between 21 and 27 months in prison. Russell is Nxivm's former bookkeeper and faces between six and 12 months in prison. Read More Bronfman, who will be sentenced July 25, tearfully read a statement in court during her plea hearing. 'Smallville' actress pleads guilty to charges relating to sex trafficking case ""Your honor, I was afforded a great gift by my grandfather and father. With the gift comes immense privilege, and more importantly, tremendous responsibility,"" Bronfman said. ""It does not come with an ability to break the law, it comes with a greater responsibility to uphold it. I failed to uphold the following laws set forth by this country, and for that I am truly remorseful."" Russell, who will be sentenced July 31, said in court that she knowingly provided visa documents with false information in order to bring a woman into the US for work. ""I know what I did was wrong and I am very sorry for the trouble that I've caused,"" Russell said, tearfully. Five Nxivm members were indicted and charged last year for crimes that included identity theft, extortion, forced labor, sex trafficking, money laundering, wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Bronfman, Russell and actress Allison Mack were among the five indicted and charged last year. Nxivm touted itself as a professional organization Prosecutors allege Raniere created the organization Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ium), which touted itself as a professional business providing coaching and educational services to ""corporations and people of all walks of life."" The organization, prosecutors say, actually operated like a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme, and encouraged its members to continue taking pricey classes and recruiting other members in order to rise in the ranks of the organization. The organization also acted as an umbrella for other groups like ""The Source,"" described as a private arts academy, and the secret society DOS, which was founded in 2015 and is the subgroup where sex trafficking activities allegedly took place. Under the sub-group DOS, prosecutors allege. women were designated as ""slaves"" until successfully recruiting others, at which time they became ""masters."" All so-called slaves were at the service of their own masters as well as those above them in the pyramid. The indictment claims many so-called slaves were branded on their pelvic areas with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere's initials. Documents describe ""branding ceremonies,"" in which women were held down by others while naked and filmed as they were branded with a cauterizing pen. Raniere was the only male in DOS and the leader, according to court filings. JUST WATCHED 'Smallville' actress pleads guilty to charges in sex trafficking case Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Easter amid the ashes: How Christians in Louisiana and Notre Dame Cathedral are celebrating this Sunday - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Daniel Burke,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/world/easter-ashes/index.html,"(CNN) As Pastor Harry Richard watched the flames consume Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral on Tuesday, his soul swirled with emotions.
Just two weeks earlier, on April 2, Richard's own church, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, was set ablaze. It was one of three predominantly black churches in the area that were intentionally burned down, according to police. ""My heart bled for them as much as it did for my own congregation,"" said Richard of the Parisians devastated by the damage to their 850-year-old cathedral . But the Baptist pastor said he also sensed the pull of something deeper, perhaps even divine, in the aftermath of the fires. ""I think that God is using these moments to bring us closer together as a world,"" Richard said. ""This is God's hand on our lives to make us realize that we are all connected in some form or fashion."" Read More In the days after the Notre Dame fire, as money poured in to save the iconic cathedral, an online campaign encouraged people to help rebuild the three Louisiana churches as well. By Friday , more than $2 million had been raised. While Christians connected to the charred churches appreciate the outpouring, many say they lost more than hallowed ground and irreplaceable artifacts in the smoke and ashes. They lost a part of themselves. ""She is the soul of France,"" Archbishop Michel Aupetit of Paris, whose home church is Notre Dame Cathedral, told Le Figaro this week. And so this Sunday will, in some sense, be remembered as an Easter amid the ashes, as Christians from Louisiana to the Ile de la Cite, the island where Notre Dame Cathedral sits surrounded by the Seine River, take refuge in the hope of resurrection. ""What does the Lord want to tell us through this ordeal?"" asked Aupetit. ""Here we move from the scandal of death to the mystery of resurrection. Our hope will never disappoint us because it is based not on buildings of stone, which we will rebuild, but on the Risen One who remains forever."" Fallen debris from the burned roof structure sits near the altar inside Notre Dame Cathedral. French connections Like many in St. Landry Parish, Pastor Richard, whose name is pronounced ""ree-SHARD,"" has French ancestry. The parish is named after St. Landry, a seventh-century Parisian bishop memorialized by St. Landry Chapel inside the Notre Dame Cathedral. Yet another connection: The first Louisiana church to burn, St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, shares a patron saint with Notre Dame: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Greater Union was built around 100 years ago, the pastor said, though it's difficult to discern the exact date because record-keeping was erratic in those days. His grandfather, who helped construct the brick and wood church by hand, signed his name with an X, Richard said. Richard's grandfather is one of several family members buried on a plot of land outside Greater Union that includes his mother and father, sister and brother, grandmother and grandfather. Sometimes he takes a walk among their tombstones and talks to them. Many of the congregation's members also have ancestors buried in the cemetery , the pastor said. ""Most of the members of our church are pretty much related, by marriage if not by blood. That cemetery is a sacred place for us."" For that reason, since the fire, people who have left Opelousas and Greater Union have urged the pastor to rebuild his church on the same hallowed ground. ""As far as I am concerned, that address will always belong to Greater Union Baptist Church. I don't want to build a cathedral. We don't have room for that. But I want that land to contain a house of God forever."" Greater Union Baptist Church Pastor Harry Richard stands for a portrait in front of the ruins of his church building in Opelousas, Louisiana. The 66-year-old, who has been pastor of Greater Union for 16 years, said one of his deacons saved a Bible from the charred ruins of the congregation. Richard hopes it's his, filled with notes about family history and scriptural thoughts, but he's been too busy to check. A pastor's first responsibility, he said, is to tend to his flock. And his is grieving. Asked about the most valuable thing lost in the fire that destroyed his church, Richard said it wasn't anything tangible. It was trust. ""We are a black Baptist church, and we've fellowshipped with some white community members who have come to our church,"" the pastor said. ""But when the fires started it created an atmosphere of mistrust. The little trust we had was burned up in that fire."" In Louisiana, as in other Southern states, memories of racial violence and racist policies stay close to the surface, Richard said. It doesn't take long to recall how the Ku Klux Klan terrorized African-Americans by setting fire to their sacred spaces. ""Our culture has been filled with mistrust and misunderstandings,"" the pastor said. Police say the fires at the three black churches in St. Landry Parish were started by the white son of a sheriff's deputy who was motivated by black metal music, not racism per se. The accused 21-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges in the case. But the fact remains: All three churches were predominantly African-American. As he prepared for Sunday Easter services, which will be held in a cozy Masonic lodge in Opelousas, Richard said the congregation has already forgiven the ""firestarter."" Trust will be harder to rebuild, but he is hopeful. Richard said he's been thinking a lot about John's Gospel, especially the 20th chapter when Mary Magdalene finds Jesus' empty tomb. ""After witnessing Christ's crucifixion, it was a traumatic experience for her to go there. And that kind of speaks to us as a congregation, when we realized our church was on fire. But, as we know, that is not the end of the story."" 'Notre Dame is still standing!' Since Notre Dame's fire, hundreds of people, both Christian and not, have sent ""testimonials"" about their spiritual and emotional ties to the cathedral. They came in from New Jersey and Seattle, Poland and Japan, Italy, Germany, and, of course, from France. People recalled the sacred moments of their lives staged in the ancient cathedral: having hasty marriages blessed by Notre Dame priests, hearing the voices of an angelic choir rise through the vaulted arches, watching their children be baptized. The cause of the fire is still not known, but investigators suspect that it was an unintentional result of repairs at the Gothic masterpiece. Many of its most prized possessions, including the stained-glass rose windows and a crown of thorns believed to have been worn by Jesus, were somehow spared. Nevertheless, wrote Mother Marie Christine in her testimonial posted on the cathedral's website, ""a whole part of our heritage, our history, has gone up in smoke."" Flames and smoke rise from Notre Dame Cathedral as it burns in Paris. ""And yet, in a few days, another fire will shine in the night opening the solemnity of the solemnities,"" Christine wrote, in a sentiment shared by many of the testimonies, ""that of the Resurrection of Christ."" There seemed to be an unspoken assumption that Notre Dame would outlast us, wrote a man named Clemence, just as it had outlasted the Huguenots, French revolutionaries and Nazis who had tried to destroy it. Parisian priests , too, wrote testimonials about ""Our Lady,"" as the cathedral was affectionately known among the French. The Rev. Denis Metzinger, parish priest of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont and a canon of Notre Dame, said that even before the fire, he had been contemplating Jesus' words upon the cross, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" ""I admit that this question has been mounting in me for weeks before the accumulation of scandals of all kinds that have emerged in my family the church in the 21st century,"" Metzinger wrote, in an apparent reference to the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal. Jesus' question again echoed through the priest's mind as he watched Notre Dame burn on Tuesday through tears. Metzinger said he was a tour guide at the cathedral, was ordained a priest at Notre Dame and participated for many years in its Masses and other sacred ceremonies. Like many others, Metzinger said, he took heart in the fact that, when the smoke cleared, Notre Dame's main altar and the gilded cross above it remained. ""Notre Dame de Paris as the church in our time is disfigured."" he said. ""Notre Dame de Paris as the church in our time is standing!"" Serenading 'Our Lady' On the day after the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, John Cavadini, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said a special prayer for the cathedral and put on his fleur-de-lis tie. As its name suggests, the university has French roots. It was founded by a French missionary order, the Congregation of Holy Cross. Tuesday morning, Cavadini talked to one of his classes about why the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral seemed to so deeply affect people around the world, Christians and atheists alike. Somehow, the flames seem to have fanned a latent spiritual impulse among even the most secular-minded, he said. ""I don't think people would have had that reaction if Notre Dame were not a church,"" he said. ""If it were the Louvre Museum or even the Vatican Museum, people would have been upset, but not like this."" Cavadini said he saw faculty members with tears in their eyes after watching the inferno tear down the cathedral's spire. ""That fire seems to have unleashed a kind of kinetic energy,"" the professor continued. An overflow crowd celebrates Mass in the public square in front of the Church of Saint-Sulpice during Holy Week in Paris. The Mass was originally scheduled to be held in the Cathedral of Notre Dame. ""The cathedral served as an embodiment of our spiritual ideals, and people took it for granted that it would always be there. When it collapsed, it was as if something inside of us collapsed as well."" In the days after the Notre Dame fire, many commentators referred to the cathedral, and others like it that had stood for centuries, as ""monuments to resilience"" or ""testaments of faith."" That's true to an extent. But watching the crowd of Parisians serenade their burning cathedral Tuesday night with ""Ave Maria,"" a hymn about St. Mary, the idea arose that any church, even a cathedral, is only a monument to faith. They are expressions of a human longing for the sacred and the spiritual, but they are not the longing itself -- and that impulse, if history is any judge, can be much more difficult to destroy. Or, as Pastor Richard said more succinctly, ""Our faith isn't in any building. Our faith is in us."""
Xi Jinping is determined to end all poverty in China by 2020. Can he do it? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ben Westcott,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/poverty-alleviation-2020-xi-jinping-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) In the small village of Gaibao, locals are filming short videos of their unspoiled and idyllic countryside on the Kwai streaming app.
One clip shows four young women laughing as they grab fat fish out of the rice fields with their hands. In another they don traditional outfits and stand next to an ox plowing a paddy field. ""Do you all have a farm such as this?"" the caption asks. Their short videos are a small part of a massive nationwide attempt to lift all of China's 1.4 billion people out of poverty by 2020 -- a goal which President Xi Jinping set in a speech in 2015 . The Chinese government defines poverty as earning less than $416 (2,800 yuan) a year or around $1.10 a day -- a lower benchmark than the World Bank poverty line of $1.90 a day, or just under $700 a year. Beijing has dispatched about 775,000 party officials to drive the anti-poverty campaign. Many are going door-to-door to work out what the government can do to help. Those who fail in their missions to alleviate poverty could face career oblivion , according to state media. Read More Stills from the Gaibao village's Kuaishou page, where they raise money through videos of their everyday lives. The idea to stream videos of the village came from Gaibao's chief poverty alleviation official, Wu Yusheng, and has helped the town, in the province of Guizhou, sell its organic produce online. Residents also receive virtual gifts from fans via the app, which they can exchange for cash. Wu, who arrived in the village in 2018, said he had already achieved his goal -- but it is unclear whether Xi will do the same. At worst, some experts fear the ruling Communist Party might just announce poverty has been eradicated, regardless of the reality, to avoid embarrassing Xi. ""Local leaders are taking it extremely seriously, almost in a panicky way. Part of the problem is that they don't know really what to do, so they're kind of grasping at different solutions,"" said John Donaldson, a poverty expert and associate professor at Singapore Management University. ""They're throwing everything at it."" Chinese President Xi Jinping visits a villager's home to learn about the progress of poverty alleviation in Huaxi village on April 15. The campaign against poverty The dream of eradicating widespread poverty in China didn't begin with Xi. It dates back to the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949. ""The reason for the existence of the Chinese Communist Party in the beginning is because of injustice and poverty among farmers,"" Donaldson said. Chairman Mao Zedong's economic experiments, however, actually set the country back, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London. ""In 1949, Shanghai was still a richer city than Hong Kong. In 1949, any coastal province was richer and more developed than Taiwan. In 1979, Hong Kong and Taiwan were way, way ahead,"" Tsang said. Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, beginning in 1958, was ostensibly an attempt to transform a mainly agrarian society through industrialization and collectivization. Instead, it helped create a famine that cost tens of millions of lives and aggravated poverty across the country. Things began to change after Mao's death. In 1978, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing China's economy and one of his first reforms was to let struggling farmers sell excess produce to make a profit . China's efforts to combat poverty since then have been staggering. In 1990, there were more than 750 million people living in poverty across the nation, according to the World Bank -- over 60% of the population. Almost 30 years later in 2019, Beijing says that number has dropped to just 16.6 million. One of the Communist Party's main claims to power in recent years has been that it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. Perhaps for that reason, Xi still isn't satisfied. Despite the growing wealth of China's major cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, parts of rural China live without electricity, fresh water and adequate food or clothing. In his 2015 speech, Xi said he was inspired to make poverty a priority by his experience working in the countryside in the 1960s when his father, a prominent party official, fell from favor during Mao's Cultural Revolution. ""I toiled with the villagers at the time, with the aim to make life a bit better, but it was harder than reaching the sky in that year,"" he said. Farmers work in the cooperative collective farm in 1950 near Beijing, China. Roads, internet and jobs The government's plan is broadly divided into two strategies -- big national policies and small local interventions. At a national level, the policies revolve around infrastructure spending. Xi's administration is pouring billions of dollars into the problem, $19 billion in 2019 alone , which has been spent on a variety of projects and initiatives across the country. More than 200,000 kilometers (124,274 miles) of roads were built or renovated in 2018 and 94% of poor villages were connected to the internet, according to government figures. Dozens of state-owned enterprises have joined the campaign and poured more than $4 billion (30 billion yuan) into poverty relief programs as of early 2019, according to state media. Some of these big-ticket projects have sparked controversy. A number of provincial governments have been accused of trying to simply move millions of poor people to newly built urban accommodation to raise them out of poverty. Some older rural citizens have refused to go, while others have moved but then returned to their old homes. Maggie Lau, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said such schemes aren't always pragmatic. ""If they move to a higher-cost area, how can they afford those new living costs?"" she asks.

— CGTN (@CGTNOfficial) April 17, 2019 But to a large degree, the anti-poverty campaign is small-scale and has been left in the hands of local officials. ""Every local official on a township level (one above a village) goes down to every poor household and tries to find out what's going on and why people are poor and how to apply resources to that,"" Donaldson said, describing his observations in Chinese villages. The solutions proposed vary wildly but often focus on encouraging villagers to lift themselves out of poverty by developing local industries, engaging in e-commerce and boosting rural tourism. While Donaldson said the effort expended was ""amazing,"" problems emerged with government officials spending too much time just knocking on doors talking about poverty rather than tackling local problems. ""The danger is that it will be a confused mess,"" he said. There has also been a lack of patience with poor villagers who fail to get with the program. In a report in February, Wu Weihua, a vice chairman of the national legislature, complained that some people just don't want to ""get rich."" ""Some poor people even have the mindset of, 'You don't help, I don't move',"" the report said. JUST WATCHED China's senior citizens risk being left behind Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
China's senior citizens risk being left behind 02:44 Corruption and pollution Failure is not tolerated -- and the government is watching where its money is being spent. In March 2018, a provincial governor was kicked out of the Communist Party , partly for his failure to address poverty in his jurisdiction. In October that year, inspections were carried out in provinces across central and western China to check that officials were following orders on poverty alleviation. The flood of government and company funds allocated to deal with the issue has also revived the ever-present threat of corruption. More than 170,000 individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds, according to the party's anti-graft agency Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. There have also been signs that the government's laser-like focus on poverty is impeding another of its main goals -- environmental conservation. A 2015 research paper found evidence that work by the government to eradicate poverty by boosting the economy was lowering air and water quality in affected regions . Heavily polluting industries were encouraged to set up shop, bringing jobs and prosperity at the expense of the environment. Or natural resources were exploited for financial gain. ""Economic growth, poverty alleviation and ecological degradation do not appear to have de-coupled as required for long-term sustainable use of the environment, especially with regards to food security and access to clean water,"" the joint British and Chinese study said. Some critics also note that the government has focused mainly on poverty in the countryside rather than in cities, ignoring less severe but still-pressing urban hardship. 'Absolutely confident' Wu, the Guizhou village poverty alleviation chief, said he was ""absolutely confident"" the 2020 goal could be met. ""The government is doing everything to achieve that. And on the micro level, the targeting of poverty population is really precise. It's not a problem if the entire society is making an effort,"" he said. China's Xi Jinping begins his most important year at his weakest point But experts and international observers say China's poverty goals achieve the bare minimum -- more work will be needed in the cities and the countryside to ensure everyone enjoys a high quality of life. Qin Gao, director of Columbia University's China Center for Social Policy, said in a 2018 report that broader government support for healthcare and employment would be more useful than initiatives on an individual basis or e-commerce measures. ""Only a combination of effective development measures and social policies and services can help China eradicate persisting rural poverty in the long run,"" she said. But Donaldson said that even if the target is met in 2020, he didn't believe the government would just abandon poverty as an issue. ""Any kind of responsible government would be focused on how you help improve the living standards of people who may not be poor but are still struggling,"" he said. ""I expect that to be on the agenda of the party forever."""
Bitcoin art: Singapore startup Maecenas could help you own a Warhol - CNN,www.cnn.com,Zahra Jamshed,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/tech/bitcoin-art-maecenas-singapore/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) British artist David Hockney smashed records last year when his ""Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)"" sold at auction in New York for $90 million.
Not a single dollar from that sale went to the artist himself. Hockney sold the original artwork in 1972 for just $18,000, leaving subsequent owners to reap the enormous rewards of its increase in value. One Singapore-based company hopes to change sales like this forever by using blockchain technology to allow artists to retain an interest in their work even as other investors buy into it.

It allows investors to use cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to buy a share of an artwork. The value of the shares — or tokens — rise and fall in a similar way to stocks. Read More According to Maecenas CEO Marcelo Garcia-Casil, this allows original owners to maintain partial ownership of a work as its value grows, and opens up the market to younger investors. ""What we're doing with the fractionalization or tokenization of art is creating a stock market experience when it comes to investing in art,"" he said. ""We're not going with this platform to art experts — we're bringing it to people who may be investing in art for the first time."" Art without a home Maecenas successfully tokenized and sold a million-dollar Andy Warhol painting in 2018, and it expects to do the same with a Picasso later this year. There's an obvious drawback to selling art in this way. With multiple owners and no single home for the works, they're often stored in restricted areas that are not accessible to the public. But some investors say the art market is perfectly suited to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The potential use of bitcoin in previously unexplored industries, like the art market, is unprecedented, said Kenrick Drijkoningen, the founding partner of Lunex . His venture capital fund invests exclusively in blockchain and cryptocurrency startups. ""You have ownership, it's censorship resistant, it's portable and the monetary supply [is finite],"" Drijkoningen explained. ""There will only ever be 20 million of them [bitcoin]."" Singapore's crypto-revolution Maecenas is part of a much bigger revolution underway in financial technology, and Singapore is playing a leading role, according to Lunex principal Tushar Agarwal. ""Singapore does an amazing job of attracting that talent, of making sure that they don't inhibit innovation for the sake of regulating,"" he said. While the city state is regarded by some as one of the most crypto-friendly places on earth, others are concerned about the lack of regulation. In January, Singapore's Monetary Authority issued a public warning about online scams involving cryptocurrency. Agarwal says the industry will continue to grow because traditional finance is unable to keep up with the speed of globalized markets. ""The amount of time that it takes for [banks] to settle transactions just hasn't kept up with the pace that is required,"" he said. ""Yes, it's highly highly volatile — but that's the risk that you take with any new industry... it's like the Wild West."" "

The New England Society for Psychic Research, which Warren and her husband Ed founded in Connecticut in 1952, announced the news on its Facebook page: ""The NESPR team regretfully announces the passing of our loving teacher, mentor, friend, mother, Lorraine."" According to ""The Demonologist,"" a book that details the Warrens' careers, the couple investigated more 3,000 paranormal and supernatural disturbances. The husband and wife team published numerous books about their exploits and inspired a string of Hollywood hits, including ""The Amityville Horror,"" ""The Conjuring,"" and the ""Annabelle"" movie franchise.

""The Amityville Horror,"" starring Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, released in 2005, was a remake of the 1979 film of the same name. The Warrens visited the haunted manor in Amityville, New York, in March 1976 with a news crew and a photographer who set up an automatic camera taking infrared photographs. That camera captured an image allegedly of a demonic boy . Movie buffs might remember the Warrens from the 2013 film ""The Conjuring,"" in which they figure prominently. It depicts disturbing events at a farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. The owners of the house called Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate.

""The US soldiers were appropriately in US territory"" during the encounter, the statement added. During the incident, the Mexican soldiers pointed their weapons at the US troops, removing a soldier's sidearm and returning it to the unmarked US vehicle, the officials said. The Mexican troops were armed with what appeared to be assault rifles, according to one official. Read More Officials said that the US soldiers allowed the weapon to be taken ""in an attempt to de-escalate a potential volatile situation."" ""Throughout the incident, the US soldiers followed all established procedures and protocols,"" Northern Command said. The encounter took place south of the border fence in the area but north of the Rio Grande, the officials said. However, the officials said the river in that area consists of brush-filled and dried-out riverbed, making it ""very easy"" for people to be confused as to what side of the border they are on. One of the American soldiers spoke some Spanish and was able to explain the situation to the Mexican forces. The two sides talked the incident over and promised to de-conflict in the future, the officials said. ""An inquiry by (Customs and Border Patrol) and (the Department of Defense) revealed that the Mexican military members believed that the US Army soldiers were south of the border,"" Northern Command said while adding that the US troops were north of the border. ""Though they were south of the border fence, US soldiers remained in US territory, north of the actual border,"" the statement said, adding that ""after a brief discussion between the soldiers from the two nations, the Mexican military members departed the area."" President Donald Trump had previously ordered the active duty military to support border security and the US has some 3,000 active duty troops supporting the Department of Homeland Security on the southern border with Mexico in addition to some 2,000 National Guard troops. The Pentagon expects additional troops to be sent to the border to support additional pending requests for assistance from DHS. On Friday, acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that he did not ""have a finite number"" in terms of how many additional troops would be sent but said the Pentagon was ""looking at anticipating"" what DHS needs prior to the receipt of a formal request for assistance.

Feds arrest man in connection with a February raid on the North Korean Embassy in Madrid - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,David Shortell,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/north-korea-embassy-madrid/index.html,"(CNN) Federal authorities arrested a man in California Thursday in connection with a brazen February raid on the North Korean Embassy in Madrid.
Christopher Ahn was taken into custody by US Marshals Thursday in Los Angeles, according to a spokesman for the agency. A law enforcement official said his arrest is connected to the violent raid of the diplomatic compound in Spain that took place just days before President Donald Trump's second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Ahn made an initial appearance Friday in Los Angeles federal court, and was remanded in to custody, according to a spokesman for the US attorney's office in Los Angeles. News of Ahn's arrest was first reported by The Washington Post . Shadowy North Korean dissident group says it raided embassy, contacted FBI Cheollima Civil Defense, a North Korean dissident group, has claimed responsibility for the February raid.

It is not clear what Ahn has been charged with and his case remains under seal. A posting on the Los Angeles federal court's website that officials said belonged to Ahn listed it only as an extradition case, and Matthew Cordova, the US Marshals spokesman, said the arrest was made on a provisional warrant from Madrid. A public defender listed for Ahn did not respond to a request for comment. Ahn is due back in court for a detention hearing on Tuesday. Authorities this week also raided the apartment of the leader of Cheollima Civil Defense, a Mexican national and US resident named Adrian Hong, according to the Washington Post. An attorney for Hong said he was ""dismayed"" that the Justice Department had ""decided to execute warrants against US persons that derive from criminal complaints filed by the North Korean regime."" ""The last US citizen who fell into the custody of the Kim regime returned home maimed from torture and did not survive. We have received no assurances from the US government about the safety and security of the US nationals it is now targeting,"" said Lee Wolosky, Hong's attorney, in a statement. He was referring to Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in 2017 after over a year in North Korean detention. A spokesman for the Justice Department said, ""While we will not comment on this particular matter at this time, we would note that extradition treaties generally provide that an individual who has been extradited to another country to face criminal charges cannot thereafter be extradited to a third country without the consent of the original country."""
WannaCry 'hero' Marcus Hutchins pleads guilty to hacking charges - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kevin Collier,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/marcus-hutchins-pleads-guilty/index.html,"New York (CNN) Marcus Hutchins, the British hacker who stopped one of the most destructive cyberattacks in the world, has taken a plea deal, admitting guilt in the US to unrelated hacking charges.
Hutchins became a minor celebrity in May 2017, when he stopped the spread of WannaCry, a ransomware worm created by North Korea that had spread wildly out of control in 2017, hitting the UK's National Health Service especially hard. A security researcher who blogged about how to hunt malicious software, Hutchins noticed and activated a kill-switch in WannaCry's code. Three months later, as he prepared to fly home after visiting Las Vegas during the DEF CON hacker conference, Hutchins was arrested and charged with crimes relating to the creation and sale of malware programs UPAS Kit and Kronos, programs that help steal people's banking information, along with two other people. Since then, he's lived in Los Angeles, unable to leave the US. Until Friday, he denied the charges.

The lawsuits claim the Environmental Protection Agency was too slow to intervene in the crisis. US Judge Linda V. Parker ruled the federal government was not immune from legal action in the case. More than a dozen lawsuits , including class-action cases, were filed against Michigan and the City of Flint after the city's water was found to be contaminated with lead in 2014 and 2015. One lawsuit alleges the state hadn't treated the water with an anti-corrosive agent, in violation of federal law. ""The impact on the health of the nearly 100,000 residents of the City of Flint remains untold,"" Parker wrote in Thursday's opinion and order. ""It is anticipated, however, that the injury caused by the lead-contaminated public water supply system will affect the residents for years and likely generations to come.""

The dog, Raider , has been meeting with the siblings ever since their parents were arrested early last year and their lives were turned upside-down. One of the 13 children -- who ranged in age from 2 to 29 -- managed to escape their filthy home in Perris, California, and called police. Authorities said the siblings had been isolated from the outside world and were often denied showers, medical care and food. The Turpins are sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after their children testify about years of torture The Turpin children have been able to play with Raider numerous times as they navigated courthouses, prosecutors' offices and other legal settings in the past year. ""When we see him bring a smile to someone's face or even just touching him, we know that they are getting emotions out that maybe a human wouldn't be able to do,"" said Corona Police Sgt. Adam Roulston, one of Raider's handlers. The 3-year-old Labrador is a facility dog with the Corona Police Department. Unlike other police dogs, he is highly trained to provide companionship without being a disruption in a work environment. Read More He is the first dog from Canine Companions for Independence, an organization that trains service dogs, to join the Corona police. While on duty, Raider wears a blue vest as well as a police badge around his neck. Roulston said one of the Turpin children asked authorities to allow Raider to be with them Friday during their parents' sentencing hearing at the Riverside County Superior Court. They took turns petting him and he sat still by their side when two of them offered testimony about how they suffered at the hands of their parents. Raider has previously helped the Turpin siblings and other victims reduce their anxiety and comforted them. He played with them, let them pet him and showed them how he can draw from a deck of playing cards, Roulston said. Roulston and police dispatcher Erin Lennox have been Raider's handlers since 2017. They balanced their law enforcement duties with the Labrador's numerous commitments that include court appearances, hospital visits and supporting witnesses of a crime. ""Seeing the way that he does and seeing how he makes people feel better it's the best reward ever,"" Roulston said. ""Officers and public safety personnel want to help people and Raider is a tool to help us do that."" Raider is among a few police facility dogs in California and is part of the growing trend toward having service animals in courtrooms nationwide.

Fact check: Erik Prince's public claims vs. the Mueller report - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Holmes Lybrand,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/prince-mueller-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Erik Prince , the founder of the controversial private security firm Blackwater, makes a number of appearances in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Noted for his ties to the United Arab Emirates, Prince was a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump during the campaign and spent time around senior officials with the Trump transition team, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Prince is the brother of Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
Over the past two years, Prince has come under scrutiny for connections he may have been trying to make between the incoming Trump administration and Russian officials. Of particular interest is a meeting Prince had in January 2017 with a high-ranking Russian official. Prince has made several public statements regarding these activities and testified behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. (The transcript was later released to the public.) In all of Prince's comments, he has tried to downplay the importance of the meeting, characterizing it as a chance encounter. However, the Mueller report undercuts some of Prince's assertions, and shows the degree to which the meeting was planned and was focused (at least in part) on making Russian connections with the incoming administration. Read More Here's a look at some of Prince's claims before his interview with Mueller compared to those he made to Mueller's team. Prince: Meeting with Putin-connected Russian was an impromptu casual encounter Mueller report : The meeting was established prior to Prince's trip. In January of 2017, Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean. During an interview with CNN in August 2017, Prince claimed that he was ""there on business"" with Emirati officials and that he simply ""met a guy,"" referring to Dmitriev. In this telling, the meeting was so insignificant, Prince said he couldn't ""even remember his name."" But according to the Mueller report, before going to the Seychelles, Prince met with an emissary of the UAE named George Nader several times in New York and ""discussed Dmitriev,"" with Nader who ""inform(ed) Prince that the Russians were looking to build a link with the incoming Trump administration."" Nader sent Prince the Wikipedia entry on Dmitriev and told Dmitriev that he had met ""with some key people within ... the inner circle"" in reference to Prince, the report says. This appears to directly contradict how Prince characterized the meeting to CNN, when he said he'd just ""met a guy."" There is also a disparity in the way Prince described the meeting, and whether he was acting on behalf of himself or as a bridge to the Trump team. Prince: I was not representing Trump in any way in meeting with Dmitriev. Mueller report: Prince told Dmitriev he would relay information to Trump's campaign chief executive Steve Bannon. In his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Prince was asked if ""the point of that meeting (was) for you to represent the Trump campaign or Mr. Trump in any way?"" He replied ""No."" This contradicts how both Nader and Dmitriev viewed the meeting with Prince. According to the report, Nader told Prince to meet with Dmitriev ""in light of (Prince's) relationship with the (Trump) Transition Team"" in order to ""discuss issues of mutual concern."" The report also states that, ""Prince acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team."" Prince also told Dmitriev that he would ""inform Bannon about his meeting with Dmitriev,"" and would follow-up if there was interest from the Trump team. Bannon told the special counsel that ""Prince did not tell him in advance about his meeting with Dmitriev."" Clearly, the meeting was set up by Nader for Dmitriev to meet someone who had connections to the incoming Trump administration, and according to the report Prince knew this. Prince also appears to have mischaracterized key details of his meeting with Dmitriev, including failing to mention that there were two meetings Prince: ""So I met him in the bar and had a drink."" Mueller report: They met twice, first in Nader's villa and again at a restaurant. In his testimony to the House committee, Price said that he met Dmitriev at ""at the bar and had a drink."" The meeting, Prince said during an interview with Al Jazeera, ""lasted one beer, which doesn't take me very long."" According to the Mueller report, what Prince failed to mention was that he first met Dmitriev in Nader's villa (with Nader in attendance). That meeting lasted 30 to 45 minutes. The two met briefly for a second time at a restaurant nearby. All of these contradictions raise the possibility that Prince could face legal jeopardy for perjury. Democrats have publicly suggested for more than a year that Prince lied to Congress, though Prince has always maintained that his testimony was truthful. A spokesperson for Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to comment on whether Prince lied during his House testimony when reached via email by CNN Thursday, saying, ""Erik has said all there is to say on this."""
WannaCry 'hero' Marcus Hutchins pleads guilty to hacking charges - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kevin Collier,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/marcus-hutchins-pleads-guilty/index.html,"New York (CNN) Marcus Hutchins, the British hacker who stopped one of the most destructive cyberattacks in the world, has taken a plea deal, admitting guilt in the US to unrelated hacking charges.
Hutchins became a minor celebrity in May 2017, when he stopped the spread of WannaCry, a ransomware worm created by North Korea that had spread wildly out of control in 2017, hitting the UK's National Health Service especially hard. A security researcher who blogged about how to hunt malicious software, Hutchins noticed and activated a kill-switch in WannaCry's code. Three months later, as he prepared to fly home after visiting Las Vegas during the DEF CON hacker conference, Hutchins was arrested and charged with crimes relating to the creation and sale of malware programs UPAS Kit and Kronos, programs that help steal people's banking information, along with two other people. Since then, he's lived in Los Angeles, unable to leave the US. Until Friday, he denied the charges.

9 countries and 3 US agencies to investigate initial 737 Max certification - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ellie Kaufman,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/737-max-initial-certification-review/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Government officials from civil aviation authorities in nine countries, as well as members of the three US federal agencies, will investigate how the 737 Max airplane was initially certified, according to a release from the Federal Aviation Administration.
The group, called the Joint Authorities Technical Review, will begin work on April 29, and will review the initial certification of ""the aircraft's automated flight control system,"" the release states. The review is expected to take 90 days, according to the release. The three American agencies involved in the investigation will be the FAA, National Transportation Safety Board and NASA. The 737 Max was grounded in March after one of the planes flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed, killing everyone on board. It was the second accident involving the jet model in less than six months, after another flown by Indonesia's Lion Air crashed last October. The crashes killed 346 people in total. The group's review of the initial certification is separate from the ongoing certification process that Boeing, the company that makes the 737 Max planes, is undergoing with the FAA to re-certify the planes, according to an FAA spokesman. Boeing has come under intense scrutiny since the Ethiopian airline crash in March. The company at first defended the planes and insisted they were safe to fly, but after intense public pressure, they grounded the planes and admitted that a software fix was needed. Read More On Wednesday, Boeing said they had made a ""significant step"" towards FAA certification of the new updated software for the 737 Max. They announced they had completed an engineering test flight with the updated software, which is the key technical flight prior to the certification flight with the FAA. Earlier this week, American Airlines, the world's largest airline that owns and operates 737 Max planes, announced they would extend flight cancellations into mid-August because of the Boeing 737 Max grounding. ""Based upon our ongoing work with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing, we are highly confident that the Max will be recertified prior to this time,"" American Chairman and CEO Doug Parker and President Robert Isom said Sunday in a message to airline staff. ""But by extending our cancellations through the summer, we can plan more reliably for the peak travel season."" Approximately 115 flights a day will be canceled through August 19, representing about 1.5% of the airline's total daily flights, they said."
"Prosecutors want Maria Butina to serve 18 months, exceeding expectations - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/butina-sentencing-filing/index.html,"(CNN) Prosecutors have gone beyond previous expectations to ask for 18 months of jail time for Maria Butina in a case where they've alleged scandalous actions -- and had to walk back some of them -- yet still accuse the Russian woman of seeking to hurt the US in her work as a foreign agent.
""Activities at issue in this case are part of Russia's broader scheme to acquire information and establish relationships and communication channels that can be exploited to the Russian Federation's benefit,"" prosecutors wrote in their pre-sentencing memo Friday. Prosecutors wrote that Butina was not a traditional spy or ""trained intelligence officer,"" but sought to help Russia at the expense of US national security. They call her an ""access agent"" -- a person used by her foreign government to attempt to set up a backchannel through Republican organizations for communication and diplomacy. ""Had she successfully done so, the risks to the United States would have included harm to this country's political processes, internal government dealings, and US foreign policy interests,"" the prosecutors wrote. Still, they note that she ""did not get along well"" with former Russian Ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak. Read More In her sentencing memo also out Friday, Butina asked a federal judge to release her from prison and send her home to Russia after she spent nine months in jail since her arrest for acting as a foreign agent of the Russian government. Her defense attorneys have cast her in the court filing Friday night as an earnest graduate student in America, simply keeping in touch with powerful backers in her homeland. They add that she has cooperated with investigators. CNN previously reported that she was speaking to prosecutors about her boyfriend and, briefly, was questioned by the special counsel's investigation. She has also spoken to the Senate Intelligence Committee for a voluntary interview that lasted eight hours, her lawyers wrote Friday, and gave them ""thousands of pages of documents,"" including many related to a former Russian politician Alexander Torshin. Butina is set to be sentenced next Friday. The prosecutors have not yet made a recommendation to the judge for her sentencing. Her attorneys have explicitly asked that she be sentenced to time served in jail, following her plea in December. ""Maria Butina is a devoted daughter, genuine idealist, and compassionate civil activist,"" her defense attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo Friday night. ""Nearly a year ago, she graduated with a master's degree from American University with straight A's and bright career prospects. Now, her world has collapsed because of a decision to help and discuss her amateur diplomacy efforts with a Russian official."" Butina, a 30-year-old longtime gun rights activist, admitted to attempting to curry favor with conservative political groups on behalf of Russia, particularly with the support of Torshin, a former Russian parliament member and former Russian Central Bank leader. In the court filing Friday night, her attorneys described her attending a ""presidential campaign announcement"" and relaying information about it back to Torshin, an event that was ""exciting."" The relationship she had with Torshin ""triggered"" her need to notify the Justice Department of her actions working for Russians, her lawyers wrote. ""She did not infiltrate the NRA. She joined it, as millions have, by filling out an online form and paying a fee. She did not seduce the figures within it or funnel Russian money to it. Nor did anyone else instruct her to do so,"" her defense lawyers wrote. Paul Erickson, a political operative who has been indicted for money laundering in South Dakota, is mentioned in her report as her boyfriend and someone who helped her draft a plan for Russian-American diplomacy in the United States. She has been cooperating with investigators in the investigation against Erickson. George O'Neill Jr., a Rockefeller heir who CNN has previously identified as US Person 2 in Butina's case, submitted a letter in support of Butina. In it, he acknowledged that he supported her in the pursuit of her master's degree at American University, where she was a graduate student. In his letter, O'Neill also wrote, ""Over the past eight months, Maria has suffered greatly and seen many of her dreams crushed by political circumstances beyond her control. I hope, in sentencing her, the court would look at this lovely and able young woman and set her free without further punishment."" O'Neill has not faced charges. Butina's lawyers did not submit a letter from Erickson. A number of letters from Butina's supporters, including her family members, were submitted in Russian and translated into English."

How the Mueller investigation was hampered by encryption apps and disappearing messages - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kevin Collier,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/mueller-investigation-encryption/index.html,"New York (CNN) Robert Mueller and his team accumulated scores of communications over its nearly two year investigation -- not just texts and emails, but also Apple iMessages, and messages from LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter.
Yet the special counsel's investigation was hampered at times by some of the most commonly prescribed methods that privacy advocates say people should use to communicate securely: the use of a solid encryption app like Signal as well as the practice of deleting all messages after a period and deleting all backups of those messages. Despite the report's comprehensive 448 pages, it could have been longer if Mueller's team had access to more communications. Mueller discovered new ways Russia attempted to interfere in the 2016 election ""[S]ome of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated -- including some associated with the Trump Campaign -- deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records,"" the report says. ""In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts."" Read More Focus on Manafort's messages The special counsel took particular interest in the messages of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison for financial crimes stemming from twin cases from Mueller's office. In June 2018, when accusing him of trying to tamper with a witness after he was originally charged, Mueller's team revealed that they had obtained Manafort's WhatsApp messages. WhatsApp is encrypted with the Signal Protocol, the same as the Signal app, which encryption experts regard as one of the best free, widely used encryption services available. To date, there's been no public evidence that any hacker or intelligence service has broken that protocol, which automatically gives users on each end of a conversation unique keys to unlock each message. When WikiLeaks released extensive CIA hacking files in 2017 it was revealed the only way the agency could access the messages of someone using those apps was to hack the phone itself. In other words, if you can read everything that's on a target phone, it doesn't matter if its messages are scrambled in transit. Mueller was able to get Manafort's WhatsApp chats from other witnesses at the time, but his team did not intercept and decrypt those messages. According to court documents, two unnamed witnesses ""both preserved the messages they received from Manafort and Person A, which were sent on encrypted applications, and have provided them to the government."" Encryption apps stymied Mueller But Manafort kept some things secret. ""The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort's electronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications),"" the special counsel's report says. A lack of insight into why Manafort shared Trump campaign polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former employee who the special counsel assessed had ties to Russian intelligence, appears to have stifled the investigation. ""The Office could not reliably determine Manafort's purpose in sharing internal polling data with Kilimnik during the campaign period,"" the report says. ""Because of questions about Manafort's credibility and our limited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, the Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it."" Jared Kushner's use of WhatsApp raises concerns among cybersecurity experts Warrants and court orders can give law enforcement the power to both seize devices that may have relevant messages on them, and to intercept communications in transit. But that may not work when looking retroactively for messages that are set to automatically delete from every phone — an option available with messaging apps like Signal and Wickr -- or in instances where every party in a conversation has deleted their messages and the service provider has also deleted them. Blackwater founder Erik Prince and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told the special counsel drastically different versions of why Prince flew to the Seychelles in an apparent failed attempt to set up a backchannel between the Russian government and the Trump transition team. ""The conflicting accounts provided by Bannon and Prince could not be independently clarified by reviewing their communications, because neither one was able to produce any of the messages they exchanged in the time period surrounding the Seychelles meeting,"" the report says. ""Prince's phone contained no text messages prior to March 2017, though provider records indicate that he and Bannon exchanged dozens of messages. Prince denied deleting any messages but claimed he did not know why there were no messages on his device before March 2017."" Despite telling the special counsel a different story than Prince's about the Seychelles, the two did not explain why messages from that time had been deleted from his phone. ""Bannon's devices similarly contained no messages in the relevant time period, and Bannon also stated he did not know why messages did not appear on his device,"" the report says."

'Amityville Horror' and 'Conjuring' ghost hunter dead at 92 - CNN,us.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/paranormal-investigator-lorraine-warren-dies/index.html,"(CNN) Lorraine Warren was one of America's most well-known paranormal investigators. She and her husband, Ed, traveled widely researching paranormal and occult phenomena, writing books and lecturing.
She died ""peacefully"" in her sleep Thursday night, her son-in-law, Tony Spera, wrote on Facebook. Warren was 92. The New England Society for Psychic Research, which Warren and her husband Ed founded in Connecticut in 1952, announced the news on its Facebook page: ""The NESPR team regretfully announces the passing of our loving teacher, mentor, friend, mother, Lorraine."" According to ""The Demonologist,"" a book that details the Warrens' careers, the couple investigated more 3,000 paranormal and supernatural disturbances. The husband and wife team published numerous books about their exploits and inspired a string of Hollywood hits, including ""The Amityville Horror,"" ""The Conjuring,"" and the ""Annabelle"" movie franchise. For more than half a century, religious authorities repeatedly called on them during outbreaks of demonic phenomena, including alleged cases of priests being possessed, NESPR's website says. Lorraine and Ed Warren argue with another investigator outside a purportedly haunted home. Read More She laid the groundwork for numerous Hollywood films Screenwriters and directors found their muse in Warren's life work. ""The Amityville Horror,"" starring Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, released in 2005, was a remake of the 1979 film of the same name. The Warrens visited the haunted manor in Amityville, New York, in March 1976 with a news crew and a photographer who set up an automatic camera taking infrared photographs. That camera captured an image allegedly of a demonic boy . Movie buffs might remember the Warrens from the 2013 film ""The Conjuring,"" in which they figure prominently. It depicts disturbing events at a farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. The owners of the house called Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. A prequel to the Conjuring films, 2014's ""Annabelle,"" features a possessed doll and fueled two more films. That real-life doll that inspired the movies is on exhibit at the Warrens' Occult Museum, located at their home in Monroe, Connecticut. In 1977, the Warrens investigated paranormal events at a home in Enfield, outside of of London. Those were depicted in the film ""The Conjuring 2"" in 2016. The actress Vera Farmiga played Warren in the Conjuring and Annabelle films, with the latest, ""Annabelle Comes Home,"" set for release this summer. On Twitter, Farmiga acknowledged Warren's death. ""My dear friend Lorraine Warren has passed. From a deep feeling of sorrow, a deep feeling of gratitude emerges,"" she wrote. ""I was so blessed to have known her and am honored to portray her."" Lorraine Warren arrives outside a courthouse in 1981, where a jury indicted a man for a killing in which his attorney said the murder was the work of the devil. She lived to prove the 'fairy tale is true' On Facebook, Tony Spera, her son-in-law, paid tribute to Lorraine. ""She was a remarkable, loving, compassionate and giving soul,"" he wrote. ""To Quote: Will Rogers, she never met a person she didn't like."" Warren maintained that her faith anchored her in a life spent trying to rescue people from demons. ""The fairy tale is true. The devil exists. God exists,"" a bio for Warren and her husband on NESPR's site says. ""And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges upon which one we elect to follow."""
Feds arrest man in connection with a February raid on the North Korean Embassy in Madrid - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,David Shortell,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/north-korea-embassy-madrid/index.html,"(CNN) Federal authorities arrested a man in California Thursday in connection with a brazen February raid on the North Korean Embassy in Madrid.
Christopher Ahn was taken into custody by US Marshals Thursday in Los Angeles, according to a spokesman for the agency. A law enforcement official said his arrest is connected to the violent raid of the diplomatic compound in Spain that took place just days before President Donald Trump's second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Ahn made an initial appearance Friday in Los Angeles federal court, and was remanded in to custody, according to a spokesman for the US attorney's office in Los Angeles. News of Ahn's arrest was first reported by The Washington Post . Shadowy North Korean dissident group says it raided embassy, contacted FBI Cheollima Civil Defense, a North Korean dissident group, has claimed responsibility for the February raid. Read More Last month, Spanish judicial authorities described how a group of 10 broke into the embassy and began to ""violently strike its occupants"" and detain and handcuff them. It is not clear what Ahn has been charged with and his case remains under seal. A posting on the Los Angeles federal court's website that officials said belonged to Ahn listed it only as an extradition case, and Matthew Cordova, the US Marshals spokesman, said the arrest was made on a provisional warrant from Madrid. A public defender listed for Ahn did not respond to a request for comment. Ahn is due back in court for a detention hearing on Tuesday. Authorities this week also raided the apartment of the leader of Cheollima Civil Defense, a Mexican national and US resident named Adrian Hong, according to the Washington Post. An attorney for Hong said he was ""dismayed"" that the Justice Department had ""decided to execute warrants against US persons that derive from criminal complaints filed by the North Korean regime."" ""The last US citizen who fell into the custody of the Kim regime returned home maimed from torture and did not survive. We have received no assurances from the US government about the safety and security of the US nationals it is now targeting,"" said Lee Wolosky, Hong's attorney, in a statement. He was referring to Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in 2017 after over a year in North Korean detention. A spokesman for the Justice Department said, ""While we will not comment on this particular matter at this time, we would note that extradition treaties generally provide that an individual who has been extradited to another country to face criminal charges cannot thereafter be extradited to a third country without the consent of the original country."""
"Liquor heiress pleads guilty to crimes related to New York sex cult, pyramid scheme case - CNN",us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/new-york-sex-cult-guilty-pleas/index.html,"(CNN) Two women who were part of an alleged pyramid scheme that involved sex trafficking and racketeering each pleaded guilty to related charges Friday in a New York federal court.
Clare Bronfman, an heiress to the Seagram's liquor fortune, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor people who were not in the United States legally for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. Kathy Russell pleaded guilty to one charge of visa fraud. Keith Raniere, founder of Nxivm Bronfman and Russell were indicted in March on racketeering and racketeering conspiracy charges as part of the cult-like organization known as Nxivm, founded by Keith Raniere, who also was indicted and is now in federal custody. He faces sex trafficking and forced labor charges. Bronfman was a member of the Nxivm executive board, according to a US Justice Department news release , and faces between 21 and 27 months in prison. Russell is Nxivm's former bookkeeper and faces between six and 12 months in prison. Read More Bronfman, who will be sentenced July 25, tearfully read a statement in court during her plea hearing. 'Smallville' actress pleads guilty to charges relating to sex trafficking case ""Your honor, I was afforded a great gift by my grandfather and father. With the gift comes immense privilege, and more importantly, tremendous responsibility,"" Bronfman said. ""It does not come with an ability to break the law, it comes with a greater responsibility to uphold it. I failed to uphold the following laws set forth by this country, and for that I am truly remorseful."" Russell, who will be sentenced July 31, said in court that she knowingly provided visa documents with false information in order to bring a woman into the US for work. ""I know what I did was wrong and I am very sorry for the trouble that I've caused,"" Russell said, tearfully. Five Nxivm members were indicted and charged last year for crimes that included identity theft, extortion, forced labor, sex trafficking, money laundering, wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Bronfman, Russell and actress Allison Mack were among the five indicted and charged last year. Nxivm touted itself as a professional organization Prosecutors allege Raniere created the organization Nxivm (pronounced NEX-ium), which touted itself as a professional business providing coaching and educational services to ""corporations and people of all walks of life."" The organization, prosecutors say, actually operated like a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme, and encouraged its members to continue taking pricey classes and recruiting other members in order to rise in the ranks of the organization. The organization also acted as an umbrella for other groups like ""The Source,"" described as a private arts academy, and the secret society DOS, which was founded in 2015 and is the subgroup where sex trafficking activities allegedly took place. Under the sub-group DOS, prosecutors allege. women were designated as ""slaves"" until successfully recruiting others, at which time they became ""masters."" All so-called slaves were at the service of their own masters as well as those above them in the pyramid. The indictment claims many so-called slaves were branded on their pelvic areas with a symbol which, unbeknownst to them, incorporated Raniere's initials. Documents describe ""branding ceremonies,"" in which women were held down by others while naked and filmed as they were branded with a cauterizing pen. Raniere was the only male in DOS and the leader, according to court filings. JUST WATCHED 'Smallville' actress pleads guilty to charges in sex trafficking case Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

She also allegedly received financial and other benefits from Raniere in exchange for the women's cooperation with their demands. Mack was released from jail on $5 million bond after being indicted last week. She pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and racketeering relating to her alleged role in a sex trafficking case.

Mueller's report leaves open possibility of post-White House criminal exposure for Trump - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Kara Scannell,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/trump-mueller-criminal-exposure-possibility-after-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller abided by Justice Department guidelines that a sitting president can't be indicted, but in preparing the detailed 448-page report , the long-time law enforcement official has teed up an investigation into obstruction that could outlive President Donald Trump's time in the White House and his temporary immunity.
In declining to reach a traditional prosecution decision, Mueller wrote that he was adhering to DOJ guidelines and also considered the ""burdens"" an indictment would place on the President's ability to govern and respond to the allegations while in office. Mueller added that the President ""does not have immunity after he leaves office"" and that his team ""conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available."" 4 times Barr twisted and cherry-picked Mueller's report The wording raises the remote specter of possible future criminal exposure for Trump when he is no longer in the White House. It isn't the only criminal inquiry looming over him. Trump's immediate criminal exposure is protected by his status as president and also by the decision of Attorney General William Barr, whom Trump appointed, to not bring a case. Barr said ""the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense."" Mueller rejected the legal defenses put forward by Trump's lawyers about his authority to investigate the president for obstruction. Read More Mueller did not ask Barr to weigh in. He also did not refer the investigation to Congress, but noted that Congress has a constitutional checks and balances role and can consider obstructive acts under its impeachment authority. ""We concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice,"" the report said. Democrats set sights on Trump's finances as post-Mueller probes take shape House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Friday would not rule out pursuing civil impeachment proceedings but insisted that it isn't his focus initially, signaling instead he will explore whether Trump obstructed justice. It is unclear whether the Democrats will pursue impeachment proceedings because of the potential political risk and if any Republicans would join their ranks. If Congress doesn't act, it doesn't mean Trump is out of the woods. Trump's best defense Trump is in a unique position to be identified by two prosecutor offices as possibly engaging in criminal conduct. In addition to Mueller, the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York obliquely referred to the President as ""Individual 1"" in the campaign finance prosecution of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney. In that matter, Cohen said under oath that he violated the law by paying hush money payments to women who alleged past affairs with the President ""in coordination with and at the direction of"" Trump. Trump has not been charged with any wrongdoing. And as long as he is in office, he won't be. Trump has denied affairs with both women and called Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt."" The statute of limitations on campaign finance and obstruction charges is five years. Most of the conduct at issue dates from 2016 to 2018, meaning Trump would have legal exposure on some elements until 2023. Elie Honig, a CNN contributor and former federal prosecutor, said it's possible Trump would be charged with obstruction down the road. ""Mueller conspicuously went out of his way to say in the report that a president can be charged when out of office. It is very possible,"" Honig said. ""That said, it seems really unlikely because it would be politically fraught and the conduct would be old by then."" Democrats set sights on Trump's finances as post-Mueller probes take shape Trump's best defense to his legal exposure is to win re-election in 2020, which would keep him in office until January 2025. There's no knowing how prosecutors would evaluate the allegations and merits of bringing a case in the future. Mueller's report states his team transferred nine cases it had not fully wrapped up to other US attorney offices to finish. Some of those cases, including the prosecution of Roger Stone, are public. Two additional cases that were transferred are ongoing. One is fully redacted and the other, through partial redaction, suggests it may have developed out of the investigation into Paul Manafort and Rick Gates' work with Ukraine. Jerome Corsi, an associate of Stone who was investigated for being a possible intermediary between Stone and WikiLeaks, publicly refused a plea deal from Mueller's team on one count of perjury in November. After he rejected the offer, no charges were filed against him. Stone was indicted several months later. Last month, Corsi said he felt ""vindicated"" when Mueller's investigation concluded and Barr said there would be no further indictments. It is not clear if his conduct linked to the plea deal is still under investigation. 14 referrals by Mueller The report also reveals that Mueller referred 14 investigations to other US attorney's offices for ""evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the Special Counsel's jurisdiction."" Twelve of the referrals are redacted with no information available. The two referrals that are not redacted are identified as the case against Cohen and the charges brought this month against Gregory Craig , a Washington, DC, lawyer who allegedly misled DOJ about work he had done for the Ukraine Ministry of Justice. Craig has pleaded not guilty. Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple charges and begins serving a three-year prison sentence on May 6. Prosecutors have said in court filings that some defendants are helping with non-public investigations. The government has kept some information relating to Manafort under seal because it relates to a matter under investigation. Fact check: What Trump associates told the public vs. what they told Mueller Gates' sentencing has been postponed several times because he is aiding multiple investigations. Sam Patten, a political consultant who pleaded guilty to not registering as a foreign lobbyist, received no jail time when he was sentenced earlier this month . Prosecutors filed a document detailing Patten's cooperation under seal stating only that he served as a valuable witness to ""a number of other criminal investigations."" One of the referrals, according to sources, was made last spring when Mueller referred to the Southern District of New York office an investigation into whether Tony Podesta, a Democratic lobbyist, and Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman, had operated as unregistered foreign agents . The same office is also looking into donations and expenditures of the Trump inaugural committee, into the Trump Organization, and into allegations Cohen made related to campaign finance and conversations about a possible presidential pardon."
DNA from old razor helped solve two cases of rape and murder from 40 years ago - CNN,us.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/cold-case-dna-razor/index.html,"(CNN) Police have cracked a cold case with DNA found on the razor of the man they say raped and killed two women more than four decades ago in California.
DNA from a razor used by Arthur Rudy Martinez matches that left by the attacker at both crime scenes in the late 1970s, the San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Office said. Martinez died of cancer in June 2014 at a prison in Spokane Washington, where he was serving life for robberies and two other unrelated rapes. The two victims did not know each other The cases of Jane Morton Antunez and Patricia Dwyer date to 1977 and 1978, respectively. Read More In November 1977, Antunez was found dead in the backseat of her car in Atascadero, California. The 30-year-old woman had been sexually assaulted and her throat slit. She was on her way to her best friend's house, but never made it, the Sheriff's Office said. Months later, in January 1978, Patricia Dwyer was found stabbed to death and sexually assaulted in her home. Like Antunez, the 28-year-old also lived in Atascadero. While the two victims had mutual friends, they did not know each other, authorities said. ""Both victims' arms were bound behind their backs by different bindings that were found at each scene,"" the Sheriff's Office said. DNA link came from another arrested relative Biological evidence was recovered from the scene in the 1970s, but DNA technology was not used in criminal cases at the time, authorities said. For years, both cases remained unresolved. Then this year, a lead from the Department of Justice's Familiar DNA Search team helped crack the case. It obtained a familial DNA comparison from a relative of the suspect whose DNA was in the system as a result of a prior arrest, San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said. ""Essentially identifies the suspect in this case. ... It really is in simple terms ... it strongly resembles existing DNA profiles in relatives who have many of the same markers in common,"" he said. When investigators made the connection, authorities reached out to the suspect's girlfriend, who still had items belonging to him. An item from her was tested and the DNA matched that of Martinez, he said. ""This lead was generated by getting a DNA profile comparison and other evidence. The DNA profile was a close match to an inmate serving time for unrelated charges,"" the Sheriff's Office said. CNN affiliate KSFN reported that DNA collected at the scenes was compared to that taken from an old razor belonging to Martinez. Police linked him to the murders. ""Most likely this case would never have been solved if the initial investigators did not collect the valuable biological DNA evidence that was used to compare to Martinez's DNA,"" the Sheriff's Office said. The suspect was in prison for assault Martinez was in Atascadero until 1978 — shortly after Dwyer's murder, authorities said. He moved to Spokane and later that year was sentenced to life in prison after committing numerous robberies and two other additional rapes, authorities said. In 1994, he escaped from prison and was on the run until he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2014, the statement said. He then turned himself in so he could receive treatment and died in prison two months later. With Martinez dead, many questions remain, including whether he knew these victims prior to their murder. ""Our hearts go out to the families of the victims and are hopeful the resolution to these cases brings them some closure,"" said Sheriff Parkinson. ""With the advancements in DNA technology and having an investigative focus solely on these types of cases, this case proves the value of having this important position."""
Welcome to the post-Mueller presidency - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/trump-presidency-after-robert-mueller-investigation-week-in-review/index.html,"(CNN) Donald Trump's presidency -- or at least his first term -- will be measured this way: Before the Mueller Report (BMR) and After the Mueller Report (AMR).
BMR ran from the start of Trump's presidency -- when the FBI investigation that would become special counsel Robert Mueller's probe was already underway -- until this past Thursday at 11 a.m. ET. AMR began soon after as people -- media types, members of Congress, average Joes -- began to either read and digest Mueller's report or watch and read coverage of it . Like it or not -- and lots and lots of Democrats won't like it -- we are in a post-Mueller world now. And that new reality brings with it a series of critical choices for both the White House, congressional Democrats and the 2020 candidates who want to unseat the President next November. Here's a look at the choices before each group. Read More 1) Trump: He has spent much of the past year relentlessly blasting the Mueller team, the media for its coverage of the Russia investigation and even members of his own administration for their lack of perceived loyalty to him on all of it. Now, the Mueller report is (mostly) behind Trump. Does he let sleeping dogs lie? Move on to immigration and the economy full time between now and 2020? Can he? 2) Congressional Democrats: Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her House Democratic colleagues face perhaps the most difficult -- and critical -- choice in the coming weeks. Do they push forward -- as Mueller seemed to suggest -- on the obstruction evidence in the report? That would likely necessitate pursuing impeachment against Trump. Pelosi has made clear she is opposed to that move -- unless there was bipartisan support for it in the country. That seems unlikely to happen now. But Pelosi will also come under more pressure from liberals to penalize Trump. 3) 2020 Democrats: Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts came out Friday afternoon with a clear message: It's time to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump. But Warren's campaign was also quick to tell CNN's MJ Lee that ""Warren's decision to call on impeachment proceedings does not mean that the topic will become central theme of her 2020 campaign going forward -- Warren plans to continue to rolling out major policy proposals."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

My guess is that most 2020 candidates will follow that lead. Say Trump should be impeached -- and maybe include it as a line or three in their stump speech -- but not build a campaign around it. The Point : The Mueller report release is a pivot point in Trump's presidency -- and re-election effort. We are living in the post-Mueller political world, and all of the players need to make decisions accordingly.

Armed Mexican troops question American soldiers on US side of border - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/mexican-troops-american-soldiers-border/index.html,"(CNN) Two US soldiers were questioned by Mexican troops earlier this month while conducting a surveillance operation on the US side of the southern border, two US defense officials tell CNN.
""On April 13, 2019, at approximately 2 p.m. CDT, five to six Mexican military personnel questioned two U.S. Army soldiers who were conducting border support operations in an unmarked (Customs and Border Protection) vehicle near the southwest border in the vicinity of Clint, Texas,"" US Northern Command told CNN in a statement. ""The US soldiers were appropriately in US territory"" during the encounter, the statement added. During the incident, the Mexican soldiers pointed their weapons at the US troops, removing a soldier's sidearm and returning it to the unmarked US vehicle, the officials said. The Mexican troops were armed with what appeared to be assault rifles, according to one official. Read More Officials said that the US soldiers allowed the weapon to be taken ""in an attempt to de-escalate a potential volatile situation."" ""Throughout the incident, the US soldiers followed all established procedures and protocols,"" Northern Command said. The encounter took place south of the border fence in the area but north of the Rio Grande, the officials said. However, the officials said the river in that area consists of brush-filled and dried-out riverbed, making it ""very easy"" for people to be confused as to what side of the border they are on. One of the American soldiers spoke some Spanish and was able to explain the situation to the Mexican forces. The two sides talked the incident over and promised to de-conflict in the future, the officials said. ""An inquiry by (Customs and Border Patrol) and (the Department of Defense) revealed that the Mexican military members believed that the US Army soldiers were south of the border,"" Northern Command said while adding that the US troops were north of the border. ""Though they were south of the border fence, US soldiers remained in US territory, north of the actual border,"" the statement said, adding that ""after a brief discussion between the soldiers from the two nations, the Mexican military members departed the area."" President Donald Trump had previously ordered the active duty military to support border security and the US has some 3,000 active duty troops supporting the Department of Homeland Security on the southern border with Mexico in addition to some 2,000 National Guard troops. The Pentagon expects additional troops to be sent to the border to support additional pending requests for assistance from DHS. On Friday, acting Secretary of Defense Pat Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon that he did not ""have a finite number"" in terms of how many additional troops would be sent but said the Pentagon was ""looking at anticipating"" what DHS needs prior to the receipt of a formal request for assistance. ""Where DHS loses its capacity is in the migrant family processing, when you think about their finite ability to do apprehensions they're really kind of trapped back in the processing side of things so working with the joint staff, we're finding a way to how do we do more monitoring and detection for them, do we maybe take that on as a mission,"" Shanahan said."

Aranda told police he had come to the mall a day earlier intending to kill an adult, but that did not ""work out,"" according to the complaint.

Xi Jinping is determined to end all poverty in China by 2020. Can he do it?,us.cnn.com,Ben Westcott,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/asia/poverty-alleviation-2020-xi-jinping-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) In the small village of Gaibao, locals are filming short videos of their unspoiled and idyllic countryside on the Kwai streaming app.
One clip shows four young women laughing as they grab fat fish out of the rice fields with their hands. In another they don traditional outfits and stand next to an ox plowing a paddy field. ""Do you all have a farm such as this?"" the caption asks. Their short videos are a small part of a massive nationwide attempt to lift all of China's 1.4 billion people out of poverty by 2020 -- a goal which President Xi Jinping set in a speech in 2015 . The Chinese government defines poverty as earning less than $416 (2,800 yuan) a year or around $1.10 a day -- a lower benchmark than the World Bank poverty line of $1.90 a day, or just under $700 a year. Beijing has dispatched about 775,000 party officials to drive the anti-poverty campaign. Many are going door-to-door to work out what the government can do to help. Those who fail in their missions to alleviate poverty could face career oblivion , according to state media. Read More Stills from the Gaibao village's Kuaishou page, where they raise money through videos of their everyday lives. The idea to stream videos of the village came from Gaibao's chief poverty alleviation official, Wu Yusheng, and has helped the town, in the province of Guizhou, sell its organic produce online. Residents also receive virtual gifts from fans via the app, which they can exchange for cash. Wu, who arrived in the village in 2018, said he had already achieved his goal -- but it is unclear whether Xi will do the same. At worst, some experts fear the ruling Communist Party might just announce poverty has been eradicated, regardless of the reality, to avoid embarrassing Xi. ""Local leaders are taking it extremely seriously, almost in a panicky way. Part of the problem is that they don't know really what to do, so they're kind of grasping at different solutions,"" said John Donaldson, a poverty expert and associate professor at Singapore Management University. ""They're throwing everything at it."" Chinese President Xi Jinping visits a villager's home to learn about the progress of poverty alleviation in Huaxi village on April 15. The campaign against poverty The dream of eradicating widespread poverty in China didn't begin with Xi. It dates back to the Communist Party's rise to power in 1949. ""The reason for the existence of the Chinese Communist Party in the beginning is because of injustice and poverty among farmers,"" Donaldson said. Chairman Mao Zedong's economic experiments, however, actually set the country back, according to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the University of London. ""In 1949, Shanghai was still a richer city than Hong Kong. In 1949, any coastal province was richer and more developed than Taiwan. In 1979, Hong Kong and Taiwan were way, way ahead,"" Tsang said. Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward, beginning in 1958, was ostensibly an attempt to transform a mainly agrarian society through industrialization and collectivization. Instead, it helped create a famine that cost tens of millions of lives and aggravated poverty across the country. Things began to change after Mao's death. In 1978, then-paramount leader Deng Xiaoping began liberalizing China's economy and one of his first reforms was to let struggling farmers sell excess produce to make a profit . China's efforts to combat poverty since then have been staggering. In 1990, there were more than 750 million people living in poverty across the nation, according to the World Bank -- over 60% of the population. Almost 30 years later in 2019, Beijing says that number has dropped to just 16.6 million. One of the Communist Party's main claims to power in recent years has been that it has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty. Perhaps for that reason, Xi still isn't satisfied. Despite the growing wealth of China's major cities such as Shanghai or Beijing, parts of rural China live without electricity, fresh water and adequate food or clothing. In his 2015 speech, Xi said he was inspired to make poverty a priority by his experience working in the countryside in the 1960s when his father, a prominent party official, fell from favor during Mao's Cultural Revolution. ""I toiled with the villagers at the time, with the aim to make life a bit better, but it was harder than reaching the sky in that year,"" he said. Farmers work in the cooperative collective farm in 1950 near Beijing, China. Roads, internet and jobs The government's plan is broadly divided into two strategies -- big national policies and small local interventions. At a national level, the policies revolve around infrastructure spending. Xi's administration is pouring billions of dollars into the problem, $19 billion in 2019 alone , which has been spent on a variety of projects and initiatives across the country. More than 200,000 kilometers (124,274 miles) of roads were built or renovated in 2018 and 94% of poor villages were connected to the internet, according to government figures. Dozens of state-owned enterprises have joined the campaign and poured more than $4 billion (30 billion yuan) into poverty relief programs as of early 2019, according to state media. Some of these big-ticket projects have sparked controversy. A number of provincial governments have been accused of trying to simply move millions of poor people to newly built urban accommodation to raise them out of poverty. Some older rural citizens have refused to go, while others have moved but then returned to their old homes. Maggie Lau, a professor at Hong Kong's Lingnan University, said such schemes aren't always pragmatic. ""If they move to a higher-cost area, how can they afford those new living costs?"" she asks.

— CGTN (@CGTNOfficial) April 17, 2019 But to a large degree, the anti-poverty campaign is small-scale and has been left in the hands of local officials. ""Every local official on a township level (one above a village) goes down to every poor household and tries to find out what's going on and why people are poor and how to apply resources to that,"" Donaldson said, describing his observations in Chinese villages. The solutions proposed vary wildly but often focus on encouraging villagers to lift themselves out of poverty by developing local industries, engaging in e-commerce and boosting rural tourism. While Donaldson said the effort expended was ""amazing,"" problems emerged with government officials spending too much time just knocking on doors talking about poverty rather than tackling local problems. ""The danger is that it will be a confused mess,"" he said. There has also been a lack of patience with poor villagers who fail to get with the program. In a report in February, Wu Weihua, a vice chairman of the national legislature, complained that some people just don't want to ""get rich."" ""Some poor people even have the mindset of, 'You don't help, I don't move',"" the report said. JUST WATCHED China's senior citizens risk being left behind Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
China's senior citizens risk being left behind 02:44 Corruption and pollution Failure is not tolerated -- and the government is watching where its money is being spent. In March 2018, a provincial governor was kicked out of the Communist Party , partly for his failure to address poverty in his jurisdiction. In October that year, inspections were carried out in provinces across central and western China to check that officials were following orders on poverty alleviation. The flood of government and company funds allocated to deal with the issue has also revived the ever-present threat of corruption. More than 170,000 individuals were disciplined in 2018 alone for misappropriation of poverty alleviation funds, according to the party's anti-graft agency Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. There have also been signs that the government's laser-like focus on poverty is impeding another of its main goals -- environmental conservation. A 2015 research paper found evidence that work by the government to eradicate poverty by boosting the economy was lowering air and water quality in affected regions . Heavily polluting industries were encouraged to set up shop, bringing jobs and prosperity at the expense of the environment. Or natural resources were exploited for financial gain. ""Economic growth, poverty alleviation and ecological degradation do not appear to have de-coupled as required for long-term sustainable use of the environment, especially with regards to food security and access to clean water,"" the joint British and Chinese study said. Some critics also note that the government has focused mainly on poverty in the countryside rather than in cities, ignoring less severe but still-pressing urban hardship. 'Absolutely confident' Wu, the Guizhou village poverty alleviation chief, said he was ""absolutely confident"" the 2020 goal could be met. ""The government is doing everything to achieve that. And on the micro level, the targeting of poverty population is really precise. It's not a problem if the entire society is making an effort,"" he said. China's Xi Jinping begins his most important year at his weakest point But experts and international observers say China's poverty goals achieve the bare minimum -- more work will be needed in the cities and the countryside to ensure everyone enjoys a high quality of life. Qin Gao, director of Columbia University's China Center for Social Policy, said in a 2018 report that broader government support for healthcare and employment would be more useful than initiatives on an individual basis or e-commerce measures. ""Only a combination of effective development measures and social policies and services can help China eradicate persisting rural poverty in the long run,"" she said. But Donaldson said that even if the target is met in 2020, he didn't believe the government would just abandon poverty as an issue. ""Any kind of responsible government would be focused on how you help improve the living standards of people who may not be poor but are still struggling,"" he said. ""I expect that to be on the agenda of the party forever."""
Measles: Are you protected? It depends on when you were born - CNN,www.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/health/measles-vaccine-protection-age/index.html,"(CNN) Nearly two decades after measles was declared eliminated in the United States, the country and the globe have seen an upsurge of cases -- including adults who thought they were protected by the vaccine. Now, some are questioning whether they are properly vaccinated and whether they are still at risk for getting measles.
In a video posted to YouTube last week, a rabbi in Detroit who said he was ""fully vaccinated"" nevertheless came down with measles -- ""a brutal three weeks,"" he said. In another recent case , an Israeli flight attendant has been unable to breathe on her own after experiencing a dire complication of measles: inflammation and swelling of the brain, called encephalitis. Health authorities believe she also received a vaccine. ""It's just so darn contagious. And the way that people travel nowadays, it just doesn't really take much for it to spread,"" said Dr. John Cullen , the current president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a family physician in Valdez, Alaska. ""I have never seen a case of measles,"" he added. ""But it's just a matter of time."" Measles is spreading across the US Adding to the uncertainty, some adults simply don't know their vaccination status or have long lost their documentation, Cullen said. The history of the measles vaccine has also prompted questions about how people of different ages have been vaccinated: Not only has the recommended number of doses changed over the years, but so has the vaccine itself. Read More Several years ago, he recalled, a case of measles popped up in Fairbanks, Alaska -- the state's first case in years. Worried about having been exposed and uncertain about whether they were properly vaccinated, patients of his who had traveled there asked for a dose of the vaccine, just in case. (When given within three days of exposure to the virus, the vaccine may offer some protection or make the illness milder, according to health officials.) Although Alaska hasn't seen any cases this year, health officials issued an alert following a declaration of emergency in nearby Washington state, which has confirmed dozens of cases in 2019. ""If we see a substantial increase in the number of infections of measles, then there's going to be a whole lot more people who are going to be wondering what their vaccine status is,"" he said. What are the current measles vaccine recommendations? Doctors recommend two doses of the MMR vaccine, so called because it covers measles, mumps and rubella. Doctors give the first dose between 12 and 15 months, the second between 4 to 6 years. The current recommendation was issued in 1989 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prior to that, a single-dose recommendation had been in place from 1963. Before we had a vaccine, the agency says 3 million to 4 million Americans were infected yearly, including 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths. In some recent years, there have been fewer than 100 cases nationwide. But the virus has made a comeback in other years, including 2019 -- largely due to anti-vaxers, experts say. ""The reason why we have vaccine hesitancy in this country is because people don't remember how bad it was,"" Cullen said. One vs. two vaccine doses: What's the difference? If you were vaccinated with two doses, in line with the latest guidelines from 1989, the CDC says you have a 97% chance at being protected against measles. And if that last few percent happen to come into contact with the virus, they're less likely to spread it to others, and their illness is often milder. One dose is still about 93% effective at preventing the disease. Measles accelerates to second-highest level in US in 25 years and over 100,000 global cases ""Most virologists only dream of a solution as successful"" as today's measles vaccine, CDC's principal deputy director, Dr. Anne Schuchat, wrote in 2015 . ""Success can breed complacency, skepticism or even attack,"" she added. The second dose, however, is not a booster per se. In research studies, nearly everyone developed signs of immunity to measles with a single dose -- and the vast majority of the time, this immunity is lifelong, experts say. ""That was in the clinical trials where everything was managed very, very tightly,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and an adviser to the CDC on vaccines. But out in the real world, despite major gains against the virus, health experts were still finding measles outbreaks among kids and adolescents who had supposedly been vaccinated with one dose. A second dose seemed to do the trick, but the question remained: Why had the vaccine failed the first time around? ""When that was examined further, it was discovered that, in the hurly burly of busy [medical] practice, the vaccine was not always handled optimally,"" Schaffner said. A measles outbreak is dividing families in this Orthodox Jewish community. Passover could make it worse For example, if a doctor or nurse were vaccinating multiple children in a row, they may have kept the vaccine out of the refrigerator too long, causing it to deteriorate. Even placing it in the door of a fridge, which is slightly warmer than the inside, may in some cases be enough to degrade the temperature-sensitive vaccine, he added. That's less of a threat now that health care providers are more educated about how to handle the vaccine. In addition, we have shifted to single-dose bottles from multidose ones that might have been left out between shots, Schaffner said. Still, giving two doses has allowed health systems to ""fill in"" a small percentage of kids for whom the vaccine didn't take the first time around. ""That is a wonderfully American solution: We'll double the cost of the vaccine program in order to protect this small group of children from getting measles and its complications,"" Schaffner said. ""That strategy worked brilliantly and has been adopted in the developing world. ""And the only way it's been undermined is when children are withheld from vaccination."" Which vaccine did I get? If you were born before the 1960s, you may have never been vaccinated against measles because it was assumed you'd been exposed to the virus. In fact, the CDC says that most people born before 1957 don't need the vaccine because ""before vaccines were available, nearly everyone was infected with measles, mumps, and rubella viruses during childhood."" Then, in 1963, two types of measles vaccines were introduced: One was ""killed"" and another ""live attenuated."" The difference is that the first inactivates the measles virus, whereas the other has a weakened form of it. The killed vaccine, which was given to an estimated 600,000 to 900,000 people, was itself killed off in 1967 ""because it did not protect against measles virus infection,"" the CDC says. The agency also recommended that people who got that vaccine, or aren't sure of which one they got during those years, should get vaccinated anew. This baby got measles because of anti-vaxers The following year, in 1968, a new version of the live vaccine hit the market. It was just as effective as its live-attenuated predecessor and even safer than the first, as it had been further weakened. It's still used today, and has been available in combination with the mumps and rubella vaccines since 1971. Experts say many middle-aged adults who were vaccinated in the early days won't know which one they got. Whether one received the ""live"" or ""killed"" vaccine was not always documented, Schaffner said -- and these days, those decades-old records might be nowhere to be found. ""Back then, the entire profession was not as nuanced about giving vaccines,"" he said. What's more, neither the CDC nor any national organization has kept vaccination records. Individual states have immunization registries, but those didn't come along until later. For many Americans, ""the records that exist are the ones you or your parents were given when the vaccines were administered and the ones in the medical record of the doctor or clinic where the vaccines were given,"" according to the CDC, which recommends that people search among baby books, school records and previous employers that may have collected this information, such as the military. But many adults will be out of luck. Older records ""simply don't exist anymore because the doctors closed their practice, they retired, they moved away,"" Schaffner said. ""It would be nigh on impossible to actually resurrect those records."" What do the experts recommend? If you've received two doses of MMR or have had lab results showing immunity or previous measles infection, the CDC says you're all set . If you've had one documented dose of the live vaccine and aren't at high risk of exposure, the agency says that's also adequate. Those at higher risk -- whom the agency advises to get two doses for good measure -- might work in health care, travel internationally or be more likely to be affected by an outbreak. What you need to know about measles as the virus spreads across the country Some people can't get vaccinated at all or need to wait: for example, people with weakened immune systems and babies who are too young to respond to the vaccine. Born before 1957 and don't work in health care? The CDC considers that ""presumptive evidence"" that you're immune from having been exposed to the virus in a pre-vaccine era. But what if you don't have written documentation of the right vaccine? For anyone who's unsure, the CDC says you can simply roll up your sleeve for another dose or two. ""The MMR vaccine is safe, and there is no harm in getting another dose,"" the agency says. Cullen, however, acknowledged that the number of people uncertain about their vaccination status could be very high. ""If we were to have an epidemic in our area, would we have enough MMR to go around for the people who are concerned?"" he wondered. ""Probably not, under those circumstances. Unfortunately, this is kind of the new reality that we're dealing with."" Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
There is a blood test doctors can use to check immunity as well, but it may take some time to get results back, he added. For the general population, Schaffner said that blood test is ""expensive, impractical, and it only rarely produces an actionable result."" ""The juice ain't worth the squeeze,"" he said. ""The way to prevent those older people from getting measles is to make sure all the kids are vaccinated."" "

CIA spy Virginia Hall is about to be everyone's next favorite historical hero - CNN,edition.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/virginia-hall-cia-spy-world-war-2-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The latest spy story to captivate the entertainment world has it all: World War II espionage in enemy territory, a determined American woman once called the ""most dangerous"" Allied spy and, of course, her prosthetic leg named Cuthbert.
But Virginia Hall's tale is far from fiction: She really was an accomplished spy who is the only woman to ever receive the US military's Distinguished Service Cross. A display is dedicated to her at the CIA's top-secret museum in Langley, Virginia . Though her legacy hasn't found a foothold in the public's imagination, that might change soon. Hall is the subject of three recently-published books and two upcoming films. If they are anywhere as intriguing as Hall herself, she'd bound to be everyone's new favorite World War II hero. Breakthrough Women in US Government, Education and Business Here's a primer: During World War II, Hall served for both the British Special Operations Executive and the American Office of Strategic Services . She spent time in the occupied French city of Vichy establishing spy networks for the UK. When Germany took the rest of France, she narrowly escaped -- but eventually joined the OSS and asked to be returned overseas. Once back in France, she continued to elude the Gestapo, who were intent on capturing the ""woman with a limp."" ""She is the most dangerous of all Allied spies,"" their communications reportedly stated . ""We must find and destroy her."" Oh, and Hall did it all on (technically) one leg. She lost the bottom half of her left leg in a hunting accident when she was 27. She eventually gave her prosthetic leg its own code name: Cuthbert. Read More Hall was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by OSS chief William Donovan in 1945. But as her exploits in World War II were coming to an end, Hall's career was just beginning: After the war, she spent an additional 16 years in the CIA. Virginia Hall being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1945. A pop culture wave The three new books profiling Hall were all published this year: ""Hall of Mirrors"" by Craig Gralley and ""A Woman of No Importance"" by Sonia Purnell hit bookshelves in February, and ""The Lady is a Spy,"" a young adult retelling of Hall's story by Don Mitchell, was released in March. Wait, there's more: A film version of Purnell's book starring Star Wars' Daisy Ridley is supposed to be released this year, and another film, "" Liberté: A Call to Spy "" is currently in post-production. A reluctant hero #ThrowbackThursday: First Tuskegee Airmen take flight What would Hall, who died in 1982 at the age of 72, think of all of this newfound attention? ""She would absolutely hate it,"" Hall's niece, Lorna Catling, tells CNN. ""She was not the least bit interested in fame or recognition. She did her work because she loved the excitement of it all. She was an outdoorsman and an extremely good organizer, and she just wanted to do her job."" Catling, who has been present for several ceremonies and dedications honoring her aunt's life, says Hall never talked about her accomplishments. While part of that was because of the secretive nature of her work, Catling says even after it was safe to discuss her time as a spy, she didn't bother. Hall even demurred when President Harry Truman offered to present her with the Distinguished Service Cross. ""She was so disinterested in that kind of recognition, she didn't want the ceremony to be public, so they had [Donovan] do it,"" Catling says. Unfortunately for Hall, her insistence on pushing away pomp and circumstances kind of adds to her whole mythology. ""I think it's great that she is finally being found, so to speak, and accredited for her work,"" Catling admits. ""Because she was pretty darn fabulous."""

When to look up for the Lyrid meteor shower - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ashley Strickland,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/world/lyrid-meteor-shower-how-to-watch-scn/index.html,"(CNN) The annual Lyrid meteor shower will peak on Tuesday morning, but keep your eyes on the sky over the weekend as well.
There hasn't been a meteor shower to light up the sky since early January, and this one will be visible around the globe. The moon was full Friday, so it will still be quite bright in the early morning hours over the weekend and during the peak. Late evening hours based on your location, between 9 p.m. and midnight local time, may be the best time to see ""shooting stars,"" or meteors that burn up in our atmosphere. Pink Moon set to illuminate the skies on Friday That will also be the best time to see slower, longer meteors that streak horizontally across the sky, called earthgrazers. Some of them have trails that glow for seconds after the meteor has disappeared. Typically, the Lyrid meteor shower can showcase between 10 and 20 meteors per hour during the peak, but it's difficult to estimate how many will be visible. Read More The shower occurs this time each year when Earth's orbit crosses paths with that of Comet Thatcher. The comet loses pieces of itself that go flying into our upper atmosphere at 110,000 miles per hour. Lyrid gets its name from the Lyra constellation. The Lyrid shower is one of the oldest known, with records of visible meteors going back 2,700 years, according to EarthSky . If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn't littered with city lights that will obstruct your view. Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness -- without looking at your phone -- so meteors are easier to spot."

"Marijuana can prevent people from obtaining citizenship, Trump administration says - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Geneva Sands,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/marijuana-ties-us-citizenship/index.html,"(CNN) Marijuana possession, production and distribution, even in states where it is legal, will remain a barrier in many cases to immigrants hoping to gain US citizenship, the federal government said.
Violation of controlled substance laws, including marijuana, ""remains a conditional bar to establishing good moral character for naturalization,"" USCIS said in a policy alert issued Friday. ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance regardless of any actions to decriminalize its possession, use, or sale at the state and local level,"" a USCIS spokesperson said in a statement. ""Federal law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose, even in places where state or local law does."" ""It's been something that we have been struggling with in Colorado for a while now,"" said Jeff Joseph, an immigration attorney in Denver, where marijuana use is legal. ""There's a number of activities that can be perfectly legal in Colorado that people don't realize constitute as an immigration violation."" Earlier this month, Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock sent a letter to US Attorney General William Barr asking for Department of Justice guidance on policies that are ""negatively impacting"" the legal immigration status for people who work in Colorado's cannabis industry. Read More ""Denver understands the need for federal laws and regulations regarding citizenship and immigration, but we are seeing the heartbreaking effects that those federal laws and regulations are having on our residents,"" Hancock said in a statement. Two Denver immigrants who had lived in the US for more than 20 years were told by USCIS that they were ineligible for naturalization because of their employment in the cannabis industry, the mayor said. One of the immigrants, Oswaldo Barrientos, 30, told CNN in a statement that he thought he ""was a shoe-in for citizenship."" ""I work hard in an industry that offers opportunity and that's unquestionably legal within the state. For the government to deny my citizenship application because I'm a bad person is devastating,"" Barrientos said. Barrientos' attorney, Aaron Elinoff, said this policy announcement is a move by the Trump administration to ""quietly and systematically"" target the immigrant population. Prior to this guidance, immigration field offices around the US handled marijuana in different ways, according to Joseph. ""This now seems to instruct [immigration] officers to probe."" Joseph said he prefers the transparency of the new guidance, but the unfortunate part is that ""people are doing things that are perfectly legal under state law, but will make them permanently ineligible for a green card."" According to USCIS, as long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the agency won't grant special considerations to individuals whose marijuana activities may be decriminalized under state or local law. ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance regardless of any actions to decriminalize its possession, use, or sale at the state and local level,"" a USCIS spokesperson said in a statement. ""Federal law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose, even in places where state or local law does."" David Leopold, counsel to DHS Watch and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, criticized the policy guidance, calling it ""nonsensical"" at a time when states continue to liberalize their marijuana laws. There have been cases where people have used medical marijuana for a serious injury, left the US, and upon return were challenged by immigration authorities, as if it had been illicit use, Leopold said. As states legalize, ""noncitizens can really find themselves in a bind,"" he said. ""USCIS doesn't have to make it worse. You have a situation where you have an obvious conflict between state and federal law."""

Magic is real. How else do you explain the glimmering northern lights, the phosphorescent glow of the mysterious sea creatures of the deep? What, short of true sorcery, could account for the ancient majesty of a rainforest or those really weird dances birds do when they want to attract a mate? OK, yes, most of it is science, but science is just another word for magic we can explain. Earth Day is April 22, and there's no better way to celebrate than to embrace the rich menagerie of magical matter all around us.

Our favorites this week Get going with some of our most popular good news stories of the week A pudgy parrot baby boom Read More We can't get enough of these fuzzy green nuggets! These are baby kākāpōs, the fattest parrots in the world. They're native to New Zealand and up until recently there were only 147 of them in existence. It turns out, when you only mate once every couple of years and constantly face predators and environmental threats, building a big family is a bit of a challenge. However, this year, the kākāpōs had a record-setting mating season ! At least 75 hatched chicks are now thriving, thanks in no small part to a diligent nationwide conservation effort. This single bumper crop of kākāpōs could mean an even bigger comeback a few years down the road, so you can bet New Zealand researchers are thrilled. Why wouldn't they be? These little land angels should be protected at all costs. A true champion It's hard to put Valentino Dixon's s incredible journey into just a few lines, but we'll try: In 1991, Dixon was put in prison for a murder he didn't commit, and to cope, he took up drawing. He got so good that the warden of his prison asked him to draw the 12th hole of the Augusta National golf course, where the Masters is held. The result was stunning, and Dixon kept drawing golf course scenes. In September 2018, thanks to the efforts of his daughter, some law students and the editorial director of Golf Digest, Dixon was finally exonerated. Earlier this month, Dixon attended the Masters and met Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and other golfing greats, and even presented Nicklaus with a drawing of the 13th hole he completed in prison. Yeah, this little paragraph doesn't cut it. This is one of the best stories we've seen all year -- and you KNOW that's saying something. Do yourself a favor and read the whole thing . Notre Dame's tiny survivors If you're still in mourning about the tragic Notre Dame fire, here is a little piece of hopeful news: The bees survived! Yes, since 2013, about 180,000 bees have lived in three hives on the roof of the cathedral just below its iconic rose window . The hives are supported with wood, so there was concern they could have caught on fire -- not to mention that at high temperatures, the wax in the hives could have melted and killed the bees. Luckily, the hives were fine, and since bees don't have lungs (fun fact!) there's no worry that they were exposed to smoke-related dangers. Notre Dame beekeeper Nicolas Geant said it was a ""huge relief"" and a ""miracle"" to discover the bees were alive. ""I was incredibly sad about Notre Dame,"" he said. ""But to hear there is life when it comes to the bees, that's just wonderful. I was overjoyed."" Raise a glass to...

He's the oldest member of the gym, so on his 98th birthday, the staff threw him a party complete with decorations, a giant card and some vanilla bean cupcakes -- Lawrence's favorite. After the celebration, Lawrence thanked everyone and then proceeded to crush his customary 90-minute workout. What, you think getting to 98 is easy?! A bright idea How do you explore the rich flora and fauna that grows in remote, hard-to-reach places such as Hawaii's steep cliff sides and small islands? By drone, of course! Researchers sent a drone into an inaccessible part of Kauai's Kalalau Valley and ended up finding a rare type of flowering plant that was previously thought to be extinct . The little yellow flower, a relative of hibiscus, was growing on a treacherous vertical cliff, so humans probably never could have found it on their own. Scientists hope drone projects like this will continue to produce enticing glimpses into nature's most confounding nooks and crannies. You gotta see this Go ahead, take a guess. Is this a tiny underwater weather balloon? A crab parasailing on the ocean floor? It's actually a new type of jellyfish that was recently discovered in the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean . The researchers who discovered it described it as an ""extraordinary gelatinous animal"" that ""does not resemble anything seen before."" Which is high praise for a jellyfish, but a withering insult for literally anyone else. Wanna get away?

Arizona explosion: 4 firefighters injured in blast at an electric company,edition.cnn.com,Hollie Silverman,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/arizona-firefighters-explosion/index.html,"(CNN) Four firefighters were injured in an explosion while responding to a call for hazardous materials at an electric company in Arizona on Friday night, authorities said.
An additional four others were transported for evaluation following the blast at the Arizona Public Service Electric Company in Surprise, said Fire Medical Department Battalion Chief Julie Moore. There's no danger to the public or the environment, Moore told CNN affiliate KPHO/KTVK. In a statement, a spokesperson from the electric company said they had an equipment failure at their storage facility. The cause of the failure is still under investigation, it said. The four injured firefighters are from Peoria Fire and were hurt when an explosion hit as they entered the facility, according to Fire Capt. Ken Wier. Read More The force of the explosion was enough to knock the helmets and face masks off the injured firefighters, he said. One firefighter is in critical condition after being knocked unconscious in the explosion. Two other firefighters are in serious condition -- one with acid burns to their leg and another one suffering from facial trauma. A fourth firefighter suffered minor injuries, Wier said."
Lyra McKee killing: Two teenagers arrested in connection with murder,edition.cnn.com,"Nic Robertson and Peter Taggart, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/uk/lyra-mckee-two-men-arrested-gbr-intl/index.html,"Londonderry/Derry, Northern Ireland (CNN) Northern Ireland police have arrested two teenagers in connection with the murder of 29-year-old investigative journalist Lyra McKee, authorities said Saturday.
The men, aged 18 and 19, were arrested under the terrorism act, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) tweeted. They have been taken to a police station in central Belfast. Police are investigating whether they acted with others. McKee, a prominent freelance journalist who wrote for publications including The Atlantic and Buzzfeed News, was killed in the Creggan area of Londonderry, also known as Derry, on Thursday night in what police described as a ""terrorist incident."" Police said the shooting was carried out by dissident republicans, namely the New IRA. Read More ""I believe both of those [arrested suspects] are members of the new IRA and I believe both were involved in the attack on Lyra,"" Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said at a press conference Saturday as he appealed for eye witnesses to come forward. ""Lyra was killed by shots that were fired indiscriminately,"" he said. ""The gunman showed no thought for who may have been killed or injured when he fired these shots. ""I know there will be some people who know what happened but are scared to come forward. I want to reassure you that we will work with you sensitively."" The PSNI released CCTV footage of the shooting in the hope that members of the public would provide information to assist the investigation into McKee's murder.

— PSNI DC&S District (@PSNIDCSDistrict) April 19, 2019 The footage apparently captures McKee's final moments at around 10 p.m. local time (5p ET) on Thursday, when she stood among a crowd and raised her phone in the air to capture the rioting taking place in front of her. McKee was standing close to a police vehicle when she was wounded by the shots fired by a single gunman. She died soon after from her injuries, assistant chief constable Mark Hamilton told reporters Friday. ""I cannot stress enough how important it is that people who were in the area last night and who recorded video and took photos share what they have with us,"" Murphy said in a statement on Friday. In 2016, Lyra McKee was named as one of Forbes Magazine's 30 under 30. ""People saw the gunman and people saw those who goaded young people out onto the streets, people know who they are. The answers to what happened last night lie within the community. I am asking people to do the right thing for Lyra McKee, for her family and for the city... help us stop this madness."" 'Single barbaric act' McKee, who was born in Belfast, is the first journalist to be killed in the United Kingdom since 2001, according to nonprofit organization the Committee to Protect Journalists. During a vigil on Friday, her partner, Sara Canning, said McKee's ""amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act."" ""Victims and LGBTQIA community are left without a tireless advocate and activist and it has left me without the love of my life, the woman I was planning to grow old with,"" she added. My friend Lyra McKee lost her life seeking the truth ""This cannot stand. Lyra's death must not be in vain because her life was a shining light in everyone else's life and her legacy will live on and the life that she has left behind."" In a rare joint appearance Friday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster and Irish republican Sinn Fein party leader Mary Lou McDonald condemned the killing. Thursday night's violence came ahead of Easter weekend, during which some republicans mark the anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, considered one of the most important events in the struggle for Irish independence from Britain. Trouble flared when police entered the Creggan area in Londonderry to carry out searches among dissident republicans who were storing firearms and explosives for a number of planned attacks over Easter weekend, police said in a statement. As the searches began, a crowd gathered and ""upwards of 50 petrol bombs were thrown at officers,"" the statement said. Two vehicles were hijacked and set on fire, it added. Flowers and tributes are left near the spot where Lyra McKee was shot on Thursday night. A recent spate of unrest in Northern Ireland has raised fears that sectarian violence might be revived amid ongoing concerns over the effects of Brexit. In January, a car bomb was detonated in Londonderry in a suspected attack by the New IRA. Many fear that Britain's departure from the European Union will mean the reintroduction of border posts on the frontier between Northern Ireland, part of the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, a European Union member. Border infrastructure was often targeted by Irish republican paramilitaries during the ""Troubles,"" the decades-long sectarian conflict in which more than 3,500 people died."
"Ukraine election: The TV series ""Servant of the People"" tells us lots about Ukraine -- and its presidential race",edition.cnn.com,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/europe/ukraine-election-tv-show-intl/index.html,"Moscow (CNN) ""Servant of the People"" is a television series about a fictional Ukraine, but its plot mirrors reality. It tells the tale of an impoverished schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president after a profanity-laced anti-corruption rant goes viral.
And the show's star, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, now stands a real chance of becoming Ukraine's next president. So what does ""Servant of the People"" tell us about Zelensky? Zelensky recently bested 38 other candidates in a national election -- and will face incumbent President Petro Poroshenko in a runoff vote on April 21 -- but he is still something of a political blank slate. That's provoked intense speculation about what kind of president he might make. After all, the winner of the runoff must confront immense challenges. Ukraine is engaged in a proxy war with Russia in the eastern Donbas region, its economy is struggling and many Ukrainians have left the country to seek livelihoods elsewhere. Read More ""Servant of the People"" is fiction, so it's perhaps not the right place to seek concrete answers to the kind of policies Zelensky might pursue if he wins office. But taken at face value, the series still tells us much about Ukraine today, and the issues that most concern Ukrainian voters. Here are some of the themes it touches on: The influence of oligarchs The opening scene of season one, episode one , features sinister characters looking out over Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti, or Independence Square. ""We waste millions to ensure that our candidates appear (on) the political scene and then we pay twice as much to destroy their competitors,"" one says. Those actors are playing caricatures of post-Soviet oligarchs, the powerful, politically connected individuals who have seized the commanding heights of the economy in countries like Ukraine. The intersection between crime and politics is a persistent theme of ""Servant of the People,"" and it's not surprising that many Ukrainian presidential candidates -- not just Zelensky, but also Poroshenko -- ran on a promise to get rid of corruption. Cleaning house in Ukraine is easier said than done, however. The country still ranks 120 out of 180 on Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index , and Ukrainians -- like Zelensky's character -- routinely complain that the economic game is rigged in favor of a small group of elites. Zelensky at a shoot for ""Servant of the People"" in Kiev in March. Ukraine's place in the world If there is any messaging in ""Servant of the People,"" it's what could be described, in shorthand, as a vision of Ukraine striving to be a ""normal"" European country: a prosperous, democratic, functioning state that is free of systemic corruption. The first episode in series three features a flash-forward to 2049, where Kiev has a futuristic skyline with wind turbines. A modern schoolroom has a history class and students are using tablets. The teacher asks the students to describe their standard of living. They answer: ""Normal, not bad."" The history teacher says Ukraine is a member of the G20, a world leader in economic growth and has paid off its debts. ""That's normal for you,"" he said. ""But 20 years ago in our country, it was normal for a teacher to be unable to pay for a kommunalka (a communal apartment) on their salary."" The instructor then laughs: ""You don't even know what that is."" Relations with the EU Ukraine's Maidan revolution -- the street demonstrations in 2014 that led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych -- began after he made a decision to ditch an association agreement with the European Union and sign an agreement instead with Russia. In 2017, Ukraine saw the introduction of visa-free travel to the EU, a scheme that allows Ukrainians to enter the so-called Schengen area without a visa for up to 90 days. A scene in season two, episode four , features a talk show where a correspondent is broadcasting live from Brussels with news on whether Ukrainians will be granted visa-free travel. The signal cuts out, and the television host says, ""we'll find the decision on whether there will be visa-free travel after this commercial break."" Language matters Some observers have made much of Zelensky's choice of language. His character primarily speaks Russian, and many members of the cast have their lines in Russian. Ukrainian is the language of official and public life, and police officers, court officials, and television announcers in the TV series often speak Ukrainian. Does that make Zelensky more ""pro-Russian"" than his rival? After all, Poroshenko has made defense of the Ukrainian language one of the cornerstones of his campaign, with the slogan Armiya, Mova, Vira (meaning ""army, language, faith""). And the Russian government has cast language as one driver of the conflict in Ukraine's east, arguing that efforts to give primacy to Ukrainian have amounted to a form of discrimination and extreme nationalism. Polls suggest Zelensky is the favorite to beat incumbent president Petro Poroshenko in Sunday's vote. At many points in history, the Ukrainian language has been suppressed by imperial Russian and Soviet rulers (Ukrainian had official status in the USSR as a local language, but authorities also pursued a de facto policy of Russification). Now the Russian government claims Kiev is pursuing an aggressive policy of Ukrainization, through a controversial 2017 law making Ukrainian the required language of study in state schools from the fifth grade on. A moratorium on Russian-language media in western Ukraine, where Ukrainian is the majority language, has also drawn international criticism. ""Servant of the People"" reflects a complex reality, where language is not the only foundation of identity and patriotism in an independent, multi-ethnic, post-Soviet Ukraine. Many of the soldiers fighting on the front lines against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas are Russian speakers. One of the catalysts for the Maidan protests was Mustafa Nayyem, an activist and journalist of Afghan descent who called on Ukrainians to come to the Maidan to protest Yanukovych in a Russian-language tweet . The media's role It's worth remembering that ""Servant of the People"" is, primarily, a comedy. It features cameos by legendary drag queen Verka Serduchka , has a fair share of slapstick, and even a ribald joke about Russian President Vladimir Putin (a double entendre about him wearing a Hublot watch, which sounds similar to a oft-used Ukrainian insult about the Kremlin leader). But it's also clear that the series has served as a magnificent campaign advertisement for Zelensky. And that has brought the show in for criticism, particularly from Poroshenko. In recent statements on Twitter, the incumbent president has blasted 1+1, the TV channel that broadcasts ""Servant of the People,"" and its owner, tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky. ""My opponents have been pouring shameful lies on me over the past few weeks,"" Poroshenko said on Twitter . ""The main tool of spreading lies during the last months, unfortunately, was 1+1."" The election drama in Ukraine will be televised. Zelensky and Poroshenko squared off Friday in a stadium debate, with the two contenders trading one-liners and barbs. Ukraine's politics have even fascinated viewers in Russia, where many have followed the spectacle of a genuinely competitive election. ""I am not a politician, I am not a politician at all,"" Zelensky said over the shouts of Poroshenko's supporters. ""I am just a human being, an ordinary human being, who has come to break this system."""
Columbine anniversary: Former principal Frank DeAngelis is still learning how to move on - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/columbine-shooting-anniversary-principal-frank-deangelis-20-years/index.html,"Arvada, Colorado (CNN) Frank DeAngelis stood in his home office, his hair graying over his ears, and pointed to each frame on the wall, telling the story behind the mementos he's collected over the last two decades.
There are letters from President Bill Clinton, another from President Barack Obama and one from Vice President Joe Biden. There's a photograph of Frank with Clinton, another of him with Hillary Clinton, and one of him beside Celine Dion. The torch holder he carried for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City is mounted near a matching newspaper clipping. And there's an autographed photo of baseball great Derek Jeter, wishing Frank well in the run-up to his retirement in 2014 as the principal of Columbine High School. ""It's a little bit of history,"" Frank said. Even still, 20 years after two students stormed the Colorado campus, killing 12 students and one teacher, Frank DeAngelis is inextricably linked to Columbine -- and to the event that has come to mark a horrific and ongoing chapter in America's saga of school massacres. Read More At first, he was bound by a promise to stay at the helm until every student who'd been at the school that unimaginable morning had graduated. Then, he expanded that vow, remaining until every local child who'd been in class that day, down to preschoolers, had earned a diploma. Framed memorabilia are displayed on Frank DeAngelis' office walls at his home. Since stepping away from the principal's office, he has continued his commitment to collective recovery -- and expanded his flock far beyond Columbine High School. Five years after retiring, the 64-year-old is as busy as ever, traveling the country to shepherd principals and communities that have fallen victim to the scourge of school shootings. It's the latest iteration of an evolving role, however unwelcome, he has pioneered since April 20, 1999. ""Columbine offers hope,"" Frank told CNN. ""And that's what I hope, 20 years later, that we're doing, that we're reaching out to other people -- the Parklands, the Santa Fes, the Sandy Hooks, the Virginia Techs."" ""I feel I was chosen to do that."" But he's also given so much of himself to Columbine, several people close to him said. And with the 20th anniversary of the shooting and the publication of a new memoir, ""They Call Me 'Mr. De,'"" Frank's wife, Diane DeAngelis, hopes he soon considers slowing down. ""It always comes to a head right before the anniversary,"" she said. ""And I just hope that with the 20th, that maybe this is the last anniversary that is as big as it is and that we can move on a bit."" A devoted educator faces the unthinkable When Frank was 13, he got a job in a pizzeria. In high school, he delivered newspapers. Frank's parents taught hard work and dedication, and when he got sick, he hardly ever missed work. Diane, who dated Frank in high school, said he was nice but very serious. He didn't have a sense of humor. The couple spent all their time together, and while still in high school, Frank gave her a promise ring and said he wanted to get married. Diane didn't want that, she said, so they broke up. ""I had no spontaneity ... I was so serious,"" Frank admitted. ""I was 15 or 16 going on 30, and I had to plan my whole life out."" Even so, Frank was unsure what he wanted to study in college, his brother said. But they had both played sports growing up, so when Frank told his brother he'd become an educator, Anthony DeAngelis assumed it was for the sake of athletics. ""I thought, 'He's probably going to be pretty good at this,'"" Anthony said. As with all things, Frank dove in deep. Early in his career, Frank's principal once forced him to fork over his keys to the school for a weekend. ""He said, 'I do not want to see you around this school. Frank, you need to get away,'"" he remembered. Lights streak as a truck drives by Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in this long-exposure photograph. Frank displayed that same commitment to each of his students and the baseball players he coached, said Tom Tonelli, one of Frank's former pupils and a Columbine High School graduate who went on to teach at the school. ""It was always: Be a good student, be a good athlete, but above all else, be a good person,"" said Tonelli of Frank's expectations. 20 years after that day at Columbine High School, I'm still asking: 'Am I safe?' Still today, when Frank's brother hands over his credit card at restaurants, servers often ask if he's related to Frank, Anthony said. A waitress last year told him Frank had been her principal. ""And she goes, 'You could talk to any of my friends. What we appreciated was how he treated us,'"" Anthony recalled. That sentiment holds whether before or after the shooting, said Tonelli, who was on staff at Columbine the day gunfire erupted. ""Do I think the shooting transformed him? Absolutely,"" the teacher said. ""But to say somehow he became a totally different type of person, I don't think so. The character he exhibited in the wake of the tragedy is just a reflection of who he was before it happened."" When 'the world didn't believe in us,' he did Columbine High School serves a middle- and upper-middle-class community in Littleton, Colorado, where the mountains in the west rise into a wide open sky. Before the massacre, it was an ""ideal"" community, Frank said, with a lot of parental support and where he ""could count on my two hands the number of fistfights we had in 20 years."" After the shooting, Frank ""felt this enormous burden to go rebuild that community,"" he said. That's when he made the promise to stay at Columbine until the Class of 2002 had graduated. Other staff members made the same commitment, he said. But in 2001, Frank felt he hadn't accomplished what he'd set out to do. The Columbine Memorial in Littleton was dedicated and opened to the public on September 21, 2007. ""There were so many people deeply impacted, even the kids in elementary school,"" he said. ""So, I made a promise that I wanted to be there until that last class graduated, which would be 2012."" Two years after that, he finally left.

Principal: I want Columbine to mean hope (2014) 03:17 Frank's promise to stay gave him ""so much credibility in the community,"" Tonelli said. The faculty and staff, along with the students and the whole community, looked to him as a leader, as someone who was ""persevering for a cause greater than himself."" The perception stuck, even in the face of criticism that the school's administrators and faculty had fostered a student culture ""where something like this could happen,"" Tonelli said, referring to the shooting and calling the claim ""unjust."" The notion ""that there were certain segments of the population we didn't care about was so untrue,"" the teacher said. Through it all, Frank's ""leadership meant everything,"" he said. ""He was the biggest believer in our kids and in their teachers and in our community at a time when we felt like the rest of the world didn't believe in us anymore."" A leader battles darkness at home But as he worked to help Columbine recover, Frank was also an ordinary survivor. At home, his heroic veneer vanished, giving way to the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I tried to do everything to protect what I call the Columbine family,"" Frank recalled. ""But when I would come home, I just wanted to be left alone."" He didn't want to talk with his first wife and two stepchildren about what happened; they just didn't understand the aftermath, he said. ""It cost me my marriage,"" he said. ""My wife was saying, 'You're not the same person I married. You've changed.' And I did. I felt so much guilt."" Religious icons are displayed in Frank DeAngelis' home office. His trauma manifested in other ways, too. Months after the shooting, Frank and his brother went to a Colorado Rockies game. When fireworks lit up the sky, Anthony said, ""My brother nearly took cover."" Later, Frank told Anthony the celebratory display took him right back to the attack. More shell shock set in when Frank returned to Columbine the summer after the shooting to prepare for the new academic year. Bangs and rumbles echoed as construction crews repaired damage to the building. ""I would have to go back to my office,"" he said, ""and I would cry."" Hope thrives in 'tough love' Ahead of the massacre's third anniversary, as he was pushed by divorce proceedings to the edge of emotional and financial ""ruin,"" Frank began pecking away at the mountain of unopened letters he'd gotten in its wake. Among the first he picked up was from his high school sweetheart, Diane. They began talking regularly by phone, often late into the night, but agreed not to see each other until Frank's marriage was dissolved. ""There was still a spark,"" Diane said, and she could tell Frank had grown up. ""I could see that he had a sense of humor,"" she laughed, but also that his core traits hadn't changed. ""Some of the good things that brought us together were there from the beginning."" But as their relationship developed, Frank continued to wrestle with his trauma. As with many Columbine survivors, it always got harder in the advent of April, a month in which Frank has gotten into six car wrecks and when his attention always jerks back to the terror. Diane and Frank DeAngelis were high school sweethearts who lost touch, then married in 2013. He leaned on counseling and his Catholic faith, but he was living alone in a nearly vacant house, with only a few pictures and a single bed left after most everything else was sold off. ""Twenty years of my life was in shambles,"" he said. ""I was struggling,"" and he eventually started to drink. Diane, whose father was a recovered alcoholic, quickly caught on. Frank started hanging up the phone around 4 in the afternoon, she said, and telling her they would talk the next day. ""Immediately, I knew,"" she said. ""I thought, I don't know if I'm going to have to end this, because I can't go down that path again."" Diane's father died that April; Frank attended the visitation, and they began seeing each other. Soon, Diane caught him drinking. ""I can't do this,"" she told him. ""It was justifiable,"" Frank said, looking back. ""That was what I needed, that tough love ... I was so fortunate she came back into my life. And I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. It was a wake-up call."" Leading the 'Club Nobody Wanted to Join' When he talks to others who have lived through school shootings, Frank mentions the risk of using alcohol or drugs to cope, and he emphasizes the importance of finding positive sources of support. It's just one of many pieces of advice he gives to members of what he calls in his book, ""A Club Nobody Wanted to Join."" Columbine wasn't the first school shooting, and it obviously wasn't the last. But every time another mass murder happens at a school, Frank said, his phone begins to ring with calls from reporters seeking insight from one of the nation's most seasoned campus attack veterans. ""Not that I'm an expert,"" he said, ""but I lived through it."" He was called on as recently as this week to address the news media when a Florida teenager -- who authorities said was ""infatuated"" with the Columbine massacre -- traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun, prompting the shutdown of Denver-area schools, including Columbine. Quotes are inscribed at the Columbine Memorial. Frank also reaches out to school leaders thrust into the role he knows so well. Last year, he said he connected after deadly shootings with administrators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as well as Santa Fe High School in Texas and Marshall County High School in Kentucky . Getting that call carries a lot of weight, said Andy Fetchik, the former principal of Chardon High School in Ohio, where three students were killed in a shooting in February 2012. What school threats and lockdowns are doing to a generation of children The first thing Frank said was, ""We are now members of the same fraternity that neither one of us pledged,"" Fetchik told CNN. ""And the second thing he asked me to do was to write down his cell phone number."" Months later, as Fetchik prepared to start the next school year, he gave Frank a call, he said. ""There was a peace of mind in speaking with someone that went through it,"" Fetchik said, noting that Frank validated the steps he'd taken to help his Ohio school community heal. Several years later, Frank visited Chardon High School to talk with faculty members about the recovery process. ""One of the things I struggled with in the recovery was addressing the needs of staff. We didn't always know what they needed,"" Fetchik said. ""Frank was that voice of somebody who's been there, who said, 'Where you're at is OK. Mental health recovery is not something you could control. There's no calendar.'"" 'Columbine is not going to define me' Today, Frank and Fetchik are members of the Principal Recovery Network , a new group of 17 current and former school administrators who have lived through school shootings and their aftermath. Unlike activists who have sought to change gun laws following campus attacks, these officials simply aim to offer themselves and their combined experience as a resource. 20 years on, Columbine survivors tell Parkland students: 'We're sorry we couldn't stop it.' It falls in line with the work Frank has undertaken since he retired. Last year, he gave about 50 presentations in the United States and Canada about the recovery process. He also serves on the boards of school safety and other organizations, he said, knowing his name and connection to Columbine carry weight. But he's tired, Diane said, and she's made it clear she hopes he slows down after the 20th anniversary of the event that has served as the pivot point for his life's work. ""He's doing a lot of good out there, and he has a lot to bring to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But I worry about his health, because it hasn't been great. I see it in his face, how exhausted he is."" Frank DeAngelis stands outside his home. For a man who's been working since he was a kid, ""I can't imagine myself being completely retired,"" Frank said. And he knows he'll always want to help suffering communities. But he admits he needs to lighten his load. ""I'm looking at the 20-year remembrance as, I need to reevaluate,"" he said. ""I need to be able to give myself permission to relax. I need to give myself permission."" When he retired, Frank said, Diane told him she worried he would fall into a depression because he would no longer be associated with Columbine. Around that time, he began worrying about his own health and suffered with anxiety. But the doctor told him he was fine. Then, he visited another expert who pinpointed the problem. ""You have been a part of Columbine for 35 years,"" Frank's therapist told him, he recalled. ""And you feel that Columbine is Frank DeAngelis."" That perspective set the stage for a new outlook, Frank said. It's one he says he wants to embrace, though it may require as much determination as any hurdle he's conquered yet. ""He made me realize that Columbine is not going to define me. And that helped a lot,"" the former principal said. ""I've just got to get it in my mind that it's OK."""
Police hope this mystery letter can solve the murder of a teen 45 years ago in Texas - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/carla-walker-cold-case-letter-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Police are hoping an anonymous letter can help solve the 45-year-old cold case murder of a teenage girl in Texas.
In 1974, Carla Walker was a 17-year-old junior in the Fort Worth suburb of Benbrook when she and her high school sweetheart, Rodney McCoy, were attacked in his car in a parking lot. Walker was abducted from the car, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . McCoy then went to her parents' home, blood flowing from his head, screaming ""They've got her, they've got her,"" the Walker family told the paper. Three days later, her body was found dumped near a lake. That same year, Fort Worth police said, someone sent a letter to a detective indicating they might know who was responsible for her murder. The Fort Worth Police Department posted that letter on social media Friday and urged anyone with information to come forward. Read More ""(Redacted) Kill Carla Walker in Benbrook ... P.S. It is hard to say but it is true,"" the letter said. ""Sign 10100"" was written both before and after the postscript. The detective working on the case received the letter, but died before sharing it, according to the paper. It wasn't released until Friday, more than four decades after it was sent. Police said they believe the author of the letter could be a witness. ""It is the hope of the Fort Worth Police Department that this person will provide valuable information that may bring peace and closure to Carla's family after 45 long years."" Anyone who knows anything about the letter is encouraged to call (817) 392-4307."

The attackers raided a family party in the city of Minatitlán in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Six men, five women and a child were killed and four others were wounded, the state's public security department said. Authorities said the suspects were looking for a person known as ""El Beky"" when shooting ensued, according to preliminary reports obtained by the state police. He is believed to be the owner of a bar located in Minatitlán. But the motive behind the mass shooting was not immediately known. ""Federal and state forces have deployed a strong search and capture operation of those responsible for the events,"" Gutiérrez Maldonado, secretary of public security in Veracruz state, tweeted Saturday. Read More State authorities held an emergency meeting ""to address the regrettable and condemnable events,"" Veracruz state Gov. Cuitláhuac García tweeted. Minatitlan police officers guard the party hall where 13 people were killed Friday. Minatitlán Mayor Nicolás Reyes Álvarez described the attack as a ""tragedy that tears the soul"" and an incident that he ""deeply regrets."" He called state and federal officials to investigate the shooting ""so they would not go unpunished in any way."" Friday's mass shooting in Minatitlán comes just a couple of days before President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is scheduled to travel to the state of Veracruz for an official visit. Reyes Álvarez said he plans to ask López Obrador to increase security forces and, if possible, assign the Mexican National Guard to patrol the city. Minatitlán has also canceled a public weekend-long event to commemorate Holy Week and Easter. Minatitlán is about 315 miles (507 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City. The shooting took place near one of the six oil refineries run by Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the country's state-owned oil company."
ADHD treatment: FDA OKs first medical device to treat ADHD in children - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Sandee LaMotte, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/health/adhd-treatment-etns-device-fda-bn/index.html,"(CNN) The first medical device to treat childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, was OK'd Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration. Designated for children ages 7 to 12 who are not currently on medication for the disorder, the device delivers a low-level electrical pulse to the parts of the brain responsible for ADHD symptoms.
Young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis risk compared to other stimulants, study says ""This new device offers a safe, non-drug option for treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients through the use of mild nerve stimulation, a first of its kind,"" Carlos Peña, director of the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. Called the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation System, eTNS,and marketed by NeuroSigma, the treatment is only available by prescription and must be monitored by a caregiver. The pocket-sized device is connected by wire to a small adhesive patch placed on the child's forehead above the eyebrows. Designed to be used at home while sleeping, it delivers a ""tingling"" electrical stimulation to branches of the cranial nerve that delivers sensations from the face to the brain. In some states, this birth month is linked to higher rates of ADHD diagnosis, study says A clinical trial of 62 children showed that the eTNS increases activity in the regions of the brain that regulate attention, emotion and behavior, all key components of ADHD. Read More Compared to a placebo, children using the device had statistically significant improvement in their ADHD symptoms, the FDA said, although it could take up to four weeks to see improvement. Authors of the clinical trial called for additional research to examine if the response to treatment will last over time, and its potential impact on brain development with prolonged use. Stephen Hinshaw , a professor of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, has led a large research study of ADHD since 1992. He said the pro of the device is that it ""appears to be safe, and the initial study is thoughtful and promising."" However, the FDA's sign-off was based on just the one ""single, small, short-term trial -- which did not compare eTNS to established treatments."" The trial, he said, was bound to get hopes up, but ""far more research is needed to demonstrate ultimate efficacy."" According to the NeuroSigma website , the device is not currently covered by insurance and could cost just over $1,000 for the starter kit. No serious side were reported during the clinical trial, the FDA said, but common side effects could include fatigue, sleepiness or trouble sleeping, teeth clenching, headache and an increase in appetite. 10% of US children diagnosed with ADHD, study finds The device should not be worn by children under the age of 7, or any child on an insulin pump, pacemaker or implanted neurostimulator. It should also not be used near a cell phone, the FDA said, because the phone's low levels of electromagnetic energy may interrupt the therapy.
ADHD is among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children with ADHD might have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors or be overly active. Doctors typically recommend a few treatment options for children: medication, behavior modification or both. Some commonly prescribed medications are amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, known as Adderall; methylphenidate, known as Concerta or Ritalin; and lisdexamfetamine, known as Vyvanse. While not familiar with the specifics of the eTNS device, Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu said she welcomes ADHD treatment options that don't involve medication. ""I would encourage families to talk with their pediatrician or pediatric neurologist to see if this system might be a good option for their child,"" Shu said.
The device was previously approved for the treatment of epilepsy and depression in Europe and Canada. Studies at UCLA found the stimulation decreased seizure activity by inhibiting overactive neurons in one section of the brain, while stimulating blood flow in the areas that control mood, attention and executive function. The device has also been investigated as a possible treatment for traumatic brain injury in veterans."

The world's leading dog DNA test is on sale,www.cnn.com,,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/cnn-underscored/best-dog-ancestry-kit/index.html," Dog DNA kits exist and they can help pinpoint what breeds your pup really is Hanna Williams, CNN Underscored Updated Fri April 19, 2019
We talk a lot about DNA kits -- which one is right for you , how they can help you stay healthy , and even how they can give you personalized diet tips .
But have you ever considered DNA testing your dog?
Wisdom Panel 3.0 Dog DNA Test Kit ($79.99; amazon.com )
Wisdom Panel is billed as the world's leading canine DNA test. With thousands of near perfect reviews on Amazon, it's no surprise this kit is growing in popularity. How do you use it?
If you've ever taken a DNA test yourself, you'll find the whole process pretty similar. Use one of the provided swabs to collect skin cells from the inside of your pup's cheek, activate the kit online, and mail in your sample. To ensure accuracy, be sure your dog does not eat anything or share a water dish with other dogs an hour before you do the test.
Once the lab receives your sample, DNA is extracted and examined. The results are then sent to a computer, where a complex algorithm evaluates all of the possible family trees in the last three generations of your furry friend. From there, the algorithm taps into an expansive breed database in order to determine which breeds are the top match. What kind of results can you expect?
Approximately two to three weeks after submitting your sample, you'll receive the results online. A breed percentage chart will display the breeds and/or breed groups found in your dog's family tree. Each breed or breed group comes with a description of traits, both physical and behavioral, that will help you work with your vet to create the ideal nutrition, training, and health care plan for your dog. The test even screens pets for multidrug sensitivity , which can protect them from severe adverse reactions to common drugs administered by veterinarians. Is it accurate?
Wisdom Panel prides itself on being as accurate as possible for a cheek swab DNA test. The company says in order to provide the highest level of accuracy, it focuses on three factors:
• Genetic markers are places of variation along DNA and can help determine what makes each breed unique. Wisdom Panel has carefully tested over 19 million genetic markers and genotyped over 13,000 dogs, finally settling on the use of 1,800 genetic markers for testing.
• An extensive database is used to compare your dog's DNA to that of other dogs. A large amount of data equals more accurate results, and Wisdom Panel 3.0 covers over 250 breeds -- the most of any canine DNA test on the market, according to the company.
• All Wisdom Panel tests are run in a USDA-accredited laboratory and are repeatedly reviewed by third-party canine specialists.

"Marijuana can prevent people from obtaining citizenship, Trump administration says - CNN",us.cnn.com,Geneva Sands,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/marijuana-ties-us-citizenship/index.html,"(CNN) Marijuana possession, production and distribution, even in states where it is legal, will remain a barrier in many cases to immigrants hoping to gain US citizenship, the federal government said.
Violation of controlled substance laws, including marijuana, ""remains a conditional bar to establishing good moral character for naturalization,"" USCIS said in a policy alert issued Friday. ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance regardless of any actions to decriminalize its possession, use, or sale at the state and local level,"" a USCIS spokesperson said in a statement. ""Federal law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose, even in places where state or local law does."" ""It's been something that we have been struggling with in Colorado for a while now,"" said Jeff Joseph, an immigration attorney in Denver, where marijuana use is legal. ""There's a number of activities that can be perfectly legal in Colorado that people don't realize constitute as an immigration violation."" Earlier this month, Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock sent a letter to US Attorney General William Barr asking for Department of Justice guidance on policies that are ""negatively impacting"" the legal immigration status for people who work in Colorado's cannabis industry. Read More ""Denver understands the need for federal laws and regulations regarding citizenship and immigration, but we are seeing the heartbreaking effects that those federal laws and regulations are having on our residents,"" Hancock said in a statement. Two Denver immigrants who had lived in the US for more than 20 years were told by USCIS that they were ineligible for naturalization because of their employment in the cannabis industry, the mayor said. One of the immigrants, Oswaldo Barrientos, 30, told CNN in a statement that he thought he ""was a shoe-in for citizenship."" ""I work hard in an industry that offers opportunity and that's unquestionably legal within the state. For the government to deny my citizenship application because I'm a bad person is devastating,"" Barrientos said. Barrientos' attorney, Aaron Elinoff, said this policy announcement is a move by the Trump administration to ""quietly and systematically"" target the immigrant population. Prior to this guidance, immigration field offices around the US handled marijuana in different ways, according to Joseph. ""This now seems to instruct [immigration] officers to probe."" Joseph said he prefers the transparency of the new guidance, but the unfortunate part is that ""people are doing things that are perfectly legal under state law, but will make them permanently ineligible for a green card."" According to USCIS, as long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law, the agency won't grant special considerations to individuals whose marijuana activities may be decriminalized under state or local law. ""Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance regardless of any actions to decriminalize its possession, use, or sale at the state and local level,"" a USCIS spokesperson said in a statement. ""Federal law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose, even in places where state or local law does."" David Leopold, counsel to DHS Watch and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, criticized the policy guidance, calling it ""nonsensical"" at a time when states continue to liberalize their marijuana laws. There have been cases where people have used medical marijuana for a serious injury, left the US, and upon return were challenged by immigration authorities, as if it had been illicit use, Leopold said. As states legalize, ""noncitizens can really find themselves in a bind,"" he said. ""USCIS doesn't have to make it worse. You have a situation where you have an obvious conflict between state and federal law."""

These are baby kākāpōs, the fattest parrots in the world. They're native to New Zealand and up until recently there were only 147 of them in existence. It turns out, when you only mate once every couple of years and constantly face predators and environmental threats, building a big family is a bit of a challenge. However, this year, the kākāpōs had a record-setting mating season ! At least 75 hatched chicks are now thriving, thanks in no small part to a diligent nationwide conservation effort. This single bumper crop of kākāpōs could mean an even bigger comeback a few years down the road, so you can bet New Zealand researchers are thrilled. Why wouldn't they be? These little land angels should be protected at all costs. A true champion It's hard to put Valentino Dixon's s incredible journey into just a few lines, but we'll try: In 1991, Dixon was put in prison for a murder he didn't commit, and to cope, he took up drawing. He got so good that the warden of his prison asked him to draw the 12th hole of the Augusta National golf course, where the Masters is held. The result was stunning, and Dixon kept drawing golf course scenes. In September 2018, thanks to the efforts of his daughter, some law students and the editorial director of Golf Digest, Dixon was finally exonerated. Earlier this month, Dixon attended the Masters and met Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus and other golfing greats, and even presented Nicklaus with a drawing of the 13th hole he completed in prison.

The hives are supported with wood, so there was concern they could have caught on fire -- not to mention that at high temperatures, the wax in the hives could have melted and killed the bees. Luckily, the hives were fine, and since bees don't have lungs (fun fact!) there's no worry that they were exposed to smoke-related dangers. Notre Dame beekeeper Nicolas Geant said it was a ""huge relief"" and a ""miracle"" to discover the bees were alive. ""I was incredibly sad about Notre Dame,"" he said. ""But to hear there is life when it comes to the bees, that's just wonderful. I was overjoyed."" Raise a glass to... Fred Lawrence, a 98-year-old World War II veteran who still exercises at his local 24 Hour Fitness three times a week without fail (there he is on the right, keeping pace with one of his workout buddies). He's the oldest member of the gym, so on his 98th birthday, the staff threw him a party complete with decorations, a giant card and some vanilla bean cupcakes -- Lawrence's favorite. After the celebration, Lawrence thanked everyone and then proceeded to crush his customary 90-minute workout. What, you think getting to 98 is easy?! A bright idea How do you explore the rich flora and fauna that grows in remote, hard-to-reach places such as Hawaii's steep cliff sides and small islands? By drone, of course! Researchers sent a drone into an inaccessible part of Kauai's Kalalau Valley and ended up finding a rare type of flowering plant that was previously thought to be extinct . The little yellow flower, a relative of hibiscus, was growing on a treacherous vertical cliff, so humans probably never could have found it on their own. Scientists hope drone projects like this will continue to produce enticing glimpses into nature's most confounding nooks and crannies. You gotta see this Go ahead, take a guess. Is this a tiny underwater weather balloon? A crab parasailing on the ocean floor? It's actually a new type of jellyfish that was recently discovered in the deepest parts of the Indian Ocean . The researchers who discovered it described it as an ""extraordinary gelatinous animal"" that ""does not resemble anything seen before."" Which is high praise for a jellyfish, but a withering insult for literally anyone else. Wanna get away? We already know Costa Rica is a beautiful, verdant paradise, but did you know it also has sloths? Lots of them! The Sloth Sanctuary outside of Cahuita, Costa Rica, is home to 214 sloths of all ages and levels of laziness, which means it's basically heaven for animal lovers. The folks at CNN Travel got to check it out firsthand, and we are not seething with jealousy at all of the cute sloth photos . Not at ALL. Tell us something good Cahokia, Illinois Job interviews are stressful. Getting pulled over is stressful. Getting pulled over on your way to a job interview? Nightmare. When Cahokia Police Officer Roger Gemoules pulled over 22-year-old Ka'Shawn Baldwin while Baldwin was on his way to a job interview, Gemoules could see how much it meant to the young man to be on time for the big appointment. So instead of giving him a ticket, Gemoules gave him a ride . Hey, laws are laws for a reason. But sometimes, they need to be paired with a little compassion. (PS: Baldwin got the job!) Impact Your World Today marks the start of National Park Week, so get outside and support your local wonders!

2 Virginia police officers fired for alleged ties to white supremacist groups - CNN,us.cnn.com,Julia Jones,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/virginia-officers-white-supremacy/index.html,"(CNN) Two Virginia police officers were fired after allegations of involvement with white supremacist groups surfaced.
Virginia Division of Capitol Police announced on Wednesday that officer Robert Stamm was fired after a review of possible violations of state and division policies. Stamm had been on administrative leave since February 6. Capitol Police spokesperson Joe Macenka told CNN the investigation that ultimately led to Stamm's termination started after activist group Antifa Seven Hills shared screenshots of Stamm's social media posts to Twitter, tagging the Capitol Police's account. On February 5, Antifa Seven Hills wrote a blog post with pictures of Stamm showing tattoos and flags with symbols the activist group says are commonly associated with white supremacy. Virginia EMT who made racist remarks on a white supremacist podcast loses his job On his Facebook profile photo, Stamm has a stamp of the Asatru Folk Assembly, an organization the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies as ""perhaps this country's largest neo-Völkisch hate group."" The SPLC says neo-Völkisc ""adherents base their spirituality on the survival of those descended from white Europeans. ..."" Read More The Anti-Defamation League describes the group in similar terms, calling the Asatru Folk Assembly an ""extremist group"" and said the officer's ""ties to white supremacy are deeply troubling and raise serious concerns."" When asked whether his group was a white nationalist group, Stamm told CNN, ""I was discriminated against for my religion. My religion is not politics, it is faith. My constitutional rights were violated. Period."" The Asatru Folk Assembly's website says ""Asatru is an expression of the native, pre-Christian spirituality of Europe. More specifically, it is the religion by which the Ethnic European Folk have traditionally related to the Divine and to the world around them."" The Virginia Division of Capitol Police handles law enforcement on the capitol grounds and provides protection to state officials. 'White supremacists by default': How ordinary people made Charlottesville possible The second officer, Daniel Morley, worked for the Chesterfield County Police and was fired on Thursday, Police Chief Jeffrey Katz wrote on a Facebook post. Katz said Morley was investigated because he ""may have an affiliation with Identify Evropa -- an organization widely known for promoting white nationalism."" CNN's attempts to reach Morley for comment were unsuccessful. Antifa of the Seven Hills also wrote a blog post about Morley, alleging he plays an active role in the Identity Evropa discussion groups as a pledge coordinator. Chief Katz said in the Facebook post that ""Our community deserves to know the men and women of their police department respect and revere them -- whoever they may be."" Katz did not answer whether the Antifa blog post sparked the investigation into Morley, but wrote that ""online postings and activities attributed to this officer were reviewed, and once authenticated,"" Morley was put on leave and eventually terminated. A federal lawsuit filed in 2017 alleges that Richard Spencer, a white nationalist leader, said one of Identity Evropa's founders, Nathan Damigo, ""took the lead in organizing white supremacist participation among people from outside Charlottesville"" for the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. The organization was then rebranded as American Identity Movement in early March - and photos on the Antifa blog post show Morley waving an American flag behind the organization's banner. The SPLC calls the newly-coined movement a ""derivative"" of Identity Evropa."
Alabama ex-investigator pleads guilty to beating handcuffed man - CNN,us.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/alabama-officer-guilty-plea/index.html,"(CNN) A former Tallassee police investigator pleaded guilty to assaulting a handcuffed 24-year-old man after his arrest.
According to the guilty plea, Brandon Smirnoff, 27, was on duty in pursuit of the victim on a four-wheeler. Several officers had placed the man in handcuffs and before placing him into his vehicle, Smirnoff lifted him in the air and repeatedly slammed him to the ground. When putting him into the car, Smirnoff reportedly slammed the man's head into the side of the vehicle, the statement said. Smirnoff's attorney, Richard White, told CNN ""I think he's sorry for what he did and I think that's a sign by him pleading. He has come to the understanding that what he did was wrong."" White said the government gave them a fair offer and after talking to his family and praying about it, Smirnoff came to the decision to plead guilty -- which he says what not an easy decision. Read More Smirnoff told the judge that he ""went beyond what he should have done and what he was sworn to uphold,"" White said. ""It is especially important in a climate of distrust between law enforcement and the public, that officers act ethically and within the bounds of the law,"" said US Attorney Louis V. Franklin for the Middle District of Alabama. ""He violated this young man's constitutional rights and the trust placed in law enforcement officers to faithfully, ethically, and morally enforce the law. You can be sure that anytime an officer steps over the line and into criminal behavior, as this one did, my office will hold that individual accountable."" Smirnoff faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine."
Columbine anniversary: Former principal Frank DeAngelis is still learning how to move on - CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/columbine-shooting-anniversary-principal-frank-deangelis-20-years/index.html,"Arvada, Colorado (CNN) Frank DeAngelis stood in his home office, his hair graying over his ears, and pointed to each frame on the wall, telling the story behind the mementos he's collected over the last two decades.
There are letters from President Bill Clinton, another from President Barack Obama and one from Vice President Joe Biden. There's a photograph of Frank with Clinton, another of him with Hillary Clinton, and one of him beside Celine Dion. The torch holder he carried for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City is mounted near a matching newspaper clipping. And there's an autographed photo of baseball great Derek Jeter, wishing Frank well in the run-up to his retirement in 2014 as the principal of Columbine High School. ""It's a little bit of history,"" Frank said. Even still, 20 years after two students stormed the Colorado campus, killing 12 students and one teacher, Frank DeAngelis is inextricably linked to Columbine -- and to the event that has come to mark a horrific and ongoing chapter in America's saga of school massacres. Read More At first, he was bound by a promise to stay at the helm until every student who'd been at the school that unimaginable morning had graduated. Then, he expanded that vow, remaining until every local child who'd been in class that day, down to preschoolers, had earned a diploma. Framed memorabilia are displayed on Frank DeAngelis' office walls at his home. Since stepping away from the principal's office, he has continued his commitment to collective recovery -- and expanded his flock far beyond Columbine High School. Five years after retiring, the 64-year-old is as busy as ever, traveling the country to shepherd principals and communities that have fallen victim to the scourge of school shootings. It's the latest iteration of an evolving role, however unwelcome, he has pioneered since April 20, 1999. ""Columbine offers hope,"" Frank told CNN. ""And that's what I hope, 20 years later, that we're doing, that we're reaching out to other people -- the Parklands, the Santa Fes, the Sandy Hooks, the Virginia Techs."" ""I feel I was chosen to do that."" But he's also given so much of himself to Columbine, several people close to him said. And with the 20th anniversary of the shooting and the publication of a new memoir, ""They Call Me 'Mr. De,'"" Frank's wife, Diane DeAngelis, hopes he soon considers slowing down. ""It always comes to a head right before the anniversary,"" she said. ""And I just hope that with the 20th, that maybe this is the last anniversary that is as big as it is and that we can move on a bit."" A devoted educator faces the unthinkable When Frank was 13, he got a job in a pizzeria. In high school, he delivered newspapers. Frank's parents taught hard work and dedication, and when he got sick, he hardly ever missed work. Diane, who dated Frank in high school, said he was nice but very serious. He didn't have a sense of humor. The couple spent all their time together, and while still in high school, Frank gave her a promise ring and said he wanted to get married. Diane didn't want that, she said, so they broke up. ""I had no spontaneity ... I was so serious,"" Frank admitted. ""I was 15 or 16 going on 30, and I had to plan my whole life out."" Even so, Frank was unsure what he wanted to study in college, his brother said. But they had both played sports growing up, so when Frank told his brother he'd become an educator, Anthony DeAngelis assumed it was for the sake of athletics. ""I thought, 'He's probably going to be pretty good at this,'"" Anthony said. As with all things, Frank dove in deep. Early in his career, Frank's principal once forced him to fork over his keys to the school for a weekend. ""He said, 'I do not want to see you around this school. Frank, you need to get away,'"" he remembered. Lights streak as a truck drives by Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, in this long-exposure photograph. Frank displayed that same commitment to each of his students and the baseball players he coached, said Tom Tonelli, one of Frank's former pupils and a Columbine High School graduate who went on to teach at the school. ""It was always: Be a good student, be a good athlete, but above all else, be a good person,"" said Tonelli of Frank's expectations. 20 years after that day at Columbine High School, I'm still asking: 'Am I safe?' Still today, when Frank's brother hands over his credit card at restaurants, servers often ask if he's related to Frank, Anthony said. A waitress last year told him Frank had been her principal. ""And she goes, 'You could talk to any of my friends. What we appreciated was how he treated us,'"" Anthony recalled. That sentiment holds whether before or after the shooting, said Tonelli, who was on staff at Columbine the day gunfire erupted. ""Do I think the shooting transformed him? Absolutely,"" the teacher said. ""But to say somehow he became a totally different type of person, I don't think so. The character he exhibited in the wake of the tragedy is just a reflection of who he was before it happened."" When 'the world didn't believe in us,' he did Columbine High School serves a middle- and upper-middle-class community in Littleton, Colorado, where the mountains in the west rise into a wide open sky. Before the massacre, it was an ""ideal"" community, Frank said, with a lot of parental support and where he ""could count on my two hands the number of fistfights we had in 20 years."" After the shooting, Frank ""felt this enormous burden to go rebuild that community,"" he said. That's when he made the promise to stay at Columbine until the Class of 2002 had graduated. Other staff members made the same commitment, he said. But in 2001, Frank felt he hadn't accomplished what he'd set out to do. The Columbine Memorial in Littleton was dedicated and opened to the public on September 21, 2007. ""There were so many people deeply impacted, even the kids in elementary school,"" he said. ""So, I made a promise that I wanted to be there until that last class graduated, which would be 2012."" Two years after that, he finally left.

Principal: I want Columbine to mean hope (2014) 03:17 Frank's promise to stay gave him ""so much credibility in the community,"" Tonelli said. The faculty and staff, along with the students and the whole community, looked to him as a leader, as someone who was ""persevering for a cause greater than himself."" The perception stuck, even in the face of criticism that the school's administrators and faculty had fostered a student culture ""where something like this could happen,"" Tonelli said, referring to the shooting and calling the claim ""unjust."" The notion ""that there were certain segments of the population we didn't care about was so untrue,"" the teacher said. Through it all, Frank's ""leadership meant everything,"" he said. ""He was the biggest believer in our kids and in their teachers and in our community at a time when we felt like the rest of the world didn't believe in us anymore."" A leader battles darkness at home But as he worked to help Columbine recover, Frank was also an ordinary survivor. At home, his heroic veneer vanished, giving way to the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder. ""I tried to do everything to protect what I call the Columbine family,"" Frank recalled. ""But when I would come home, I just wanted to be left alone."" He didn't want to talk with his first wife and two stepchildren about what happened; they just didn't understand the aftermath, he said. ""It cost me my marriage,"" he said. ""My wife was saying, 'You're not the same person I married. You've changed.' And I did. I felt so much guilt."" Religious icons are displayed in Frank DeAngelis' home office. His trauma manifested in other ways, too. Months after the shooting, Frank and his brother went to a Colorado Rockies game. When fireworks lit up the sky, Anthony said, ""My brother nearly took cover."" Later, Frank told Anthony the celebratory display took him right back to the attack. More shell shock set in when Frank returned to Columbine the summer after the shooting to prepare for the new academic year. Bangs and rumbles echoed as construction crews repaired damage to the building. ""I would have to go back to my office,"" he said, ""and I would cry."" Hope thrives in 'tough love' Ahead of the massacre's third anniversary, as he was pushed by divorce proceedings to the edge of emotional and financial ""ruin,"" Frank began pecking away at the mountain of unopened letters he'd gotten in its wake. Among the first he picked up was from his high school sweetheart, Diane. They began talking regularly by phone, often late into the night, but agreed not to see each other until Frank's marriage was dissolved. ""There was still a spark,"" Diane said, and she could tell Frank had grown up. ""I could see that he had a sense of humor,"" she laughed, but also that his core traits hadn't changed. ""Some of the good things that brought us together were there from the beginning."" But as their relationship developed, Frank continued to wrestle with his trauma. As with many Columbine survivors, it always got harder in the advent of April, a month in which Frank has gotten into six car wrecks and when his attention always jerks back to the terror. Diane and Frank DeAngelis were high school sweethearts who lost touch, then married in 2013. He leaned on counseling and his Catholic faith, but he was living alone in a nearly vacant house, with only a few pictures and a single bed left after most everything else was sold off. ""Twenty years of my life was in shambles,"" he said. ""I was struggling,"" and he eventually started to drink. Diane, whose father was a recovered alcoholic, quickly caught on. Frank started hanging up the phone around 4 in the afternoon, she said, and telling her they would talk the next day. ""Immediately, I knew,"" she said. ""I thought, I don't know if I'm going to have to end this, because I can't go down that path again."" Diane's father died that April; Frank attended the visitation, and they began seeing each other. Soon, Diane caught him drinking. ""I can't do this,"" she told him. ""It was justifiable,"" Frank said, looking back. ""That was what I needed, that tough love ... I was so fortunate she came back into my life. And I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that. It was a wake-up call."" Leading the 'Club Nobody Wanted to Join' When he talks to others who have lived through school shootings, Frank mentions the risk of using alcohol or drugs to cope, and he emphasizes the importance of finding positive sources of support. It's just one of many pieces of advice he gives to members of what he calls in his book, ""A Club Nobody Wanted to Join."" Columbine wasn't the first school shooting, and it obviously wasn't the last. But every time another mass murder happens at a school, Frank said, his phone begins to ring with calls from reporters seeking insight from one of the nation's most seasoned campus attack veterans. ""Not that I'm an expert,"" he said, ""but I lived through it."" He was called on as recently as this week to address the news media when a Florida teenager -- who authorities said was ""infatuated"" with the Columbine massacre -- traveled to Colorado and bought a shotgun, prompting the shutdown of Denver-area schools, including Columbine. Quote: s are inscribed at the Columbine Memorial. Frank also reaches out to school leaders thrust into the role he knows so well. Last year, he said he connected after deadly shootings with administrators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, as well as Santa Fe High School in Texas and Marshall County High School in Kentucky . Getting that call carries a lot of weight, said Andy Fetchik, the former principal of Chardon High School in Ohio, where three students were killed in a shooting in February 2012. What school threats and lockdowns are doing to a generation of children The first thing Frank said was, ""We are now members of the same fraternity that neither one of us pledged,"" Fetchik told CNN. ""And the second thing he asked me to do was to write down his cell phone number."" Months later, as Fetchik prepared to start the next school year, he gave Frank a call, he said. ""There was a peace of mind in speaking with someone that went through it,"" Fetchik said, noting that Frank validated the steps he'd taken to help his Ohio school community heal. Several years later, Frank visited Chardon High School to talk with faculty members about the recovery process. ""One of the things I struggled with in the recovery was addressing the needs of staff. We didn't always know what they needed,"" Fetchik said. ""Frank was that voice of somebody who's been there, who said, 'Where you're at is OK. Mental health recovery is not something you could control. There's no calendar.'"" 'Columbine is not going to define me' Today, Frank and Fetchik are members of the Principal Recovery Network , a new group of 17 current and former school administrators who have lived through school shootings and their aftermath. Unlike activists who have sought to change gun laws following campus attacks, these officials simply aim to offer themselves and their combined experience as a resource. 20 years on, Columbine survivors tell Parkland students: 'We're sorry we couldn't stop it.' It falls in line with the work Frank has undertaken since he retired. Last year, he gave about 50 presentations in the United States and Canada about the recovery process. He also serves on the boards of school safety and other organizations, he said, knowing his name and connection to Columbine carry weight. But he's tired, Diane said, and she's made it clear she hopes he slows down after the 20th anniversary of the event that has served as the pivot point for his life's work. ""He's doing a lot of good out there, and he has a lot to bring to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But I worry about his health, because it hasn't been great. I see it in his face, how exhausted he is."" Frank DeAngelis stands outside his home. For a man who's been working since he was a kid, ""I can't imagine myself being completely retired,"" Frank said. And he knows he'll always want to help suffering communities. But he admits he needs to lighten his load. ""I'm looking at the 20-year remembrance as, I need to reevaluate,"" he said. ""I need to be able to give myself permission to relax. I need to give myself permission."" When he retired, Frank said, Diane told him she worried he would fall into a depression because he would no longer be associated with Columbine. Around that time, he began worrying about his own health and suffered with anxiety. But the doctor told him he was fine. Then, he visited another expert who pinpointed the problem. ""You have been a part of Columbine for 35 years,"" Frank's therapist told him, he recalled. ""And you feel that Columbine is Frank DeAngelis."" That perspective set the stage for a new outlook, Frank said. It's one he says he wants to embrace, though it may require as much determination as any hurdle he's conquered yet. ""He made me realize that Columbine is not going to define me. And that helped a lot,"" the former principal said. ""I've just got to get it in my mind that it's OK."""
Attackers detonate explosives outside Afghan communication ministry in Kabul - CNN,www.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/20/middleeast/kabul-attack-telecommunications-ministry/index.html,"(CNN) Three attackers detonated explosives outside the Afghan communication ministry in Kabul on Saturday, the interior ministry said.

CIA spy Virginia Hall is about to be everyone's next favorite historical hero - CNN,us.cnn.com,AJ Willingham,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/virginia-hall-cia-spy-world-war-2-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) The latest spy story to captivate the entertainment world has it all: World War II espionage in enemy territory, a determined American woman once called the ""most dangerous"" Allied spy and, of course, her prosthetic leg named Cuthbert.
But Virginia Hall's tale is far from fiction: She really was an accomplished spy who is the only woman to ever receive the US military's Distinguished Service Cross. A display is dedicated to her at the CIA's top-secret museum in Langley, Virginia . Though her legacy hasn't found a foothold in the public's imagination, that might change soon. Hall is the subject of three recently-published books and two upcoming films. If they are anywhere as intriguing as Hall herself, she'd bound to be everyone's new favorite World War II hero. Breakthrough Women in US Government, Education and Business Here's a primer: During World War II, Hall served for both the British Special Operations Executive and the American Office of Strategic Services . She spent time in the occupied French city of Vichy establishing spy networks for the UK. When Germany took the rest of France, she narrowly escaped -- but eventually joined the OSS and asked to be returned overseas. Once back in France, she continued to elude the Gestapo, who were intent on capturing the ""woman with a limp."" ""She is the most dangerous of all Allied spies,"" their communications reportedly stated . ""We must find and destroy her."" Oh, and Hall did it all on (technically) one leg. She lost the bottom half of her left leg in a hunting accident when she was 27. She eventually gave her prosthetic leg its own code name: Cuthbert. Read More Hall was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross by OSS chief William Donovan in 1945. But as her exploits in World War II were coming to an end, Hall's career was just beginning: After the war, she spent an additional 16 years in the CIA. Virginia Hall being awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1945. A pop culture wave The three new books profiling Hall were all published this year: ""Hall of Mirrors"" by Craig Gralley and ""A Woman of No Importance"" by Sonia Purnell hit bookshelves in February, and ""The Lady is a Spy,"" a young adult retelling of Hall's story by Don Mitchell, was released in March. Wait, there's more: A film version of Purnell's book starring Star Wars' Daisy Ridley is supposed to be released this year, and another film, "" Liberté: A Call to Spy "" is currently in post-production. A reluctant hero #ThrowbackThursday: First Tuskegee Airmen take flight What would Hall, who died in 1982 at the age of 72, think of all of this newfound attention? ""She would absolutely hate it,"" Hall's niece, Lorna Catling, tells CNN. ""She was not the least bit interested in fame or recognition. She did her work because she loved the excitement of it all. She was an outdoorsman and an extremely good organizer, and she just wanted to do her job."" Catling, who has been present for several ceremonies and dedications honoring her aunt's life, says Hall never talked about her accomplishments. While part of that was because of the secretive nature of her work, Catling says even after it was safe to discuss her time as a spy, she didn't bother. Hall even demurred when President Harry Truman offered to present her with the Distinguished Service Cross. ""She was so disinterested in that kind of recognition, she didn't want the ceremony to be public, so they had [Donovan] do it,"" Catling says. Unfortunately for Hall, her insistence on pushing away pomp and circumstances kind of adds to her whole mythology. ""I think it's great that she is finally being found, so to speak, and accredited for her work,"" Catling admits. ""Because she was pretty darn fabulous."""

Friday's mass shooting in Minatitlán comes just a couple of days before President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is scheduled to travel to the state of Veracruz for an official visit. Reyes Álvarez said he plans to ask López Obrador to increase security forces and, if possible, assign the Mexican National Guard to patrol the city. Minatitlán has also canceled a public weekend-long event to commemorate Holy Week and Easter. Minatitlán is about 315 miles (507 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City. The shooting took place near one of the six oil refineries run by Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the country's state-owned oil company."

"Ukraine election: The TV series ""Servant of the People"" tells us lots about Ukraine -- and its presidential race",us.cnn.com,"Analysis by Nathan Hodge, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/europe/ukraine-election-tv-show-intl/index.html,"Moscow (CNN) ""Servant of the People"" is a television series about a fictional Ukraine, but its plot mirrors reality. It tells the tale of an impoverished schoolteacher who unexpectedly becomes president after a profanity-laced anti-corruption rant goes viral.
And the show's star, comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, now stands a real chance of becoming Ukraine's next president. So what does ""Servant of the People"" tell us about Zelensky? Zelensky recently bested 38 other candidates in a national election -- and will face incumbent President Petro Poroshenko in a runoff vote on April 21 -- but he is still something of a political blank slate. That's provoked intense speculation about what kind of president he might make. After all, the winner of the runoff must confront immense challenges. Ukraine is engaged in a proxy war with Russia in the eastern Donbas region, its economy is struggling and many Ukrainians have left the country to seek livelihoods elsewhere. Read More ""Servant of the People"" is fiction, so it's perhaps not the right place to seek concrete answers to the kind of policies Zelensky might pursue if he wins office. But taken at face value, the series still tells us much about Ukraine today, and the issues that most concern Ukrainian voters. Here are some of the themes it touches on: The influence of oligarchs The opening scene of season one, episode one , features sinister characters looking out over Kiev's Maidan Nezalezhnosti, or Independence Square. ""We waste millions to ensure that our candidates appear (on) the political scene and then we pay twice as much to destroy their competitors,"" one says. Those actors are playing caricatures of post-Soviet oligarchs, the powerful, politically connected individuals who have seized the commanding heights of the economy in countries like Ukraine. The intersection between crime and politics is a persistent theme of ""Servant of the People,"" and it's not surprising that many Ukrainian presidential candidates -- not just Zelensky, but also Poroshenko -- ran on a promise to get rid of corruption. Cleaning house in Ukraine is easier said than done, however. The country still ranks 120 out of 180 on Transparency International's latest Corruption Perceptions Index , and Ukrainians -- like Zelensky's character -- routinely complain that the economic game is rigged in favor of a small group of elites. Zelensky at a shoot for ""Servant of the People"" in Kiev in March. Ukraine's place in the world If there is any messaging in ""Servant of the People,"" it's what could be described, in shorthand, as a vision of Ukraine striving to be a ""normal"" European country: a prosperous, democratic, functioning state that is free of systemic corruption. The first episode in series three features a flash-forward to 2049, where Kiev has a futuristic skyline with wind turbines. A modern schoolroom has a history class and students are using tablets. The teacher asks the students to describe their standard of living. They answer: ""Normal, not bad."" The history teacher says Ukraine is a member of the G20, a world leader in economic growth and has paid off its debts. ""That's normal for you,"" he said. ""But 20 years ago in our country, it was normal for a teacher to be unable to pay for a kommunalka (a communal apartment) on their salary."" The instructor then laughs: ""You don't even know what that is."" Relations with the EU Ukraine's Maidan revolution -- the street demonstrations in 2014 that led to the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych -- began after he made a decision to ditch an association agreement with the European Union and sign an agreement instead with Russia. In 2017, Ukraine saw the introduction of visa-free travel to the EU, a scheme that allows Ukrainians to enter the so-called Schengen area without a visa for up to 90 days. A scene in season two, episode four , features a talk show where a correspondent is broadcasting live from Brussels with news on whether Ukrainians will be granted visa-free travel. The signal cuts out, and the television host says, ""we'll find the decision on whether there will be visa-free travel after this commercial break."" Language matters Some observers have made much of Zelensky's choice of language. His character primarily speaks Russian, and many members of the cast have their lines in Russian. Ukrainian is the language of official and public life, and police officers, court officials, and television announcers in the TV series often speak Ukrainian. Does that make Zelensky more ""pro-Russian"" than his rival? After all, Poroshenko has made defense of the Ukrainian language one of the cornerstones of his campaign, with the slogan Armiya, Mova, Vira (meaning ""army, language, faith""). And the Russian government has cast language as one driver of the conflict in Ukraine's east, arguing that efforts to give primacy to Ukrainian have amounted to a form of discrimination and extreme nationalism. Polls suggest Zelensky is the favorite to beat incumbent president Petro Poroshenko in Sunday's vote. At many points in history, the Ukrainian language has been suppressed by imperial Russian and Soviet rulers (Ukrainian had official status in the USSR as a local language, but authorities also pursued a de facto policy of Russification). Now the Russian government claims Kiev is pursuing an aggressive policy of Ukrainization, through a controversial 2017 law making Ukrainian the required language of study in state schools from the fifth grade on. A moratorium on Russian-language media in western Ukraine, where Ukrainian is the majority language, has also drawn international criticism. ""Servant of the People"" reflects a complex reality, where language is not the only foundation of identity and patriotism in an independent, multi-ethnic, post-Soviet Ukraine. Many of the soldiers fighting on the front lines against Russian-backed separatists in Donbas are Russian speakers. One of the catalysts for the Maidan protests was Mustafa Nayyem, an activist and journalist of Afghan descent who called on Ukrainians to come to the Maidan to protest Yanukovych in a Russian-language tweet . The media's role It's worth remembering that ""Servant of the People"" is, primarily, a comedy. It features cameos by legendary drag queen Verka Serduchka , has a fair share of slapstick, and even a ribald joke about Russian President Vladimir Putin (a double entendre about him wearing a Hublot watch, which sounds similar to a oft-used Ukrainian insult about the Kremlin leader). But it's also clear that the series has served as a magnificent campaign advertisement for Zelensky. And that has brought the show in for criticism, particularly from Poroshenko. In recent statements on Twitter, the incumbent president has blasted 1+1, the TV channel that broadcasts ""Servant of the People,"" and its owner, tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky. ""My opponents have been pouring shameful lies on me over the past few weeks,"" Poroshenko said on Twitter . ""The main tool of spreading lies during the last months, unfortunately, was 1+1."" The election drama in Ukraine will be televised. Zelensky and Poroshenko squared off Friday in a stadium debate, with the two contenders trading one-liners and barbs. Ukraine's politics have even fascinated viewers in Russia, where many have followed the spectacle of a genuinely competitive election. ""I am not a politician, I am not a politician at all,"" Zelensky said over the shouts of Poroshenko's supporters. ""I am just a human being, an ordinary human being, who has come to break this system."""
"Notre Dame fire started at the center of the cathedral's roof, police source says",edition.cnn.com,"Margot Haddad and Tara John, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation-intl/index.html,"Paris (CNN) Investigators have pinpointed the start of the fire that ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, a police source told CNN.
After police reviewed a cache of amateur video and photos from local residences, investigators believe the fire started at the center of the cathedral's roof towards the base of the iconic spiral, the police source said. The police source also told CNN that investigators are focusing on two potential problems relating to the outbreak of the fire. One issue under investigation is a possible problem with the fire alarm system sensors. Investigators' second line of inquiry, the source said, relates to the elevators that were built for the construction workers. The source provided no additional details on that. The bees living on Notre Dame's roof survived the fire Two security guards at the cathedral told police they noticed the flames for the first time only when the flames were already almost 3 meters high ‪at 6:43 p.m. local time (12:43 p.m. ET), indicating the fire alarm sensors might not have been working properly, the police source told CNN. Read More The first alarm rang ‪at 6:15 p.m. local time. An alert flashed on the Notre Dame security control screens showing which sensor was sending the alert. According to the police source, the two security agents went to check the location but didn't see anything at that time. When the second alarm rang ‪at 6:43 p.m. local time, the two security agents followed the alarm system instructions and went to another location at the top of the cathedral, where they then saw the flames. Prosecutors are investigating if a short-circuit caused the fire Paris prosecutors are investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire that ripped through the cathedral. A judicial source told CNN on Thursday that ""we are not excluding any hypothesis at this stage,"" saying that this is not their only line of inquiry. The cathedral was undergoing renovations at the time of the fire. Some scrutiny has fallen on the firms undertaking work on the 150-year-old spire, which collapsed Monday as the flames raged around it. How centuries of priceless treasures were saved at Notre Dame Of the four companies contracted to carry out renovations at Notre Dame, two companies -- scaffolding firm Europe Echafaudage and art conservationists Socra -- had work in progress there at the time of the fire. Neither company had workers on site when the fire broke out. The fire devastated large parts of the 850-year-old building before it was finally extinguished after a nine-hour battle. Scores of priceless artifacts were rescued from the flames, and were taken to the Louvre museum for safekeeping. The bees that live on the roof of Notre Dame also survived the devastating fire, beekeeper Nicolas Geant told CNN. The Paris fire service said the operation was one of the most complex it had ever undertaken, and at one point, it was feared that the entire structure might be lost."

Fact check: Erik Prince's public claims vs. the Mueller report - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,Holmes Lybrand,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/prince-mueller-report/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Erik Prince , the founder of the controversial private security firm Blackwater, makes a number of appearances in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Noted for his ties to the United Arab Emirates, Prince was a prominent supporter of President Donald Trump during the campaign and spent time around senior officials with the Trump transition team, including former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Prince is the brother of Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.
Over the past two years, Prince has come under scrutiny for connections he may have been trying to make between the incoming Trump administration and Russian officials. Of particular interest is a meeting Prince had in January 2017 with a high-ranking Russian official. Prince has made several public statements regarding these activities and testified behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee in November 2017. (The transcript was later released to the public.) In all of Prince's comments, he has tried to downplay the importance of the meeting, characterizing it as a chance encounter. However, the Mueller report undercuts some of Prince's assertions, and shows the degree to which the meeting was planned and was focused (at least in part) on making Russian connections with the incoming administration. Read More Here's a look at some of Prince's claims before his interview with Mueller compared to those he made to Mueller's team. Prince: Meeting with Putin-connected Russian was an impromptu casual encounter Mueller report : The meeting was established prior to Prince's trip. In January of 2017, Prince met with Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, in the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean. During an interview with CNN in August 2017, Prince claimed that he was ""there on business"" with Emirati officials and that he simply ""met a guy,"" referring to Dmitriev. In this telling, the meeting was so insignificant, Prince said he couldn't ""even remember his name."" But according to the Mueller report, before going to the Seychelles, Prince met with an emissary of the UAE named George Nader several times in New York and ""discussed Dmitriev,"" with Nader who ""inform(ed) Prince that the Russians were looking to build a link with the incoming Trump administration."" Nader sent Prince the Wikipedia entry on Dmitriev and told Dmitriev that he had met ""with some key people within ... the inner circle"" in reference to Prince, the report says. This appears to directly contradict how Prince characterized the meeting to CNN, when he said he'd just ""met a guy."" There is also a disparity in the way Prince described the meeting, and whether he was acting on behalf of himself or as a bridge to the Trump team. Prince: I was not representing Trump in any way in meeting with Dmitriev. Mueller report: Prince told Dmitriev he would relay information to Trump's campaign chief executive Steve Bannon. In his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Prince was asked if ""the point of that meeting (was) for you to represent the Trump campaign or Mr. Trump in any way?"" He replied ""No."" This contradicts how both Nader and Dmitriev viewed the meeting with Prince. According to the report, Nader told Prince to meet with Dmitriev ""in light of (Prince's) relationship with the (Trump) Transition Team"" in order to ""discuss issues of mutual concern."" The report also states that, ""Prince acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team."" Prince also told Dmitriev that he would ""inform Bannon about his meeting with Dmitriev,"" and would follow-up if there was interest from the Trump team. Bannon told the special counsel that ""Prince did not tell him in advance about his meeting with Dmitriev."" Clearly, the meeting was set up by Nader for Dmitriev to meet someone who had connections to the incoming Trump administration, and according to the report Prince knew this. Prince also appears to have mischaracterized key details of his meeting with Dmitriev, including failing to mention that there were two meetings Prince: ""So I met him in the bar and had a drink."" Mueller report: They met twice, first in Nader's villa and again at a restaurant. In his testimony to the House committee, Price said that he met Dmitriev at ""at the bar and had a drink."" The meeting, Prince said during an interview with Al Jazeera, ""lasted one beer, which doesn't take me very long."" According to the Mueller report, what Prince failed to mention was that he first met Dmitriev in Nader's villa (with Nader in attendance). That meeting lasted 30 to 45 minutes. The two met briefly for a second time at a restaurant nearby. All of these contradictions raise the possibility that Prince could face legal jeopardy for perjury. Democrats have publicly suggested for more than a year that Prince lied to Congress, though Prince has always maintained that his testimony was truthful. A spokesperson for Prince, Marc Cohen, declined to comment on whether Prince lied during his House testimony when reached via email by CNN Thursday, saying, ""Erik has said all there is to say on this.""

The Turpin children had a police dog when facing their parents in court. He's comforted them for months. - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/turpin-children-court-emotional-support-dog/index.html,"The Turpin children had a police dog when facing their parents in court. He's comforted them for months. By Nicole Chavez, CNN Updated 10:54 PM EDT, Fri April 19, 2019
(CNN) As the children of David and Louise Turpin spoke about taking their life back and the nightmares they still have, a yellow Labrador sat quietly next to them.
The dog, Raider , has been meeting with the siblings ever since their parents were arrested early last year and their lives were turned upside-down. One of the 13 children -- who ranged in age from 2 to 29 -- managed to escape their filthy home in Perris, California, and called police. Authorities said the siblings had been isolated from the outside world and were often denied showers, medical care and food. The Turpins are sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after their children testify about years of torture
The Turpin children have been able to play with Raider numerous times as they navigated courthouses, prosecutors' offices and other legal settings in the past year.
""When we see him bring a smile to someone's face or even just touching him, we know that they are getting emotions out that maybe a human wouldn't be able to do,"" said Corona Police Sgt. Adam Roulston, one of Raider's handlers.
The 3-year-old Labrador is a facility dog with the Corona Police Department. Unlike other police dogs, he is highly trained to provide companionship without being a disruption in a work environment.
He is the first dog from Canine Companions for Independence, an organization that trains service dogs, to join the Corona police. While on duty, Raider wears a blue vest as well as a police badge around his neck.
Roulston said one of the Turpin children asked authorities to allow Raider to be with them Friday during their parents' sentencing hearing at the Riverside County Superior Court. They took turns petting him and he sat still by their side when two of them offered testimony about how they suffered at the hands of their parents.
Raider has previously helped the Turpin siblings and other victims reduce their anxiety and and comforted them. He played with them, let them pet him and showed them how he can draw from a deck of playing cards, Roulston said.
Roulston and police dispatcher Erin Lennox have been Raider's handlers since 2017. They balanced their law enforcement duties with the Labrador's numerous commitments that include court appearances, hospital visits and supporting witnesses of a crime.
""Seeing the way that he does and seeing how he makes people feel better it's the best reward ever,"" Roulston said. ""Officers and public safety personnel want to help people and Raider is a tool to help us do that.""
Raider is among a few police facility dogs in California and is part of the growing trend toward having service animals in courtrooms nationwide. A California law signed in 2017 allows trained therapy dogs to accompany witnesses while testifying. "

"Flint residents can sue the federal government over water crisis, judge rules - CNN",www.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/us/flint-water-federal-lawsuit-ruling/index.html,"(CNN) Residents of Flint, Michigan, can proceed with lawsuits that had been filed against the federal government in connection with the city's water crisis, a federal judge ruled.
The lawsuits claim the Environmental Protection Agency was too slow to intervene in the crisis. Judge Linda V. Parker ruled the federal government was not immune from legal action in the case. More than a dozen lawsuits , including class-action cases, were filed against Michigan and the City of Flint after the city's water was found to be contaminated with lead in 2014 and 2015. One lawsuit alleged the state hadn't treated the water with an anti-corrosive agent, in violation of federal law. ""The impact on the health of the nearly 100,000 residents of the City of Flint remains untold,"" Judge Parker wrote in Thursday's opinion and order. ""It is anticipated, however, that the injury caused by the lead-contaminated public water supply system will affect the residents for years and likely generations to come.""

420 Day is coming and marijuana stocks are on fire - CNN,www.cnn.com,Paul R. La Monica,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/investing/cannabis-stocks-420/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) For decades, though nobody was really sure why , April 20 has been the unofficial holiday for marijuana users and a joke by and about them. Now, though, it's also a reminder of how quickly marijuana is moving from illegal and a joke to a multi-billion dollar legal business — and a good time for us to take another look at how well cannabis stocks have been doing.
Publicly traded cannabis companies have reported strong sales since Canada legalized pot last October and several US states voted to approve recreational and medical marijuana use. Cannabis has also gone mainstream thanks to big investments and partnerships between marijuana sellers and blue chip consumer companies. Corona owner Constellation Brands ( STZ ) has a more than 35% stake in Canopy Growth ( CGC ) , a Canadian cannabis company that intends to take a bigger step into the United States with plans to buy American cannabis firm Acreage Holdings . Constellation also disclosed Thursday it may eventually boost its stake in Canopy to 50%. Pot stocks may be a bubble that needs to burst Marlboro-owner Altria ( MO ) invested $1.8 billion in cannabis producer Cronos Group ( CRON ) . And Tilray ( TLRY ) is working on cannabis-infused drinks with Budweiser owner AB InBev ( BUD ) . Read More But many of these stocks have soared this year already — Cronos is up nearly 60% so far while Canopy has gained 70% — leading to questions about whether this is just a speculative mania like tulips and dot-com companies. Bubble or bargain? ""This business is still in its infancy. It's like investing in alcohol post-Prohibition. There will be tons of growth,"" said Dan Ahrens, chief operating officer with investment firm AdvisorShares. ""But there are going to be home runs and there will be lots of strikeouts."" Ahrens thinks that investors need to be patient and selective. But he believes they will be rewarded — that is, if they wind up picking the winners. ""These are new, up and coming companies. There is going to be volatility so you have to be selective,"" Ahrens said, adding that he favors companies that haven't already shot up because they've done big deals like Canopy and Cronos have. Ex-NFL player Tiki Barber now invests in pot AdvisorShares just launched the Pure Cannabis ETF ( YOLO ) , an actively managed fund that invests in cannabis stocks. Some of its top holdings are Canadian cannabis companies CannTrust ( CTST ) , Aphria ( APHA ) and Hexo ( HEXO ) . JUST WATCHED Canopy Growth co-CEO: Product opportunity is 'substantial' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Canopy Growth co-CEO: Product opportunity is 'substantial' 05:27 Rob Almeida, global investment strategist with MFS Investment Management, said investors may be getting ahead of themselves. He's worried that cannabis stocks are going to turn out to be an investing fad like 3D printing and blockchain companies. ""Cannabis is not going to have parabolic growth,"" Almeida told CNN Business. ""There is a lot of hope and enthusiasm."" Cannabis prices are falling One cause for concern: Now that more states are legalizing marijuana use, prices are dropping as competition has increased. Research firm BDS Analytics, which calculates a consumer price index for the cannabis industry in the United States, recently reported that overall prices in February for products such as ingestibles, topical creams, vaporizers and vape pens and pre-rolled joints, fell 2.7% from February of 2018. Prices were down nearly 2% from the prior month. Many of the publicly traded cannabis companies have been reporting a drop in the retail price in Canada since legalization last October as well. Aphria, for example, reported sales this week that missed forecasts. Shares plunged nearly 15% on the news. But the stock is still up more than 40% so far in 2019. More deals likely on the way A lot of the excitement has to do with expectations of more mergers and partnerships. Aurora Cannabis ( ACB ) , a Canadian company whose stock has soared 80% this year, recently announced that it was adding legendary investor and deal maker Nelson Peltz as an adviser. That's led to speculation that Peltz may help Aurora team up with a consumer products or healthcare company. Tilray, for example, also has a strategic relationship with generic drug maker Sandoz, a subisidiary of Novartis ( NVS ) . So other cannabis firms may look to team up with Big Pharma. Canopy's plans to buy Acreage could lead to another wave of consolidation too. Matt Hawkins, managing principal at Cresco Capital Partners and an investor in Acreage, said in an email to CNN Business that ""this is the moment the cannabis sector knew was coming -- consolidation."" Hawkins added that the deal ""will lead to a rush of cannabis companies merging in order to compete with Canopy/Acreage"" and that ""it's now going to be very hard for early start-ups to enter the space and compete with the growing/emerging conglomerates."" In other words, there's another sign that cannabis is going legit : It's starting to function just like any other major consumer industry. "

A NASA study determined that when meteorites strike the moon, they cause water plumes to shoot into space. The first molecule produced by the Big Bang has finally been found in space. And one of the largest carnivorous mammals to ever walk the Earth was discovered. NASA astronaut Christina Koch is also aiming to hold the record for longest single spaceflight by a woman. Here's what you missed this week in space and science.

Hide Caption 41 of 95 Photos: Wonders of the universe The NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope is celebrating its 28th anniversary in space with this stunning and colorful image of the Lagoon Nebula 4,000 light-years from Earth. While the whole nebula is 55 light-years across, this image only reveals a portion of about four light-years. Hide Caption 42 of 95 Photos: Wonders of the universe This is a more star-filled view of the Lagoon Nebula, using Hubble's infrared capabilities. The reason you can see more stars is because infrared is able to cut through the dust and gas clouds to reveal the abundance of both young stars within the nebula, as well as more distant stars in the background. Hide Caption 43 of 95 Photos: Wonders of the universe The Rosette Nebula is 5,000 light-years from Earth. The distinctive nebula, which some claim looks more like a skull, has a hole in the middle that creates the illusion of its rose-like shape.

Hide Caption 95 of 95 An interstellar visitor on Earth Read More In 2014, a 1.5-foot-wide meteor crashed near Papua New Guinea. But this one traveled a long, long way to do so -- from another solar system . Researchers were able to determine this because of its velocity. It was moving so fast that it was able to make it to our solar system after probably traveling tens of thousands of years. They don't know how old it is, but it's probably ancient and contains a combination of a time capsule and message in a bottle with regards to information about its origin. ""Most importantly, there is a possibility that life could be transferred between stars,"" researcher Abraham Loeb of Harvard University said. ""In principle, life could survive in the core of a rock. Either bacteria, or tardigrades (a microscopic, water-dwelling animal); they can survive harsh conditions in space and arrive right to us."" Love and loss during the Crusades DNA from 13th-century remains buried in a pit in Lebanon is shedding light on the lives of Crusader soldiers and how they mixed with the local population. Crusader burials are rare, and these weren't in the best condition. The soldiers bore the marks of the blunt force that killed them. Then they were dumped in a pit and burned and lay in warm and humid conditions for hundreds of years. But thanks to some intrepid scientists, DNA was extracted from their temporal bones. And it contains a fascinating story that had been lost to the historical record. Skeleton DNA reveals surprising backgrounds of Crusader soldiers The researchers weren't expecting the diverse origins of the men. Some were from Spain and Sardinia, four were locals who were probably recruited to fight, and two carried mixed genetics indicating that they were the result of relations between Crusaders and locals. Some of the soldiers who traveled from western Europe to fight stayed in the newly established Christian states that popped up along the Eastern Mediterranean coast, according to a study. They settled down and had families with locals. As the wars raged on, they also died together in battle. And then, they were eventually cast out, leaving no genetic mark on the local population. The year of the woman (in space) NASA astronaut Christina Koch was scheduled to take part in the first all-female spacewalk alongside Anne McClain on March 29, but it was scrapped due to spacesuit availability. Instead, Koch conducted her spacewalk alongside Nick Hague. Christina Koch aims for record for longest spaceflight by a woman Now, she has her eye on a different record: the longest single spaceflight by a woman . Koch arrived on the International Space Station on March 14 for her first mission. She will remain on the station until February 2020, according to NASA's new schedule. Normally, astronauts stay on the station for six months. Koch's mission will surpass that of Peggy Whitson, who spent 288 consecutive days in space, and end up just shy of the longest single spaceflight by a NASA astronaut: 340 days, set by Scott Kelly. The next hot trend: moon water Meteorites don't just stir up dust when they crash into the moon. They also send plumes of water shooting into space . It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ""meteor shower."" Micro-meteorites collide with the moon at high velocity and send shock waves reverberating through the lunar surface. They need to penetrate only a few inches to stir up deposits of water, and the high energy of the collision converts the molecules into water vapor. The plumes spurt out into space. Most of the molecules dissipate into the very thin atmosphere around the moon, while some settle back into the ground. This is exciting news for missions that may rely on the natural resources of the moon, which is proving to be much more than a quiet satellite. Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state It all started with the Big Bang. When the universe formed during the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago, the chemical reactions of the aftermath formed the first molecules. Those molecules were crucial in helping form everything we know, but they're also absent. And although HeH+, the helium hydride ion, has been proposed for years as that first molecule, scientists couldn't find any evidence of its existence in space -- until now. After the Big Bang, HeH+ formed in a molecular bond when helium atoms and protons combined. Later, these would break apart into hydrogen molecules and helium atoms. Both elements are the two most abundant throughout the universe, with hydrogen first and helium second. A high-resolution spectrometer called GREAT on board a telescope called SOFIA detected the molecule in the planetary nebula NGC 7027, finally bring an end to a decades-long search. The biggest bad after the dinosaurs Millions of years ago, animals were on a much bigger scale -- and some of them were downright terrifying. For example, Simbakubwa kutokaafrika, which is Swahili for ""big lion coming from Africa."" Simba brings to mind ""The Lion King,"" but the real creature was more like your worst nightmare. This giant carnivore ruled at the top of the food chain after the dinosaurs went extinct. Twenty-three million years ago, the giant carnivore larger than any modern-day lion or polar bear stalked sub-Saharan Africa, according to the fossils of a previously undiscovered species that spent decades in a museum drawer. The skull is comparable to that of a rhinoceros, and given its size and giant sharp teeth, the carnivore was at the head of its food chain. Researchers estimate that it weighed 1.6 tons and could prey on large herbivores akin to today's elephant and hippopotamus. Timon and Pumbaa would have been food, not friends, to this giant predator. Simbakubwa was part of the hyaenodonts, an extinct group of mammalian carnivores that lived in Africa. And Simbakubwa is the oldest of this group, making it one of the largest carnivorous mammals ever to live on land. After the extinction of dinosaurs, they enjoyed a 45 million-year reign as the key predators. But tectonic plates shifted, introducing animals from other landmasses like the relatives of dogs, cats and hyenas. And eventually, they went extinct. Hopefully, ""Hyaenodont Park"" never becomes a thing. TESS finds its first Earth-size planet TESS the planet-hunting satellite is living up to its name. It just spied an Earth-sized exoplanet , as well as a warm mini-Neptune, in a star system 53 light-years away from us. The Earth-size planet, dubbed HD 21749c, completes an orbit of its host star every eight days. Its planetary sibling, HD 21749b, is about 23 times Earth's mass and has a radius about 2.7 times that of Earth. This puts the exoplanet in the category of a sub-Neptune or mini-Neptune. TESS has been operating for only about a year and has already made some exciting discoveries. So this is just the beginning for Kepler's successor. Happy birthday, Hubble! Twenty-nine years ago, the Hubble Space Telescope launched, and it has been capturing stunning views of the Milky Way galaxy ever since. To celebrate, Hubble's team shared a beautiful new look at the Southern Crab Nebula in all of its tentacled glory. The Southern Crab Nebula is several thousand light-years away in the Centaurus constellation. The hourglass-shaped nebula is due to an aging red giant star and a white dwarf. Materials that they ejected are pulled around the aging star and the dead star by gravity, creating its unique shape. In addition to taking us through the wonders of space, Hubble has made discoveries that affect astronomy and astrophysics. ""Among Hubble's landmark accomplishments include making the deepest views ever taken of the evolving universe, finding planet-forming disks around nearby stars, chemically probing the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars, identifying the first supermassive black hole in the heart of a neighboring galaxy, and providing evidence of an accelerating universe, propelled perhaps by some unknown source of energy in the fabric of space,"" the Space Telescope Science Institute said in a news release."
Mike Pompeo insists he's 'still in charge' on North Korea negotiations - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Zachary Cohen,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/pompeo-north-korea-still-in-charge/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized Friday that he is ""still in charge"" of the diplomatic team running negotiations with North Korea and made it clear that he plans to continue serving in that capacity despite a blistering rebuke by Pyongyang earlier this week that called for the top US diplomat to be removed from denuclearization talks.
Pompeo also sought to downplay concerns about how the current impasse between Washington and Pyongyang over sanctions relief might impact talks going forward, a disagreement that contributed to President Donald Trump's decision to walk away from February's summit with Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, without a deal. ""President Trump is obviously in charge of the overall effort but it will be my team, special representative {Stephen} Biegun will continue to lead the efforts to achieve what Chairman Kim committed to do back in June of last year which was to denuclearize,"" Pompeo told reporters at the State Department, standing alongside acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and their Japanese counterparts. Trump says sanctions on North Korea are at a 'fair level' ""As I have said before he has made that commitment to President Trump multiple times, he has made it to me personally a half a dozen times. I'm convinced we still have a real opportunity to achieve that outcome and our diplomatic team will continue to remain in the lead,"" he added. Pompeo's comments come after North Korean Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun slammed the US Secretary of State for ""letting loose reckless remarks and sophism of all kinds,"" specifically taking issue with his characterization of Kim Jong Un's recent speech to the country's rubber stamp parliament. Read More ""Everyone has a clear interpretation of his speech which says that the US should change its way of calculation and come up with responsive measures before the end of this year,"" Kwon said, accusing Pompeo of misconstruing Kim's words for an unknown ulterior motive. ""Even in the case of possible resumption of the dialogue with the US, I wish our dialogue counterpart would be not Pompeo but another person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us,"" Kwon added. Pompeo seemed to brush off that criticism Friday and indicated that the comments would have no impact on the prospect of negotiations going forward or his personal role in the process. Isolating Trump There has been little contact between the US and North Koreans since Hanoi and the Trump administration has not budged on its refusal to lift any sanctions until Pyongyang provides greater evidence that it is prepared to reduce its nuclear arsenal. That disagreement is believed to be the primary reason the most recent round of talks between Kim and Trump fell apart in Hanoi. However, Pompeo has publicly insisted that the US remains willing to return to the table and bluntly answered ""yes"" Friday when asked if he thinks talks with North Korea can continue without the US providing sanctions relief, despite Kwon's comments to the contrary. Pyongyang immediately blamed Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton for derailing the summit, a theme Kwon continued to push on Thursday, saying it ""gives us a lesson that whenever Pompeo pokes his nose in, the talks go wrong without any results."" Pompeo was one of the primary drivers in Washington of those talks, and the historic first summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore, but the shine appears to have worn off the relationship. Since Hanoi, North Korea has sought to not only portray Pompeo as an obstacle to diplomatic progress but as someone who actively working to prevent the two sides from reaching a deal despite Trump's eagerness to keep the momentum alive with Kim since Hanoi. The high-stakes meeting Trump hopes will help end the North Korea stalemate ""North Korea thinks Pompeo and Bolton have a different opinion as to what a deal should look like and still believes that Trump remains the key to getting what they want,"" a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiation process said. This source noted that recent criticism levied against US officials has not mentioned Trump himself, which is believed to be part of an effort by the North Koreans to isolate the President from his top advisers. Eric Brewer, a former director for counterproliferation at the NSC under the Trump administration, said he also thinks the comments about Pompeo are normal bluster from North Korea, noting that we've seen Kim trying to drive a wedge between Trump and his advisers before. However, he added that ""it would be nice to see the President come out"" and publicly endorse"" Pompeo and Biegun. Private frustrations Pompeo went on to say Friday that the ""mission set remains the same"" with regards to North Korea as they work toward and completely verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. But despite Pompeo publicly keeping his cool, his negotiators, including Biegun, are growing more and more frustrated behind the scenes, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking. Specifically, Biegun's frustrations are rooted in the lack of communication between the US and North Korea, according to multiple sources who have talked to him recently, noting that he has made it clear that he would like to get back to the table with his North Korean counterparts soon. But that timetable remains unclear. Sources told CNN that South Korean President Moon Jae-in has a message from Trump that he has been asked to relay to Kim. The message includes ""things that matter to the current course of action, things that have to lead to something positive for the US-DPRK summit,"" a source said. ""I believe he (Kim) would be very, very curious about what my President (Moon) would have to say after his meeting with the Trump administration."" South Korean President Moon has a message for Kim Jong Un from Trump, sources say While Moon has cast himself as the intermediary charged with jump starting talks between the US and North Korea, sources familiar with the situation have told CNN that there have not been any serious inter-Korean talks since Hanoi. Both US and South Korean officials say that their leaders want another summit with Kim but it remains unclear when either meeting might take place. Kim's next move For his part, Kim is still weighing options that include taking provocative measures, such as a satellite launch, in an attempt to regain leverage by raising tensions with the US or go the other way: attempt to resume diplomacy while continuing to seek sanctions relief, a source told CNN earlier this month. Pyongyang claimed it had conducted a ""new tactical guided weapons firing test"" on Wednesday but US officials have characterized the development as consistent with a low-level provocation and opted against condemning the move publicly. What US intelligence believes happened with North Korea's weapons test Plans are also in the works for Kim to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. South Koreans say they are not worried, but that visit could further complicate the diplomacy between the US, North Korea and South Korea. While some still fear that Russia will throw a wrench in the US-North Korean diplomacy, US officials do not see the meeting as much of a threat given that Russia has little leverage. There are hopes, among some US officials, that after North Korea holds meetings in Russia that they will come back to the table with the US. On Thursday, Kim said he seeks to ""closely cooperate"" with Putin ""as required by the new era."" It appeared that he was making a point to the Americans. Biegun held meetings in Moscow earlier this week ahead of Kim's planned arrival. Putin and Kim Jong Un will meet in Russia later this month, Kremlin confirms During those meetings, according to a Russian official, Biegun made it clear that the Trump administration does not want to go down the path of a step by step process with North Korea. Russia is not expected to push North Korea to bite at a big deal, they are content with that status quo, the official explained, given that they are getting involved. ""Maybe this is far as we can get,"" said the official, with little sense of urgency, explaining that the current halt to nuclear and missile testing from North Korea may be the ceiling on progress. The official also said that Russia didn't plan to torpedo the US talks, but rather hopes they could help get the two sides back to conversing."
Why the Mueller report probably isn't a game changer for voters - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/poll-of-the-week-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show WKRP in Cincinnati .
Poll of the week: A new Fox News poll finds President Donald Trump with a 45% approval rating and a 51% disapproval rating among voters. Last month, the same pollster gave him a 46% approval rating and 51% disapproval rating among voters. Fox News' findings are in-line with the average poll , which showed the President's ratings stayed steady after Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. What's the point: Mueller's nearly two-year long investigation has given the news industry more than a few headlines. People were arrested, charged with crimes and sentenced to jail. Through it all, Trump's approval rating has almost always stayed somewhere between 40% and 45% among voters. Does the release of the full redacted version of Mueller's report on Thursday change that? It's certainly plausible, but you'd be right to express skepticism. Read More Back in March, before Barr's memo was published, just 7% of voters said in a Fox News poll that something in the Mueller report could have a ""strong"" chance of changing their minds about Trump. The lack of a shift in public opinion about Trump after Barr's memo was released is very much in-line with that. Voters said the Mueller report wouldn't change their minds about Trump because the Russia investigation is simply put not a top issue for voters. In a CNN poll last month , zero respondents (0%) said it was their top issue for their 2020 vote when they were allowed to list any possible issue. This follows the 2018 midterm elections, in which fewer voters said the Russian investigation was an important issue to their vote than any of the issues listed in CNN's poll. The Mueller report also seems unlikely to upend the Democratic race for president. This month, Monmouth University asked likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa to state their top one or two issues in determining their vote for the Democratic nomination. Voters could list anything they wanted. Again, zero respondents (0%) said the Russia investigation was a top issue for them. Voters seem most likely to rely on their partisan priors when reading the Mueller report. Currently, Trump sports a -10 point net approval rating (approval-disapproval) among voters in the average poll . That is, voters are 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position when it comes to whether they approve of the job he is doing as president. Now look at how voters responded in a CNN poll when asked about the Barr memo of the Mueller report, in regards to Trump and his campaign. A majority, 55%, said that ""the President and his campaign have not been exonerated, but collusion could not be proven."" This was, of course, pretty close to what the Barr memo actually stated . Despite what was written in the memo, 45% agreed with the statement that ""the President and his campaign have been exonerated of any collusion with Russia."" This statement was far closer to Trump's own spin of the memo. In other words, Trump's base seems pretty locked in, but so too does his opposition. Just like when it comes to his overall approval rating, voters were 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position on the Mueller report. Obviously, this time could be different. Trump received a lot of bad press on Thursday because of the redacted Mueller report. Just keep in mind that the vast majority of voters have already stated on the record that they plan to vote a certain way (either for or against Trump), regardless of what the report's findings."
A peep into the history of Easter's marshmallow icon - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Denise Powell, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/health/peeps-history/index.html,"(CNN) Easter is a popular time for America's bunny- and chick-shaped marshmallow friends known as Peeps. Every day, about 5.5 million Peeps are produced, roughly 2 billion a year.
Peeps may be made with love, but they also have some less-healthy ingredients. Four yellow marshmallow bunny Peeps -- considered one serving -- contain 110 calories and 26 grams of sugar. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 100 calories, or 6 teaspoons, of added sugar a day for women and 150 calories, or 9 teaspoons, for men; for children 2 to 18, the recommendation is fewer than 25 grams of added sugar per day -- less than one serving of bunny Peeps. The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization, gives Peeps a score of nine on its a nutrition scale from one to 10, with one being a food of least concern and 10 being of higher concern. It points out that the treat is more than 81% sugar in weight and contains a nonspecific ""flavor"" ingredient. Beyond sugar, Peeps are made of corn syrup, a preservative called potassium sorbate, tartrazine (a yellow dye) and gelatin derived from pigs. ""The level of gelatin we use in Peeps is actually quite low, lower than most marshmallow products in the market,"" Caitlin Servian, brand manager of Peeps, wrote in an email. Read More Peeps have edible eyes made of carnauba wax derived from the buds and leaves of a Brazilian palm tree. Carnauba wax is also used in some protective coverings for shoes and cars, as well as other candies. Peeps may not be vegetarian, but they are gluten-free. They are also fat-free, but of course our bodies can turn sugar into fat. OK, so they're not a health food. But they are still an edible icon after more than 65 years of existence, with rabid fans all over the world. Let's look at this candy's origin story. 1600: Royal Peep ancestors Maria de' Medici, Queen of France and second wife of King Henry IV of France of the House of Bourbon. The creation of sugar animal figures is not unique to recent American confectionery history. On October 5, 1600 , edible sugar sculptures were displayed at a banquet in Florence, Italy, to celebrate the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France. Early 1900s: New York, the city of Peep dreams In 1910, 19-year-old Russian Jewish immigrant Sam Born arrived in New York from France, ready to take the candy industry by storm. ""A candy maker by trade, Born was responsible for many innovations including the technology to produce chocolate sprinkles, known as Jimmies; the hard chocolate coating used for Eskimo Pies; and the machine that mechanically inserted sticks into lollipops,"" Servian explained. Sam Born, left, and his brothers-in-law, Jack Shaffer and Irv Shaffer. The Willy Wonka-esque Born shared his ""just born"" chocolates in the window of his Brooklyn, New York, store in 1917, indicating that they were freshly made. He would open his own manufacturing company, Just Born, in 1923. The company expanded to an empty printing factory in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1932, during the Great Depression. 1950s: Peeps can no longer fly In 1953, Just Born acquired Rodda Candy Co., which originally made the candy we know as Peeps -- but with wings. The original marshmallow chicks were more labor-intensive, requiring manually squeezing marshmallow paste out of pastry tubes. The original Peeps had wings. The factory eventually quickened the process of making a Peep from 27 hours to six minutes. This was due to the effort of Bob Born, Sam's son, who modernized production with mechanical machinery. In 1955, it clipped the marshmallow chicks of their wings to further speed the process. As popular as Peeps are, Just Born's best-selling candy is Mike and Ike fruit chews. 1950s and '60s: The Peeps family expands Peeps' gingerbread-flavored marshmallow men. In addition to the chicks that are popular during Easter, shapes and flavors were created to meet seasonal themes such as Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day. Bunny Peeps weren't added until the 1980s . 1990s: Watch out, world, here come the Peeps As Peeps became more popular, the brand diversified its product. By 1998, Peeps were available in five colors : yellow, white, pink, blue and lavender. Original yellow is the best-selling color in the United States, Servian said, followed by pink and blue. Over the years, the company has added other flavors, including orange sherbert, pancakes and syrup, fruit punch, sour watermelon, blue raspberry and party cake. 1999: Peeps meet their match Emory University researchers tested the durability of the marshmallow candy. One of the tests demonstrated how dissolvable they were in water, acetone, sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. Peeps stood strong against those chemical foes. Then came phenol . After an hour in this protein-destroying chemical, toxic to even humans, the only thing left in the solution were the Peeps' eyes. 2000: ""Malcolm in the Middle"" vs. Peeps In the episode "" Traffic Jam ,"" Malcolm's older brother, Francis, makes a bet that results in him eating 100 Peeps (which he refers to as ""Quacks""). Spoiler: He loses the bet and becomes sick from overindulging. 2007: Peeps go sugar-free A ""sugar-free"" Peep entered the market with sugar substitutes like maltitol and isomalt. 2009: Peeps goes brick and mortar The Just Born first retail store, Peeps & Company , opened in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, for all Peeps pilgrims. The first Peeps store. This was also the year Peeps Delights were introduced: chicks covered in crème-flavored fudge or chocolate. 2013: Football player gets an offer he can't refuse After Dallas Cowboys football player Barry Church chipped his tooth on a Jolly Rancher and needed a root canal, he was given enough soft-to-chew Peeps to last an entire season. 2017: 255 Peeps in five minutes
At 24, professional eater Matt Stonie won the second annual World Peeps Eating Championship. He ate 255 Peeps in five minutes, beating his own record by 55. Competitive eaters like Stonie train for this feat by drinking excessive water to expand their stomachs, learning how to control their breathing, controlling calorie consumption in the off-season and exercising . Peeps have survived intense experiments and stood the test of time. They're clearly not going away any time soon."
From 'total exoneration' to 'total bullsh**': Trump lingers on damning report - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/donald-trump-mueller-report-anger/index.html,"Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.
Instead of the ""total exoneration"" Trump had proclaimed earlier, the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid , encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia's interference in US elections -- his ""Achilles heel,"" according to one forthcoming adviser. Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but doesn't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the ""crazy sh**"" he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication. Now, those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House. And he's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president, and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor. Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him ""Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),"" Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. Read More Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation. One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team, John Dowd and Ty Cobb, who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed. It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing. While these people are critical, the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given. It was a strategy that worked, even if there is some political embarrassment. The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report. Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days. Mounting anger Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff. It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration. Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended. ""Game over, folks,"" he said over the sounds of a busy airport. ""Now, it's back to work."" It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to. Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers. The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was ""nothing surprising."" ""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm,"" the official said. Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes. Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over. There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them. What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House. Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut. Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims. Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force. In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as ""ridiculous and petty."" Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since. Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday. ""(Trump) has never asked me to break the law,"" she said on CBS. ""When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it. He's not somebody who sit around and ponders. I think you guys have seen that day in and day out. One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him. You don't get to have it both ways."" Increasingly untethered JUST WATCHED Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' 02:48 Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts. Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads. People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides. Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day. Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President. In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior. Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a ""shock collar"" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure. Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence ""to create distance from the West Wing."" Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures. So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team. Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday. In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands. McGahn described Trump asking him to do ""crazy sh**,"" according to Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a ""lying bastard"" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion. In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did. Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report. ""Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,"" the President wrote."
"Ohio church apologizes after pastor asks students to spit on him, cut him as part of Easter lesson - CNN",edition.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/ohio-church-easter-lesson-apology/index.html,"(CNN) An Ohio church is apologizing for an ""inappropriate"" Easter lesson in which a pastor urged students to spit on him, slap him and cut him with a steak knife.
Impact City Church lead pastor Justin Ross and part-time associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey went on Facebook this week to publicly apologize to students who were part of the unusual after-school activity Monday. Dempsey was leading a group of middle and high school students who were part of the church's weekly ""After School Student Hangouts."" The program includes food and activities, Ross said. That's when Dempsey decided to share his message with students about Easter, in a way which he later said, ""crossed the line."" 'I thought it was OK' Read More ""Jaddeus got up in front of the students and he said, 'I'm going to ask you to do something that might seem a little crazy, but if there's anyone here that would like to spit in my face, you can do so without any repercussions,' "" Ross said on social media, describing the event. Some students took him up on his offer. Then, he told them they could slap him. Several did. Finally, Dempsey pulled out a steak knife and set the same conditions. One student took the knife and sliced his back. Students pulled out their phones and began posting on social media. Videos of that day show the students lining up before the pastor and taking turns spitting on his face while others laugh. One student is heard saying ""I'm doing it,"" while others respond, ""Do it."" ""Can I do it again?"" another asks. Another video shows students attempting to cut the pastor's back, before the pastor seems to say, ""Make me bleed."" Ai'Janae Parker, 12, took part in the activity. ""I thought it was very weird and awkward,"" she told CNN affiliate WBNS. ""I took part because I thought it was OK because it was coming from an adult."" The affiliate also reported the Licking County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation. Intent was 'honorable', pastor says The illustration went too far, Ross said in a video the Pataskala church later uploaded. But, he said, it was used to explain a ""very important topic about the crucifixion."" ""The reactions are appropriate,"" Ross said. ""Many of you were disgusted, many of you were hurt by this, many of you were very confused."" Even though the activity was inappropriate, he said, the ""intent was honorable."" After letting them spit, slap and cut him, Dempsey sat students down and talked to them about Jesus, his trial and crucifixion and how he was ""beaten, he was broken, he was whipped, he was crucified and he died as an innocent man,"" Ross said. ""[Jesus] chose to allow them to spit on him and beat him and crucify him in order to take the payment of our debt that we call sin,"" Ross said. ""So Jaddeus, in an effort to share that message of love through the Gospel and the story of Jesus' crucifixion, he shared this illustration and tried to share some of the pain that Jesus took on that day."" Ross said the church does not condone that students or anyone should spit or slap others, or ""use a weapon to harm anyone or to harm themselves."" Dempsey says no one knew about the activity In the same Facebook video by the church, Dempsey said it was completely his idea and no one else knew about his plans. It was over the top and bad judgment, he said. ""I am so sorry for misrepresenting the community, the church, the parents, the students and anybody that I hurt,"" Dempsey said. ""It was not my intention. My intention was just to show them how much Jesus loves them and I love them."" Dempsey said he has been a student leader for almost four years and that Monday's activity was ""an anomaly and is not normally what happens."" Many Facebook users came to Dempsey's defense after the incident. The church said its board of directors will conduct a formal review and investigation."
Bacon is about to get more expensive - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/investing/bacon-more-expensive-china/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) African swine fever is plaguing China's pork production. The disease is killing multitudes of animals, hitting the global pork supply chain, and driving up prices.
China is one of the biggest producers of pork in the world, with around half of the meat's global output. China's pork production has fallen 10% this year, according to US government statistics. To meet China's insatiable demand for pork products, the country is turning to imports, which are expected to hit a record high in 2019. The European Union, Brazil, Canada and the United States are providing the goods. ""China normally accounts for 49% of global pork consumption, while consuming 28% of the world's meat supply,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone. ""As such, this is a big problem for China, and we expect it to be a five to seven year problem before production can be restored."" While prices for lean hog futures — which are traded like other agricultural products such as corn or soy — have skyrocketed, the difference between wholesale and retail pork prices in the United States has been stable over the past few months, according to data from the USDA. Read More But hog prices are near a four-year high and futures for June have rallied nearly 30% since the beginning of March. At some point, the price increase will be too big for retailers to shoulder the burden if the problem sticks around. China will likely do what it can to get pork supplies destined for US consumer and others to its own shores to stem the shortfall, ""pushing pork prices upward until the consumer shift to poultry, beef and other options,"" said Suderman. He sees it ""as a long-term issue that will rise the price of virtually all meat worldwide."" Last year, China produced 54.8 million metric tons of pork, and consumed nearly 60 million tons. By February, China had slaughtered nearly 1 million pigs over six months as it struggled to contain the outbreak of the swine fever, a highly contagious and fatal disease for pigs that is not harmful to humans. Turning to alternative meats, like poultry, will likely help meet the Chinese demand. But production constraints — such as a limited number of refrigerated ocean freighters — will limit the extent to which other meats can fill the gap. All in, China will have a total meat shortfall of 16.2 metric tons over the coming year, Suderman estimated. The increase in pork prices could also show up in China's closely watched economic data. ""Pork prices have large implications for Chinese and emerging market inflation given food prices are the largest factor in consumer inflation and the main component is pork,"" said Nicky Shiels, commodities strategist at Scotiabank. Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Nicky Shiels' last name."
Why the Mueller report probably isn't a game changer for voters - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Harry Enten,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/poll-of-the-week-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show WKRP in Cincinnati .
Poll of the week: A new Fox News poll finds President Donald Trump with a 45% approval rating and a 51% disapproval rating among voters. Last month, the same pollster gave him a 46% approval rating and 51% disapproval rating among voters. Fox News' findings are in-line with the average poll , which showed the President's ratings stayed steady after Attorney General William Barr released his summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report. What's the point: Mueller's nearly two-year long investigation has given the news industry more than a few headlines. People were arrested, charged with crimes and sentenced to jail. Through it all, Trump's approval rating has almost always stayed somewhere between 40% and 45% among voters. Does the release of the full redacted version of Mueller's report on Thursday change that? It's certainly plausible, but you'd be right to express skepticism. Read More Back in March, before Barr's memo was published, just 7% of voters said in a Fox News poll that something in the Mueller report could have a ""strong"" chance of changing their minds about Trump. The lack of a shift in public opinion about Trump after Barr's memo was released is very much in-line with that. Voters said the Mueller report wouldn't change their minds about Trump because the Russia investigation is simply put not a top issue for voters. In a CNN poll last month , zero respondents (0%) said it was their top issue for their 2020 vote when they were allowed to list any possible issue. This follows the 2018 midterm elections, in which fewer voters said the Russian investigation was an important issue to their vote than any of the issues listed in CNN's poll. The Mueller report also seems unlikely to upend the Democratic race for president. This month, Monmouth University asked likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa to state their top one or two issues in determining their vote for the Democratic nomination. Voters could list anything they wanted. Again, zero respondents (0%) said the Russia investigation was a top issue for them. Voters seem most likely to rely on their partisan priors when reading the Mueller report. Currently, Trump sports a -10 point net approval rating (approval-disapproval) among voters in the average poll . That is, voters are 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position when it comes to whether they approve of the job he is doing as president. Now look at how voters responded in a CNN poll when asked about the Barr memo of the Mueller report, in regards to Trump and his campaign. A majority, 55%, said that ""the President and his campaign have not been exonerated, but collusion could not be proven."" This was, of course, pretty close to what the Barr memo actually stated . Despite what was written in the memo, 45% agreed with the statement that ""the President and his campaign have been exonerated of any collusion with Russia."" This statement was far closer to Trump's own spin of the memo. In other words, Trump's base seems pretty locked in, but so too does his opposition. Just like when it comes to his overall approval rating, voters were 10 points more likely to take the anti-Trump position on the Mueller report. Obviously, this time could be different. Trump received a lot of bad press on Thursday because of the redacted Mueller report. Just keep in mind that the vast majority of voters have already stated on the record that they plan to vote a certain way (either for or against Trump), regardless of what the report's findings."
"Ohio church apologizes after pastor asks students to spit on him, cut him as part of Easter lesson - CNN",us.cnn.com,"Christina Maxouris, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/us/ohio-church-easter-lesson-apology/index.html,"(CNN) An Ohio church is apologizing for an ""inappropriate"" Easter lesson in which a pastor urged students to spit on him, slap him and cut him with a steak knife.
Impact City Church lead pastor Justin Ross and part-time associate pastor Jaddeus Dempsey went on Facebook this week to publicly apologize to students who were part of the unusual after-school activity Monday. Dempsey was leading a group of middle and high school students who were part of the church's weekly ""After School Student Hangouts."" The program includes food and activities, Ross said. That's when Dempsey decided to share his message with students about Easter, in a way which he later said, ""crossed the line."" 'I thought it was OK' Read More ""Jaddeus got up in front of the students and he said, 'I'm going to ask you to do something that might seem a little crazy, but if there's anyone here that would like to spit in my face, you can do so without any repercussions,' "" Ross said on social media, describing the event. Some students took him up on his offer. Then, he told them they could slap him. Several did. Finally, Dempsey pulled out a steak knife and set the same conditions. One student took the knife and sliced his back. Students pulled out their phones and began posting on social media. Videos of that day show the students lining up before the pastor and taking turns spitting on his face while others laugh. One student is heard saying ""I'm doing it,"" while others respond, ""Do it."" ""Can I do it again?"" another asks. Another video shows students attempting to cut the pastor's back, before the pastor seems to say, ""Make me bleed."" Ai'Janae Parker, 12, took part in the activity. ""I thought it was very weird and awkward,"" she told CNN affiliate WBNS. ""I took part because I thought it was OK because it was coming from an adult."" The affiliate also reported the Licking County Sheriff's Office opened an investigation. Intent was 'honorable', pastor says The illustration went too far, Ross said in a video the Pataskala church later uploaded. But, he said, it was used to explain a ""very important topic about the crucifixion."" ""The reactions are appropriate,"" Ross said. ""Many of you were disgusted, many of you were hurt by this, many of you were very confused."" Even though the activity was inappropriate, he said, the ""intent was honorable."" After letting them spit, slap and cut him, Dempsey sat students down and talked to them about Jesus, his trial and crucifixion and how he was ""beaten, he was broken, he was whipped, he was crucified and he died as an innocent man,"" Ross said. ""[Jesus] chose to allow them to spit on him and beat him and crucify him in order to take the payment of our debt that we call sin,"" Ross said. ""So Jaddeus, in an effort to share that message of love through the Gospel and the story of Jesus' crucifixion, he shared this illustration and tried to share some of the pain that Jesus took on that day.""

Mike Pompeo insists he's 'still in charge' on North Korea negotiations - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Zachary Cohen,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/pompeo-north-korea-still-in-charge/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized Friday that he is ""still in charge"" of the diplomatic team running negotiations with North Korea and made it clear that he plans to continue serving in that capacity despite a blistering rebuke by Pyongyang earlier this week that called for the top US diplomat to be removed from denuclearization talks.
Pompeo also sought to downplay concerns about how the current impasse between Washington and Pyongyang over sanctions relief might impact talks going forward, a disagreement that contributed to President Donald Trump's decision to walk away from February's summit with Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, without a deal. ""President Trump is obviously in charge of the overall effort but it will be my team, special representative {Stephen} Biegun will continue to lead the efforts to achieve what Chairman Kim committed to do back in June of last year which was to denuclearize,"" Pompeo told reporters at the State Department, standing alongside acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and their Japanese counterparts. Trump says sanctions on North Korea are at a 'fair level' ""As I have said before he has made that commitment to President Trump multiple times, he has made it to me personally a half a dozen times. I'm convinced we still have a real opportunity to achieve that outcome and our diplomatic team will continue to remain in the lead,"" he added. Pompeo's comments come after North Korean Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun slammed the US Secretary of State for ""letting loose reckless remarks and sophism of all kinds,"" specifically taking issue with his characterization of Kim Jong Un's recent speech to the country's rubber stamp parliament. Read More ""Everyone has a clear interpretation of his speech which says that the US should change its way of calculation and come up with responsive measures before the end of this year,"" Kwon said, accusing Pompeo of misconstruing Kim's words for an unknown ulterior motive. ""Even in the case of possible resumption of the dialogue with the US, I wish our dialogue counterpart would be not Pompeo but another person who is more careful and mature in communicating with us,"" Kwon added. Pompeo seemed to brush off that criticism Friday and indicated that the comments would have no impact on the prospect of negotiations going forward or his personal role in the process. Isolating Trump There has been little contact between the US and North Koreans since Hanoi and the Trump administration has not budged on its refusal to lift any sanctions until Pyongyang provides greater evidence that it is prepared to reduce its nuclear arsenal. That disagreement is believed to be the primary reason the most recent round of talks between Kim and Trump fell apart in Hanoi. However, Pompeo has publicly insisted that the US remains willing to return to the table and bluntly answered ""yes"" Friday when asked if he thinks talks with North Korea can continue without the US providing sanctions relief, despite Kwon's comments to the contrary. Pyongyang immediately blamed Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton for derailing the summit, a theme Kwon continued to push on Thursday, saying it ""gives us a lesson that whenever Pompeo pokes his nose in, the talks go wrong without any results."" Pompeo was one of the primary drivers in Washington of those talks, and the historic first summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore, but the shine appears to have worn off the relationship. Since Hanoi, North Korea has sought to not only portray Pompeo as an obstacle to diplomatic progress but as someone who actively working to prevent the two sides from reaching a deal despite Trump's eagerness to keep the momentum alive with Kim since Hanoi. The high-stakes meeting Trump hopes will help end the North Korea stalemate ""North Korea thinks Pompeo and Bolton have a different opinion as to what a deal should look like and still believes that Trump remains the key to getting what they want,"" a diplomatic source familiar with the negotiation process said. This source noted that recent criticism levied against US officials has not mentioned Trump himself, which is believed to be part of an effort by the North Koreans to isolate the President from his top advisers. Eric Brewer, a former director for counterproliferation at the NSC under the Trump administration, said he also thinks the comments about Pompeo are normal bluster from North Korea, noting that we've seen Kim trying to drive a wedge between Trump and his advisers before. However, he added that ""it would be nice to see the President come out"" and publicly endorse"" Pompeo and Biegun. Private frustrations Pompeo went on to say Friday that the ""mission set remains the same"" with regards to North Korea as they work toward and completely verifiable and irreversible denuclearization. But despite Pompeo publicly keeping his cool, his negotiators, including Biegun, are growing more and more frustrated behind the scenes, according to multiple sources familiar with their thinking. Specifically, Biegun's frustrations are rooted in the lack of communication between the US and North Korea, according to multiple sources who have talked to him recently, noting that he has made it clear that he would like to get back to the table with his North Korean counterparts soon. But that timetable remains unclear. Sources told CNN that South Korean President Moon Jae-in has a message from Trump that he has been asked to relay to Kim. The message includes ""things that matter to the current course of action, things that have to lead to something positive for the US-DPRK summit,"" a source said. ""I believe he (Kim) would be very, very curious about what my President (Moon) would have to say after his meeting with the Trump administration."" South Korean President Moon has a message for Kim Jong Un from Trump, sources say While Moon has cast himself as the intermediary charged with jump starting talks between the US and North Korea, sources familiar with the situation have told CNN that there have not been any serious inter-Korean talks since Hanoi. Both US and South Korean officials say that their leaders want another summit with Kim but it remains unclear when either meeting might take place. Kim's next move For his part, Kim is still weighing options that include taking provocative measures, such as a satellite launch, in an attempt to regain leverage by raising tensions with the US or go the other way: attempt to resume diplomacy while continuing to seek sanctions relief, a source told CNN earlier this month. Pyongyang claimed it had conducted a ""new tactical guided weapons firing test"" on Wednesday but US officials have characterized the development as consistent with a low-level provocation and opted against condemning the move publicly. What US intelligence believes happened with North Korea's weapons test Plans are also in the works for Kim to visit Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month. South Koreans say they are not worried, but that visit could further complicate the diplomacy between the US, North Korea and South Korea. While some still fear that Russia will throw a wrench in the US-North Korean diplomacy, US officials do not see the meeting as much of a threat given that Russia has little leverage. There are hopes, among some US officials, that after North Korea holds meetings in Russia that they will come back to the table with the US. On Thursday, Kim said he seeks to ""closely cooperate"" with Putin ""as required by the new era."" It appeared that he was making a point to the Americans. Biegun held meetings in Moscow earlier this week ahead of Kim's planned arrival. Putin and Kim Jong Un will meet in Russia later this month, Kremlin confirms During those meetings, according to a Russian official, Biegun made it clear that the Trump administration does not want to go down the path of a step by step process with North Korea. Russia is not expected to push North Korea to bite at a big deal, they are content with that status quo, the official explained, given that they are getting involved. ""Maybe this is far as we can get,"" said the official, with little sense of urgency, explaining that the current halt to nuclear and missile testing from North Korea may be the ceiling on progress. The official also said that Russia didn't plan to torpedo the US talks, but rather hopes they could help get the two sides back to conversing."
From 'total exoneration' to 'total bullsh**': Trump lingers on damning report - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kevin Liptak,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/politics/donald-trump-mueller-report-anger/index.html,"Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.
Instead of the ""total exoneration"" Trump had proclaimed earlier, the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid , encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia's interference in US elections -- his ""Achilles heel,"" according to one forthcoming adviser. Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but doesn't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the ""crazy sh**"" he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication. Now, those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House. And he's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president, and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor. Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him ""Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad),"" Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. Read More Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation. One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team, John Dowd and Ty Cobb, who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed. It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing. While these people are critical, the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given. It was a strategy that worked, even if there is some political embarrassment. The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report. Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days. Mounting anger Undermining, but protective: How Trump's staff's insolence may have saved him But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff. It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration. Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended. ""Game over, folks,"" he said over the sounds of a busy airport. ""Now, it's back to work."" It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to. Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers. The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides. A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was ""nothing surprising."" ""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm,"" the official said. Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes. Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over. There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them. What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House. Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut. Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims. Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force. In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as ""ridiculous and petty."" Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since. Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday. ""(Trump) has never asked me to break the law,"" she said on CBS. ""When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it. He's not somebody who sit around and ponders. I think you guys have seen that day in and day out. One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him. You don't get to have it both ways."" Increasingly untethered JUST WATCHED Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' 02:48 Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts. Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads. People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides. Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day. Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President. In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior. Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a ""shock collar"" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure. Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence ""to create distance from the West Wing."" Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures. So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team. Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday. In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands. McGahn described Trump asking him to do ""crazy sh**,"" according to Priebus. Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a ""lying bastard"" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion. In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did. Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report. ""Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed,"" the President wrote."
Easter amid the ashes: How Christians in Louisiana and Notre Dame Cathedral are celebrating this Sunday,us.cnn.com,Daniel Burke,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/world/easter-ashes/index.html,"(CNN) As Pastor Harry Richard watched the flames consume Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral on Tuesday, his soul swirled with emotions.
Just two weeks earlier, on April 2, Richard's own church, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, Louisiana, was set ablaze. It was one of three predominantly black churches in the area that were intentionally burned down, according to police. ""My heart bled for them as much as it did for my own congregation,"" said Richard of the Parisians devastated by the damage to their 850-year-old cathedral . But the Baptist pastor said he also sensed the pull of something deeper, perhaps even divine, in the aftermath of the fires. ""I think that God is using these moments to bring us closer together as a world,"" Richard said. ""This is God's hand on our lives to make us realize that we are all connected in some form or fashion."" Read More In the days after the Notre Dame fire, as money poured in to save the iconic cathedral, an online campaign encouraged people to help rebuild the three Louisiana churches as well. By Friday , more than $2 million had been raised. While Christians connected to the charred churches appreciate the outpouring, many say they lost more than hallowed ground and irreplaceable artifacts in the smoke and ashes. They lost a part of themselves. ""She is the soul of France,"" Archbishop Michel Aupetit of Paris, whose home church is Notre Dame Cathedral, told Le Figaro this week. And so this Sunday will, in some sense, be remembered as an Easter amid the ashes, as Christians from Louisiana to the Ile de la Cite, the island where Notre Dame Cathedral sits surrounded by the Seine River, take refuge in the hope of resurrection. ""What does the Lord want to tell us through this ordeal?"" asked Aupetit. ""Here we move from the scandal of death to the mystery of resurrection. Our hope will never disappoint us because it is based not on buildings of stone, which we will rebuild, but on the Risen One who remains forever."" Fallen debris from the burned roof structure sits near the altar inside Notre Dame Cathedral. French connections Like many in St. Landry Parish, Pastor Richard, whose name is pronounced ""ree-SHARD,"" has French ancestry. The parish is named after St. Landry, a seventh-century Parisian bishop memorialized by St. Landry Chapel inside the Notre Dame Cathedral. Yet another connection: The first Louisiana church to burn, St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, shares a patron saint with Notre Dame: Mary, the mother of Jesus. Greater Union was built around 100 years ago, the pastor said, though it's difficult to discern the exact date because record-keeping was erratic in those days. His grandfather, who helped construct the brick and wood church by hand, signed his name with an X, Richard said. Richard's grandfather is one of several family members buried on a plot of land outside Greater Union that includes his mother and father, sister and brother, grandmother and grandfather. Sometimes he takes a walk among their tombstones and talks to them. Many of the congregation's members also have ancestors buried in the cemetery , the pastor said. ""Most of the members of our church are pretty much related, by marriage if not by blood. That cemetery is a sacred place for us."" For that reason, since the fire, people who have left Opelousas and Greater Union have urged the pastor to rebuild his church on the same hallowed ground. ""As far as I am concerned, that address will always belong to Greater Union Baptist Church. I don't want to build a cathedral. We don't have room for that. But I want that land to contain a house of God forever."" Greater Union Baptist Church Pastor Harry Richard stands for a portrait in front of the ruins of his church building in Opelousas, Louisiana. The 66-year-old, who has been pastor of Greater Union for 16 years, said one of his deacons saved a Bible from the charred ruins of the congregation. Richard hopes it's his, filled with notes about family history and scriptural thoughts, but he's been too busy to check. A pastor's first responsibility, he said, is to tend to his flock. And his is grieving. Asked about the most valuable thing lost in the fire that destroyed his church, Richard said it wasn't anything tangible. It was trust. ""We are a black Baptist church, and we've fellowshipped with some white community members who have come to our church,"" the pastor said. ""But when the fires started it created an atmosphere of mistrust. The little trust we had was burned up in that fire."" In Louisiana, as in other Southern states, memories of racial violence and racist policies stay close to the surface, Richard said. It doesn't take long to recall how the Ku Klux Klan terrorized African-Americans by setting fire to their sacred spaces. ""Our culture has been filled with mistrust and misunderstandings,"" the pastor said. Police say the fires at the three black churches in St. Landry Parish were started by the white son of a sheriff's deputy who was motivated by black metal music, not racism per se. The accused 21-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges in the case. But the fact remains: All three churches were predominantly African-American. As he prepared for Sunday Easter services, which will be held in a cozy Masonic lodge in Opelousas, Richard said the congregation has already forgiven the ""firestarter."" Trust will be harder to rebuild, but he is hopeful. Richard said he's been thinking a lot about John's Gospel, especially the 20th chapter when Mary Magdalene finds Jesus' empty tomb. ""After witnessing Christ's crucifixion, it was a traumatic experience for her to go there. And that kind of speaks to us as a congregation, when we realized our church was on fire. But, as we know, that is not the end of the story."" 'Notre Dame is still standing!' Since Notre Dame's fire, hundreds of people, both Christian and not, have sent ""testimonials"" about their spiritual and emotional ties to the cathedral. They came in from New Jersey and Seattle, Poland and Japan, Italy, Germany, and, of course, from France. People recalled the sacred moments of their lives staged in the ancient cathedral: having hasty marriages blessed by Notre Dame priests, hearing the voices of an angelic choir rise through the vaulted arches, watching their children be baptized. The cause of the fire is still not known, but investigators suspect that it was an unintentional result of repairs at the Gothic masterpiece. Many of its most prized possessions, including the stained-glass rose windows and a crown of thorns believed to have been worn by Jesus, were somehow spared. Nevertheless, wrote Mother Marie Christine in her testimonial posted on the cathedral's website, ""a whole part of our heritage, our history, has gone up in smoke."" Flames and smoke rise from Notre Dame Cathedral as it burns in Paris. ""And yet, in a few days, another fire will shine in the night opening the solemnity of the solemnities,"" Christine wrote, in a sentiment shared by many of the testimonies, ""that of the Resurrection of Christ."" There seemed to be an unspoken assumption that Notre Dame would outlast us, wrote a man named Clemence, just as it had outlasted the Huguenots, French revolutionaries and Nazis who had tried to destroy it. Parisian priests , too, wrote testimonials about ""Our Lady,"" as the cathedral was affectionately known among the French. The Rev. Denis Metzinger, parish priest of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont and a canon of Notre Dame, said that even before the fire, he had been contemplating Jesus' words upon the cross, ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" ""I admit that this question has been mounting in me for weeks before the accumulation of scandals of all kinds that have emerged in my family the church in the 21st century,"" Metzinger wrote, in an apparent reference to the Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandal. Jesus' question again echoed through the priest's mind as he watched Notre Dame burn on Tuesday through tears. Metzinger said he was a tour guide at the cathedral, was ordained a priest at Notre Dame and participated for many years in its Masses and other sacred ceremonies. Like many others, Metzinger said, he took heart in the fact that, when the smoke cleared, Notre Dame's main altar and the gilded cross above it remained. ""Notre Dame de Paris as the church in our time is disfigured."" he said. ""Notre Dame de Paris as the church in our time is standing!"" Serenading 'Our Lady' On the day after the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, John Cavadini, a professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said a special prayer for the cathedral and put on his fleur-de-lis tie. As its name suggests, the university has French roots. It was founded by a French missionary order, the Congregation of Holy Cross. Tuesday morning, Cavadini talked to one of his classes about why the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral seemed to so deeply affect people around the world, Christians and atheists alike. Somehow, the flames seem to have fanned a latent spiritual impulse among even the most secular-minded, he said. ""I don't think people would have had that reaction if Notre Dame were not a church,"" he said. ""If it were the Louvre Museum or even the Vatican Museum, people would have been upset, but not like this."" Cavadini said he saw faculty members with tears in their eyes after watching the inferno tear down the cathedral's spire. ""That fire seems to have unleashed a kind of kinetic energy,"" the professor continued. An overflow crowd celebrates Mass in the public square in front of the Church of Saint-Sulpice during Holy Week in Paris. The Mass was originally scheduled to be held in the Cathedral of Notre Dame. ""The cathedral served as an embodiment of our spiritual ideals, and people took it for granted that it would always be there. When it collapsed, it was as if something inside of us collapsed as well."" In the days after the Notre Dame fire, many commentators referred to the cathedral, and others like it that had stood for centuries, as ""monuments to resilience"" or ""testaments of faith."" That's true to an extent. But watching the crowd of Parisians serenade their burning cathedral Tuesday night with ""Ave Maria,"" a hymn about St. Mary, the idea arose that any church, even a cathedral, is only a monument to faith. They are expressions of a human longing for the sacred and the spiritual, but they are not the longing itself -- and that impulse, if history is any judge, can be much more difficult to destroy. Or, as Pastor Richard said more succinctly, ""Our faith isn't in any building. Our faith is in us."""
"Notre Dame fire started at the center of the cathedral's roof, police source says",us.cnn.com,"Margot Haddad and Tara John, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation-intl/index.html,"Paris (CNN) Investigators have pinpointed the start of the fire that ripped through Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, a police source told CNN.
After police reviewed a cache of amateur video and photos from local residences, investigators believe the fire started at the center of the cathedral's roof towards the base of the iconic spiral, the police source said. The police source also told CNN that investigators are focusing on two potential problems relating to the outbreak of the fire. One issue under investigation is a possible problem with the fire alarm system sensors. Investigators' second line of inquiry, the source said, relates to the elevators that were built for the construction workers. The source provided no additional details on that. The bees living on Notre Dame's roof survived the fire Two security guards at the cathedral told police they noticed the flames for the first time only when the flames were already almost 3 meters high ‪at 6:43 p.m. local time (12:43 p.m. ET), indicating the fire alarm sensors might not have been working properly, the police source told CNN. Read More The first alarm rang ‪at 6:15 p.m. local time. An alert flashed on the Notre Dame security control screens showing which sensor was sending the alert. According to the police source, the two security agents went to check the location but didn't see anything at that time. When the second alarm rang ‪at 6:43 p.m. local time, the two security agents followed the alarm system instructions and went to another location at the top of the cathedral, where they then saw the flames. Prosecutors are investigating if a short-circuit caused the fire Paris prosecutors are investigating if an electrical short-circuit caused the fire that ripped through the cathedral. A judicial source told CNN on Thursday that ""we are not excluding any hypothesis at this stage,"" saying that this is not their only line of inquiry. The cathedral was undergoing renovations at the time of the fire. Some scrutiny has fallen on the firms undertaking work on the 150-year-old spire, which collapsed Monday as the flames raged around it. How centuries of priceless treasures were saved at Notre Dame Of the four companies contracted to carry out renovations at Notre Dame, two companies -- scaffolding firm Europe Echafaudage and art conservationists Socra -- had work in progress there at the time of the fire. Neither company had workers on site when the fire broke out. The fire devastated large parts of the 850-year-old building before it was finally extinguished after a nine-hour battle. Scores of priceless artifacts were rescued from the flames, and were taken to the Louvre museum for safekeeping. The bees that live on the roof of Notre Dame also survived the devastating fire, beekeeper Nicolas Geant told CNN. The Paris fire service said the operation was one of the most complex it had ever undertaken, and at one point, it was feared that the entire structure might be lost."
When to look up for the Lyrid meteor shower,us.cnn.com,Ashley Strickland,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/world/lyrid-meteor-shower-how-to-watch-scn/index.html,"(CNN) The annual Lyrid meteor shower will peak on Tuesday morning, but keep your eyes on the sky over the weekend as well.
There hasn't been a meteor shower to light up the sky since early January, and this one will be visible around the globe. The moon was full Friday, so it will still be quite bright in the early morning hours over the weekend and during the peak. Late evening hours based on your location, between 9 p.m. and midnight local time, may be the best time to see ""shooting stars,"" or meteors that burn up in our atmosphere. Pink Moon set to illuminate the skies on Friday That will also be the best time to see slower, longer meteors that streak horizontally across the sky, called earthgrazers. Some of them have trails that glow for seconds after the meteor has disappeared. Typically, the Lyrid meteor shower can showcase between 10 and 20 meteors per hour during the peak, but it's difficult to estimate how many will be visible. Read More The shower occurs this time each year when Earth's orbit crosses paths with that of Comet Thatcher. The comet loses pieces of itself that go flying into our upper atmosphere at 110,000 miles per hour. Lyrid gets its name from the Lyra constellation. The Lyrid shower is one of the oldest known, with records of visible meteors going back 2,700 years, according to EarthSky . If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn't littered with city lights that will obstruct your view. Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness -- without looking at your phone -- so meteors are easier to spot."
Bacon is about to get more expensive,us.cnn.com,"Anneken Tappe, CNN Business",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/investing/bacon-more-expensive-china/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) African swine fever is plaguing China's pork production. The disease is killing multitudes of animals, hitting the global pork supply chain, and driving up prices.
China is one of the biggest producers of pork in the world, with around half of the meat's global output. China's pork production has fallen 10% this year, according to US government statistics. To meet China's insatiable demand for pork products, the country is turning to imports, which are expected to hit a record high in 2019. The European Union, Brazil, Canada and the Unites States are providing the goods. ""China normally accounts for 49% of global pork consumption, while consuming 28% of the world's meat supply,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone. ""As such, this is a big problem for China, and we expect it to be a five to seven year problem before production can be restored."" While prices for lean hog futures — which are traded like other agricultural products such as corn or soy — have skyrocketed, the difference between wholesale and retail pork prices in the United States has been stable over the past few months, according to data from the USDA. Read More But hog prices are near a four-year high and futures for June have rallied nearly 30% since the beginning of March. At some point, the price increase will be too big for retailers to shoulder the burden if the problem sticks around. China will likely do what it can to get pork supplies destined for US consumer and others to its own shores to stem the shortfall, ""pushing pork prices upward until the consumer shift to poultry, beef and other options,"" said Suderman. He sees it ""as a long-term issue that will rise the price of virtually all meat worldwide."" Last year, China produced 54.8 million metric tons of pork, and consumed nearly 60 million tons. By February, China had slaughtered nearly 1 million pigs over six months as it struggled to contain the outbreak of the swine fever, a highly contagious and fatal disease for pigs that is not harmful to humans. Turning to alternative meats, like poultry, will likely help meet the Chinese demand. But production constraints — such as a limited number of refrigerated ocean freighters — will limit the extent to which other meats can fill the gap. All in, China will have a total meat shortfall of 16.2 metric tons over the coming year, Suderman estimated. The increase in pork prices could also show up in China's closely watched economic data. ""Pork prices have large implications for Chinese and emerging market inflation given food prices are the largest factor in consumer inflation and the main component is pork,"" said Nicky Shiels, commodities strategist at Scotiabank. Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Nicky Shiels' last name."
Tesla to shakeup its board of directors,us.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/19/investing/tesla-board-steve-jurvetson/index.html," Tesla revealed Friday that four directors will leave the company — shrinking the size of its board to seven eventually.
The electric-car maker said that it wants to ""streamline"" corporate oversight because its board has grown by four members over the past five years. That has led to ""the duplication of certain areas of experience or expertise"" among its directors, the company said in a filing. Now Tesla is shaking things up to allow the board to ""operate more nimbly and efficiently."" Two directors have agreed not to stand for reelection at Tesla's annual meeting this year, and two more will leave in 2020 or 2021. The rules on CEO tweets weren't made for Elon Musk ""Such agreements did not result from any disagreement between Tesla and any of such directors,"" the company said. Cautious Tesla investors have also been pleading for with the company to tighten oversight of CEO Elon Musk. The disclosure comes just four months after Tesla added two new board members as part of a settlement deal that Musk and Tesla reached with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency wanted Tesla to put stricter checks on Musk's power after accusing him of misleading investors with his tweets about taking Tesla private. But their dispute is far from over : The SEC has since accused Musk of flouting other settlement terms and is looking to hold him in contempt. Read More Tesla's Friday filings say the outgoing board members include Linda Johnson Rice, the chairman and CEO of Johnson Publishing, who joined the board in 2017. The others — Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson — have been with the company over nine years. Jurvetson is considered a close ally to Musk. The venture capitalist was one of Tesla's earliest investors, and he's a director at Musk's rocket company, SpaceX. Jurvetson, who is scheduled to depart in 2020, returned to his role at Tesla this month after taking a year-long leave of absence that he began amid reports of inappropriate workplace behavior and harassment. Jurvetson has denied the allegations. A new filing states that the Tesla board is confident that with three remaining independent members, it is ""poised to lead Tesla with fresh perspectives balanced by deep historical knowledge of our company, while maintaining a wealth of diverse experience and expertise."" 'Put your reasonableness pants on': Judge gives Musk and SEC two weeks to settle dispute over tweets Critics have said that some of Tesla's ""independent board members"" aren't so independent. Oracle's Larry Ellison, for example, reportedly had close ties to Musk before joining the board. He was one of the members that Tesla brought on to comply with the SEC settlement. Other independent directors include 21st Century Fox's James Murdoch and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, head of global human resources at Walgreens. Wilson-Thompson was the other independent director elected after the SEC settlement. Kimbal Musk, Elon's brother, also has a seat on the board. If shareholders approve a plan to restructure the remaining board seats, director terms will be reduced to two years instead of three."
Elizabeth Warren calls for House to begin impeachment proceedings on Trump - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,MJ Lee,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump-impeachment-proceedings/index.html,"(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump Friday.
""The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack,"" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate wrote on Twitter. ""Mueller put the next step in the hands of Congress: 'Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.' The correct process for exercising that authority is impeachment."" Prior to this week, Warren -- like many other Democrats -- had consistently said that she would first need to first see the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller before drawing any conclusions on whether Congress should consider impeachment proceedings against the President. That question has been a divisive one for Democrats in Washington, with many in the party urging caution. Warren's call for impeachment proceedings could foreshadow other national Democrats -- including additional presidential candidates -- following suit in the coming days. The Massachusetts Democrat said on Twitter: ""To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways."" Read More Warren, a vocal critic of Trump, also said that the ""the severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty. That means the House should initiate impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States."" According to a Warren aide, the senator, who was flying back to Boston from Salt Lake City on Thursday, began reading the redacted Mueller report on the plane. She continued reading into the night after getting home. When she was finished, she felt it was her ""duty"" publicly share her thoughts, the aide added. The aide also told CNN that Warren's decision to call on impeachment proceedings does not mean that the topic of impeachment will become the central theme of her 2020 campaign going forward. Warren plans to continue to roll out major policy proposals and discuss on the stump how she believes Washington is ""broken,"" according to the aide. "
A peep into the history of Easter's marshmallow icon,us.cnn.com,"Denise Powell, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/health/peeps-history/index.html,"(CNN) Easter is a popular time for America's bunny- and chick-shaped marshmallow friends known as Peeps. Every day, about 5.5 million Peeps are produced, roughly 2 billion a year.
Peeps may be made with love, but they also have some less-healthy ingredients. Four yellow marshmallow bunny Peeps -- considered one serving -- contain 110 calories and 26 grams of sugar. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 100 calories, or 6 teaspoons, of added sugar a day for women and 150 calories, or 9 teaspoons, for men; for children 2 to 18, the recommendation is fewer than 25 grams of added sugar per day -- less than one serving of bunny Peeps. The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization, gives Peeps a score of nine on its a nutrition scale from one to 10, with one being a food of least concern and 10 being of higher concern. It points out that the treat is more than 81% sugar in weight and contains a nonspecific ""flavor"" ingredient. Beyond sugar, Peeps are made of corn syrup, a preservative called potassium sorbate, tartrazine (a yellow dye) and gelatin derived from pigs. ""The level of gelatin we use in Peeps is actually quite low, lower than most marshmallow products in the market,"" Caitlin Servian, brand manager of Peeps, wrote in an email. Read More Peeps have edible eyes made of carnauba wax derived from the buds and leaves of a Brazilian palm tree. Carnauba wax is also used in some protective coverings for shoes and cars, as well as other candies. Peeps may not be vegetarian, but they are gluten-free. They are also fat-free, but of course our bodies can turn sugar into fat. OK, so they're not a health food. But they are still an edible icon after more than 65 years of existence, with rabid fans all over the world. Let's look at this candy's origin story. 1600: Royal Peep ancestors Maria de' Medici, Queen of France and second wife of King Henry IV of France of the House of Bourbon. The creation of sugar animal figures is not unique to recent American confectionery history. On October 5, 1600 , edible sugar sculptures were displayed at a banquet in Florence, Italy, to celebrate the marriage of Maria de' Medici and Henry IV of France. Early 1900s: New York, the city of Peep dreams In 1910, 19-year-old Russian Jewish immigrant Sam Born arrived in New York from France, ready to take the candy industry by storm. ""A candy maker by trade, Born was responsible for many innovations including the technology to produce chocolate sprinkles, known as Jimmies; the hard chocolate coating used for Eskimo Pies; and the machine that mechanically inserted sticks into lollipops,"" Servian explained. Sam Born, left, and his brothers-in-law, Jack Shaffer and Irv Shaffer. The Willy Wonka-esque Born shared his ""just born"" chocolates in the window of his Brooklyn, New York, store in 1917, indicating that they were freshly made. He would open his own manufacturing company, Just Born, in 1923. The company expanded to an empty printing factory in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in 1932, during the Great Depression. 1950s: Peeps can no longer fly In 1953, Just Born acquired Rodda Candy Co., which originally made the candy we know as Peeps -- but with wings. The original marshmallow chicks were more labor-intensive, requiring manually squeezing marshmallow paste out of pastry tubes. The original Peeps had wings. The factory eventually quickened the process of making a Peep from 27 hours to six minutes. This was due to the effort of Bob Born, Sam's son, who modernized production with mechanical machinery. In 1955, it clipped the marshmallow chicks of their wings to further speed the process. As popular as Peeps are, Just Born's best-selling candy is Mike and Ike fruit chews. 1950s and '60s: The Peeps family expands Peeps' gingerbread-flavored marshmallow men. In addition to the chicks that are popular during Easter, shapes and flavors were created to meet seasonal themes such as Halloween, Christmas and Valentine's Day. Bunny Peeps weren't added until the 1980s . 1990s: Watch out, world, here come the Peeps As Peeps became more popular, the brand diversified its product. By 1998, Peeps were available in five colors : yellow, white, pink, blue and lavender. Original yellow is the best-selling color in the United States, Servian said, followed by pink and blue. Over the years, the company has added other flavors, including orange sherbert, pancakes and syrup, fruit punch, sour watermelon, blue raspberry and party cake. 1999: Peeps meet their match Emory University researchers tested the durability of the marshmallow candy. One of the tests demonstrated how dissolvable they were in water, acetone, sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. Peeps stood strong against those chemical foes. Then came phenol . After an hour in this protein-destroying chemical, toxic to even humans, the only thing left in the solution were the Peeps' eyes. 2000: ""Malcolm in the Middle"" vs. Peeps In the episode "" Traffic Jam ,"" Malcolm's older brother, Francis, makes a bet that results in him eating 100 Peeps (which he refers to as ""Quacks""). Spoiler: He loses the bet and becomes sick from overindulging. 2007: Peeps go sugar-free A ""sugar-free"" Peep entered the market with sugar substitutes like maltitol and isomalt. 2009: Peeps goes brick and mortar The Just Born first retail store, Peeps & Company , opened in National Harbor, Maryland, just outside Washington, for all Peeps pilgrims. The first Peeps store. This was also the year Peeps Delights were introduced: chicks covered in crème-flavored fudge or chocolate. 2013: Football player gets an offer he can't refuse After Dallas Cowboys football player Barry Church chipped his tooth on a Jolly Rancher and needed a root canal, he was given enough soft-to-chew Peeps to last an entire season. 2017: 255 Peeps in five minutes Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
At 24, professional eater Matt Stonie won the second annual World Peeps Eating Championship. He ate 255 Peeps in five minutes, beating his own record by 55. Competitive eaters like Stonie train for this feat by drinking excessive water to expand their stomachs, learning how to control their breathing, controlling calorie consumption in the off-season and exercising . Peeps have survived intense experiments and stood the test of time. They're clearly not going away any time soon."
ADHD treatment: FDA OKs first medical device to treat ADHD in children,us.cnn.com,"Sandee LaMotte, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/20/health/adhd-treatment-etns-device-fda-bn/index.html,"(CNN) The first medical device to treat childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, was OK'd Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration. Designated for children ages 7 to 12 who are not currently on medication for the disorder, the device delivers a low-level electrical pulse to the parts of the brain responsible for ADHD symptoms.
Young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis risk compared to other stimulants, study says ""This new device offers a safe, non-drug option for treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients through the use of mild nerve stimulation, a first of its kind,"" Carlos Peña, director of the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement. Called the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation System, eTNS,and marketed by NeuroSigma, the treatment is only available by prescription and must be monitored by a caregiver. The pocket-sized device is connected by wire to a small adhesive patch placed on the child's forehead above the eyebrows. Designed to be used at home while sleeping, it delivers a ""tingling"" electrical stimulation to branches of the cranial nerve that delivers sensations from the face to the brain. In some states, this birth month is linked to higher rates of ADHD diagnosis, study says A clinical trial of 62 children showed that the eTNS increases activity in the regions of the brain that regulate attention, emotion and behavior, all key components of ADHD. Read More Compared to a placebo, children using the device had statistically significant improvement in their ADHD symptoms, the FDA said, although it could take up to four weeks to see improvement. Authors of the clinical trial called for additional research to examine if the response to treatment will last over time, and its potential impact on brain development with prolonged use. Stephen Hinshaw , a professor of psychology at University of California, Berkeley, has led a large research study of ADHD since 1992. He said the pro of the device is that it ""appears to be safe, and the initial study is thoughtful and promising."" However, the FDA's sign-off was based on just the one ""single, small, short-term trial -- which did not compare eTNS to established treatments."" The trial, he said, was bound to get hopes up, but ""far more research is needed to demonstrate ultimate efficacy."" According to the NeuroSigma website , the device is not currently covered by insurance and could cost just over $1,000 for the starter kit. No serious side were reported during the clinical trial, the FDA said, but common side effects could include fatigue, sleepiness or trouble sleeping, teeth clenching, headache and an increase in appetite. 10% of US children diagnosed with ADHD, study finds The device should not be worn by children under the age of 7, or any child on an insulin pump, pacemaker or implanted neurostimulator. It should also not be used near a cell phone, the FDA said, because the phone's low levels of electromagnetic energy may interrupt the therapy.
ADHD is among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children with ADHD might have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors or be overly active. Doctors typically recommend a few treatment options for children: medication, behavior modification or both. Some commonly prescribed medications are amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, known as Adderall; methylphenidate, known as Concerta or Ritalin; and lisdexamfetamine, known as Vyvanse. While not familiar with the specifics of the eTNS device, Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu said she welcomes ADHD treatment options that don't involve medication. ""I would encourage families to talk with their pediatrician or pediatric neurologist to see if this system might be a good option for their child,"" Shu said.
The device was previously approved for the treatment of epilepsy and depression in Europe and Canada. Studies at UCLA found the stimulation decreased seizure activity by inhibiting overactive neurons in one section of the brain, while stimulating blood flow in the areas that control mood, attention and executive function. The device has also been investigated as a possible treatment for traumatic brain injury in veterans."

Egypt's parliament voted Tuesday in favor of the changes. Read More One amendment would extend a presidential term from four to six years. It would also add two more years to Sisi's current term and allow him to seek re-election for another six-year term in 2024. Another measure would expand Sisi's power over the legislative branch by creating an upper house known as a senate. The president would be able to handpick one-third of the members. The size of the lower house would be reduced, from 596 to 450, with at least 25% of seats reserved for women. The revised charter would also give the president new authority to appoint members of the judiciary. Opponents warn of an authoritarian push Supporters of the changes said they would bolster Egypt's economy, which is struggling to recover from the political turmoil of recent years, and strengthen security. Opponents see a further step toward authoritarianism. Trump to meet Egypt's President Sisi as human rights issues persist ""These amendments aim to expand military trials for civilians, undermine the independence of the judiciary, and strengthen impunity for human rights violations by members of the security forces, furthering the climate of repression that already exists in the country,"" Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Magdalena Mughrabi, said Tuesday in a statement. Sisi, a former general, became president in 2014 after a coup the previous year. He was re-elected in 2018 with 97% of the vote . Since he came into power, Sisi has cracked down on dissent. Human rights groups have accused the regime of widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners, silencing dissidents and using death sentences to ""settle scores."" Sisi's government has denied the allegations."
Premier League: Manchester City return to top of Premier League after narrow win over Tottenham - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/football/premier-league-tottenham-manchester-city-spt-intl/index.html,"Story highlights Man City 1-0 Spurs City return to top of Premier League (CNN) Pep Guardiola must have been sick of the sight of Mauricio Pochettino.
This was the third time in the last 11 days that Manchester City and Tottenham have gone toe to toe, with the north London side coming out on top on the previous two occasions. True, City may have won 4-3 in Wednesday's pulsating Champions League clash but it wasn't enough to stop Spurs advancing to the semifinals on away goals. In the finale of the City-Spurs trilogy, Guardiola's side went at least some way to exorcising the demons of Wednesday's nightmare, which saw Raheem Sterling have a last-minute goal -- a tie winning goal -- disallowed by VAR. READ: Tottenham end Man City's quadruple hopes after mesmerizing clash Read More READ: Where does Man City vs. Spurs rank among Champions League classics? Though that result is likely to haunt City for quite some time, they can at least take comfort in Saturday's crucial, hard-fought 1-0 victory over Tottenham which saw them return to the top of the Premier League. Much was made about City's mentality in the build up to this game and how the team would react to Wednesday's soul-crushing result which seemed to drain the life out of the Etihad. It's the first Premier League goal Phil Foden has scored for City. In his pre-match press conference, Guardiola pointed out that his superstars were still only human but implored them to use that disappointment to fire them to victory as they chase a consecutive Premier League crown in a nail-biting title race. But the players -- with the fans roaring them on from the first whistle -- showed no signs of a Champions League hangover and took the lead inside five minutes. Bernardo Silva's deft ball into the box found Sergio Aguero, who showed impressive awareness and poise to cushion his header for Phil Foden to nod into an empty net. It was the teenager's first league goal for the club, becoming the first player born in the 2000s to score for City in the Premier League and it would prove to be the crucial winner. On a sour note, Kevin De Bruyne -- so impressive in City's recent quadruple-chasing run of games -- was the first casualty of the grueling set of fixtures as he limped off after half an hour with yet another injury. Although Spurs mustered two good first-half chances -- the first saved by Ederson and the second blocked wonderfully by Aymeric Laporte -- they faded in the second, as both sides had appeals fr a penalty turned down. All in all, it was an impressive display of mental strength from City to navigate the first of two difficult Premier League clashes, the second coming in Wednesday's derby against local rivals Manchester United. With Liverpool leading by two points prior to kick off having played a game more, victory ensures City lead the title race again -- for now at least. Jurgen Klopp's side face relegation-threatened Cardiff City on Sunday and could once again return to the top of the Premier League with a win."
Why my friend Loujain al-Hathloul deserves to stand front and center -- and free (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Urooba Jamal,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/20/opinions/loujain-al-hathloul-deserves-nobel-peace-prize-jamal/index.html,"Urooba Jamal ( @uroobajamal ) is a freelance journalist who writes about social movements and international affairs. She is part of Friends of Loujain ( @FreeLoujain ), a collective of Vancouver-based women calling for the release of Loujain al-Hathloul and other detained Saudi women's rights activists. The views expressed here are hers. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) I hadn't looked at the photograph in years. But then news came she faced the death penalty. When I looked at the photo again after so long, I could almost hear her characteristic laughter.
Urooba Jamal It was a photo of a group of us from the Pakistan Students' Association. Front and center in it was my friend, Loujain al-Hathloul. We were pictured together at an event in 2011 at our alma mater, the University of British Columbia (UBC), in Vancouver, Canada. I don't remember exactly, but Loujain probably had, as she often did, driven us to the Pakistani restaurant 40 minutes away from our school to pick up the catered food for the event. We had probably thanked her endlessly, as we often did, for taking us to the event from our dorms, our heels and outfits made of silk, chiffon and lace standing no chance in the Vancouver rain if we walked in them across our enormous campus. The same smiling young woman in the photo we unearthed now faced incarceration and worse for having dared to do the same in the country she grew up in: to drive. Loujain was arrested in May 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, where she had been living, and then removed to Saudi Arabia and detained. While the death penalty rumors thankfully turned out to be false, Loujain's ongoing ordeal is still grim: she faces a number of dubious charges and according to her family has been tortured and sexually harassed while imprisoned. What has been her supposed crime? Peacefully fighting for women's rights in Saudi Arabia. Read More Saudi Arabia cites UN job application as evidence against rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul Loujain is currently facing a closed-door trial, a trial in which a number of her fellow women rights activists have testified that they too were subjected to torture and sexual harassment while detained. The prosecutor overseeing the hearing, I learned from Loujain's brother, Walid al-Hathloul , is denying all allegations of torture. Her fourth hearing, which would have taken place April 17 -- the day she was named as TIME magazine's 100 most influential people of 2019 -- was abruptly adjourned. While Saudi media brand her as a traitor to the kingdom, and international media reduce her to a mere victim, her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize for her groundbreaking work on human rights has been largely ignored. Concurrently, media continue to give far more airtime to the nomination of someone else who is far from deserving of the prize: US President Donald Trump. In an embarrassing gaffe that still pales in comparison to his multitude of indiscretions, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported Trump himself had asked Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to nominate him for the award, a claim Abe refused to deny . The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the Asahi report. Meanwhile the momentum for Loujain's nomination has come from multiple fronts: a recommendation in a New York Times op-ed by journalist Nicholas Kristof; from academics, such as the nomination by Bessma Momani in Canada; to written support from more than a dozen French scholars; to yet more nominations by politicians from Canadian MP Hélène Laverdière to a group of MPs in Norway . JUST WATCHED Saudi sisters who escaped oppression are now free Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Saudi sisters who escaped oppression are now free 03:19 It is absurd that Trump's self-aggrandizing nomination is being given incessant attention, while someone whose peaceful and tireless work spanning many years for the advancement of all Saudi women remains locked behind bars. Loujain receiving the Nobel Peace Prize would send a strong message to the Crown Prince and his rogue gallery of miscreants: that despite their attempts to squander and squash the voice and spirit of a woman who dared to imagine a brighter future for Saudi women — they will fail. Being named a TIME honoree has already shown that the international community has not only taken notice of her efforts, but are rightly lauding her accomplishments. Loujain would join the likes of previous winners such as Malala Yousafzai and Nadia Murad, women from imperialized nations who have overcome incredible adversity — to only have their commitment to the liberation of women globally, strengthen. Loujain has suffered tremendously since her imprisonment almost a year ago, but she's deserving of the award for everything her efforts have accomplished: she's shown extraordinary resolve and bravery in ways that have galvanized women around the world. It wasn't too long after we had both graduated from UBC that Loujain returned to Saudi Arabia, and in her resolve to see women's rights advance there, she began to defy the driving ban and speak out against the male guardianship system. Shortly after her most recent arrest last year -- she had been arrested several times before that since 2014 — the driving ban was overturned in June 2018. The Crown Prince reaped praise for the move, while our friend and other women actually responsible for the historic change were just beginning to undergo what has become their nightmare ordeal. While my sister is in a Saudi jail, Mariah Carey could use her voice to help her That's when Friends of Loujain sprang into action. We are a collective of Vancouver-based women who knew Loujain from our time together at UBC. In this last year, we've taken a number of actions to demand her release. We have been pleased to see growing international attention surrounding Loujain's case; without a doubt, her actions have inspired people globally. Meanwhile, even by Trump's own admission , there is hardly a popular movement behind his Nobel Peace nomination, while his approval rating as President remains low . Highlighting Loujain's conditions as a political prisoner is vital; however, the media ought to also showcase her peaceful activism over the years -- activism that ignited one of the biggest social reforms ever seen in the ultra-conservative absolute monarchy. As a Nobel Peace Prize nominee whose only delinquency has been to peacefully demand equal rights, only one outcome will deliver justice for Loujain: a full pardon that grants her immediate release.

It is my hope that, like in the photo we took all those years ago, Loujain stands front and center again one day soon, to receive her Nobel Peace Prize."
Mitt Romney on Mueller report: I am 'sickened' by 'dishonesty and misdirection' of President Donald Trump - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,"Jamie Ehrlich, CNN",04-20-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/19/politics/romney-mueller-president-trump-reaction/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_topstories+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Top+Stories%29,"Washington (CNN) Republican Sen. Mitt Romney issued a sharp rebuke of President Donald Trump on Friday following the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report , saying he was ""sickened"" by details revealed in the document.
""I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President. I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia,"" the Utah Republican said in a statement. Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice could not clear Trump, according to a redacted version of the special counsel's report released Thursday, which provided new details of Trump's efforts to influence the investigation into his campaign and Russia. As Senate Democrats begin to call for Trump's impeachment based on Mueller's evidence, Romney is one of the first Republican senators to sharply rebuke the actions outlined in the report. Romney has historically been one of the harshest Republican critics of the President. ""Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders,"" Romney said. "
