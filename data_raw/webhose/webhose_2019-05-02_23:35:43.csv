OAKLAND — At no point last season did the Red Sox struggle like this.
Boston was the only team in the big leagues to avoid a four-game losing streak while steamrolling to a championship in 2018. It’s taken less than a week for the Red Sox to fall from those ranks this year, as they suffered through another helpless evening at Oakland Coliseum on Tuesday.
Matt Chapman’s one-out solo homer in the bottom of the first inning was all the Athletics required. Oakland carved its way to a 1-0 victory in breezy, misty conditions that only added to Boston’s misery.
“It’s part of baseball,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “It’s 1-5. It’s only the first two series of the season. Yes, of course, we want to play better. We want to win ballgames.
“Honestly, with the effort today and the game that was played, I’m okay.”
Chris Sale served up the 12th round-tripper allowed by Red Sox starting pitching this season, a liner by Chapman over the wall in left. His six strong innings were otherwise overshadowed by the lowest average fastball velocity of his career – just 89.3 mph – and more questions about why and how much he’s holding back. Sale threw 28 sliders, 29 fastballs and 30 changeups, topping out at 92 mph.
“The name of the game isn’t velocity,” Sale said. “It’s giving your team a chance to win. No matter what you’re featuring that day you’ve got to get as deep into the game as you can and give your team a chance to win when you’re out of there.”
“He dialed it up when he wanted to,” pitching coach Dana LeVangie said. “It’s there. But he knows how important he is to this team. He can pitch regardless of the velocity.”
It was just the second one-strikeout game of Sale’s career in 209 starts. The first came last September against the Mets, an abbreviated three-inning stint inside the final three weeks after he came off the injured list. Sale was ramping up for the playoffs and appears to be taking the same approach with this regular season.
“Especially a starting pitcher, finding the groove and getting comfortable – we’re still working,” Sale said. “It’s a work in progress. That’s no excuse. You’ve got to go out there and find a way.”
“I try to stay away from the velocity thing,” Cora said. “Sometimes you get caught up on it and it’s like, ‘Is he going to be alright?’ He gave us six. It was different, but he gave us six.”
This also marked the second time in as many starts Sale has been on the wrong end of an Oakland shutout here. The previous occasion came on April 21 last season, a 3-0 game in which Sean Manaea threw the first no-hitter at the Red Sox in 25 years. Boston fell to 15-37 in its last 52 games at this venue, a baseball diamond disguised as a cauldron whenever the Red Sox travel west.
“It’s tough,” Sale said. “Losing back-to-back games to start the series, you obviously want to get off to a better start than that. It is what it is. You take it off the chin, show up tomorrow and keep grinding.”
Mike Fiers became the second Oakland starter in as many nights to blank the Red Sox through six innings. Boston threatened more frequently than against Aaron Brooks in Monday's 7-0 defeat, but the end result was the same. Fiers stranded three Red Sox base runners in scoring position, including a pair just 90 feet away.
“There was a lot of slamming bats and helmets,” Cora said. “That’s part of it. We’ll talk to them a little bit. It should be the other way around. They have a good pitching staff.”
Three relievers handled matters from there for the Athletics, but it wasn’t easy. Ryan Buchter left Christian Vazquez at third base by recording strikeouts on all three of his left-left matchups in the seventh. Closer Blake Treinen received all the help he needed in the ninth when Ramon Laureano threw out Xander Bogaerts at third base attempting to stretch a one-out double off the wall in right center.
“That guy is one of the best closers in the game – a lot of movement on his ball,” Bogaerts said. “Frankly we haven’t been swinging it the way we normally do.”
It’s the first time since 2012 Boston has started 1-5 and the first time since August 2017 the Red Sox have dropped four straight games. They staggered to a 69-93 mark in the first campaign and were eliminated in the American League Division Series in the second. Managers Bobby Valentine and John Farrell were each fired in the offseason that followed.

WASHINGTON (AP) "" Showered by raindrops and jeers for much of the game, Bryce Harper put a bat-flipping, celebratory finish on his memorable return to Washington.
Harper crushed a long home run in his final at-bat, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Nationals 8-2 Tuesday night for the franchise's best start in over a century.
Maikel Franco also homered for the Phillies, baseball's only undefeated team at 4-0. They had only done that in 1915 and 1897.
Harper left Washington after playing 927 games over seven years, participating in six All-Star Games and winning the 2015 NL MVP Award. He listened to what the Nationals had to offer, then signed a $330 million, 13-year contract with the rival Phillies in February.
Harper hasn't wasted any time providing returns for the investment. He has three homers and five RBIs in four games, along with a .429 batting average. He drove in three Tuesday.
Booed during every at-bat, Harper thumped a ""take that,"" 458-foot shot in the eighth inning off Jeremy Hellickson. As the ball soared toward the second deck in right field, Harper flipped his bat and circled the bases with delight before celebrating with his new teammates in the visiting dugout.
""It's the emotion of the game. That's it. That's about it,"" he said of the bat flip.
But man, that home run sure felt good.
""I was pretty fired up. I was excited,"" he said. ""I was trying to get back to my teammates as quick as possible and do all my handshakes.""
When Philadelphia's starting lineup was announced during the late stages of a 41-minute rain delay, it became apparent that Harper would not be welcomed back warmly. Many in the slow-arriving crowd of 35,920 booed loudly when his name was announced as the No. 3 hitter, and the derisive shouting continued during a video montage of his biggest moments with the Nationals.
""I heard the boos,"" Harper acknowledged. ""For me, that's part of sports, part of the game.""
The chorus resumed when Harper walked to the plate in the first inning to face three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer. The fans finally cheered when Harper took a strike on the outside corner, and they got even louder when Harper whiffed on a 2-2 changeup .
""Hearing the boos in the first at-bat just reminded me that I have 45,000 people back in Philadelphia screaming for me,"" Harper said.
When he took his position in right field, Harper stood in front of seven fans wearing white shirts that spelled out T-R-A-I-T-O-R.
After striking out twice, Harper doubled to right in the fifth and singled in a run in the sixth to make it 6-0 before connecting in the eighth.
When the game ended, hundreds of Phillies fans remained, chanting ""MVP! MVP!"" as Philadelphia shook hands. The shouting fans included many who had bused in from Philly earlier in the day and sat behind Harper in right field.
Jean Segura had three hits and three RBIs for the Phillies, who were coming off a season-opening sweep of Atlanta.
Zach Eflin (1-0) struck out nine and allowed three hits over five scoreless innings. He outdid Scherzer (0-2), who allowed one earned run in five innings and struck out nine.
Scherzer has started half the Nationals' four games this season. He has a 2.13 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 12 2/3 innings, but Washington has yet to score a run for him.
Very little went right for the Nationals, who fell to 1-3.
Shortstop Trea Turner left in the first inning after being struck by a pitch on his right index finger while trying to bunt. Turner squared at the plate and couldn't back away from a fastball that struck his hand, which was wrapped around the bat.
The injury was diagnosed as a nondisplaced fracture. The timetable for his return is undetermined.
In addition, first baseman Matt Adams left in the fourth inning with back spasms, likely the result of a scary fall early in the game while chasing a foul ball. Drifting behind first base toward the stands, Adams flipped over a fence as he reached into the photo well and landed on his back.
Manager Dave Martinez said Adams was day to day.
Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer in the sixth.
DOMINATED
Philadelphia cleanup hitter Rhys Hoskins went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts against Scherzer and is 0 for 14 with nine Ks lifetime against the right-hander.
STRANGE PERSPECTIVE
Speaking before the game, Harper had no doubt that this was going to be an unusual experience.
""Seeing Max on the mound tonight, Trea at short, Rendon at third and me not standing behind them, it's definitely going to be weird,"" Harper said. ""But I'm looking forward to running out there and doing my job for the Philadelphia Phillies. I'm excited for that next chapter.""
TRAINER'S ROOM
Phillies: LHP Tommy Hunter, on the 10-day injured list with a strained right forearm, was getting ""a series of tests"" in Philadelphia on Tuesday, manager Gabe Kapler said. ""He still felt some soreness,"" Kapler said, ""so we want to make sure that we don't miss anything.""
Nationals: OF/INF Howie Kendrick (hamstring strain) was in the clubhouse Tuesday and appears close to being activated from the injured list. ""He's going to work out with us a couple days and we'll see where he's at,"" Martinez said, adding that a rehabilitative stint might not be necessary. ... OF Michael A. Taylor (knee/hip) will start a rehab assignment Friday with Double-A Harrisburg.
UP NEXT
Phillies: Aaron Nola (1-0, 1.50 ERA) starts in the finale of the two-game series on Wednesday afternoon. The right-hander beat Atlanta in the opener after going 17-6 last year.
Nationals: Anibal Sanchez makes his Nationals debut on Wednesday.

FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) "" The Latest on Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, running for Ferguson City Council (all times local):
11:10 p.m.
Michael Brown's mother has been defeated in her bid for a seat on the City Council in Ferguson, Missouri, where her son died in a police shooting that helped give rise to the national Black Lives Matter movement.
Lesley McSpadden lost Tuesday in a three-way race in Ferguson's 3rd Ward. Unofficial St. Louis County election results show the winner was Fran Griffin.
Brown, a black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014, touching off months of protests and violence. Wilson claimed he was forced to shoot when the unarmed Brown came at him menacingly after attacking the officer during a street confrontation. A St. Louis County grand jury's November 2014 decision not to indict Wilson sparked renewed unrest.
McSpadden told The Associated Press prior to the election that police accountability would have been a top priority.
Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has 21,000 residents, about two-thirds of whom are African-American.

WASHINGTON (AP) "" ""Not any longer.""
And with that, a triumphant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared to close the book Tuesday on a divisive Republican debate, convincing President Donald Trump to shelve plans to replace the Affordable Care Act until after the 2020 election.
""I made it clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate,"" McConnell told reporters.
It was a rare public disclosure of private counsel from the Republican leader. And it signaled that, after two years in Trump's Washington, Republicans on Capitol Hill are figuring out how to handle the president and his impulsive swerves on policy.
Trump insisted Tuesday it was his idea to switch course.
""I wanted to delay it myself,"" Trump said during an event at the White House. ""I want to put it after the election.""
Facing a court deadline, Trump seized on health care last week, backing a lawsuit seeking to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Trump's motivations were as political as they were legislative. He didn't want to cede the issue again in the 2020 campaign, according to a person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to speak publicly.
""We're going to keep the presidency, and we'll vote in the best health care package we've ever had,"" he said.
The Trump and McConnell had not spoken for days. The president stunned Republicans last week by announcing he wanted to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, insisting the GOP could become the ""party of health care."" Republicans wanted no part of a do-over after their failure to replace the law in 2017. Facing a revolt from the ranks, McConnell told the president he needed him to listen, according to a person who was granted anonymity to discuss the private call.
McConnell explained to Trump that senators are open to tackling specific aspects of health care "" namely, trying to lower prescription drug prices. But Trump's promised big, new health care bill wasn't going happen with Democrats running the House. Instead, Trump could focus on the issue during the election.
Several times McConnell told Trump to listen, the person said. And it worked. Trump told McConnell he ""accepted"" the situation and ""would be developing a plan that he would take to the American people during the 2020 campaign."" That night, Trump tweeted as much.
""So we don't have a misunderstanding about that,"" McConnell said Tuesday.
Trump's shift "" he tweeted late Monday that Congress will vote on a GOP plan after the elections ""when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House"" "" made clear that the health care debate will be left for voters to decide during the race for the White House.
That arrangement suits Democrats just fine. They are denouncing Trump's attempt to overturn the ACA in court and floating various health care plans, including an expansion of government-funded Medicare with so called ""Medicare for All,"" setting up a stark contrast between the parties for the campaign trail.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will ""hold Americans hostage through 2020"" on an issue that affects millions of people. He said that Trump ""insists he has a magic plan that we can see if only the American people re-elect him.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Democrats' health care battle with Trump is ""a values fight.""
After Trump dropped the issue on Republicans last week, many hoped it would just go away. They had no comprehensive proposal to replace the ACA law and no big plans to unveil one. Publicly and privately, Republicans tried to talk to Trump.
McConnell has made it clear Republicans should spend their time attacking ""Medicare for All"" proposals rather than revisiting the ACA debate, according to a Republican granted anonymity to discuss the private thinking.
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a Trump confidant, called shifting the debate to 2021 ""a very pragmatic decision."" He said Tuesday that ""spending quality time to develop a comprehensive strategy"" would be ""critical.""
Trump's effort to repeal former President Barack Obama's 2010 health care law narrowly failed in the Senate in 2017 when Republicans controlled both chambers in Congress. He still blames the late Sen. John McCain for joining other senators to oppose a last-ditch plan.
While Republicans gained Senate seats last fall, GOP senators "" particularly those up for re-election next year "" weren't looking for another fight over the law. They saw how the issue played in 2018, when Democrats made it the cornerstone of their successful drive to win back the House.
Preserving health care protections, and especially for people with pre-existing conditions, resonates with voters. According to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 115,000 midterm voters nationwide, nearly 4 in 10 Democratic voters identified health care at the top of a list of key issues.
As Democrats have blamed Republicans for trying to end the ACA, GOP-backed challenges to the 2010 law are making their way through courts.
Last week, the Trump administration told a federal appeals court it wants the entire Affordable Care Act struck down, an outcome that could leave millions of people uninsured.
In his late-Monday tweets, Trump claimed Republicans are developing a plan with cheaper premiums and deductibles that ""will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America.""
Republicans appeared relieved that, for now, that battle will be fought during the campaign, rather than in Congress.
The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune of South Dakota, said the president ""has some big ideas and, to his credit, wants to solve problems."" But Thune said, ""you run into that wall of reality,"" of a divided Congress with Democrats in control of the House, which requires bipartisanship.
""Trying to convey what the obstacles are to getting what he wants to get done in the next two years is something I think a number of our members conveyed to him,"" Thune said.

Mccann, The Associated Press Wednesday Apr 3, 2019 at 12:01 AM Apr 3, 2019 at 12:01 AM
CHICAGO (AP) "" Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot's resounding victory was a clear call for change at City Hall and a historic repudiation of the old-style, insider politics that have long defined the nation's third-largest city.
Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor who'd never been elected to public office, defeated Cook County Board President and longtime City Council member Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday with backing from voters across the city. Late results showed Lightfoot, 56, winning every one of the city's 50 wards.
Lightfoot also made history, becoming the first black woman and the first openly gay person to be elected Chicago mayor. Chicago will become the largest U.S. city to have a black woman serve as mayor when Lightfoot is sworn in May 20. She will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U.S. cities, including Atlanta and New Orleans, and will be the second woman to lead Chicago.
""Out there tonight a lot of little girls and boys are watching. They're watching us, and they're seeing the beginning of something, well, a little bit different,"" Lightfoot told a jubilant crowd at a downtown hotel. ""They're seeing a city reborn.""
She pledged to make Chicago ""a place where your zip code doesn't determine your destiny,"" to address the city's violence and to ""break this city's endless cycle of corruption"" that allows politicians to profit from their office.
Lightfoot emerged as the surprising leader in the first round of voting in February when 14 candidates were on the ballot to succeed Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who decided against running for a third term.
She seized on outrage over a white police officer's fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald to launch her reformer campaign. She got in the race even before Emanuel announced he wouldn't seek re-election amid criticism for initially resisting calls to release video of the shooting.
Joyce Ross, 64, a resident of the city's predominantly black West Side who is a certified nursing assistant, cast her ballot Tuesday for Lightfoot. Ross said she believes Lightfoot will be better able to clean up the police department and curb the city's violence.
She was also bothered by Preckwinkle's association with longtime Alderman Ed Burke, who was indicted earlier this year on charges he tried to shake down a restaurant owner who wanted to build in his ward.
""My momma always said birds of a feather flock together,"" Ross said.
Preckwinkle said she called Lightfoot Tuesday night to congratulate her on a ""hard-fought campaign.""
""While I may be disappointed I'm not disheartened. For one thing, this is clearly a historic night,"" she told a crowd gathered in her South Side neighborhood. ""Not long ago two African American women vying for this position would have been unthinkable. And while it may be true that we took two very different paths to get here, tonight is about the path forward.""
That path will have major challenges. Chicago has been losing population, particularly in predominantly African American neighborhoods hit hardest by violence and a lack of jobs.
The new mayor will take over a city that faces massive financial problems. She will have just a few months to prepare a new budget, which in 2020 is expected to have a roughly $250 million deficit. Lightfoot also will take over the worst-funded public pensions of any major U.S. city. Chicago's annual payments to the retirement systems are slated to grow by $1.2 billion by 2023.
She has expressed support for a casino in Chicago and changing the state's income tax system to a graduated tax, in which higher earners are taxed at a higher rate "" two measures lawmakers have tried for unsuccessfully for years to pass.
Violence and policing will also continue to be an issue, and one that has proven to be politically difficult.
The Chicago Police Department must implement a federally monitored consent decree approved in January. It followed the McDonald killing and a U.S. Justice Department review that found a long history of excessive use of force and racial bias by officers.
While voters also elected several newcomers over City Council veterans, Lightfoot will have to work with a council that has a sizable number of members who are the type of politicians she railed against during her campaign.

Michael Brown's mother loses Ferguson City Council race,www.providencejournal.com,"Jim Salter, The Associated Press",04-04-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190402/michael-browns-mother-loses-ferguson-city-council-race?rssfeed=true,"Michael Brown's mother loses Ferguson City Council race Jim Salter, The Associated Press Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 12:30 AM Apr 3, 2019 at 12:30 AM
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) "" Michael Brown's mother was defeated Tuesday in her bid for a seat on the City Council in Ferguson, Missouri, where her son died in a police shooting that helped give rise to the national Black Lives Matter movement.
Lesley McSpadden lost in a three-way race in Ferguson's 3rd Ward. Unofficial St. Louis County election results show the winner was Fran Griffin. The race also featured Keith Kallstrom, who was the incumbent.
""I congratulate Fran on her victory. I feel proud of the positive race we ran, and I loved talking to the Ferguson community,"" McSpadden said late Tuesday night in an emailed statement. ""Tomorrow, the work continues and I intend to be a part of it no matter my position. I'm not going anywhere.""
Brown, a black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9, 2014, touching off months of protests and violence. Wilson claimed he was forced to shoot when the unarmed Brown came at him menacingly after attacking the officer during a street confrontation. A St. Louis County grand jury's November 2014 decision not to indict Wilson sparked renewed unrest in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the 21,000 residents are black.
""I wanted to go back and do something right in a place that did something so very wrong to my son, and I think that's what my son would want as well,"" McSpadden, 39, said in an interview with The Associated Press prior to the election. She had pledged to make police accountability one of her top priorities.
McSpadden, who spelled her first name ""Lezley"" for an autobiography but said she otherwise goes by Lesley, was new at being a candidate but has been at the edge of politics since her son's death. She's been front and center in the national Black Lives Matter movement. She endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in early 2016, at a time when Clinton was fending off a primary challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
She was among seven ""Mothers of the Movement"" who appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Those mothers lost children in police shootings, in police custody or from gun violence. Also in 2016, McSpadden testified in favor of a Missouri Senate bill aimed at increasing use of police body cameras.
In the aftermath of Brown's death, Ferguson's criminal justice system drew heavy criticism for its treatment of poor and minority residents. Police were accused of singling out blacks for unnecessary traffic stops and harassing them on the street. The municipal court was accused of heaping on fines for minor offenses.
While the U.S. Department of Justice also found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, the agency's blistering report of the police and municipal court practices led to a consent agreement requiring reforms that are still being implemented.
McSpadden's campaign drew skepticism from some in Ferguson. LaTasha Brown, president of the Southeast Ferguson Neighborhood Association, said she was concerned that McSpadden mostly campaigned from afar rather than getting in touch with the community.
""The 3rd Ward needs somebody who's going to mingle with the people,"" Brown said. ""You can't make change from a distance. If you don't know what your constituents are going through, if you're not there to hear what they're saying, how can you lead these people and make decisions for these people?""
Griffin did not immediately return a phone call for comment Tuesday night. Both she and Kallstrom have long been active in Ferguson.
Griffin has served on several boards and commissions, including serving on the city's Parks and Recreation Board. Kallstrom was a councilman for 10 years, took seven years off, then won three-year terms in 2013 and 2016.
McSpadden said she moved to Ferguson a year ago from a neighboring community specifically to run for the council.
""I wanted to come back to a place that caused me so much pain and did me so wrong, and to do something right,"" McSpadden told the AP. Never miss a story

Maduro loyalists strip Venezuela's Juan Guaido of immunity,www.providencejournal.com,"Scott Smith, The Associated Press",04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190402/maduro-loyalists-strip-venezuelas-juan-guaido-of-immunity?rssfeed=true,"Maduro loyalists strip Venezuela's Juan Guaido of immunity Scott Smith, The Associated Press Tuesday Apr 2, 2019 at 8:26 PM Apr 2, 2019 at 10:54 PM
CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) "" Maduro loyalists stripped Venezuela's Juan Guaidó of immunity Tuesday, paving the way for the opposition leader's prosecution and potential arrest for supposedly violating the constitution when he declared himself interim president.
But whether the government of President Nicolas Maduro will take action against the 35-year-old lawmaker following the Constituent Assembly's decision remains unclear. Guaidó has embarked on an international campaign to topple the president's socialist administration amid deepening social unrest in the country plagued by nearly a month of power outages .
He declared himself Venezuela's interim president in January, and vowed to overthrow Maduro. So far, however, Maduro has avoided jailing the man that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and roughly 50 other nations recognize as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
A defiant Guaidó spoke publicly moments after the vote, saying he's undeterred, while knowing he runs the risk of being ""kidnapped"" by the Maduro government.
""We are aware of that,"" Guaido said. ""But we will not change our path.""
He cited low wages driving millions abroad and the spate of blackouts that have crippled the nation's public transportation, water services and communications.
The Trump administration has threatened the Maduro government with a strong response if Guaido is harmed and Florida Senator Marco Rubio "" who has Trump's ear on Venezuela policy "" said before the vote that nations recognizing Guaidó as his country's legitimate leader should take any attempt by Maduro's government to ""abduct"" him as a coup.
""And anyone who cooperates with this should be treated as a coup plotter & dealt with accordingly,"" Rubio said on Twitter.
However, the vote against Guaidó was unanimous, and Constituent Assembly president and socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello accused the opposition of naively inviting a foreign invasion and of inciting a civil war. �
""They don't care about the deaths,"" Cabello said. ""They don't have the slightest idea ??what the consequences of war are for a country.""
The Constituent Assembly, which is made up entirely of Maduro loyalists, met a day after Maduro ally and Venezuela Supreme Court of Justice Maikel Moreno ordered it to strip Guaidó's immunity for violating an order banning him leaving the country while under investigation by the attorney general. The opposition leader is also accused of inciting violence through street protests, and of receiving illicit funds from abroad.
The Constitution guarantees immunity for elected officials, and says that in order to withdraw immunity the accused lawmaker must be given a preliminary hearing before the Supreme Court. The action must be approved by the National Assembly "" steps that weren't taken in Guaidó's case.
The Constitutional Assembly was created two years ago, when Maduro became frustrated by the democratically elected and opposition-dominated National Assembly rejected the president's policies. Its creation essentially replaced the National Assembly, rendering it powerless.
Guaidó has dismissed the Maduro-stacked high court and Constituent Assembly as illegitimate, and continued his calls for Maduro to step down.
Guaidó has come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, and Tuesday night's vote was but the latest instance of that. Officials have jailed his chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, and accused him of involvement in a ""terrorist"" scheme to overthrow the government. Maduro's government also barred Guaidó from holding public office for 15 years for allegedly hiding or falsifying data in his sworn statement of assets.
The opposition leader, however, has drawn masses of Venezuelans into the streets and garnered broad international support, demanding Maduro give up rule of the crisis-wracked nation.
Defying the court order, Guaidó left the country in late February for a ten-day tour of South America, meeting with foreign leaders who support the Venezuelan opposition and who reject Maduro's election last year for a second six-year term.
Maduro blames Washington of attempting a coup to overthrow him and install Guaidó's puppet government aimed at seizing Venezuela's vast oil reserves.
Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the Maduro government may be assessing its strength amid the global community.
""This seems like an attempt to test the waters, weighing how the international community would react to detaining Guaido,"" Ramsey said. ""The government is reasserting its authority while also sending a clear signal to the opposition: we are in control.""

"The Trailer for Joker Won’t Be Out Until Wednesday, So Here Are Trailers for the Movies People Are Already Comparing It To",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/joker-teaser-trailer-joaquin-phoenix-requiem-taxi-driver-king-comedy.html,"Way to manage expectations! Columbia The teaser for Joker debuted at CinemaCon in Las Vegas on Tuesday, giving attendees a first look at Warner Bros.’ latest take on the venerable Batman villain, which will star Joaquin Phoenix. The teaser will be on the internet tomorrow—there’s not even a teaser for the teaser !—but reactions have begun rolling in on social media from people who saw it. According to Jason Guerrasio of Business Insider, the new film “has a very TAXI DRIVER vibe to it, but def a lot more twisted”: JOKER looks fucking insane!!! Has a very TAXI DRIVER vibe to it, but def a lot more twisted. You’ll see the footage we just saw tomorrow. #CinemaCon — Jason Guerrasio (@JasonGuerrasio) April 2, 2019 Scott Wampler at Birth, Movies, Death compared the film to a different Scorsese classic, plus Darren Aronofsky’s grim Hubert Selby Jr. adaptation Requiem for a Dream : Shots in the JOKER trailer evoke REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, KING OF COMEDY, much more. Very weird, very well cut, you do get to hear Phoenix’s Joker laugh. I fucking loved it. — Scott Wampler™ @ CinemaCon (@ScottWamplerBMD) April 2, 2019 Joker was directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay by Phillips and 8 Mile writer Scott Silver. Taxi Driver , The King of Comedy , and Requiem for a Dream all have some connection to Joker : Silver got a special thanks in the credits for Requiem for a Dream for some reason or another, and Scorsese was attached to produce Joker before dropping out last summer. While we’re all anxiously awaiting the teaser’s debut, we can try to reverse engineer it from the non-superhero-related movies it evokes. First, here’s the original trailer for Taxi Driver , a 1976 drama about a Vietnam vet who goes on a bloody rampage after Batman allows him to fall into a vat of chemicals that dye his hair green: It is easy to forget just how scuzzy something has to look before a Taxi Driver comparison is apt. The King of Comedy is a more attainable goal, scuzz-wise, so here’s how they sold that back in the day. Robert De Niro plays Rupert Pupkin, a would-be standup who goes on a bloody rampage after Batman allows him to fall into a vat of chemicals that dye his hair green: The shot in the trailer of De Niro in front of his cutout audience is one of the defining images of the 20 th century, and since Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker is reported to be a failed stand-up, it’s a natural thing for Phillips to quote from. De Niro reportedly appears in the new trailer as a talk show host, presumably a riff on Jerry Lewis’ role in the original film, in which he played Batman. Then there’s the odd man out, Requiem for a Dream . If you haven’t seen it recently, and have forgotten how frenetic movies of the early aughts tended to be, revisit the trailer for this Suicide Squad prequel, in which a young Jared Leto goes on a bloody rampage after Batman allows him to fall into a vat of chemicals that dye his hair green: It’s not really clear where the stylistic overlap between this filmand classic Scorsese films might be, but as Mike Hindes’ legendary Toy Story 2 trailer shows, you can improve just about anything by sprinkling it liberally with Requiem for a Dream : Joker comes out October 4. While we don’t know for sure exactly what kind of movie these influences are going to add up to, one thing’s for certain: Things are going to get … twisted.

Watch: Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel Roast Trump's 'Oranges' Gaffe,www.mediaite.com,Tommy Christopher,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-stephen-colbert-and-jimmy-kimmel-mercilessly-roast-trumps-oranges-gaffe/,"ORANGE IS THE NEW WHACK Watch: Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel Mercilessly Roast Trump’s ‘Oranges’ Gaffe by Tommy Christopher | Apr 3rd, 2019, 12:58 am
Donald Trump provided an entire orchard of laughs for late night hosts Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel when he mangled the word “origins” three times, instead musing about the “oranges” of Special Counsel Robert Mueller ‘s investigation.
On Tuesday night’s edition of CBS’ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Colbert introduced Trump’s Oval Office gaffe by asking his audience to “See if you can notice his small slip of the brain.”
He then played the clip of Trump substituting “orange” for “origins,” and riffed on the citrus theme.
“Yes! Yes, sir! We must take a look at the Oranges of the investigation! I say it is high clemen-time we do so!” Colbert said.
“The American people will not stand-gerine for it any longer!” he continued, adding “We can vitamin C right through the lies! We tropi-can handle the juice!”
Colbert then rolled out the classic orange-related “knock-knock” joke, the punchline of which we will not spoil for you.
Over on ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel joked that “What happens is he wakes up every morning, sees the color of his face and the rest of the day he has that word stuck in his head. ”
Perhaps the funniest punchline came from Trump’s own White House, which noted Trump’s gaffe in its official transcript by inventing an entire new word, rather than admit Trump said “oranges” three times:
I hope they now go and take a look at the oringes [origins] — the origins of the investigation, the beginnings of that investigation. If you look at the origin of the investigation — where it started; how it started; who started it, whether it’s McCabe or Comey or a lot of them; where does it go; how high up in the White House did it go — you will all get Pulitzer Prizes, okay? You’d all get Pulitzer Prizes. You should have looked at it a long time ago.
And that’s the only thing that’s disappointing to me about the Mueller report. The Mueller report, I wish, covered the oringes [origins] of how it started — the beginnings of the investigation and how it started.
That is the real transcript, via email from The White House, perhaps the best evidence yet that this presidency is not from concentrate.

Strengthening women's participation in local governance: lessons and strategies,iknowpolitics.org,Editor,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://iknowpolitics.org/en/learn/knowledge-resources/strengthening-womens-participation-local-governance-lessons-and-strategies,"Share Print this article South Africa has made great strides in establishing a constitutional and legislative framework for building a participatory democracy. This paper seeks to explore the extent to which existing participatory mechanisms enable active participation by women in municipal processes, and possible alternative approaches and models to strengthen this. A gap in studies thus far reveals the need to examine to what extent current participation mechanisms accommodate equity issues by enabling marginalized or vulnerable groups to participate in governance, and women living in poverty, in particular. The paper commences with an assessment of the existing policy framework for public participation, and then – drawing on literature and case studies on approaches and models for strengthening women's participation – puts forward recommendations in this regard.

The strong social development indicator of women in areas such as health and education has not translated into their increased political participation. As such, this study focuses on the level of women’s participation in local governance and explores why there is a low level of political participation of women in local governance. Both quantitative and qualitative methods comprising of questionnaire survey, interviews and focus group discussions were employed in this study. The findings show organized collective involvement of women was effective only in social welfare, livelihood and social security than political participation. The study also reveals that the low level of political participation by women is attributable to biological, economic, psychological, religious and political factors. Overall, it was found that although women are interested in participating in local governance, they have a lack of space for political participation. Click here to see the report. Resource type:"

Contesting gender quotas: dynamics of resistance,iknowpolitics.org,Editor,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://iknowpolitics.org/en/learn/knowledge-resources/contesting-gender-quotas-dynamics-resistance,"Share Print this article Gender quotas have diffused rapidly around the globe in recent decades, suggesting widespread and dramatic transformations in women's access to political power. Yet, quotas often face serious challenges following their introduction, resulting in a gap between quota requirements and electoral outcomes. To explore these dynamics, this article develops a theoretical account of how and why political elites resist the changes called for by quota reforms. It argues that three tools predicated upon women's exclusion from the political sphere – false universalism and political principles, male power and political survival, and gender and leadership norms – are often mobilized to render quotas illegitimate, making resistance understandable and, indeed, even desirable on a host of grounds. The article then catalogues trends in resistance at different stages of the electoral process, integrating materials from case studies around the world – and exposing a wide range of strategies, often creative, to subvert the impact of quota policies. Adopting gender quotas may thus be only the beginning – rather than the end – of a long and contested process to empower women as political actors. Click here to see the report. Resource type:"

Before the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iranian women were acquiring rights along with women in other parts of the world. Hundreds served on elected local councils and millions were in the workforce , including as judges, civil servants, ambassadors and police officers.
The Iranian Islamic Revolution wiped out those gains.
For the past four decades, Iranian women have fought back to regain a few of their basic human freedoms, including what they could study and what jobs they could hold. But the harsh reality for the 40 million women in Iran is that the law recognizes the husband as the head of the family, and the wife must obey him in all matters, including employment.
The Iranian economy could drastically improve if the regime allowed women to fully participate in the workforce; Iran’s gross domestic product could increase by 40 percent, according to an International Monetary Fund estimate.
