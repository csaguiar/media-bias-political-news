"New U.S. diabetes cases fall, even as obesity rates rise",www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/new-u-s-diabetes-cases-fall-even-obesity-rates-rise-n1010996,"The number of new diabetes cases among U.S. adults keeps falling, even as obesity rates climb , and health officials aren't sure why. New federal data released Tuesday found the number of new diabetes diagnoses fell to about 1.3 million in 2017, down from 1.7 million in 2009.
Earlier research had spotted a decline, and the new report shows it's been going on for close to a decade. But health officials are not celebrating.
""The bottom line is we don't know for sure what's driving these trends,"" said the lead author of the new report, Dr. Stephen Benoit of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among the possibilities: Changes in testing and getting people to improve their health before becoming diabetic.
Growing concern about the soaring cost of insulin Jan. 22, 2019 02:24 The report was published by the journal BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care . The statistics run through 2017. Last year's numbers are not yet available, Benoit said.
Diabetes is a disease in which sugar builds up in the blood. The most common form is tied to obesity, and the number of diabetics ballooned as U.S. obesity rates increased.
But other factors also might have pushed up annual diabetes diagnoses from 2000 to 2010, and they may partly explain why the numbers have been going down since, some experts said.
First, the diagnostic threshold was lowered in the late 1990s. That caused more people to be counted as diabetics, but the impact of that may have played out.
""We might have mined out a lot of the previously unrecognized cases"" and so new diagnoses in the last several years are more likely to be actual new illnesses, said Dr. John Buse, a University of North Carolina diabetes expert.
Meanwhile, doctors have increasingly used a newer blood test to diagnose diabetes. It's much easier than tests that required patients to fast for 12 hours or to undergo repeated blood draws over two hours.
The American Diabetes Association recommended the new test, known as the hemoglobin A1C blood test , for routine screening in 2010. Because it's easier to do, it would be expected to lead to more diagnoses. But some experts say it may miss a large proportion of early cases in which people aren't showing symptoms. ""You may be missing people that would have been diagnosed"" with older tests, Benoit said.
Another possibility: Increasingly, more doctors have been diagnosing ""prediabetes,"" a health condition in which blood sugar levels are high but not high enough to hit the diabetes threshold. Physicians typically push such patients into exercise programs and urge them to change their diet.
""Prediabetes is becoming a more accepted diagnosis"" and may be causing an increasing number of patients to improve their health before becoming diabetic, said Dr. Tannaz Moin, a UCLA expert.
The new report is based on a large national survey conducted by the government every year. Participants were asked if they had been diagnosed with diabetes, and also if the diagnosis was made in the previous year.
It found the rate of new diabetes cases fell to 6 per 1,000 U.S. adults in 2017, from 9.2 per 1,000 in 2009. That's a 35 percent drop, and marks the longest decline since the government started tracking the statistic nearly 40 years ago, according to the CDC.
The decrease was mainly seen among white adults, the researchers said.
Meanwhile, the overall estimate of how many Americans have diabetes — whether the diagnosis is recent or not — has been holding steady at 80 per 1,000 U.S. adults. That translates to about 21 million Americans.

Netflix says it will team up with ACLU in 'fight' against Georgia abortion law,www.nbcnews.com,Daniel Arkin,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/netflix-says-it-will-team-aclu-fight-against-georgia-abortion-n1010921,"America's top entertainment companies have largely stayed quiet ever since Georgia, a major hub for film and television productions, passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. But on Monday, Netflix stepped into the fray and announced it would ""fight"" against Georgia's controversial ""heartbeat bill.""
The streaming giant — which produces popular series such as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark"" in the state — said it will team up with the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups to challenge the law.
""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" Ted Sarandos, chief content officer of Netflix, said in a statement. ""It's why we will work with the ACLU and others to fight it in court.""
Sarandos said that the company would continue to film in Georgia ""while also supporting partners and artists who choose not to."" He added that if the law were to take effect in 2020, Netflix would ""rethink our entire investment in Georgia.""
In an email to NBC News, the ACLU thanked Netflix for ""offering to support our upcoming lawsuit against Georgia's unconstitutional abortion ban.""
It was not immediately clear what other groups Netflix planned to partner with in its fight against the law. The company said it could not provide additional details at this time.
In recent weeks, entertainment industry backlash to the law has been limited to independent, small-scale production companies , including Color Force (""Crazy Rich Asians""), Killer Films (""Boys Don't Cry""), and ""The Wire"" creator David Simon's Blown Deadline Productions.
The law also drew criticism and calls for a boycott from individual performers, such as #MeToo activist Alyssa Milano (Netflix's ""Insatiable""), ""This Is Us"" star Mandy Moore, ""Wild Wild Country"" co-producer Mark Duplass, and Mark Hamill of the ""Star Wars"" franchise.
Don’t give your business to Georgia. Will you pledge with me not to film anything in Georgia until they reverse this backwards legislation?
— Mark Duplass (@MarkDuplass) May 9, 2019 Two high-profile projects — Amazon Studios' 10-episode drama series ""The Power,"" directed by Reed Morano (""The Handmaid's Tale"") and Lionsgate's ""Barb and Star Go the Vista Del Mar,"" co-starring Kristen Wiig — withdrew from planned shoots in the state.
Other industry players, such as J.J. Abrams and Jordan Peele , who are co-producing HBO's upcoming horror series ""Lovecraft Country"" — have announced they would keep plans to film in Georgia but donate their ""episodic fees"" to groups opposing the law, including the ACLU and Fair Fight Georgia.
Georgia's bill, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on May 7, would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks, before some women know they are pregnant.
""Film and television production in Georgia supports more than 92,000 jobs and brings significant economic benefits to communities and families. It is important to remember that similar legislation has been attempted in other states, and has either been enjoined by the courts or is currently being challenged,"" said Chris Ortman, a spokesman for the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), an industry lobbying group.
""The outcome in Georgia will also be determined through the legal process,"" Ortman added.
In response to requests for comment, spokespeople for Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures referred NBC News to the MPAA statement. (Universal Pictures is owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)
Georgia's generous tax incentives — uncapped credits, chief among them — have helped turn the state into a production behemoth, leading some in the industry to call it ""Hollywood of the South.""
The state is the shooting location for AMC's hit zombie saga ""The Walking Dead"" and recent entries in the Marvel franchise, including ""Black Panther."" In 2016, 17 of the 100 highest-grossing American movies were filmed in the state, according to the nonprofit Film LA .
In addition to ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark,"" the list of shows Netflix has shot in Georgia includes ""Insatiable,"" ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" and the first two seasons of the ""Queer Eye"" reboot.
The streaming service's big-name competitors — including Disney, AT&T's Warner Bros., and Sony — were relatively more vocal in 2016 amid a debate over a Georgia bill that would have legalized ""faith-based"" refusal of services to LGBTQ people.
Disney and Netflix threatened to yank productions from the state; CBS, Sony, Time Warner and other leading media companies publicly decried the proposed law. The bill was eventually vetoed by then-Republican Gov. Nathan Deal.
Federal Election Commission data reviewed by NBC News shows that Netflix has donated some $10,000 to Los Angeles County's Planned Parenthood Advocacy Project in the last five years.

Man sentenced to 8 years for wife's death on honeymoon,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-sentenced-8-years-wife-s-death-honeymoon-n1011016,"MIAMI — A man whose wife disappeared while they honeymooned at sea was sentenced by a federal judge to eight years in prison for involuntary manslaughter. Lewis Bennett, 42, apologized to the family of Isabella Hellman during a Tuesday hearing before U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami. He waived his right to appeal.
Defense attorneys sought a 7-year sentence, a year lower than the maximum number spelled out in a plea agreement reached last November. Bennett was originally charged with murder, with investigators alleging he intentionally tried to sink the boat, but later dropped the charges.
""It's not because I expect that he will commit this crime again,"" Judge Moreno said. ""Sentencing is for punishment.""
Lewis Bennett killed his wife, Isabella Hellmann, while on their honeymoon at sea in 2017. Broward Sheriff?s Office Before Moreno announced his decision, Bennett, a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom, asked the judge that he let him get out of prison sooner so he could continue to raise the couple's daughter, who was an infant when the mother vanished. Emelia Bennett turns 3 in July and is being raised by his parents in Scotland.
""If you may permit me to be with my daughter as soon as possible,"" Bennett said. ""I want to bring her up in a manner that is respectful to my wife's wishes.""
But Moreno sided with prosecutors and chose eight years in prison as the sentence and three years on supervised release.
Hellman disappeared as the couple sailed off the Bahamas in May 2017.
A statement from the U.S. Attorney's office says Bennett had experience sailing, including training on emergency procedures and had previously traveled from St. Marteen to Australia. His wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Cuba, had not trained in emergency sailing procedures and had less experience, prosecutors said.
The couple had been married for three months when they set sail to St. Marteen, Puerto Rico and Cuba for a delayed honeymoon in late April. After they left Cuba on May 14, Bennett asked Hellman take over control of the boat for the night so he could go rest in the boat's cabin, according to court documents. He didn't require her to wear a life jacket, harness or personal locator, prosecutors said in the statement.
He said he woke up when the craft hit something, and Hellman was missing.
Assistant U.S. attorney Kurt Lunkenheimer said on Tuesday that Bennett ""did not search for her diligently enough despite him being an experienced sailor.""
The government maintained he didn't use the satellite phone to call for help. Instead, he loaded provisions and stolen silver coins onto a life raft and boarded it. Prosecutors said he called for help 45 minutes after he had woken up realizing his wife was gone.
A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter rescued him and flew him to the Florida Keys. Authorities searched for Hellman for four days, but never found her body. A Florida state judge declared Hellman dead earlier this month to clear the way for the couple's daughter to inherit her mother's estate.
""Hellman's death occurred as a result of Bennett's knowledge of circumstances that existed that could have reasonably enabled him to foresee threat to life,"" said the U.S. Attorney's office statement Tuesday.
The FBI said an inspection found that holes in the hull were inflicted from the inside and hatches were opened in a deliberate attempt to sink the boat.
Bennett was initially arrested and charged with murder last year before reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors. He had already pleaded guilty to transporting $100,000 in stolen coins.
The defense attorney declined to comment. An attorney for Hellman's family said her relatives were satisfied with the judge's decisions and were excited they would soon be able to visit Emelia in Scotland.
""There is nothing that can or could be done to bring Isabella back,"" said Mitchell Kitroser, a lawyer who spoke on behalf of the Hellman's family and said they were planning a visit in June. Emelia ""lost her mom but that doesn't mean that she has lost her mom's family.""
An earlier version of this report had an incorrect age for Lewis Bennett.

"Lawmakers, activists renew battle to legalize some abortions in Argentina",www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/lawmakers-activists-renew-battle-legalize-some-abortions-argentina-n1010956,"Latino Lawmakers, activists renew battle to legalize some abortions in Argentina ""Abortion continues to be practiced in terrible conditions and women continue to die,” said Amnesty International Argentina director Mariela Belski. Activists with green handkerchiefs, which symbolizes the abortion rights movement, demonstrate to mark the revival of their campaign to legalize abortion, in front of the National Congress in Buenos Aires, on May 28, 2019. Emiliano Lasalvia / AFP - Getty Images Breaking News Emails May 28, 2019, 6:33 PM UTC By Associated Press BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — Argentine activists on Tuesday were launching a renewed effort to legalize elective abortions in the homeland of Pope Francis after narrowly falling short last year. Lawmakers said they would introduce a bill to legalize abortion for pregnancies up to 14 weeks. A similar measure last year passed the lower house of Congress but was defeated in the Senate under heavy opposition by religious organizations. The grassroots movement behind the legislation came closer than ever before to approval and activists promised to continue their efforts to expand women’s reproductive rights. Backers hope elections this year will bring in senators more favorable to their cause. The bill was being introduced as demonstrations marking the International Day of Action for Women’s Health were being held Argentina and other nations. The Argentine movement has gathered international support, with Penelope Cruz and several other actors at the Cannes film festival holding up the green handkerchiefs that symbolize the abortion movement. “After last year’s rejection, it’s evident that abortion continues to be practiced in terrible conditions and women continue to die...,” said Amnesty International Argentina director Mariela Belski. “The state must settle its debt and provide abortion services without improper restrictions, discrimination and punishment.” Argentina now allows abortion only in cases of rape or a risk to a woman’s health. But Argentine women continue to undergo illegal abortions and thousands of women, mostly poor, are hospitalized each year for complications. The health minister estimates that more than 350,000 clandestine abortions are carried out each year, while human rights groups estimate the number to be as high as a half million. Activists take part in a rally in favor of legalizing abortion, outside the National Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 28, 2019. Agustin Marcarian / Reuters The new bill protects women who carry out their own abortions from any sanctions. The new bill differs from last year’s with a new section focused on sexual education and counseling for women. It also sets prison terms of between three months and one year to health establishments or doctors who “unjustifiably delay,” block or refuse to carry out an elective abortion within the terms of the law, and longer prison terms if that action leads to damage to a woman’s health or causes her death. Last year, conservative President Mauricio Macri had promised to sign the legislation if it passed Congress even though he opposes abortion. After it was rejected in the Senate, Macri said that the debate would continue. Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage in 2010. More recently, the Ni Una Menos, or Not One Less , movement created in Argentina to fight violence against women has spread worldwide. Efforts to ease or tighten abortion restrictions have repeatedly emerged across Latin America and the Caribbean in recent years as socially conservative countries grapple with shifting views on once-taboo issues and the church continues to lose influence to secularism and a crisis of confidence after an avalanche of clerical sex abuse scandals. Pope Francis last year denounced abortion as the “white glove” equivalent of Nazi-era eugenics programs and urged families “to accept the children that God gives them.” The pope recently said that abortion can never be condoned, even when the fetus is seriously ill or likely to die. He also urged doctors and priests to support families to carry such pregnancies to term. “Is it licit to throw away a life to resolve a problem?” the pontiff asked. “Is it licit to hire a hit man to resolve a problem?” His comments came as the abortion debate is rousing renewed debate in the U.S. with state initiatives seeking to restrict the procedure. In 2017, Chile became the last country in South America to drop a ban on abortions in all cases, though some countries in Central America still prohibit abortions without exceptions."
'Bengali Harlem' documentary explores an early wave of South Asian immigration,www.nbcnews.com,Lakshmi Gandhi,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/bengali-harlem-documentary-explores-early-wave-south-asian-immigration-n1003781,"When filmmaker and writer Vivek Bald first met actor Aladdin Ullah in the early 2000s, he was instantly intrigued by the story of Ullah’s family. The actor and comedian said his father, Habib, was born in what is now Bangladesh and arrived in New York in the 1920s when he jumped off a British steamship he and other South Asian men were working on.
“I had a whole series of historical questions that I thought his father's story raised,” Bald recalled. “Was his father part of a larger migration of South Asians — particularly of South Asian Muslims — to the United States that had just not been recorded in history?”
Related writeourstories writeourstories Write Our Stories: Asian Pacific American History and Heritage Ullah and Bald’s exploration of this history is the subject of ""Bengali Harlem,"" a book, web project and upcoming documentary , which received a grant to finish production earlier this year from the Center for Asian American Media.
Bald's 1994 documentary ""Taxi-vala/Auto-biography” also explored the lives of South Asian workers in New York. He felt drawn to Habib Ullah’s story not only because it was dramatic, but also because the man’s early years were during an era of intense anti-Asian sentiment in the United States.
The Immigration Act of 1917 prohibited immigration from South and Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and its predecessor -- the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 -- had completely halted all arrivals from Asia.
“So what stood out to me was that his father came here after that really strict anti-immigration law was passed in 1917,” Bald said. “And he lived out the majority of his adult life in the United States during the height of exclusion between 1917 and 1965.”
But while Bald and Ullah began to talk about creating a documentary about Habib Ullah and other South Asian immigrants of his generation, Bald felt historical details were missing. As he searched for those answers, he decided to pursue a doctorate at New York University.
“For a number of years, I concentrated on answering that question of ‘Was Aladdin's father part of a larger history?’” Bald, now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said.
As Bald worked on that question, his 2015 book “Bengali Harlem and the Lost Histories of South Asian America” began to take shape. Bald said it ""became clear"" that Aladdin Ullah's father was part of a trend of predominately Muslim and Bengali workers on ships.
Actor and writer Aladdin Ullah, the son of a steamship from South Asia who migrated to the U.S., in a still from ""Bengali Harlem"" Courtesy of Vivek Bald Bengali men — primarily those from what is now Bangladesh — were often employed as ship workers by British companies throughout the 1910s and 1920s. Working as seamen in that era was both thankless and dangerous, Bald noted. “They were breaking up coal and shoving it into furnaces,” he said. “They would spend hours and hours in the belly of the steamship shoveling coal where the temperatures were over 100 degrees.”
Many of the workers were also very young, with some only being about 14 or 15, according to Bald’s research. The thankless conditions lead many of them to jump ship whenever possible and New York offered them a chance to “disappear” into the existing social fabric, Bald said.
He estimates that between 700 and 1,000 South Asian ship workers settled in the United States between the 1920s and 1950s.
Due to the strict segregation of the era, many ended up in northern Manhattan neighborhoods like Harlem and would often marry African American or Puerto Rican women. Several of the Bengali ship jumpers would also later move to Detroit to work in the auto industry.
One of the biggest challenges to retracing Habib Ullah’s story was that he was in his 50s when his son Aladdin was born and died when his son was still quite young. From what Bald and Ullah have been able to determine, Habib Ullah was probably born in the early 1900s and came to New York as a teenager.
Related News News Digital archive preserves 'pioneering' history of Punjabis in California As Bald began to try to retrace his journey, he encountered obstacles common to sorting through old records, such as names being spelled incorrectly on shipping records and immigration papers and then again in digitized archives.
“By the time they get to us in the present day, as historians or people doing family research, there are so many distortions in the archives,” he said. “You have to develop ways to get them in multiple levels.”
Another challenge to retracing the steps of the ship jumpers who arrived in the 1920s was that neighborhoods like Harlem have changed drastically.
“There are some traces, some buildings are still there and some aren’t,” Bald said, noting that because the ship jumpers almost always lived in African American and Puerto Rican neighborhoods, their homes and communities were often impacted by gentrification and displacement. “It was one of those ways in which South Asian American histories are intertwined with African American and Puerto Ricans.”
A still from ""Bengali Harlem,"" a documentary that explores early South Asian migrants to the United States Courtesy of Vivek Bald Thanks to the recent grant from the Center for Asian American Media, filming for the “Bengali Harlem” documentary is almost complete after more than a decade of interviews and research. Among those interviewed for the film are one of the last living ship jumpers of Habib Ullah’s era, Mawsood Choudhury, who spoke to Bald several times before Choudhury's death in 2010.
Ultimately, Bald hopes that bringing the story of the Bengali ship jumpers of the early 20th century to the screen will inspire Americans to rethink the way they view the South Asian immigrant story of the last 150 years. Because little was known or written about these early immigrants, the story of the South Asian experience in the United States was incomplete, he said.
“I started to see a different history in which there has been a continuous and unbroken migration to the United States that has been predominantly Muslim and Sikh,” Bald said. “I feel that it put the post-1965 migration into a larger context in which it is not the dominant narrative.”

"Meek Mill says racism, not crowd size, is why he was denied entry to Las Vegas hotel",www.nbcnews.com,Janelle Griffith,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/meek-mill-says-racism-not-crowd-size-why-he-was-n1010866,"Rapper Meek Mill refuted Cosmopolitan Hotel's claim that he was denied entry to the Las Vegas property Saturday because a party he was there for was at capacity. Mill, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, said Tuesday that the justification contradicts what he was told Saturday by security personnel and ""doesn't even make sense."" He maintains he was discriminated against.
The hotel told NBC News in a statement Tuesday that the incident ""related to a matter of security, not race, and any reports citing otherwise are false.""
""We pride ourselves on providing an inclusive environment, with zero tolerance for discrimination,"" the hotel said. ""Under different circumstances, Meek Mill would be welcomed to the resort, but not at the compromise of his personal safety and the safety of our guests.""
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx5z723A45V
Mill was at the hotel to support DJ Mustard, who has a residency at Marquee Nightclub where he was hosting a party.
According to the hotel, the party had reached capacity as dictated by city fire marshals and prior to Mill's arrival, police had been called onsite to manage a larger than usual venue crowd.
When it was contacted in advance of Mill's arrival, security staff clarified that he would not be granted access because of capacity issues, ""in accordance with both club and resort policy,"" the hotel said, adding that this was reiterated to Mill when he arrived.
""Meek Mill refused to depart property and was then informed that any continued attempt would result in trespassing,"" the hotel said.
Mill said in separate tweets Tuesday that he was told he would be arrested ""just for stepping on their property,"" even if he went to eat at a restaurant and not to attend the pool party.
In a now-viral video of his exchange with security personnel that was posted to his Instagram account over the weekend, Mill is shown seated in a vehicle outside the hotel and can be heard asking two men why he was being denied entry. The video has been viewed more than half a million times. Mill never got out of the car or entered the hotel.
In the video, he is told multiple times that he would be arrested for trespassing if he tried to enter the property. No mention was made of capacity issues.
Mill's attorney, Joseph Tacopina, told NBC News on Tuesday that the hotel's conduct ""continues to be deplorable.""
“The assertion that the Cosmopolitan denied Meek because of capacity concerns at Marquee Dayclub is outright false,"" Tacopina said. ""In the recorded video, Meek also inquired about getting a meal at one of the hotel’s restaurants, yet their security team continued to deny Meek and said he would be arrested for trespassing regardless of location in the hotel premises.""
Tacopina said Sunday that ""the Cosmopolitan maintains a list of African American recording artists who should be denied access for no other reason than their culture and skin color,"" which, he said, constitutes discrimination. Tacopina identified Yo Gotti and BlocBoy JB among other rappers on that alleged list. Yo Gotti, born Mario Mims, said Tuesday that he has ""experienced similar discrimination at the Cosmopolitan and other Vegas hotels.""
""It’s a disgrace that these establishments continue to judge us by the color of our skin and our professions instead of recognizing our artistry and dedication to our communities,"" Yo Gotti told NBC News.
Tacopina said he plans to file a complaint in the near future.

Did the Iranians create fake U.S. social media accounts and pose as GOP politicians?,www.nbcnews.com,Ken Dilanian,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/did-iranians-create-fake-u-s-social-media-accounts-pose-n1010946,"WASHINGTON — Starting in April 2018, a group of anonymous people created fake American social media accounts to pose as journalists, plant letters to newspapers and impersonate Republican candidates for Congress — all in an apparent effort to promote Iranian interests. Was this the work of an Iranian intelligence service ? A third country? A band of pranksters?
It's not completely clear who was behind the campaign, according to reports released Tuesday by Facebook and a leading cybersecurity company, FireEye .
But what it shows, the companies say, is that the tech-fueled media environment which makes the United States a global beacon for free expression has also opened American consumers to exploitation and manipulation. And there is yet no good answer for what to do about it.
A post identified by Facebook. via Facebook ""This demonstrates that actors who engage in this type of influence activity leverage all manner of different tactics and techniques that stretch across a wide variety of media and platforms,"" Lee Foster, who leads FireEye's intelligence team, said. ""This is a societywide issue that we really have to come to terms with and figure out a way to effectively tackle.""
""We risk the U.S. information space effectively becoming a free-for-all for foreign interference ,"" he added.
The FBI declined to comment, pointing NBC News to a statement by Director Christopher Wray, who told Congress on May 7, ""On the counterintelligence side, we're facing a uniquely challenging time in terms of foreign investment, foreign influence; China, Russia, North Korea, Iran. I could go on and on there.""
Based on a tip from FireEye, Facebook said Tuesday it removed 51 Facebook accounts, 36 pages, seven groups and three Instagram accounts involved in what it called "" coordinated inauthentic behavior that originated in Iran.""
Trump ramps up Iran threats as rocket hits near US Embassy in Iraq May 21, 2019 01:54 ""The individuals behind this activity — which also took place on other internet platforms and websites — misled people about who they were and what they were doing,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, head of Facebook's cybersecurity policy, said in a blog post.
""They purported to be located in the US and Europe, used fake accounts to run Pages and Groups, and impersonated legitimate news organizations in the Middle East. The individuals behind this activity also represented themselves as journalists or other personas and tried to contact policymakers, reporters, academics, Iranian dissidents and other public figures. A number of these account owners also attempted to contact Instagram accounts, some of which later posted content associated with this activity.""
The Facebook action encompassed accounts that were different from but related to the ones FireEye identified, including accounts that were aimed at countries aside from the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Facebook takes down accounts engaged in deception, not because of who they are or what they say, company officials say. Facebook said it would prove the operation originated in Iran, but was not prepared to attribute it to specific people or the government.
The focus of the Facebook campaign was not so much to build followers, but to create fake personas that could be used to reach out to real people, Gleicher said.
A Facebook page purports to show anti-government graffiti in Saudi Arabia. via Facebook The disclosures come on the heels of a report by FireEye last year that identified an Iranian influence operation making use of fake news sites and social media accounts aimed at audiences around the world. The tactics included impersonating Americans of all political stripes.
Last month, Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto, uncovered what it said was a separate pro-Iranian influence operation that used social media to spread bogus articles online and attack Iranian adversaries.
FireEye identified a network of English-language social media accounts ""that engaged in inauthentic behavior and misrepresentation and that we assess with low confidence was organized in support of Iranian political interests,"" the company said Tuesday in a report obtained by NBC News.
""In addition to utilizing fake American personas that espoused both progressive and conservative political stances, some accounts impersonated real American individuals, including a handful of Republican political candidates that ran for House of Representatives seats in 2018.""
Most of the Twitter accounts in the network appear to have been suspended on or around May 9, the report says.
Trump denies reports that he's 'angry with his people' over Iran May 17, 2019 00:59 According to a Twitter spokesperson, ""We removed this network of 2,800 inauthentic accounts originating in Iran at the beginning of May. FireEye, a private cybersecurity firm, has issued a report and chosen not to share information or insights with Twitter prior to publication which is outside standard, responsible industry norms. Responsible disclosure should include notification and information sharing to protect against informing bad actors. Going public without these elements harms the credibility of the security research community, whose insights we support and appreciate.
""Our investigations into these accounts are ongoing. As we continue to investigate potential wider networks and actors, we typically avoid making any declarative public statements until we can be sure that we have reached the end of our analyses. As standard, once we have completed our review, we disclose the full account sets and content to our archive of information operations to enable public and academic research.""
Fake personas in the network had material published in the U.S. and Israeli media outlets, lobbied journalists to cover specific topics, and appear to have orchestrated audio and video interviews with unsuspecting Americans and British citizens about various political issues, FireEye reported.
Many of the accounts tweeted the same messages, which is one way FireEye assessed they were linked.
""While we have not at this time tied these accounts to the broader influence operation we identified last year, they promoted material in line with Iranian political interests in a manner similar to accounts that we have previously assessed to be of Iranian origin,"" the company said in a report obtained by NBC News. ""Most of the accounts in the network appear to have been suspended on or around the evening of May 9, 2019.""
The fake personas expressed support for the Iran nuclear deal, denounced the Trump administration's designation of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, and criticized a U.S.-led conference in Warsaw that focused on Iranian influence in the Middle East.
An allegedly inauthentic post about ISIS. via Facebook They also blasted Trump's veto of a resolution passed by Congress to end U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict.
There were some indicators that the network was operated by Iranians, FireEye said. For example, one account in the network, @AlexRyanNY, created in 2010, had only two visible tweets prior to 2017 — one of which, from 2011, was in Persian.
In 2017, @AlexRyanNY claimed in a tweet to be ""an Iranian who supported Hillary.""
Additionally, while most of the accounts in the network had their interface languages set to English, one account had its interface language set to Persian, FireEye found.
Last year, one of the accounts impersonated Marla Livengood, a Republican candidate for California's 9th Congressional District, using a photograph of Livengood and a campaign banner for its profile and background pictures.
The account began tweeting about generic news but then segued into promoting material more closely aligned with Iranian interests, FireEye said. For example, the account, along with others in the network, commemorated the United Nations' International Day of the Girl Child with a photograph of emaciated children in Yemen, and called attention to the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Those are two stories that tend to be bad for Iran's mortal enemy, Saudi Arabia.
One of the posts identified by Facebook. via Facebook ""We were not aware of it,"" Scott Winn, who helped run the Livengood campaign, saod.
""This seems to be kind of an ongoing problem in campaigns … we have people that are looking at what happened in the 2016 election and trying to duplicate that on a local level.""
Another fake account impersonated Jineea Butler, a Republican candidate for New York's 13th Congressional District, using a photograph of Butler for its profile picture and incorporating her campaign slogans into its background picture, as well as claiming in its Twitter bio to be a ""US House candidate, NY-13"" and linking to Butler's website, jineeabutlerforcongress.com.
The network also impersonated regular Americans. One fake persona was ""Ed Sullivan,"" who sent letters that were published in the New York Daily News and other newspapers, including one letter headlined, ""Don't shrug off Khashoggi's murder.""
U.S. intelligence agencies have the capacity to determine whether this was an Iranian influence campaign, experts say. FireEye said it would continue to pursue that question.
""If it is of Iranian origin or supported by Iranian state actors,"" the report concludes, ""it would demonstrate that Iranian influence tactics extend well beyond the use of inauthentic news sites and fake social media personas, to also include the impersonation of real individuals on social media and the leveraging of legitimate Western news outlets to disseminate favorable messaging.""

TSA changes policy to allow some CBD oil and medications on planes,www.nbcnews.com,Elizabeth Chuck,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tsa-changes-policy-allow-some-cbd-oil-medications-planes-n1010561,"U.S. news TSA changes policy to allow some CBD oil and medications on planes The change was prompted by the only FDA-approved drug that contains CBD oil, Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures in children with epilepsy. A TSA worker at the Salt Lake City International Airport on Jan. 16, 2019. Rick Bowmer / AP file Breaking News Emails May 28, 2019, 7:35 PM UTC By Elizabeth Chuck The Transportation Security Administration quietly changed its cannabis policy over the weekend to allow passengers to bring some forms of cannabidiol (CBD) oil, plus an FDA-approved marijuana based drug, on flights. All forms of marijuana were previously prohibited in both checked and carry-on bags. But Sunday, the agency updated TSA.gov to reflect new regulations that allow FDA-approved medical marijuana and products that contain hemp-derived CBD oil. The CBD oil is allowed ""as long as it is produced within the regulations defined by the law"" under the 2018 Farm Bill , which federally legalized hemp and hemp derivatives. The development was first reported by Marijuana Moment on Monday . Hemp derivatives contain little to no tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana that produces a high. The TSA's new rules still ban other forms of marijuana, including certain cannabis-infused products and CBD oils that have THC, which are still illegal under federal law. TSA officers are required to report any violations of that law. It is not clear how the TSA intends to check whether a product contains THC; a TSA spokesperson said that if there were questions of whether a substance was illegal under federal law, the issue would be referred to law enforcement for further adjudication, but that the TSA would not do the testing.

P Shannon Stapleton / Reuters The change was prompted by the only Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that contains CBD oil, Epidiolex, which is used to treat seizures in children with epilepsy, the TSA said. ""To avoid confusion as to whether families can travel with this drug, TSA immediately updated TSA.gov once we became aware of the issue,“ the agency said in a statement to NBC News. Epidiolex was approved by the FDA last June to treat severe, rare forms of pediatric epilepsy. The TSA spokesperson said the agency recently became aware of Epidiolex and updated its policy accordingly. The TSA did not offer any other details on other CBD oil that its website says is allowed on flights now. Regardless, the updated policy is welcome news for CBD advocates, especially after some passengers have been arrested for carrying CBD oil on planes — such as a 71-year-old woman who was arrested at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport earlier this month. Grandmothers arrested while traveling with CBD oil highlights confusion May 22, 2019 01:30 Ally Horner, the co-owner of Your CBD Store in Spring, Texas, 25 miles north of Houston, said questions about traveling with CBD products are common among her customers. She said she has always told them that it's not worth the risk, and instead advises them to take their CBD medication at home prior to their flight and then find a dispensary at their travel destination, or pay her store to ship them to them once they arrive. ""A lot of people are buying the CBD as an alternative to opiates, and having them be able to travel safely and not get into trouble would be huge for everybody."" Being able to bring CBD on flights with them, she said, ""would be huge."" ""A lot of people are buying the CBD as an alternative to opiates, and having them be able to travel safely and not get into trouble would be huge for everybody,"" she said. Laws on marijuana, whether medicinal or recreational, vary by state. But federal transportation rules have always been strict: Previously, even passengers flying between two states where marijuana was legal were prohibited from bringing it on their flights. Proponents say CBD offers a range of health benefits, both mental and physical. Research to support such claims is ongoing. Horner, 26, started taking CBD oil for pain after she broke her leg in January. With a titanium rod and five screws in her leg, ""I’m already going to set off a metal detector, so I’m already going to have anxiety about that"" when traveling, she said. ""And not being able to take the CBD that helps with my anxiety and pain, that would send my anxiety through the roof,"" she said. Elizabeth Chuck "
Fact check: Why are Trump and the Democrats talking about the 1994 crime bill,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/fact-check-why-are-trump-democrats-talking-about-1994-crime-n1010691,"The crime bill that former Vice President Joe Biden helped write as a senator 25 years ago has been thrust into the spotlight on the 2020 campaign trail. His primary competition, including Sens. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., have condemned the legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, as having contributed to mass incarceration. And over the Memorial Day weekend, President Donald Trump attacked Biden for his involvement in it.
Here's what was in the bill, who supported it, and what is known about the law's effects.
What is the 1994 crime bill? The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , or the 1994 crime bill as it became known, earmarked billions in funding for states to build new prisons, train and hire additional police, expanded the federal death penalty and instituted a federal ""three-strikes"" life sentence mandate.
The legislation also included the original Violence Against Women Act, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and more than $6 billion in funding for crime prevention programs.
Joe: You don't attack a former VP on foreign soil May 28, 2019 12:38 The bill was intended to combat and deter violent crime, which peaked nationally in the early 1990s. On a political level, Clinton and Democrats hoped that passage of a tough law would help them blunt or reverse long-running GOP charges that their party was soft on crime.
Violent crime started to fall before the bill was passed, though it dropped much more dramatically from 1994 to 2000, according to the Brennan Center for Justice , a progressive law and policy institute.
Who was for it, who was against? Both Democrats and Republicans supported the bill, though there were detractors in both parties.
Democrats, including most of the Congressional Black Caucus , Republicans and substantial numbers of African American pastors and mayors backed the legislation, according to reports at the time.
Most supporters saw it as a way to respond to the peak in violent crime in the early 1990s that came on the heels of a decades-long increase, a trend that would soon begin to reverse.
""The American people have been looking forward to this day for a long time,"" Clinton said at a bill-signing ceremony in 1994. ""In the last 25 years, half a million Americans have been killed by other Americans. For 25 years, crime has been a hot political issue used too often to divide us while the system makes excuses for not punishing criminals and doing the job.""
Biden had been working with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., on similar legislation even before Clinton took office.
When the Senate passed its version of the bill in November 1993, on a 95-4 roll call, former Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, boasted about it.
""I believe the American people are starting to see that we mean business about crime, and that this bill is going to make a difference,"" he said then. ""As in all bills, there may be some things that I do not particularly like. But, overall, this bill is a tremendous addition to the fight against crime. It is, I think, the finest anti-crime bill in the history of this country.""
Current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was among those who voted for it.
But there was a war brewing in the House, in which Republicans were concerned over whether the bill was tough enough on offenders, whether it spent too much on crime-prevention programs rather than punishment — the ""midnight basketball"" program became a talking point for conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh — and whether it should include a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons. Some centrist Democrats shared these objections.
A House-Senate conference committee had to write two different ""final"" versions of the legislation before it could pass muster, and an unlikely coalition of Republican and Democratic opponents temporarily killed it in the House by winning on a procedural vote. Clinton agreed to demands to trim back spending for prevention programs and tweak the weapons ban to secure the votes he needed in the House.
In the end, 235 House members, including 46 Republicans, voted for it. (Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, then an independent representative from Vermont, was among the ""yes"" votes.)
But with the National Rifle Association actively engaged against the bill, and focusing its arguments on aspects other than gun control, it suddenly became a much tougher vote for GOP senators. Biden and his allies needed 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a procedural block, which meant they had to get at least six Republicans on board. They got seven and the bill went to Clinton for his signature. McConnell voted against it the second time around.
Critics found fault Detractors at the time warned that the bill co-written by Biden was far too punitive and did not put enough of an emphasis on dealing with broader structural issues that led to the increase in violent crime. Though there was money allocated for preventative programs, the bill was focused on cracking down on crime and throwing the book at criminals.
There were alternative legislative efforts. Then-Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said that providing billions for prison expansion was a ""simplistic approach to the crime problem."" Conyers offered up a bill that focused on job opportunities, drug treatment and additional crime prevention programs.
Meanwhile, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., one of the Congressional Black Caucus members who voted against the crime bill, said, ""You wouldn't ask an opponent of abortion to look at a bill with the greatest expansion of abortion in the history of the United States, and argue that he ought to vote for it because it's got some highway funding in it.""
What Biden says now Biden has faced questions and criticism about the legislation this year, before and after announcing his bid to challenge Trump in 2020. He's mostly defended the law and taken credit for some of its successes.
""You know I've been in this fight for a long time,"" Biden said in January at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington , without explicitly remarking on the 1994 bill. ""I haven't always been right, I know we haven't always done things the right way. But I've always tried.""
At a New Hampshire campaign stop in May, Biden talked up several specific components of the bill.
""There's a whole lot of talk about, you know,"" Biden said. ""It had three big things in it,"" he continued, listing off the funding that was allocated toward crime prevention programs, as well as the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on assault weapons, both of which are now expired.
Sanders also has defended his vote in favor of the bill in a similar fashion, telling CNN that if he hadn't, he would be getting asked today about why he ""did not vote for a ban on assault weapons.""
Did it lead to ""mass incarceration""? During that same New Hampshire event, Biden claimed that the 1994 bill did not lead to mass incarceration.
""Folks, let's get something straight, 92 out of every 100 prisoners who end up behind bars are in a state prison, not a federal prison,"" he said. ""This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.""
Though the bill was not the root cause of ""mass incarceration,"" it was ""the most high-profile legislation to increase the number of people behind bars,"" according to a Brennan Center analysis in 2016.
The crime bill granted states billions to build prisons if they passed laws requiring inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, the Brennan Center said, noting that 30 states introduced or amended laws between 1995 and 1999 so that they would be in compliance and receive the money. By 1999, 42 states had ""truth-in-sentencing"" laws on the books, which contributed to an increase in imprisonment.
""By dangling bonus dollars, the crime bill encouraged states to remain on their tough-on-crime course,"" the Brennan Center wrote.

Noah Mina, 35, was reported missing on May 20 in the area of Kapilau Ridge Trail, also known as the Saint Anthony Cross, in Wailuku, according to the Maui Police Department .
Police and fire personnel are assisting in his search, the department said. Javier Cantellops, one of the rescuers who found Amanda Eller on Friday, said during a news conference over the weekend that he was meeting with Mina's family to put together a search team.
Missing hiker Noah Kekai Mina, in the area of Kapilau Ridge Trail, also known as the Saint Anthony Cross in Wailuku. via Facebook ""Circumstances are completely different ... but overall it's the next mission,"" he said at the Saturday press conference. ""He's another member of our community.""
Mina's father, Vincent Mina, said in a Facebook post that Noah has been missing since last Monday when he went for a hike that morning and hopes his son's story ends as Eller's did, with his safe return.
Mina is described as 5-foot-8, 180 pounds, with shaven black hair and brown eyes.
Eller, 35, was discovered by a helicopter crew on Friday, after going for what was supposed to be a short hike on May 8 . She was reported missing by her boyfriend, Benjamin Konkol, the next day.
Authorities said Eller left her SUV, with her wallet and phone inside, at the Maui reserve before going on her trek. Her mother, Julia Eller, said at a news conference on Saturday that her daughter intended to go on a 3-mile hike but became disoriented after stopping to rest.
Amanda Eller was reported missing in Maui on May 9. Troy Helmer Eller tried to follow her instincts to get back to her car but ""was going in the wrong direction,"" her mother said.
Eller told The New York Times that she was injured when she fell from a 20-foot cliff and later lost her shoes in a flash flood. She survived by eating plants, strawberry guavas and moths that landed on her body, she told the outlet. Eller kept herself hydrated by drinking water from the river.
Doctors said Eller suffered an orthopedic fracture and burns on her lower extremities. She was released from the hospital on Saturday and is recovering at a family's members house in Maui.

California minor league team apologizes for video suggesting Ocasio-Cortez is an 'enemy',www.nbcnews.com,David K. Li,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-minor-league-team-apologizes-video-suggesting-ocasio-cortez-enemy-n1010906,"A minor league baseball team in California apologized Tuesday for inadvertently suggesting in a Memorial Day video that U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among those who are ""enemies of freedom."" The video was played by the Fresno Grizzlies between its games against the El Paso Chihuahuas in a Pacific Coast League doubleheader on Memorial Day.
As the Grizzlies do at many Memorial Day games in their home stadium of Chukchansi Park, it played a video featuring a speech by President Ronald Reagan extolling American values and warning of ""enemies of freedom and potential adversaries.""
As Reagan's words about enemies were heard, images beamed on the scoreboard of Kim Jong Un, Fidel Castro — and Ocasio-Cortez, the outspoken first-term Democratic congresswoman from New York City.
The Grizzlies, a triple-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals, said it had no idea the congresswoman's image was on the video and it accepts full responsibility.
""We're embarrassed we allowed this video to play without seeing it in its entirety first,"" according to a team statement. ""We unconditionally apologize to Rep. Ocasio-Cortez ... in addition to our fans, community and those we hurt. It was a mistake, and we will ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.""
The foul-up happened after a team employee found that a YouTube producer, whose videos of Reagan's 1981 inaugural address the Grizzlies had used before, had a new video of the speech in a higher resolution, Grizzlies spokesman Paul Braverman said.
The employee uploaded that newer video, which had been posted on YouTube just six days earlier, without watching all of it — and thus missing the inflammatory shot at Ocasio-Cortez, according to the Grizzlies.
""The employee is absolutely remorseful; his heart is broken over the incident,"" Braverman told NBC News.
A representative for Ocasio-Cortez declined comment Tuesday.

Federal judge releases USC records in gynecologist lawsuit,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/federal-judge-releases-usc-records-gynecologist-lawsuit-n1010881,"LOS ANGELES — University of Southern California records reveal medical experts hired to evaluate a campus gynecologist after years of complaints reported there was evidence he preyed on Asian students and had signs of ""psychopathy,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. The confidential report was among USC records concerning Dr. George Tyndall that were made public Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson at the newspaper's request.
The records had been filed under seal a part of a class-action lawsuit by former patients against Tyndall and USC, following a Times investigation into claims of sexual abuse or harassment of patients by the gynecologist.
Wilson said in a written ruling that the public had an interest in ""all pertinent information"" about Tyndall and the university's response.
""Providing the public with all available nonprivileged information furthers the public narrative about inappropriate sexual behavior and ensures for longer-lasting changes beyond the case at hand,"" Wilson wrote.
Related News News USC agrees to $215 million settlement, reforms over doctor abuse allegations Since news of the allegations and USC's handling of them over many years surfaced last year, university President C.L. Max Nikias was ousted, most top administrators have left or will soon, more than 650 lawsuits have been filed, and Los Angeles police have been conducting an extensive sex crimes investigation.
Tyndall hasn't been charged, and he denies any wrongdoing.
The gynecologist, who started at the campus clinic in 1989, was suspended in 2016, when the expert evaluation began, and he later left his post with a substantial payout, the Times reported.
Newly released records include documents handed over to lawyers for plaintiffs and another set of records given to the judge for his decision on whether to approve a $215 million settlement with some former patients in the class action.
5 USC women share their sexual misconduct allegations against gynecologist June 14, 2018 05:33 Memos, correspondence and handwritten complaints are among records dating to the 1990s.
The records show that the medical experts hired to evaluate Tyndall told the university he appeared to be targeting international students from Asia who were vulnerable because of their age and language skills.
""If the patients were young and Asian, they were more likely to have a pelvic exam completed,"" said the report from Colorado-based consulting firm MDReview.
The evaluation included inspection of medical charts, review of university files and interviews with clinic staffers, administrators and Tyndall.
The report found that Tyndall's pelvic exams were inappropriate and not within medical standards, and that he had ""unusual and potentially dangerous opinions about breast exams.""
The experts were concerned about photographs Tyndall took of patients' genitals and his ""dubious"" reasons for keeping them.
Patients who were ""non-Asian, obese, or older"" were less likely to receive a pelvic exam, according to the report.
Related News Nearly 100 women accuse former USC doctor of sex abuse Tyndall had potential mental health problems, including ""underlying psychopathy,"" the report said. It noted such signs as hoarding, poor hygiene and his request to personally keep a patient's used intrauterine device.
Those issues were outside the scope of the report, but ""impossible to ignore,"" it said.
An attorney representing the university said in a letter to Wilson that by the time administrators received the report Tyndall had already been suspended and never treated another USC patient.
The proposed federal class-action settlement could give $2,500 to $250,000 to the plaintiffs against Tyndall. Former patients with allegations against Tyndall are deciding whether to join the settlement, which has been criticized by attorneys for hundreds of women in state court cases.
USC published a website with all the materials that were filed in court , and the university's interim president, Wanda Austin, said in a statement late Thursday that the records ""should help confirm that the proposed settlement remains the best option"" for resolution.

Missouri's abortion doctors vow to continue helping women,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/missouri-s-abortion-doctors-vow-continue-helping-women-n1011006,"Doctors in Missouri may only have a few more days to perform abortions, but they insist their care for patients who want to terminate a pregnancy won't end anytime soon. ""Despite what happens on Friday, we will continue to help our patients access care when they need it,” Dr. Colleen McNicholas, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said on a call with reporters today.
That includes helping women who are seeking to end a pregnancy find help in other states. “We will make sure Missourians who need abortion care will be able to get it, whether that be with us or with another provider,” McNicholas said.
'Partial-birth' abortion 'isn't a thing': Missouri doctors get clinical May 28, 2019 02:04 McNicholas said the center takes care of several thousand women seeking an abortion each year. She and clinic director Dr. David Eisenberg spoke with NBC News on Friday, the day Missouri’s governor signed into law a bill that would prohibit abortions after eight weeks gestation .
“This is a government intrusion into the practice of medicine,” Eisenberg said.
The Planned Parenthood Federation of America said Missouri’s health department is threatening not to renew the St. Louis Planned Parenthood’s license to provide abortions. The clinic is the only one in the state that offers abortion services.
Anita Murphy directs patient phone calls at the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region in St. Louis, Missouri; some call to ask if they can still get abortion services. Ali Galante / NBC News If the license is not renewed by May 31, doctors at the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region will no longer be able to perform abortions , though they will still provide other medical care. That would leave more than 1 million women of childbearing age without access to abortion in the state.
“This is not a drill. This is not a warning,” Dr. Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told reporters in the phone call. “This is real, and this is a public health crisis.”
The group announced it is filing a lawsuit against the state of Missouri in an effort to maintain abortion services past the May 31 deadline.
Doctors who perform abortions in Missouri were already grappling with how to handle that state's newly signed law banning abortions after eight weeks gestation, except in cases in which they are ""medically necessary.""
Obstetrician gynecologist Dr. Colleen McNicholas speaks with a patient at the Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region in St. Louis, Missouri. Ali Galante / NBC News Doctors say that creates a huge problem, particularly in circumstances that require snap medical decisions. “How do I know what I think is a medical emergency will be viewed as such by the attorney general?” McNicholas asked.
“What a terrible place we are putting physicians in, a totally untenable ethical position where they have to choose between providing the appropriate care for their patient, or potentially going to jail or losing their medical license,” she added.
Some states’ new abortion bans have been referred to as “heartbeat” bills by politicians, and mean that abortions would be prohibited after a “fetal heartbeat” is detected. But doctors say what physicians are hearing at six to eight weeks gestation isn’t a true heartbeat; it’s just electrical activity.
“At six weeks, we’re talking about essentially two tubes that are aligned by some cardiac cells that can do some vibration,” McNicholas said. She says equating that electrical activity with a fully functioning heart is simply medically inaccurate.
Women seek abortions for a number of reasons, and the decision can be incredibly difficult.
“Sometimes the choice to end a pregnancy, even when it was a highly desired one, is a really difficult one for people,” Eisenberg said.
Jennifer Box, 38, of St. Louis, Missouri, was in such a position. She made the painful decision to end her pregnancy at 15 weeks. Doctors had discovered her growing fetus had a genetic disorder called trisomy 18, an abnormality that usually results in either stillbirth or the death of the baby within a year.
Jennifer Box says ending her pregnancy with a fetus with a rare and deadly chromosomal abnormality was the most compassionate choice for the baby, as well as her two older children. Courtesy Jennifer Box Babies with trisomy 18 often have heart defects, difficulty eating and breathing, and are susceptible to serious infections.
“I made a decision in consultation with multiple doctors, genetic counselors and different hospitals. We made a medical choice as parents for our daughter,” Box said. She and her husband, Jake, found out the fetus was a girl, and named her Libby Rose.
“It was heartbreaking, but I can’t imagine giving birth to a child only to know that she would suffer indefinitely until she would die,” Box said.
“I believe my greatest act of love as her mother was to suffer myself instead.”
Meanwhile, physicians at the St. Louis Planned Parenthood say they will continue to provide assistance to women.
“When abortion is safe and accessible, it’s the safest medicine that’s provided,” Eisenberg said. “The fact is, it’s basic health care for women.”

FAA investigating Chick-fil-A's exclusion at U.S. airports - 41NBC News | WMGT-DT,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/faa-investigating-chick-fil-s-exclusion-u-s-airports-n1010841?cid=public-rss_20190528,"

By Tim Fitzsimons and The Associated Press - Advertisement - The Federal Aviation Administration says it’s investigating decisions to exclude Chick-fil-A from airport concession contracts in San Antonio, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, over opposition to the fast-food chain owners’ record on LGBTQ issues. The San Antonio Express-News reports the FAA told San Antonio officials Friday it is investigating complaints the city-owned airport discriminated “against a private company due to the expression of the owner’s religious beliefs.” In a statement shared with NBC News on Tuesday, the FAA confirmed that it received complaints that airport operators were discriminating against private companies over “religious beliefs.” “FAA’s Office of Civil Rights has notified the San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF) that it has opened investigations into these complaints,” the agency stated. “The FAA notes that federal requirements prohibit airport operators from excluding persons on the basis of religious creed from participating in airport activities that receive or benefit from FAA grant funding.” Keisha Russell, an attorney at the First Liberty Institute, the legal group that filed a complaint with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao over Chick-fil-A’s airport exclusion, said her organization is “pleased that the FAA responded to our request by opening an investigation into San Antonio for its blatant, illegal religious discrimination against Chick-fil-A.” “American business owners should not have to suffer because they want to operate their businesses in accordance with their religious beliefs,” Russell continued. “Few things are more un-American than government hostility against religion.” Andy Segovia, an attorney for the city of San Antonio, said his office is reviewing the FAA’s notice. Chick-fil-A, an Atlanta-based restaurant chain, has faced opposition elsewhere over donating millions over the years to groups that oppose same-sex marriage. Texas lawmakers this month approved a bill that would prohibit cities from taking “adverse action” against an individual based on contributions to religious organizations. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has signaled he will sign the legislation. "
What's fueling the spate of recent tornadoes across the U.S.?,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-s-fueling-spate-recent-tornadoes-across-u-s-ncna1011036,"A series of devastating tornadoes that hit western Ohio late Monday marked the 12th consecutive day of such severe storms in the United States, with an average of 27.5 tornadoes occurring each day over that time period. If that seems like a lot, that’s because it is. Scientists have found that since the 1950s, the annual number of tornado outbreaks has remained roughly the same, but the number of tornadoes per outbreak — or the number of days with multiple tornadoes — is increasing.
James Elsner, an atmospheric scientist at Florida State University in Tallahassee, said that on average, four to five tornadoes typically strike as part of a cluster. But he and his colleagues found that since 1950, the number of days with a cluster of at least 32 tornadoes has more than doubled, while smaller clusters have declined.
“The overall trend is not upwards, but what was surprising and sharply up is the fact that when conditions become favorable for tornadoes, we’re seeing more tornadoes per outbreak ,” Elsner, who was the lead author of a 2014 study about this phenomenon, said.
WATCH: Massive tornadoes touch down in Kansas May 29, 2019 01:02 Elsner added that the average number of tornadoes over the past 12 days is double the long-term average of tornadoes per outbreak.
But figuring out what is driving this uptick has been challenging.
“We’re not 100 percent sure what’s causing that,” said Victor Gensini, a climatologist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. “There are theories that for any given outbreak, there’s more instability or fuel available for storms, but it’s really difficult to know.”
Part of the problem is that there is a lot of variability from year to year. Last year was a very quiet year for tornadoes, becoming the first year since modern record-keeping began in 1950 that there were no “violent” tornadoes in the U.S. Violent tornadoes are those with estimated wind speeds of 166 miles per hour or higher.
This year is already shaping up to be more destructive. So far in 2019, there have been 935 reported tornadoes across the country , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This is up from an average of 743 tornadoes at this point in the year from 2005 to 2015, Gensini said. Monday’s rash of tornadoes, which caused widespread damage in the Dayton, Ohio, area and knocked out power to around 68,000 households, already ranks as the fourth most active tornado day of 2019, according to NOAA statistics.
Another issue is that scientists need more data. The most detailed records of tornadoes only extend back to the 1950s, making for a relatively short history of how things have changed, Gensini said.
This limited historical record also makes it difficult for researchers to know precisely what — if any — impact climate change is having on the frequency and severity of tornadoes .
There are two main ingredients that help tornadoes form: atmospheric instability, typically from a buildup of moisture and heat in the atmosphere, and wind shear, which refers to changing wind speed and direction with height that lifts air up and contributes to the storm’s violent rotation.
How do tornadoes form and why are they so destructive? May 27, 2019 02:02 Climate change is causing ocean temperatures and global surface temperatures to increase, which in turn drives atmospheric instability when warm, moist air moves across the middle of the country, according to Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
“All of this provides more fuel for thunderstorms and sets the stage for tornadoes to develop,” Trenberth said.
But while scientists also predict that wind shear may decrease as the Arctic warms, climate models show that atmospheric instability from climate change will probably contribute to more tornadoes overall.
“If you don’t have a cold Arctic, it’s hard to get a really strong wind shear across the Pacific Ocean,” Gensini said. “It’ll be a bit of a struggle between these two blocking weather patterns, but our climate models show that instability wins out, which suggests that we’ll see more tornadoes.”
Gensini said it is difficult to know the impact that climate change is having on specific extreme weather events, or in particular regions of the country, but that general trends are consistent with models that incorporate the planet’s changing climate.
“The analogy I like to use is with baseball’s steroid era,” Gensini said. “It’s a very difficult question to answer if this one home run was caused by steroids, but when you look at the batting average or the number of home runs over that time period, it’s easy to say that, yes, statistically a lot of those home runs were likely caused by steroids.”

8h ago / 2:27 PM UTC Maine Democratic House speaker to run against Susan Collins WASHINGTON — Sara Gideon, the Democratic Speaker of the Maine House, has jumped into the race against Republican Sen. Susan Collins.
Gideon announced her bid in a video on social media where she recounted her political career, highlighting her work on health care, job training and drug addiction.
She also framed herself as a the bulwark against controversial former Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage in the state legislature, arguing that she'll be able to take the same approach in Washington
""Getting things done for Mainers is what we are elected to do, not falling in line behind the demands of someone else,"" she said.
""It doesn't matter if that person is Paul LePage, Mitch McConnell or Donald Trump.""
I’m running against Susan Collins for U.S. Senate because Mainers deserve a senator who will always put our state first. Let's build this campaign together. Will you join us? ➡️ https://t.co/mcihP9UtNE #MESen #MEpolitics pic.twitter.com/1SbV0MbMKM
— Sara Gideon (@SaraGideonME) June 24, 2019 Collins presents a unique opportunity and challenge for Democrats.
They see her as newly vulnerable after she voted for the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination was roiled by allegations of sexual assault stemming from his teenage years.
But Collins is a mainstay in the state — she's been in the Senate since 1997 and has cruised to re-election since. And her Kavanaugh support could galvanize Republicans around her too.
Gideon speaks to that dynamic in her announcement video, arguing that Collins has lost her bipartisan streak.
Republicans panned Gideon's announcement, arguing that bipartisan streak will serve Collins well once again in 2020.
""Susan Collins is the most independent Senator in the country because of her ability to work across party lines to get things done for Maine,” said Nathan Brand, a spokesperson for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Chosen by Schumer and Washington Democrats, Sara Gideon is an extreme partisan who will give away Maine’s voice to radical leftists like Pelosi and AOC.”

10h ago / 12:24 PM UTC Inslee pledges to phase out fossil fuels FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Washington Governor Jay Inslee is proposing an aggressive plan to eliminate fossil fuel use in the U.S and transition the nation to 100% clean energy by taking on corporations and adding 8 million new jobs.
The “Freedom from Fossil Fuels” plan, being unveiled Monday, consists of 16 policy initiatives that include phasing out fracking and use of coal, creating a “climate test” for new infrastructure, introducing a climate pollution fee on corporations and establishing an office in the Department of Justice entirely focused on prosecuting environmental injustices.
""In order to build a more prosperous, just and inclusive clean energy future, our nation must confront the economic and environmental harm caused by corporate polluters,"" the campaign’s plan states.
The governor will officially announce his proposal from Everglades Holiday Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where there has been recent controversy over a real estate company trying to explore oil drilling in the wetlands.
Inslee has released three other plans has part of his “Climate Mission” including a plan on global action on climate change, a clean energy plan and an “Evergreen Economy” plan and is the only candidate who has made the environment the central focus of his campaign.

11h ago / 11:58 AM UTC Biden previews immigration policy visions ahead of debate WASHINGTON — Vice President Joe Biden continued to ramp up his attacks on President Donald Trump Monday with harsh criticism of the administration’s hardline position on immigration, just days ahead of the first Democratic presidential debate in Southern Florida.
In a Miami Herald op-ed , Biden writes that Trump continues to threaten U.S. relations with Latin America by relying on campaign tactics of “vilifying immigrants to score political points.” He lists the administration’s latest threat to immediately deport thousands of undocumented immigrants, the decision to end aid to Central American countries and continued “horrifying scenes” of families detained at the border as examples to contrast the leadership he says would bring to the presidency as an experienced foreign policy expert.
“It’s clear Donald Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Latino community and scare voters to turn out on election day, not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere,” he writes.
He adds, “at a time when the challenges we face demand a united, regional response, Trump repeatedly invokes racist invective to describe anyone south of the Rio Grande, including calling migrants ‘animals.’”
Biden says that Trump’s signature “build the wall” mantra is “a slogan divorced from reality.”
The “true solution” is to address the root causes of the migrant flow from Central America, Biden argues, calling for returning to a strategy he helped lead in the Obama administration to support economic and security initiatives in the Northern Triangle countries.
Biden calls for Congress to pass the DREAM Act to finally allow undocumented immigrants to come “out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats.” He also targets Trump’s “increasing belligerence” in handling the Venezuelan crisis and calls for granting temporary protected status to refugees from the South American country.
The broad immigration policy overview in the Miami Herald comes after Biden attacked what he called the “mindless” Trump approach to immigration in an interview Saturday with MSNBC’s Al Sharpton.
“Not only is that cruel, but imagine what it says to the rest of the world about who we are,” Biden said of children in detention centers. “This is absolutely mindless what he’s doing.”

4h ago / 6:36 PM UTC Beto O'Rourke rolls out proposals to help veterans TAMPA, Fla. — Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke is unveiling an expansive policy outline to address veterans issues on Monday, which includes revitalization of the VA and other improved veterans services and a proposed $1,000 new “war tax” on wealthy households that don’t include veterans or current servicemembers.
The former Texas congressman wants to pass on some responsibility of military service by imposing a $1,000 progressive tax on people making over $200,000 a year for every new authorized war the United States enters. That money would be funneled into what he calls a “Veterans Health Care Trust Fund,” which would support veterans’ medical services and other forms of care.
“It means that before we go to war again, after we’ve ended the wars that we’re already in, we’re gonna make sure that we understand the full cost and consequence of going to those wars,” O’Rourke told NBC News in an exclusive interview. “It’s not just deploying the women and men, the missiles and the bombs, it’s their care when they come back.”
Beto O'Rourke on 'war tax' to help veterans: 'It's not just deploying...it's their care' June 24, 2019 19:06 O'Rourke has long called for bringing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to a “responsible end,” and says he wants to invest half of the money being spent there — which he estimates is around $200 of $400 billion — into programs helping veterans.
The candidate is proposing to reshape the VA on several fronts, including implementing partnerships with research universities and standardizing electronic health care data. He wants to build upon existing “reverse boot camps” and work with federal agencies on various economic concerns for members of the military transitioning back to civilian life.
O’Rourke’s plan for veterans is the seventh major policy rollout of his campaign, but this is a topic that was at the forefront of his career prior to his vault into the mainstream public eye during the Texas Senate race last year. As a congressman, he held quarterly veterans town halls, served on both the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services committees, and worked on numerous pieces of veterans-focused legislation that became law.
Part of his proposal this week to address veteran suicide and mental health matters also includes allowing VA physicians to prescribe or recommend medical cannabis where it’s legal, while also ensuring VA providers communicate with veterans about safe and responsible gun storage.
He told NBC News Monday that his potential administration would “make suicide reduction our No. 1 clinical priority at the V.A.”
He also calls on Congress to increase funding to the National Institutes of Health to fight diseases prevalent with veterans, including doubling research into Alzheimer’s and other dementia's from $2.5 billion to $5 billion a year.

1d ago / 3:21 PM UTC Bullock makes first trip to New Hampshire while the rest of the field is in South Carolina MANCHESTER, N.H. — While nearly all the other 2020 Democratic candidates were in South Carolina this weekend, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock headed north to New Hampshire for his first campaign trip to the Granite State. With Bullock’s visit, every 2020 contender has now officially introduced themselves to first-in-the-nation primary voters.
All of the retail politics typical of a New Hampshire swing were on full display during Bullock's visit — he was escorted by influential state senators as he met voters at Concord’s Market Days Festival, held a brewery meet and greet, shook hands with diners at local Manchester haunts, and attended a Nashua house party hosted by a former New Hampshire attorney general.
Bullock entered the race five weeks ago. The house party was initially scheduled for March, but had to be postponed, along with Bullock’s announcement, due to working with the Montana state legislature to expand Medicaid.
“I only got into this formally a little bit over a month ago because I had a job to do,” Bullock said. “And if I had to choose between chasing 100,000 voters or providing health care for 100,000 people, easiest decision I’ll ever make.”
2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Montana Gov. Steve Bulllock talks to voters at a house party in Nashua, New Hampshire, on June 22, 2019. Julia Jester / NBC News When asked why he chose to jump into such a crowded field rather than vie for a Montana Senate seat, Bullock told NBC News, “We need to win places we lost in addition to bringing out our base, we need to be able to make people believe that government works.”
“My whole life experience has been in the executive branch of things, I think I have something really meaningful to offer there, so that was the decision I made,” he said.
Bullock said New Hampshire is critical because at the end of the day, it’s the state that’s “going to sort out a lot of this.”
“Folks in New Hampshire, they take their role seriously, so they want to get to know the candidates,” he said. “As much as at times people try to nationalize elections, this really is a person to person effort.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has made the most trips to the first primary state, with ten N.H. campaign swings according to NBC News' tally. And in the latest CBS News/YouGov poll, only two percent of Granite Staters are so far considering supporting Bullock for the nomination.

3d ago / 4:07 PM UTC Americans weigh in on how to improve democracy WASHINGTON — In a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Americans were asked about potential changes that could occur within U.S. democracy. The most popular answers, below, are added up by those who said the changes would improve democracy ""a lot"" or ""just some.""
Term limits for members of Congress: 71 percent. Non-partisan commissions drawing congressional/state legislative districts: 66 percent. Election Day as a national holiday: 66 percent. Automatic voter registration for every adult citizen: 65 percent. Term limits for Supreme Court justices: 60 percent. Eliminating the Electoral College to decide presidential elections: 56 percent. Federal funding of congressional campaigns: 54 percent. Eliminating the filibuster: 44 percent. Of course, there are significant partisan differences on these fixes: 81 percent of Democratic respondents said abolishing the Electoral College would improve democracy a lot/somewhat, versus just 32 percent of Republicans who agreed.
But the one fix where there’s bipartisan support is congressional term limits, with 81 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of independents and 67 percent of Democrats who think it would improve the U.S. democracy.

3d ago / 4:19 PM UTC On World Refugee Day, one campaign staffer shares his journey NEW HAMPSHIRE — Suraj Budathoki is a man of dates. March 5, 1990 is when he left Bhutan overnight at age nine as a political refugee with his family. February 24, 2009 is when he resettled in Atlanta, GA and began working two full-time jobs to support himself. December 5, 2009 is when he got to New Hampshire and soon after started taking classes at a community college, later earning a bachelor’s degree in political science and a masters’ degree in international relations.
And May 1, 2019 is when he started working for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign as his Constituency Director in New Hampshire.
Suraj Budathoki, constituency director for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, and Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. Courtesy of Suraj Budathoki Budathoki left Bhutan at a time when a sixth of the population was being evicted due to political persecution from an authoritarian government. But he says that when he finally got to America, he was unaware of how hard it would be to feel like he was succeeding.
Thursday was World Refugee Day, marked by the U.N. and Budathoki told NBC News that arriving in the U.S. was a shock. “When I came to the United States, I was unaware of the reality of America, the hardship, the recession,” he said. “I was unaware of all those things. And I was kind of traumatized.”
Budathoki says Sanders’ plans to address education and student debt, healthcare, income inequality and climate inspired him to get involved with the campaign.
""Suraj represents the promise of America and what this country can be,” Joe Caiazzo, Bernie Sanders’ New Hampshire State Director, told NBC News. “He overcame enormous hardships and built a life for him and his family in New Hampshire. Suraj became an entrepreneur, a leader in his community, and a role model not just for new Americans, but for all of us. We're lucky to have him on our team as we build our grassroots campaign throughout New Hampshire.""
Budathoki said while he and other refugees see America as a beacon of hope, the country isn’t addressing the underlying causes of refugee displacement — supporting authoritarian regimes, implementing imbalanced trade policies and tackling climate change. “We have a responsibility to answer these issues,” he said.
Budathoki says working on the Sanders campaign has been his “proudest moment.” To future refugees who want to get involved in the political process, Budathoki said, “Fight for your right. Speak up. No one has the right to dehumanize you.”

4d ago / 6:24 PM UTC Marianne Williamson walks back skeptical comments about vaccinations MANCHESTER, N.H. — Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson Thursday walked back comments expressing skepticism about government-mandated vaccinations.
Appearing on ""The View,” Williamson was challenged on remarks she made at an art gallery reception in Manchester, N.H. on Wednesday evening. When asked by an attendee about her perspective on medical freedom and choice, Williamson responded with her views on government-mandated vaccinations. “To me,"" she said, ""it’s no different than the abortion debate. The U.S. government doesn't tell any citizen, in my book, what they have to do with their body or their child.”
She added, “I have met very sincere, very smart people on both sides of the vaccine issue. I understand infectious diseases are no small deal, but I have to say I know as a mother, if you're telling me that I have to put a needle into the arm of my baby and I don't feel good about what's in that needle, I'm not sure about that.”
""I’ve seen too many mothers with just tears in their eyes,"" she added, ""with real fear. And that’s too draconian to me, it’s just too Orwellian to me.""
On Thursday, Williamson said that as president, she would have a commission of scientists, not paid by “big pharma,” to research vaccines and infectious diseases. ""The days of blind faith in big pharma are over,"" she said.
Pressed by ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain on calling mandatory vaccines “draconian” and “Orwellian,” Williamson responded, “I think I misspoke in that one sentence.”
She later added, “I understand that public safety must come first, but I also understand that we must have a balance between public safety and the issues of individual freedom. I do not trust the propaganda on either side,” telling co-host Whoopi Goldberg, “I support vaccines.”
The latest Monmouth University poll released on Thursday shows Williamson at one percent, along with Mayor Bill de Blasio, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Gov. Jay Inslee and Sen. Amy Klobuchar.

4d ago / 4:40 PM UTC Republicans launch anti-Medicare for All ad campaign tied to Dem debate WASHINGTON — As Democratic presidential candidates prepare to debate issues like health care next week in Miami, Republicans are preparing a major national ad campaign to try to turn public opinion against Medicare for All .
One Nation, a GOP group tied to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, is launching a $4 million campaign on national broadcast and cable TV, as well as radio and digital platforms around the debate to highlight what it calls ""horror-stories"" from Canada's single-payer health care system.
A handful of prominent Democratic presidential hopefuls , including Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris, are backing a Medicare-for-All approach to health care.
The ad focuses on long wait times patients have had to endure for procedures like heart surgery, with a narrator warning, ""Medicare for All would eliminate private insurance for 180 million people — you and every American waiting in the same government-run plan.""
“We’re going to make sure every American understands that Medicare for All means paying more for lower-quality care, longer wait times and restricted choice,” said One Nation President and CEO Steven Law. “If you’re a union worker, a family dependent on employer insurance, or a senior relying on traditional Medicare, so-called Medicare for All will turn your world upside down.”
While many presidential candidates have said they support ""Medicare for All,"" the term can actually apply to a wide variety of plans to overhaul the health care system.
Most candidates actually support an idea to give Americans the option to buy into a government-run system like Medicare, while Sanders calls for a more sweeping reform that would replace private insurance with a Canadian-style single-payer system like the ones described in the One Name ad.
The concept is a fairly new one to most Americans, which gives partisans on both sides have an opportunity to try to define it. Polls show a majority of Americans favor the idea of universal health care, but are confused about specifics of ""Medicare for All.""
One recent survey by a Democratic group found Americans favor an optional buy-in scheme, but are more hostile towards a full-blown Canadian-style system that would eliminate private insurance, giving Republicans an incentive to try to conflate the two in voters' minds.

4d ago / 10:12 PM UTC Mike Pence to headline pre-Democratic debate Miami event touting Hispanic support WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence will headline a speech on Tuesday in Miami to tout Hispanic support for the Trump-Pence 2020 ticket, just 24 hours before the first Democratic presidential debate there, according to two sources familiar with the plans.
The campaign is still finalizing the list of Latino leaders and business executives that Pence is expected to reveal in order to show support from a key demographic in the battleground state of Florida and beyond heading into next year’s election.
Tuesday’s speech will also mark the official rollout of the Trump campaign coalition and Florida Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez will be announced as national co-chair of the campaign, these sources said.
While President Trump won’t be traveling for any specific campaign events or rallies next week, he will be gearing up for a trip to Osaka, Japan for the G20, and will likely be aboard Air Force One for the first night of debates.
On Wednesday night, the president told Sean Hannity he might live-tweet the back-to-back events, though initially he said he had not planned to and called a Wall Street Journal report that he might “fake news.” Moments later, Trump changed his tune and said “Maybe I will now.”
It would not be surprising for Trump to use his favorite social media platform to react to the Democratic candidates on stage in Miami but it’s unclear whether he will be able to watch the second night of debates in real time while he’s on the ground in Osaka.
Next week, the day before the debates, Trump is expected to speak at a closed press fundraiser in Washington D.C. The following morning, June 26, he will speak at the Faith & Freedom Coalition conference in Washington. He’s expected to leave for Japan at some point after that.

4d ago / 12:23 PM UTC Sanders’ staff expands in early states as Warren rises CHICAGO — Sen. Bernie Sanders', I-Vt., presidential campaign has been expanding its field operation in early primary states, making dozens of hires as polls show his Democratic rivals surging.
His Iowa team has grown in recent days to include to 43 field organizers — a significant increase from just a few weeks ago. In New Hampshire, the campaign says it has more than doubled its staff and is planning new field office openings across the first in the nation primary state. Advisers say similar moves are taking place in South Carolina and Nevada.
While the increases reflect significant growth, Sanders' state staffing and field office levels still lag behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who has been rising in the polls. On Wednesday, Warren announced seven Iowa and four New Hampshire office openings.
Sanders’ advisers say the larger staff footprint will be used to better organize and mobilize volunteers as part of the “next phase of its organizing strategy.”
“We are seeing a lot of energy in our volunteers,” Sanders Iowa state director Misty Rebik told NBC News. “They’re coming out, they’re showing up, not only at big events when the senator is here, they’re coming up when the senator is not here.”
While campaign manager Faiz Shakir told NBC News these changes simply reflect a planned “strategy to build up through the summer and the fall,” the growth comes as polls show the race shifting.
Former Vice President Joe Biden has maintained a clear first-place position since entering the race, however multiple recent state and national polls have shown Warren challenging Sanders for second place.
When asked whether Warren's growth is threatening his position in the race, Sanders focuses on results that show him ahead when taking on President Trump. “Some of the polls have me doing a lot better than Elizabeth Warren, depending on the poll,” Sanders said to NBC’s Andrea Mitchell.
“If the American people are looking at the candidate who can defeat Trump, I’ll hope they’ll give serious consideration to our candidacy,” he said.
But Sanders has used his campaign to increasingly draw sharp contrasts with Biden, and most recently Warren. On Wednesday, Politico reported that ""centrists"" of the Democratic Party are warming to Warren.
Sanders retweeted a link to the story, saying, “the cat is out of the bag. The corporate wing of the Democratic Party is publicly ‘anybody but Bernie.’”

Georgia's strictest possible reading of the law to stop felons from voting,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/georigia-s-strictest-possible-reading-law-stop-felons-voting-n1011056,"SAVANNAH, Ga. — Leon Brown is trusted enough to drive a tractor-trailer inside one of the nation's busiest seaports more than six years after being released from prison. But he's not allowed to vote in Georgia because of a law rooted in the years after the Civil War, when whites sought to keep blacks from the ballot box. With a criminal history dating back decades, Brown, 53, has more than three years left on probation after serving behind bars for theft and credit card fraud. Enough time has passed that he qualifies for a federal government credential to deliver cargo to and from the Port of Savannah, but Brown can't take part in elections.
""I would like to vote,"" Brown said. ""I go off and do the time, come back out and they hold me hostage again because I'm on probation.""
Brown and tens of thousands of other Georgia residents are cut off from voting due to a vaguely worded law that state election officials interpret in the strictest possible manner.
Georgia strips voting rights from people convicted of all felonies, from murder to drug possession, even though a straightforward reading of the law suggests not all felons deserve such punishment.
Felons seeking to restore their voting rights must not only finish their prison sentences, but also any parole or probation, as well as pay any outstanding court fines. That has a big effect in Georgia, which has more people on probation than any other state.
The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld laws like Georgia's, which is not the nation's most severe. Kentucky and Iowa bar all felons from voting for life. So did Florida until voters last year approved a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights to those who serve their time. Nine other U.S. states permanently rescind voting rights for some felony convictions.
Voting policies in Georgia have been under a microscope since the 2018 elections, largely because of the close finish between new Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams. Abrams and her supporters accused Kemp, who campaigned while serving as Georgia's top elections official, of benefiting from restrictive policies adopted in the name of election security. Abrams said the policies actually prevented minorities and low-income voters from casting ballots. An advocacy group since formed by Abrams has co-filed a lawsuit accusing Kemp of mismanaging the election.
The debate in Georgia has all but ignored the voting rights of felons, even as the issue has gained traction nationally. A sweeping election bill recently passed by the Democrats in the U.S. House would allow felons to vote in federal elections as soon as they leave prison.
Georgia law prohibits voting by anyone convicted of a ""felony involving moral turpitude,"" a legal phrase rooted in the state's Reconstruction-era Constitution of 1877. The phrase has endured several revisions, including the latest version from 1983.
""It's a vague concept,"" said Julia Simon-Kerr, a University of Connecticut law professor who's spent the past decade researching the legal history of the phrase ""moral turpitude."" ''It can be used basically in discriminatory ways because it has very little solid, definitional meaning.""
State lawmakers have never defined which felonies involve ""moral turpitude."" Georgia election officials have long interpreted the state Constitution to mean all felonies trigger the loss of voting rights.
Not everyone agrees.
""If the Constitution states felonies 'involving moral turpitude,' then there must be felonies not involving moral turpitude,"" said Sean Young, Georgia legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""We should be asking Georgia politicians why they're so eager to restrict the franchise beyond what the Constitution allows.""
Georgia election officials say court rulings support denying voting rights to all felons. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's spokeswoman, Tess Hammock, said the state Supreme Court has ""directly weighed in on this question."" She cited a 1998 ruling that states ""in Georgia, all felonies are crimes involving moral turpitude,"" and a similar decision from 1979.
Neither of those cases dealt with voting rights. One upheld the disbarring of an attorney over a felony conviction. The other addressed whether a trial witness' criminal record could be used to attack his credibility.
The ACLU's Young said it's significant that neither case dealt with felons' voting rights because ""the same words can have different meaning in a different context.""
Others have questioned whether Georgia is right to prohibit all felons from voting. A panel formed by Kemp in 2011 to recommend changes to election laws suggested lawmakers consider defining felonies of ""moral turpitude"" for voting purposes. The state Senate this year approved a study committee to look at whether to exempt some nonviolent felonies from the voting ban.
Alabama has grappled with a similar law denying voting rights for crimes involving ""moral turpitude."" The U.S. Supreme Court in 1985 struck down the original, ruling its adoption in 1901 was guided by a ""zeal for white supremacy.""
Alabama later restored the ""moral turpitude"" standard and kept it vague until 2017. That's when state lawmakers facing a federal lawsuit defined those crimes as 46 felonies, leaving out some lesser ones, such as drug possession.
In Georgia, the law says felons don't regain the ability to vote ""except upon completion of the sentence."" State officials interpret that to mean not just prison time, but also parole and probation.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, Georgia had 410,964 people on probation as of 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. That's far more than any other state. California had 288,911 probationers, despite having a population almost four times that of Georgia.
Felony convictions barred 248,751 Georgia residents — 3 percent of the state's voting-age population — from voting in 2016, according to the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based advocacy group that studies racial disparities in criminal sentences. Of those, 58 percent were African Americans, who make up 30 percent of the state population.
Brown left prison in 2012 after serving about two years for stealing $80 and a credit card that he used to run up $442.48 in fraudulent charges.
""I didn't hurt anybody,"" he said. ""I just did something stupid.""

Phillies outfielder Odúbel Herrera arrested in domestic case,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/phillies-outfielder-od-bel-herrera-arrested-domestic-case-n1011026,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Odúbel Herrera was placed on administrative leave Tuesday by Major League Baseball following his arrest in a domestic violence case at an Atlantic City casino a day earlier. Herrera was arrested Monday night on an assault charge at the Golden Nugget Casino.
Police say they were called on a report of a domestic assault and found a 20-year-old woman ""with visible signs of injury to her arms and neck,"" which they said were caused by Herrera, whom they described as her boyfriend.
The 27-year-old, whose full name is David Odúbel Herrera, was released on a summons pending a future court date.
The Phillies issued a statement Tuesday saying they were taking the matter seriously and support the joint agreement between the league and players' union covering domestic violence.
""This morning we were made aware of an alleged incident involving Odúbel Herrera,"" the statement read. ""Upon receiving this information, we immediately reported the incident to Major League Baseball, which has informed us that Herrera has been placed on administrative leave.""
The leave was effective Tuesday and can last up to seven days. In previous MLB investigations, the length of the administrative leave frequently has been extended while the probe continues.
The center fielder is hitting .222 with 1 home run and 16 RBIs in 39 games this season.
The Phillies did not play on Memorial Day.
When Atlantic City police officers arrived at the casino at 8:33 p.m., they saw the 20-year-old Philadelphia woman speaking with security officers. ""The victim had visible signs of injury to her arms and neck that was sustained after being assaulted by her boyfriend, David Odúbel Herrera, during a dispute,"" police said, adding that the woman declined medical treatment.
Herrera was arrested without incident in his hotel room. It could not immediately be determined if he has hired a lawyer who could comment on his behalf.
MLB and the players' association agreed to a domestic violence policy in 2015, giving the commissioner the right to investigate and impose discipline. If discipline is warranted, a paid leave can be converted to a suspension without pay. Players cited previously under the policy include José Reyes, Aroldis Chapman, Yasiel Puig, Héctor Olivera, Jeurys Familia, Steven Wright, Miguel Sanó and Addison Russell."
Job burnout: How to spot it and take action,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/job-burnout-how-spot-it-take-action-n1011116,"Finding a suitable balance between work and daily living is a challenge that many workers in the United States face. Excelling in the office, exceeding expectations, and climbing the corporate ladder are all a part of the American dream. But many Americans struggle to successfully combine work, family commitments and personal life.
And that struggle can lead to an all-too-familiar feeling: burnout.
This American company makes employees take mandatory vacation May 17, 2019 02:02 In fact, occupational burnout is such a problem in the U.S. and around the world that the World Health Organization decided to address the problem during its recently concluded World Health Assembly in Geneva.
The WHO said Tuesday that “burnout” is an “occupational phenomenon” that could lead someone to seek care although they did not go as far as to call it an official medical condition.
The international body even updated its International Classification of Diseases list , which is used globally as a benchmark for health diagnosis, to include the following identifiers to help doctors easily spot the syndrome:
Feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion Increased mental distance from one's job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job Reduced professional efficacy. Why are we so burned out? One reason may be the increasing globalization and technology use, which compel 24/7 connectivity, creating an environment in which it is almost impossible to disengage from work.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which represents the vast majority of the world’s most advanced economies, says 11 percent of U.S. employees work 50 or more hours a week and the average American spends 40 percent of their day dedicated to their job. As a result, the U.S. ranks toward the bottom of the work-life balance spectrum among developed countries.
And there’s a cost to the burnout: Stressful jobs contribute to 120,000 deaths each year and cost U.S. businesses up to $190 billion in health care costs, according to a 2016 paper from researchers at the Harvard Business School and Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.
Related Lifestyle Lifestyle These are the least stressed states in America. Did yours make the list? We asked a psychologist, Shainna Ali, owner of Integrated Counseling Solutions in Orlando, Florida, how to spot work burnout and prevent it before we log hours far beyond the point of diminishing returns.
Suddenly hitting a wall? Job burnout can result from a number of factors, including work-life imbalance, a dysfunctional work environment and unclear job expectations.
“Job burnout normally includes signs of mental health concerns that are based around work … [such as] depleted mood, lack of motivation, or anxiety,” Ali said. “People joke about the Sunday night blues. It’s as if around 4 p.m., they give a collective groan — that’s a real thing. People should ask themselves, do I feel better when I’m leaving work? Do I grow anxious when others discuss work in leisure settings?”
She also notes that burnout is often generally related to anxiety, and less commonly, to depression, but that it varies from person to person. One reason may be that U.S. adults are stressed in general and are not taking enough personal time away from work.
Should life be this stressful? May 8, 2019 08:38 A 2018 Gallup poll of 150,000 people around the world found that Americans were the most stressed. Fifty-five percent of Americans said they had experienced stress during much of their day in 2018 — much higher than the global average, which sat around 35 percent. They also found that Americans take fewer vacation days than people in any other country in the world.
Ways to combat work burnout Ali says breaking negative patterns that lead to job burnout can be tricky, but paying attention to one’s needs is essential to promoting well-being in the workplace.
She suggests three ways to establish self-care in the workplace:
Foster wellness in the workplace by establishing healthy connections at work Use break time effectively, by going for walks and participating in quick, enjoyable activities Take a vacation. She adds that the WHO’s guideline changes highlight the need for human resources departments to look more deeply into establishing positive workplace environments.
“I think this acknowledgement by the WHO gives job burnout some validity that this is a concern at work and warrants attention. Self-care is important and surging in popularity, even in the workplace,” Ali told NBC News.
“It's easy to forget about self-care. We may not notice it initially but over time the effect can be dramatic, even dangerous. Fortunately, as people weigh the costs and benefits of self-care more and more, they are finding that healthy mental practices can have a tremendous effect in and out of the workplace,” she added.

Michelle Chen: Trump's latest immigration plan proves his policies were never just about ending undocumented migration,www.nbcnews.com,Michelle Chen,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-latest-immigration-plan-proves-his-policies-were-never-ncna1011111,"In between considering a batch of pardons for convicted war criminals and stonewalling a congressional investigation into his own alleged crimes, President Donald Trump last week deigned to lecture immigrants about “personal responsibility,” reminding communities of their duty to be self-sufficient. He announced that he would hold family members of immigrants accountable for whatever social welfare benefits are used by those they sponsor to come to the United States. But billing immigrant sponsors for their loved ones’ welfare costs is not about responsibility, it’s about assaulting the bonds of family and community at the heart of a democratic society.
The White House memorandum resurrects an obscure and rarely enforced provision of a Clinton-era welfare reform law that mandates the sponsors of new immigrants — primarily citizens who are supporting immigrant family members seeking to resettle in the U.S. — to compensate Uncle Sam for any need-based federal aid that the immigrants receive, such as Medicaid. Though the administration has not spelled out how various agencies running public assistance programs will actually calculate the costs or compel individuals to repay their “debts,” the subtext is clear: The administration wants to prioritize what little is left of the threadbare federal safety net for white, native-born citizens.
Related Opinion Opinion Trump's base loves his immigration rhetoric. But they won't like its economic effects. The memorandum further illustrates Trump's overarching immigration agenda — a business-friendly program that aims to prioritize “merit-based” immigration , based on skills and education, rather than family reunification, which has historically driven the growth of immigrant communities.
The memorandum is, more broadly, the latest in a string of Trumpian schemes to exclude immigrants from public services and civic life. Earlier this month, the administration moved to kick immigrants out of federally subsidized housing through a ban on undocumented immigrants — even those living with legal-resident family members — who are currently able to live in mixed-status households. The proposed rule would lead to the eviction of an estimated 55,000 children who are either citizens or green card holders. Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, claimed the policy aims to preserve “our scarce public resources” for legal residents.
But the assumption that government-supported housing is too “scarce” to share with immigrants blatantly ignores the fact that many citizens are deeply embedded in mixed-status households that form the lifeblood of multicultural communities. Driving immigrants into homelessness won’t alleviate the shortage of affordable housing , but it would aggravate the terror already haunting poor immigrant families under Trump.
Related Opinion Opinion Trump's immigration strategy has always been about race, not the law The threat of eviction deepens the panic that the administration triggered with an ongoing campaign to penalize immigrants for using social welfare . Last fall, a proposed rule change sought to tighten the criteria for deeming immigrants likely to become a “public charge” — or at risk of becoming primarily dependent on public assistance — when immigrants apply for admission to the U.S. or for a green card. Immigration authorities could, under the new policy, evaluate immigrants by judging their estimated need for cash assistance, potential for dependence on long-term institutional care under Medicaid or even their mental health status or English proficiency. It’s yet another signal that the administration seeks to penalize immigrants for using government assistance even when they are fully entitled to it.
Although the public-charge rule has not yet been implemented, according to the Urban Institute , surveys already show a major chilling effect: Last year, about one in seven adults in immigrant families avoided using a noncash form of public assistance, like food stamps — including one-fifth of low income immigrants. Reflecting the racialized nature of Trump’s border crackdown, Latinx adults in immigrant families were twice as likely as other racial groups to report being deterred from benefits programs. Many immigrants have apparently determined that it’s safer to expose themselves to illness or hunger than to risk running into trouble with immigration authorities.
So the impact could be even more devastating if the proposed rule actually goes into effect. According to the Migration Policy Institute , out of an estimated 27 million immigrants and family members who would potentially be affected, “5.4 million to 16.2 million ... could be expected to disenroll from programs.” Both citizen and noncitizen children would potentially lose access to health care, food stamps and other benefits, because “their families deem the potential immigration consequences of continued access to be too great.""
Trump’s war on immigrants is expanding to target people who support immigrants as well. Under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the administration launched an unprecedented assault on so-called “sanctuary cities,” by threatening to cut off federal funds for the growing network of municipalities that have pledged to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. City leaders have managed to thwart the administration's move, but unilateral federal crackdowns on immigrants continue in cities regardless of local backlash.
Related Opinion Opinion Trump's border wall is meant to remind all Latinos that we're unwelcome An even cruder attack on allies of immigrants was the prosecution of four volunteers who tried to aid migrants at the southwest Arizona border. The humanitarian workers, members of the group No More Deaths, were convicted last January after getting “caught” placing jugs of water in a protected desert area for migrants making the deadly journey.
Trump’s anti-immigrant decrees effectively weaponize the politics of exclusion, by imposing shame and stigma on immigrants just for seeking support from a public agency or relying on it for the care of a loved one. And the administration's efforts to wield the law to attack the loved ones of migrants — to impose debts on their family members, to criminalize even the smallest act of charity — all play into a crusade to shift the border ever inward, seeking to divide communities and further alienate the undocumented. But the relatives, neighbors and allies of immigrants will never stop supporting their loved ones, with or without papers. Trump has only raised the price of defending the unbreakable bonds of family, across communities and beyond borders.

The lawyer, who wore a navy suit, blue shirt, and blue/silver tie with white dots, made two brief appearances in a lower Manhattan courthouse to answer charges on his indictments for the separate alleged schemes.
Michael Avenatti in court for 2 arraignments in 1 day May 28, 2019 04:04 In answering the Nike matter, Avenatti told the judge he was ""100 percent not guilty!""
Earlier in the day, a defense lawyer for Avenatti asked if he could be allowed to argue for the Daniels case to be combined with the other prosecutions and heard in Southern California where the defendant works and lives.
Prosecutors called that request a stall tactic while a judge said she'll consider that question at a later date.
Despite Avenatti's sticky legal situation, the anti-Trump agitator still managed a comedic shot at the president and his son, asking reporters, ""Does anyone know when the president and Don Jr. will be arraigned?""
The combative lawyer cast this prosecution in biblical terms, with himself as the defendant poised to topple a huge giant.
""For over 20 years, I have represented David versus Goliaths in courthouses just like this one,"" he told reporters. ""I intend to fight the ultimate Goliath, the Trump administration.""
Avenatti allegedly tricked Daniels' literary representative to forward payments from her book's publisher to an account he controlled and not to the writer. He's also accused of demanding money from Nike on behalf of a youth basketball coach who had information that company employees made illicit payments to the families of high school athletes.
Avenatti remains free on bail.

It's only the latest outbreak of extreme weather that's been plaguing the U.S. for nearly two weeks. Tuesday's violent weather marks the 13th consecutive day of such severe storms, coming a day after a series of devastating tornadoes hit western Ohio late Monday . That dangerous streak included an average of 27.5 tornadoes occurring each day.
Tornado is seen in Wabash County, Indiana on May 27, 2019. Will Woodward / Reuters Storms capable of producing hail, damaging winds and tornadoes have hit from the Central Plains into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service. Police confirmed Tuesday evening that a tornado hit southwest of Lawrence, Kansas, in the eastern part of the state.
The National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency for the areas around Kansas City and urged residents to take shelter, advising them to seek the lowest level in the most interior room.
The agency had also predicted that tornadoes may strike across the Upper Ohio Valley and Northeast States into Tuesday evening. Extreme weather warnings were issued across the state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, including tornado warnings for Scranton, Dunmore, Wilkes-Barre and the Poconos.
Leavenworth County, Kansas, Undersheriff Jim Sherley said 24 to 30 homes suffered extensive damage in storms there, but all reported injuries were minor. The storm ran through the communities of Linwood and Bonner Springs, and numerous power lines and trees were down in the path of the storm, he said.
Tornado warnings were issued for Staten Island in New York City as well as Newark and Elizabeth, New Jersey, late Tuesday evening.
There were no tornadoes reported in the New York City metropolitan area, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center website . New York City's office of emergency management tweeted that the tornado threat for Staten Island had passed as of 10:30 p.m.
An emergency management official in Stanhope, New Jersey, reported storm damage to the outside of Lenape Valley Regional High School, but there was no damage to the interior of the school and the 50 to 100 people inside the building for an athletic banquet were safely evacuated.
Two people sustained “very minor injuries” but refused medical treatment after a light pole fell on the car they were in in a parking lot. It won’t be clear if there was an actual tornado until an assessment is done Wednesday, officials said.
A tornado did touch down near Morgantown in Berks County, Pennsylvania, the weather service said, based on video showing the tornado on the ground, but an assessment still needs to be completed.
At this time, we can confirm that a tornado did occur near Morgantown in Berks County PA based on video received showing a tornado on the ground. A final assessment including results of the survey are expected to be completed and transmitted via a PNS by Wednesday evening.
— NWS Mount Holly (@NWS_MountHolly) May 29, 2019 Damaged buildings and downed trees were reported throughout Berks County, including Caernavon Township and Morgantown, but no serious injuries were reported, NBC Philadelphia reported .
There were no tornado watches across the country as of late Tuesday, according to the weather service, but northeastern Kansas, parts of northern Missouri, southern Iowa and central Illinois were under flash flood warnings.
At least one person died and 12 others were injured late Monday night after a tornado devastated the Dayton, Ohio, area. The National Weather Service confirmed a ""large and dangerous"" tornado on the ground near the Dayton suburb of Trotwood in Montgomery County just after 11 p.m.
Neighbors in Clayton, Ohio gather belongings after houses were damaged after a tornado touched down overnight near Dayton, Ohio on May 28, 2019. Kyle Grillot / Reuters The weather service issued 36 tornado warnings overnight Monday across the region.
A twister touched down in Pendleton, about 35 miles from Indianapolis, on Monday evening. At least 75 homes were damaged there and in nearby Huntsville, said Madison County Emergency Management spokesman Todd Harmeson. No serious injuries were reported.
Intense rain in Kansas and northeast Oklahoma have strained aging dams and levees, and a reservoir in Oklahoma that drains a massive watershed hit record water levels. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a large dam to control the river flow, which put Fort Smith — the second-largest city in Arkansas — in the path of record-breaking flooding expected to last all week.
""The whole purpose of a dam is to capture that flood water and not let it run freely down the river,"" said Preston Chasteen, deputy chief of public affairs for the Corps' Tulsa District. ""If these dams weren't in place to control these releases, I think the circumstances would be far worse than they currently are.""

She said the time she spent in the Makawao Forest Reserve in North Maui was an ""opportunity"" to be ""stripped away of all the comforts of this modern world and see what was left.""
During the news conference, Eller also said a prayer for Noah Mina, 35, who was reported missing on May 20 in the area of Kapilau Ridge Trail, also known as the Saint Anthony Cross, in Wailuku.
""I'm asking with all of these hearts and all of these beautiful people behind this prayer today that we reach Noah, that we are able to touch his heart, to help him in this moment of confusion, to find clarity for, his life, his purpose, his self, to find the love within himself to stay alive,"" she said, in part.
Javier Cantellops, one of the rescuers who found Eller on Friday, said over the weekend that he was meeting with Mina's family to put together a search team.
Amanda Eller was reported missing in Maui on May 9. Troy Helmer Eller, a physical therapist and yoga instructor, said she spent her first week trying to become visible to helicopters after she lost her way in the more than 2,000 acre reserve. She says she fell down a 20-foot cliff and became disoriented.
Eller, 35, had left her water bottle, cellphone and wallet in her car when she embarked on what she thought would be a three-mile hike. She said she began to feel ""invisible"" days after she went missing as she went unnoticed.
""As the helicopters are passing over and not seeing me, I'm invisible,"" she said. ""You lose hope. Your hope meter starts to decline a little bit.""
She was rescued on May 24 when she was spotted by a helicopter team. By that time, she could barely walk. Her shoes were swept away in a flash flood when she was trying to dry them.
She fractured her leg, tore the meniscus in her knee, got a skin infection and severe sunburn in the ordeal.
Asked what she would say to skeptics who doubt her story, Eller said she ""wants to focus all of her energy on the positive.""
She said she has had ""a few disruptive people"" approach her and ""say some disruptive things.""
“I think there’s a lot of confused, delusional people out there,” she said. “I’m not taking it to heart and I’m not taking that energy in. I’m so grateful to be alive.”

Lyft passenger caught on camera violently beating driver,www.nbcnews.com,Safia Samee Ali,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lyft-passenger-caught-camera-violently-beating-driver-n1011136,"Authorities in New York are searching for a passenger who violently attacked a Lyft driver during the course of a trip last Thursday. The driver, Eduardo Madiedo, 36, said he was beaten while driving two passengers to Mount Sinai Hospital in Astoria, Queens.
Madiedo’s dashcam captured the encounter, which began after a male passenger got into the car with an older woman who held him as he laid in the back seat moaning as if in pain for several minutes.
The passenger then removes his shirt and, using profane language, tells Madiedo to drive faster by cutting in front of the cars ahead.
Madiedo warns the passenger, “Excuse me, man, if you’re gonna be disrespectful I’ll just pull over right now,” which triggered the man to repeatedly and violently punch the driver's head while the car was still moving.
“Out of nowhere, he started punching in back of the head as much as he could,"" Madiedo told NBC News, adding that he was in the middle of rush-hour traffic and was struggling to keep control of the car during the attack. “I wear driving glasses that he knocked off my face.”
The video then shows the passenger lunging forward in an effort to get into the front seat while aggressively grabbing Madiedo by the neck as he pulls the car over.
The woman urges the man, who is screaming hysterically, to stop and they both exit the car. Seconds later, the man pummels Madiedo once again through the window. ""He tried to open my door from the inside to pull me out of the car,” Madiedo said.
Lyft said it permanently banned the passenger from the ride-sharing app, according to WNBC-TV . The company has not released details of the man's identity.
“It is unacceptable for a professional driver to have to fear being in his work environment. We are grateful that Mr. Madiedo wasn’t seriously injured, and have every confidence that his attacker will be facing the consequences of his actions as soon as possible,"" said Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, which regulates the for-hire vehicle industry in New York City, according to WNBC-TV. ""It should also be noted that Mr. Madiedo was victimized while communicating a crucial safety message to his two passengers, which makes this unwarranted violence all the more disturbing.""
Aside from bumps on the back of his head, bruises and soreness, Madiedo said he did not suffer any serious injuries, but the incident was a ""turning point"" for him and he's not sure he's going to continue working as a ride-share driver.
""I feel anxious to go back to work,"" he said. ""I have to go in a different direction, it's not a safe way to go anymore.”
Madiedo said he is sharing the harrowing video in the hopes that it will help apprehend the man who attacked him.
""I want the gentleman to get caught and face consequences,” he said. ""If there are no repercussions, anyone can do this.""

"Johnson & Johnson opioids helped create 'worst man-made public health crisis in history,' Oklahoma says in court - NBC News",www.nbcnews.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/johnson-johnson-opioids-helped-create-worst-man-made-public-health-n1011161,"NORMAN, Okla. — The first trial against a pharmaceutical opioid manufacturer started Tuesday in Oklahoma in what could be a precedent-setting case for hundreds of other claims around the country. The state's attorney general, Mike Hunter, began the day by accusing Johnson & Johnson of putting profits over responsibility and argued that the company was responsible for the ""worst man-made public health crisis in the history of our state and country.""
In the multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the drugmaker, lawyers for the state argued that Johnson & Johnson knew about the addictive nature of opioids, but misled doctors by downplaying the risks of the drugs while touting its benefits.
Brad Beckworth, a lawyer for Oklahoma, argued that Johnson & Johnson was motivated to increase sales on multiple fronts as both the manufacturer of the drugs Duragesic and Nucynta and as a supplier of the raw materials for other opioid manufacturers. He argued that a marketing push by Johnson & Johnson lead doctors to overprescribe opioids in Oklahoma.
“If you oversupply, people will die,” Beckworth repeatedly said in his opening statement while showing email communications from Johnson & Johnson sales representatives.
Beckworth argued those emails showed the pressure tactics the company used to get doctors to prescribe Johnson & Johnson’s drugs.
State's attorney Brad Beckworth presents information in the opening statements during the Oklahoma v. Johnson &amp; Johnson opioid trial at the Cleveland County Courthouse in Norman, Oklahoma on May 28, 2019. Chris Landsberger / Pool via Reuters In its defense, Johnson & Johnson lawyer Larry Ottway argued that the company clearly labeled its drugs and highlighted the addictive nature and risks of its product. Ottway displayed for the court slides of all the warnings that come with its drugs. He also argued that Johnson and Johnson's share of the opioid market in Oklahoma was too small to be responsible for the crisis.
Oklahoma settled with two other drug manufacturers before Tuesday’s opening statements. In March, Purdue Pharma settled for $270 million, and on Sunday, Teva Pharmaceuticals settled for $85 million, leaving Johnson & Johnson as the sole defendants in what could a monthslong bench trial.
Ottway addressed Johnson & Johnson’s position as the sole remaining defendant, concluding “if you’re right, you must fight.”

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., greets the crowd before holding a town hall meeting at Grand Rapids Christian High School's DeVos Center for Arts and Worship on Tuesday. Cory Morse / The Grand Rapids Press via AP Breaking News Emails May 29, 2019, 3:25 AM UTC / Updated May 29, 2019, 3:36 AM UTC By Leigh Ann Caldwell and Alex Moe GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — More than 800 people showed up to a town hall Tuesday night to both praise and berate the only Republican member of Congress who has called for impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. It’s the first time Rep. Justin Amash has faced voters in a question-and-answer setting since declaring on Twitter less than two weeks ago that he supported opening impeachment proceedings. He entered Tuesday to a standing ovation from many, but was also greeted with deep skepticism, and even anger, by others during the sometimes-contentious two-hour event. The libertarian-leaning Republican, who often is the lone Republican to vote against his party, reminded voters that his job is not to represent the position of voters in his district but to “uphold the Constitution.” President Donald Trump supporters, including Grand Rapids resident Anna Timmer, from left, heckle Rep. Justin Amash, R-Cascade Township, at Grand Rapids Christian High School's DeVos Center for Arts and Worship on May 28, 2019. Cory Morse / The Grand Rapids Press via AP Amash, who was first elected to Congress in 2010 as part of the tea party wave focused on a limited government and ballooning deficits, has repeatedly bucked his party on issues of government spending, health care and now impeachment. His support of an impeachment inquiry puts him in line with just more than three dozen Democratic House members. That group does not yet include House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Amash on Tuesday defended his position, which he said he came to after reading the 448-page report by special counsel Robert Mueller, saying that it’s not about criminality but about losing the trust of the public. He cited Volume II of the Mueller report that outlines nearly a dozen instances where President Donald Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation. “Obstruction of justice is more relevant when there is no charge in the underlying crime,” Amash said in response to woman in a red “Make America Great Again” hat who said she was “disappointed” with Amash’s statement. He told the two high school girls who thanked him and their AP government teacher for teaching them to think critically that his biggest concern was that partisanship has supplanted congressional independence and that he fears “we’ve gotten to the point that impeachment will never be used.” Rep. Justin Amash, R-Cascade Township, holds a town hall meeting at Grand Rapids Christian High School's DeVos Center for Arts and Worship on May 28, 2019. Cory Morse / The Grand Rapids Press via AP One impassioned woman stood to tell Amash that she logged countless hours volunteering for his first congressional campaign but has since changed her opinion of him. “You have spent the last two years failing to do your job,” the woman said to Amash. She defended Trump, saying that the president and his campaign were spied upon. Amash said that the president cares little about the individual privacy rights except when it might affect him. ""They are not protecting your rights. They want to protect the president. But the rest of you, forget about it,"" Amash said. ""The government can spy on all of you."" Amash said he had not yet ruled out a presidential campaign against Trump, running as an independent or a Libertarian. Some in the audience accused the congressman of overlooking his district and trying to raise his national profile with his impeachment comments. The crowd included Democrats who had never voted for Amash but wanted to support him, Republicans who wanted to hear him explain himself and hard-core Trump supporters who came to challenge him. His primary opponent, Jim Lower, also attended. Lower told NBC News that since he announced his primary challenge after Amash voiced his support for impeachment proceedings, he’s received a significant amount of support. ""I just think he’s a very slim minority of people who have come to that conclusion, and that’s not surprising because in Congress he is usually a lone 'no' vote or he thinks that he is smarter than everyone or he thinks somehow he sees things that they aren’t,"" Lower said. ""Frankly, it’s out of step with reality and its out of step with where the voters are at."" Cathy Garnaat, a Republican who supported Amash and the president said she was upset about Amash’s position but wanted to hear his reasoning. She said that she will definitely support Trump in 2020 but that Tuesday night was the first time she had heard that the Mueller report didn’t completely exonerate the president. “I was surprised to hear there was anything negative in the Mueller report at all about President Trump. I hadn’t heard that before,"" she said. ""I’ve mainly listened to conservative news and I hadn’t heard anything negative about that report and President Trump has been exonerated."" Cheryl Wanless, a Republican who has supported Amash, said she was confused by his position but after hearing him speak, doesn't “have a problem proceeding with"" impeachment. “Though in the back of my mind, I know it is not going to pass the Senate most likely,"" she said. ""But if the process has to go this far, I think that’s fine — go ahead."" Amash expressed criticism of Trump beyond the Mueller inquiry. He said that the government at the top is lacking in ethics and morality, which he says matter. He told an African American man who wondered why Trump was being demonized when the president has helped minorities. Amash countered by saying that many would disagree and that is the president “demonizes” people. “Why are people so angry with each other when the economy is doing so well?” Amash rhetorically asked. “I think it’s because of the tone the people are setting at the top.” Leigh Ann Caldwell Leigh Ann Caldwell is a political reporter for NBC News who covers Capitol Hill and elections.

"Dangerous floods leave Plains, Midwest 'at the mercy of Mother Nature'",www.nbcnews.com,Kerry Sanders,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/dangerous-floods-leave-plains-midwest-mercy-mother-nature-n1011156,"TULSA, Okla. — The 3,000 electronic games and gaming tables are silent at the River Spirit Casino Resort as the water encroaches, idling more than 1,500 employees in an eerie scene threatening to repeat itself in flood-soaked communities across the Midwest and the Great Plains. The 200,000-square-foot gambling mecca has been closed since the Arkansas River began flooding last week, and it's expected to remain closed until at least the middle of next week , said Muscogee (Creek) Nation Casinos, which operates the casino.
The casino's pool bar is under water, which has even entered its famed tiki bar, the resort said.
""We're still at the mercy of Mother Nature, waiting for the water to stop rising,"" Pat Crofts, the company's chief executive, said Tuesday.
The Army Corps of Engineers has been releasing 275,000 cubic feet of water per second from the Keystone Dam, which protects Tulsans from the waters of Keystone Lake and the Arkansas and Cimarron rivers upstream.
David Williams, a hydrologist with the Corps, said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that ""heavy rainfall this morning has largely remained below the reservoir, below Keystone Dam, and short-term weather models suggest that this trend will continue through the remainder of today.""
Williams said thereservoir's elevation peaked Tuesday and was not dropping. He added that in the ""absence of additional rainfall and inflow coming into the reservoir,"" the Corps will maintain the release of 275,000 cubic feet of water per second from the dam through late Thursday. It will then begin to reduce the magnitude of that release, he said.
""We were very fortunate last night, for the first time in about a week and a half, the weather broke our way,"" Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said at the news conference. ""The rain that we were anticipating to be pretty severe ended up not being as bad as projected.""
More than 2 million gallons of water a second has been flowing toward Tulsa, putting the city's 75-year-old network of levees at risk of failing. If that were to happen, entire neighborhoods would flood with water that the Tulsa Health Department said is likely to be full of snakes, sewage and debris.
Bynum warned that despite the night of better weather, there was still work to be done and residents should ""remain vigilant"" and while there was no emergency in regards to the levees at the moment, ""there is high risk.""
He encouraged people living near the levees to consider proactively relocating.
""The river is still having a release out of the dam that’s highest than it’s been in over three decades, we still have a long way to go before we’re in a safe pace in this community,"" he said.
""This is not a time to be taking a deep breath and relaxing, we’re still in a very dangerous situation right now,"" he said.
Severe weather outbreak: Millions across U.S. face new risks May 29, 2019 02:06 The National Weather Service in Norman said a severe thunderstorm watch was in effect until 5 p.m. for parts of south central and southeast Oklahoma, with clusters of storms continuing to impact the southern part of the state.
At least six deaths have been confirmed in Oklahoma since the severe weather and flooding began early last week, the state's chief medical examiner said. Every county in the state remained under emergency declarations Tuesday.
Two levees northwest of Little Rock on the Arkansas side of the river have already been topped as the flooding swallows up much of the Arkansas-Oklahoma border, according to the state Department of Emergency Management, which closed two major bridges spanning the river Monday night.
Related News News Extreme weather spans coast-to-coast with multiple tornadoes and severe storms plaguing the country In Pulaski County, Arkansas, Two Rivers Park and its dam, along with the Big Dam Bridge, were closed as the Arkansas River reached 22.4 feet on Tuesday, on its way to a forecast crest of 27.2 feet by Sunday, well above flood stage.
""This is a very catastrophic, not-yet-over scenario that we're dealing with,"" Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., said.
At the tip of the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Missouri and the Mississippi rivers in Missouri, the Rivers Pointe Fire Protection District told residents of Portage Des Sioux and West Alton to evacuate as the Mississippi crests.
""The levees are tired, just plain and simple,"" Fire Chief Rick Pender said.
At least seven people have died because of flooding and tornadoes across Missouri, the Highway Patrol and the state Department of Public Safety said Tuesday.
""I've been here 5½ years, and I've been through two 50-year floods,"" Mark Newlin of Portage De Sioux told NBC affiliate KSDK of St. Louis. ""And they're calling this a 100-year flood.""
One death has been confirmed in Iowa, that of an unidentified person in the town of Adair, near Des Moines, authorities said.
""This is the worst I've seen it,"" Russ Bates of Council Bluffs, just across the Missouri River from Omaha, Nebraska, told NBC affiliate WOWT of Omaha. ""I think the storm drains just can't handle it.""
Bates said he thought he was OK when he left for work Tuesday morning. But when he returned home in the afternoon, water ""was coming in my doors.""
Flooded homes along the Arkansas River in Sand Spring, Oklahoma, on Tuesday. Communities that have seen little rain are getting hit by historic flooding along the Arkansas River thanks to downpours upstream. DroneBase via AP In Casey, about 25 miles west of Des Moines, winds associated with the storm were so fierce that they flipped over four semitrailers on Interstate 80 on Tuesday morning.
""One minute you're driving, and the next second you're on your side sliding down the interstate,"" Sgt. Nathan Ludwig, a spokesman for the Iowa State Patrol, told NBC affiliate WHO of Des Moines.
The storm knocked over several large trees at the Oakwood Cemetery nearby.
""Oh my goodness. I can't believe how such old trees can just be toppled,"" Romonia Dinkla, the cemetery's treasurer, told WHO. ""It's just amazing, and I didn't want to look in that hole.""
While no coffins were disturbed, the cemetery is faced with a mammoth cleanup effort.
""We really don't have the budget for something like this, so we're going to have to rely on volunteers,"" Dinkla said. ""We have a volunteer cleanup every year, but this is going to take major volunteers.""

McConnell says he'd confirm Supreme Court justice in election year The comment, however, diverges from his decision in 2016 to not consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland following the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier that year. “What can’t be undone is a lifetime appointment,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. “That’s the most important thing that we have done for the country, which cannot be undone.” J. Scott Applewhite / AP file Breaking News Emails May 29, 2019, 4:16 AM UTC / Updated May 29, 2019, 2:13 PM UTC By Rebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp V WASHINGTON — If a Supreme Court vacancy emerges next year, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Tuesday that he would fill it. The comment, however, diverges from his decision in 2016 to not consider President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia earlier that year. WATCH: Mitch McConnell's stance on confirming Supreme Court vacancy in 2016 vs. 2020 May 29, 2019 01:02 At a chamber luncheon in Paducah, Kentucky, on Tuesday, McConnell was asked by a member of the audience, “Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?"" “I would fill it,” he responded, smirking, which drew loud laughter. McConnell said that while the 2017 GOP tax cuts could be repealed in the future, judicial confirmations are more permanent. “What can’t be undone is a lifetime appointment,"" McConnell said. “That’s the most important thing that we have done for the country, which cannot be undone.” McConnell has said that the biggest decision he has made in his Senate career was his choice not to consider Garland’s nomination. “I made the call in 2016 that we would not fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia in the last year of the previous administration, a decision of enormous consequences,” he said. “You may have recalled the level of controversy that it produced. I thought I was on pretty firm ground because if I knew the shoe had been on the other foot, the guys on the other side would have done the same thing. That provided an opportunity for the American people to speak up about who they wanted to make that decision.” In a tweet Tuesday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called McConnell a hypocrite. | | — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) May 29, 2019 Shortly after Obama nominated Garland in March 2016, McConnell said on the Senate floor: ""The American people may well elect a president who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next president may also nominate someone very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people a voice in the filling of this vacancy.” He then told Garland that afternoon by phone that the Senate would not consider his nomination. McConnell consistently cited the so-called Biden Rule, an informal understanding that a president should not be able to name a judge to the Supreme Court during an election year. McConnell and then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, would not even allow a hearing on Garland’s nomination. The bet paid off when Trump was elected and was able to nominate conservative Neil Gorsuch to the court. Asked for a comment Tuesday night, McConnell spokesman David Popp referred NBC News to an interview the majority leader did with Fox News in October 2018, and said “it’s not a reversal” because “2020 (would not) be the same as 2016.” In that interview, host Chris Wallace asked McConnell what he would do if Trump were to name someone to the Supreme Court in the final year of his first term in 2020. “Well, I understand your question of what I told you is what the history of the Senate has been. You have to go back to 1880 to find the last time a vacancy created in a presidential election year on the Supreme Court was confirmed by a Senate of a different party than the president,"" McConnell said. McConnell has conveyed this reasoning several times — the decision not to consider Garland's nomination was because the Senate was held by a different party than the president leading into an election. His answer Tuesday is consistent with that claim. Since Trump became president, the Senate has confirmed two justices to the Supreme Court — Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 — both of whom are considered conservative. Republicans were able to confirm the two nominees after they triggered the nuclear option in 2017, lowering the vote threshold so that a Supreme Court pick could be confirmed by the Senate with a simple majority rather than the previous 60-vote threshold. There are several justices on the Supreme Court who have served for several decades. Justice Stephen Breyer is 80 and has served since 1994. Justice Clarence Thomas is 70 and has served since 1991, the longest-serving justice currently on the court. And Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, has served since 1993 and has suffered a series of health-related issues, including recent surgery for lung cancer. She returned to the court in February.

May 29, 2019 04:09 Breaking News Emails May 29, 2019, 5:48 AM UTC By Vaughn Hillyard SPARTANBURG, South — Kamala Harris railed on Tuesday night against President Donald Trump’s derogatory tweets about former Vice President Joe Biden over the weekend, calling them “contrary to the best interests of our country and the integrity of our country.” At an MSNBC town hall, Harris said the tweets, including one in which Trump referenced smiling when North Korea’s Kim Jong Un “called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse,"" were more examples of “why he should not be president of the United States.” “The idea that this president on foreign soil attacked the previous vice president of the United States —I don't care what the differences on policy issues,” Harris said from the Wofford College stage. “I don't care what the differences in terms of party affiliation. It is wrong.” Kamala Harris on Trump's immigration policies May 29, 2019 02:41 The California senator also rolled out her latest policy proposal, a plan to press for federal legislation that would require state and local governments with a history of having violated abortion rights under Roe v.

Related Politics Sanders: Trump and Kim Jong Un agree on assessment of Biden Harris also criticized Trump’s enduring trade hostilities with China, labeling the cost burdens on Americans as “Trump trade tax.” “We are all paying a price for the policies, which have resulted in the Trump trade tax,” she said. “We are paying more for washing machines and shampoos. We are paying more in terms of our farmers having to eat the cost of having soybeans that they have been growing, rotting in bins.

Ferry strikes whale near Seattle,www.nbcnews.com,Phil Helsel,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ferry-strikes-whale-near-seattle-n1011211,"A Seattle-area ferry struck a whale Tuesday evening, a spokeswoman for Washington State Ferries said. The animal was hit about 8:15 p.m., minutes after the ferry left Seattle for Bainbridge Island, west of the city, said spokesperson Dana Warr, who was not sure what kind of whale was hit.
The ferry was traveling about 17 mph when it struck the whale just after the animal had surfaced about five feet in front of the ferry’s bow.
""There had been no previous reports of whales spotted in Elliott Bay earlier today,"" Warr said in a statement, adding that the Coast Guard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and marine mammal agencies were notified.
Several passengers aboard the Wenatchee ferry said they saw a bleeding whale from the passenger deck, NBC affiliate KING of Seattle reported , and one witness told the station it was likely a gray whale.
""The whale surfaced after being struck and gushing a lot of blood,"" Beth Andrus of Seattle told The Seattle Times newspaper . ""It surfaced a few more times before sinking.”
The animal's condition was not known, and boats were seen looking for the whale, KING reported. No injuries to anyone on the ferry were reported.
The Coast Guard investigated with a response boat, and a helicopter was also sent out to look for a whale, which had not been located late Tuesday night, Coast Guard Petty Officer Trevor Lilburn said.
""We are aware of the reports that a Washington State Ferry hit a whale in Elliott Bay tonight. We have asked the U.S. Coast Guard to assist in locating the whale that may have been struck and are standing by for further information,"" a NOAA spokesperson said in a statement to KING.
Gray whales can grow up to about 49 feet long and approximately 90,000 pounds, NOAA says.
NOAA says on its website that gray whales, found mainly in shallow coastal waters in the North Pacific Ocean, are known for their curiosity toward boats and face threats from vessel strikes, especially because they feed and migrate along the U.S. west coast.
The whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal with a round trip of around 10,000 miles, according to the agency.

Lawn mower accidents are maiming children. A simple fix might have reduced the damage.,www.nbcnews.com,"Eli Wolfe, FairWarning",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawn-mower-accidents-are-maiming-children-simple-fix-might-have-n1010761,"U.S. news Lawn mower accidents are maiming children. A simple fix might have reduced the damage. Although human error is an obvious factor, another is a choice by some mower manufacturers to design their machines so they can mow in reverse. There were about 65 lawn mower backover injuries per year from 1990 to 2014, a study estimated. Seventy percent of the victims were under the age of 5. Robin Muccari / NBC News Breaking News Emails May 29, 2019, 7:05 AM UTC By Eli Wolfe, FairWarning This story was produced by FairWarning , a nonprofit news organization based in Southern California that focuses on public health, consumer and environmental issues. Jeremy Westfall was cutting the grass last month at his home in Mineralwells, West Virginia, when he decided to put his Massey Ferguson lawn tractor in reverse. He didn’t see his 6-year-old daughter Michaela walking up behind him, and backed over her. When emergency personnel arrived, a sheriff's report said, they found that the child’s toes had been cut off, and that a piece of her foot was under the mower. FairWarning has identified 133 cases of young children being injured by backovers of riding mowers since 2004, based on court records, news reports and interviews. Eight of the children died, and others suffered amputations of fingers, toes, hands, feet and limbs, as well as mangled internal organs. ''That's an extremely alarming number,"" said Elliot Kaye, of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, one of the five commissioners who set policies and rules. FairWarning's list of injuries is almost certainly an undercount. A study published in 2017 in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine estimated there were 1,641 backover injuries in the United States from 1990 to 2014 — roughly 65 per year. Seventy percent of the victims were under the age of 5. Although human error is an obvious factor, another is a conscious choice by some mower manufacturers to design their machines so they can mow in reverse, despite mounting evidence that this jeopardizes small children, an investigation by FairWarning has found. In 2003, in response to the rising toll of these accidents, the mower industry adopted a voluntary standard for riding mowers. It requires the blades to stop spinning when the mower moves in reverse, but permits manufacturers to include buttons or switches to override this safety feature. Many manufacturers have done so, and the accidents have continued. The Consumer Product Safety Commission implemented a mandatory safety standard for walk-behind power mowers in the early 1980s, but excluded riding mowers from the rule. Kaye said the issue of backover injuries has not been on the commission’s radar since he joined it in 2010. ""The agency should take a hard look at it and take some action, if necessary,” he said. But there are no immediate plans to do so. The issue of backover injuries is not mentioned in the commission’s operating plan listing priorities for 2019. In a statement, the agency’s acting chairman, Ann Marie Buerkle, urged consumers who use riding lawn mowers “to protect their kids by always keeping them out of the mowing area ... When it is absolutely necessary to operate the mower in reverse, always look behind you, as well as on the ground before and while backing up.” FairWarning reached out to the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute , a trade group, and several manufacturers, including Husqvarna, Ariens and Ryobi, but none agreed to interviews. Massey Ferguson did not respond to a request for comment on the Mineralwells accident. Adding to the trauma In almost every case, the operator of the mower is a parent or close family member, compounding the trauma of the accident. “That night when we were in the hospital … I couldn’t sleep because when I closed my eyes, all I could see was his eyes looking into my eyes,” Ryan Manahl, of Cedar Falls, Iowa, said in an interview, describing the day he backed over his 3-year-old son, Tate. Since the August 2017 accident, Tate has endured more than 30 surgeries to repair severe injuries to his legs and internal organs. Tate Manahl Courtesy Ryan Manahl Christina Kennedy said that since the death of her 8-year-old brother in a backover accident in 2010, her parents “struggle every day just to function.” Adding to the family’s misery were the cruel comments posted online about Shane’s death. “I saw many sites that I wished I hadn’t, speaking horribly about the accident,” she said in an email. “Some of the people didn’t go as far as blaming my father for not paying attention, but it’s easy to say those things if you weren’t there.” Isabelle Norton was 2 when her leg was amputated in a backover accident at her home in Springfield, Oregon, in 2006. As her father, Kirk Norton, was backing up the mower, he saw his nephew waving frantically. By the time he realized what had happened, it was too late, court records show . Isabelle Norton Family photo via court record The mower’s blades, spinning at 190 mph, did terrible damage to Isabelle’s tiny body. A sheriff’s deputy who responded to the accident said there were “too many pieces of flesh and bone” scattered across the yard to describe in his report . He found Isabelle’s left foot near the mower and, 20 feet away, three of her toes. The accident happened in 2006, but lawyers for the child are still locked in a marathon legal battle with mower manufacturer Deere & Co, the giant producer of construction, farm and garden equipment. Last year, a jury found that the mower was defectively designed and awarded Isabelle $12.25 million , holding Deere 78 percent responsible for the damages. The jury put the rest of the blame on her father, who is serving a 17-year sentence in state prison after being convicted in 2011 of sexual abuse and sodomy in an unrelated case. Deere denied liability and has appealed the jury’s decision in the mower case, which could add several years to the litigation. Kirk Norton has also appealed. Both Deere officials and Kirk Norton’s lawyer did not respond to interview requests. ''Someone backs over somebody and is not taking any responsibility for that.'' During the March 2018 trial, lawyers for Deere defended the mower’s design. It was ''well engineered, well designed, and well built,'' and Isabelle's father was to blame for her injuries, a Deere lawyer said in court . ''Someone backs over somebody and is not taking any responsibility for that.'' But Isabelle’s lawyer, Don Corson, argued that Deere — whose iconic green-yellow mowers and tractors are found in millions of garages and yards — was ignoring a product defect that continues to kill and maim children. “The manufacturer in this case knew about these problems for decades,” Corson said, according to a court transcript . “They knew there was a large number of serious lawn mower backover injuries, and they knew that they were particularly happening to young children, and they knew about the human limitations when backing up.” Corson cited internal memos from Deere that showed how the company experimented with backover safety systems in the 1980s and the early 2000s . The company introduced the ''no mow in reverse'' design, which allowed users the option of overriding the safety feature, in the late 1990s. That design became the industry standard several years later. Nathan Hemming, a product safety engineer at Deere, acknowledged in testimony at the trial that the company never evaluated whether the system reduced accidents. “The manufacturer in this case knew about these problems for decades."" Isabelle, now 15, has been left with chronic health problems in addition to the loss of her left leg, according to court records. “This kid goes to bed in pain every night,” Sandra McCoy, Isabelle’s aunt, said in testimony at the 2018 trial . “Sometimes she wakes up in the middle of the night and you can hear her crutches going through the house to the microwave to heat up her rice pack. She doesn’t like to wake people up to tell them that she’s in pain.” Citing the pending appeal, Corson declined to make Isabelle or her family available for comment. A concession to consumers — or failing to protect them? According to representatives of lawn mower companies, the override that allows for mowing in reverse is a concession to consumers who want flexibility when they mow. But family members of injured children and safety advocates say the override results in manufacturers having it both ways as they try to shield themselves from lawsuits — slapping warnings in their operator manuals and on their websites to not mow in reverse, but enabling operators to do it. Even with the override, critics say, manufacturers could reduce the risk by placing the button behind operators so they would have to look behind to engage it, allowing them to see if there’s a child nearby. The study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine identified this as a serious flaw. “Operators are able to reengage the mower blades while traveling in reverse without ever looking behind them, which negates the safety purpose of the mechanism,” the study said, referring to the “no mow in reverse” design. Kaye, the Consumer Product Safety Commission commissioner, said it appears to be a case in which letting the ''industry police itself is failing to protect consumers.'' He added that “in almost every case” of companies claiming that an override feature ''is demanded by consumers and would otherwise make the product not usable or salable ... that turns out to be nonsense.” MTD Products — a major power equipment maker based in Valley City, Ohio — said in an email that the override feature doesn’t pose a threat to users. “Providing the operator a conscious choice to temporarily maintain power to the implement can help to improve utility and shorten mowing time, without compromising safety,” an MTD spokeswoman wrote. Deere has used similar language in arguing that accidents happen because of operator error, saying the operator makes a conscious decision to use an override every time he or she backs up. ""Blaming the user is a hell of a lot easier than spending the money to do it right.” “Industry has figured that blaming the user is a hell of a lot easier than spending the money to do it right,” said Sean Kane, president of the consulting firm Safety Research & Strategies Inc. “If there was a real desire by the industry to see this go away, it could have easily gone away.” In 1982, MTD introduced mowers that did not cut in reverse and had no override. For the next two decades, the company boasted , it didn’t have a single backover accident. Writing to a news organization in 2001, an MTD executive said that the company’s co-founder, Theo Moll, ""believed that protecting children was more important than the loss in sales due to customer resistance.” But evidently, MTD saw itself losing out to competitors who were installing overrides. In 2005 — once the voluntary standard was in effect — MTD began to do the same. An MTD spokeswoman said in an email that the company made the change to satisfy customers with “differing mowing demands.” She added that the company has seen ""no discernible increase'' in accidents since 2005, but noted that MTD ""does not know how many such accidents occur.” Adults who back over children are deeply conscious of their mistake. In interviews with FairWarning, parents spoke of the tremendous sense of guilt and personal responsibility. Wyatt Cruse Courtesy Jennifer Heim But families are also angry at the industry for failing to offer safer designs. “We can’t lock our kids in kennels while we mow the lawn,” Jennifer Heim said. In 2015, her son Wyatt, then 4, lost a toe and suffered serious leg injuries when his grandfather backed over him with a riding mower in East Dubuque, Illinois. Heim said she had warned Wyatt about lawn mower safety many times. But it’s difficult to communicate the risks of amputation to a child. “There has to be some kind of give and take from manufacturers,” she said. Crusading on the issue John Brooks, a building and safety inspector who lives in Orlando, Florida, has become a crusader on the issue. Brooks became aware of backover accidents when Ireland Nugent, 2, lost both her legs in a backover in Florida in 2013. Horrified, Brooks assumed the manufacturer would do something following a flurry of media attention, but nothing happened. Soon after, Brooks learned of three more mower accidents in Florida. John Brooks holding Ireland Nugent. Courtesy John Brooks “If a guy like me can see this is terrible, I’d hope a manufacturer would say the same thing to themselves and ask, ‘How can we reduce this?’” Brooks said. Brooks formed an online community of hundreds of families affected by lawn mower accidents. With a few other members he helps raise funds to pay their medical bills. Last year, he conducted an informal survey of his Facebook group for Isabelle Norton’s lawyer. Brooks has little faith that companies will take action, so he’s developing an aftermarket device designed to shut down mowers when children approach. “Some of the first people I want to give my device to are the people who were injured,” Brooks said. “I want their kids to feel like it’s impossible for that equipment to harm them again.” Richard Gill, an engineer who testified as a plaintiff's expert in Isabelle Norton’s case, noted that as far back as the 1960s, backovers were known to be a severe hazard — one that manufacturers had a moral obligation to address. “Here we are 50 some years later — nothing has changed,” Gill said.

The 45-year-old man in the southern city of Kitakyushu told police he used a stun gun on his two daughters, aged 17 and 13, and 11-year-old son ""when they didn't follow the rules,"" a police official told Reuters.
The boy suffered a minor burn on his arm and there were no visible injuries on the girls, the official added.
A series of high-profile child abuse cases in recent years has shaken Japan, including the death last year of a 5-year-old girl, Yua Funato, whose father beat and starved her in the name of discipline.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at the time her death was ""soul-crushing"" and he promised steps to prevent more deaths.
Legislators in the powerful lower house of parliament on Tuesday unanimously approved a plan to ban corporal punishment of children by their parents, paving the way for passage of a revised law during the current session.
More than 50 countries — mostly in Europe — have laws prohibiting corporal punishment of children in the home.
Japan would be the third country in Asia to institute such a ban after Mongolia in 2016 and Nepal two years later.

John Bolton says Iran is seeking nuclear arms - msn.com,www.nbcnews.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/john-bolton-says-iran-seeking-nuclear-arms-n1011221,"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates — Donald Trump's national security adviser said Wednesday there was ""no reason"" for Iran to back out of its nuclear deal with world powers other than to seek atomic weapons, a year after the U.S. president unilaterally withdrew America from the accord. John Bolton, long a hawk on Iran, also claimed — without offering evidence — that the alleged sabotage of four oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates came from naval mines placed ""almost certainly by Iran.""
White House national security adviser John Bolton takes questions a outside the White House on April 30, 2019. Joshua Roberts / Reuters file Speaking in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital, Bolton told journalists that there had been a previously unknown attempt to attack the Saudi oil port of Yanbu as well.
Saudi officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Bolton's claim on Yanbu, which is the terminus, or end point, of the kingdom's East-West Pipeline. That pipeline was attacked in recent days in a coordinated drone assault launched by Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.
Iran has denied any involvement in the sabotage of the oil tankers.
Related News News Ship sabotage mystery raises fears of accidental conflict with Iran In recent weeks, tensions have soared as the U.S. beefed up its military presence in the Persian Gulf in response to a still-unexplained threat from Iran.
The U.S. also has accused Iran of being behind a string of incidents, including the alleged sabotage of oil tankers near the UAE coast and a rocket that landed near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, while Yemen's Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels have launched a string of drone attacks targeting Saudi Arabia.
Iran, meanwhile, has announced it was backing away from the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limits its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the accord as he believes it didn't go far enough in limiting the Iranian nuclear program, nor did it address Iran's ballistic missile program.
Bolton said that without more nuclear power plants, it made no sense for Iran to stockpile more low-enriched uranium as it now plans to do. But the U.S. also earlier cut off Iran's ability to sell its uranium to Russia in exchange for unprocessed yellow-cake uranium.
Iran has set a July 7 deadline for Europe to offer better terms to the unraveling nuclear deal, otherwise it will resume enrichment closer to weapons level. Bolton declined to say what the U.S. would do in response to that.
""There's no reason for them to do (higher enrichment) unless it is to reduce the breakout time to nuclear weapons,"" Bolton said.
Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. However, Western powers pushed for the nuclear deal to limit Iran's ability to seek atomic weapons."

Or a macaroni and cheese pale ale? Those were among the flavors at the Strange Brew Festival in Reno, Nevada, this month, where competition for attention has intensified as craft beers have boomed.
Brewers have always experimented, from the medieval Belgians who stirred sour cherries into their beer to newer varieties like the white IPA, a marriage of Belgian and American styles that was developed about a decade ago.
But today's brewers have kicked it up a notch as they try to distinguish themselves from everyone else trying to distinguish themselves.
Visitors at the festival in Reno could sample a peanut butter and pickle pilsner, a tamale lager and a smoked carrot stout. There were concoctions from big brewers like Sierra Nevada and smaller local brew pubs, sweet beers brewed with Jolly Ranchers and spicy ones that tasted like garlic bread or mango salsa.
The U.S. had 7,346 craft brewers last year, up 93 percent from 2014, according to the Brewers Association, an industry trade group. Craft beer sales rose 7 percent to $27.6 billion last year, about one-fourth of the total U.S. beer market.
""If someone wants to explore bizarre components, then I think they should do it under the umbrella of alternative beverages and not be allowed to sully the good name of beer.""
""People are looking for ways to differentiate themselves and be the next big thing,"" said Jon Brandt, a beer aficionado who works for Washington-based distributor Madidus Importers. ""A lot of it is just about trying to get noticed.""
A beer with head-turning labels or ingredients can do just that. Denver-based Wynkoop Brewing Co. lures a lot of customers with its Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, which is made with roasted barley, seven different grains and grilled buffalo or bull testicles.
""It actually started as an April Fool's joke,"" said John Sims, Wynkoop's head brewer. ""It's pretty popular.""
Wynkoop has traditional ales and lagers on the menu, too. Sometimes, Brandt said, a wacky beer is a way to get people to look at the rest of a brewer's lineup.
""I'm making a beer for you to notice me, but I really want to sell you my IPA,"" he said. Among the oddest beers he has tasted is a Bloody Mary brew from Michigan's Short's Brewing Co. He liked it, but other tasters thought it went too far.

Bamforth said laws restricting ingredients — like Germany has — might be going a bit too far. But he would like to see some regulations defining what can and can't be called ""beer.""

Huawei asks court to deem U.S. security law unconstitutional,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/huawei-asks-court-deem-u-s-security-law-unconstitutional-n1011231,"SHENZHEN, China — Fighting to maintain its access to major markets for next-generation communications, Chinese tech giant Huawei is challenging the constitutionality of a U.S. law that limits its sales of telecom equipment. Huawei's chief legal officer Song Liuping said at a press briefing Wednesday that Huawei filed a motion for summary judgment asking the court in Plano, Texas, to rule on whether a U.S. military spending provision that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment is constitutional.
Huawei is the biggest global maker of network equipment and enjoys a lead in 5G, or fifth-generation, technology. It also is the No. 2 maker of smartphones. The Trump administration claims the company could use its equipment to spy on behalf of the Chinese government and is thus a threat to international cybersecurity.
Related Tech Tech Here's how Trump's latest executive order could affect Huawei ""This decision threatens to harm our customers in over 170 countries, including more than 3 billion customers who use Huawei products and services around the world,"" Song said.
Huawei, whose U.S. headquarters is in Plano, launched a lawsuit in March against the U.S. national defense law , calling the provision a ""bill of attainder"" that selectively punishes Huawei and violates its due process by presuming its guilt without a fair trial. The summary judgment motion seeks to accelerate the legal process to give U.S. customers access to Huawei equipment sooner, according to a Wednesday statement from Huawei.
Song said the ""state-sanctioned campaign"" against the company will not improve cybersecurity.
""Politicians in the U.S. are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company,"" he said. ""This is not normal.""
Apart from the defense law provision, the U.S. Commerce Department recently placed Huawei on its ""Entity List,"" effectively barring U.S. firms from selling their technology to it and other Chinese firms without government approval. Huawei relies heavily on U.S. components, including computer chips, and about one-third of its suppliers are American.
The moves against Huawei are part of a broader trade war between the world's two largest economies that has both sides imposing billions of dollars of punitive tariffs against each other's products.
Related U.S. news U.S. news Rural Americans could lose cell service because of Trump's ban on Huawei The dispute centers on China's huge longstanding trade surplus with the U.S. and complaints that Beijing and Chinese companies use unfair tactics to acquire advanced foreign technologies.
The most recent round of negotiations between Beijing and Washington ended earlier this month without an agreement after Trump more than doubled duties on $200 billion in Chinese imports. China responded by raising tariffs of 5 percent to 25 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
The moves against Huawei have already affected the company's U.S. partnerships.

Jared Kushner aims to build support for 'deal of the century' with Mideast trip,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/jared-kushner-aims-build-support-deal-century-mideast-trip-n1011281,"LONDON — Jared Kushner is traveling in the Middle East this week to drum up support for President Donald Trump's long-awaited Israel-Palestinian peace plan. But the trip by Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, takes place as the U.S prepares to unveil the economic portion of what the administration has called the “deal of the century” at a conference in Bahrain next month, and it could not come at a worse time.
Related World news World news Trump's 'deal of the century' can't escape America's past Mideast failures Not only does Kushner’s team face near-unanimous Palestinian condemnation, but he's looking at an uphill battle in winning widespread support across the Middle East.
And if that weren’t enough, Kushner is flying straight into an unprecedented impasse in Israeli politics that will undoubtedly distract from sealing a deal.
'A completely insane position' After a short stop in Jordan on Wednesday, Kushner is set to visit Israel on Thursday — but whom will he be speaking to? The Parliament was dissolved and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a coalition government, a task that looked increasingly difficult since one of his most prominent potential coalition partners broke with him .
Israel will hold its second election of the year in September.
The dissolution of the Knesset could stop attempts by Netanyahu’s Likud party to grant him immunity from prosecution.
Netanyahu hasn't yet been indicted but Israel's attorney general announced in February that he plans to do so in the wake of a two-year corruption investigation. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing.
Israel's attorney general announces plans to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Feb. 28, 2019 01:01 The situation leaves Israeli politicians with little bandwidth to engage, as well as diminished authority.
On Monday, Trump tweeted his support for Netanyahu, who is perhaps the president's closest ally on the international stage.
No way, Palestinians say Little is known about the deal that Kushner and envoy Jason Greenblatt have been working on for more than two years, but their public statements indicate the plan relies heavily on economic solutions, and not political ones.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Majdi Mohammed / Reuters file The Palestinians have repeatedly spelled out they aren't even coming into the shop to see what Kushner is selling.
""The 'deal of the century' or the deal of shame will go to hell, with God's will, and the economic project they are working on next month will go to hell, too,"" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said this week. ""Whoever wants to solve the Palestinian issue must start with the political issue, not by selling the illusions of billions"" of dollars.
The borders of a Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the future of Palestinian refugees and Israeli security demands are all longstanding priorities for Palestinian leaders.
While a two-state solution is broadly supported by the international community, recent comments by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have thrown into question U.S. support for the concept .
To make matters worse, the Palestinians aren’t even on speaking terms with Washington after their leadership cut ties in response to Trump's decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem in 2017.
Related News News Netanyahu's re-election crushes Palestinian dreams of own state The Trump administration has also halted funding for UNRWA, the United Nations agency that has supported Palestinian refugees for seven decades, and other projects — deepening the hardship and desperation of millions of Palestinians in the blockaded Gaza Strip , and occupied east Jerusalem and the West Bank.
“We can build our own country,” said Sam Bahour, a Palestinian-American business consultant based in Ramallah in the West Bank. “The only thing that is stopping us from doing that is getting the Israelis to remove this occupation so we have a chance to build our economy.”
Despite dire financial straits faced by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, many experts agree that prioritizing economic development without a political framework that addresses basic Palestinian demands for human and other rights and an independent state will not work.
Palestinian demonstrators hurl rocks at Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip on May 15. Said Khatib / AFP - Getty Images file ""It seems as though the administration will turn around after this workshop [in Bahrain] and say it failed because the Palestinians did not come to the table,” Bahour said. “But there is no table there, the U.S. administration took the table away when they took Jerusalem off the table, and they tried to take the refugee issue off the table.”
Gulf monarchies warm, Arab public cool Kushner has succeeded in bringing an unprecedented amount of Arab support for the idea of a deal. That next month's conference is being held in an Arab country — Bahrain — is significant in itself given than not a single Gulf monarchy has official diplomatic relations with Israel. However, Israel's neighbors Egypt and Jordan have not confirmed they will attend, and China and Russia are skipping the event.
But Anwar Gargash, the minister of state for foreign affairs in the United Arab Emirates, recently told journalists that ""dialogue with Israel is a positive thing.""
And the editor-in-chief of the Arab News — a Saudi newspaper with close ties to the country's ruling royal family — recently urged the Palestinians to give the Trump plan a chance.
What's the holdup on President Trump's Mideast peace plan? March 28, 2019 06:13 But support from Gulf monarchies only goes so far, and many countries in the region are in a serious bind, according to Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.
Heavily reliant on the U.S. for political and military support, countries like Jordan will find it difficult to say no to the invitation to Kushner's conference, Eyal said. But the Palestinian issue resonates deeply with the Arab public and it is tricky for leaders to embrace a plan that does not promise a Palestinian state.
""Relations between Arab monarchies and Israel are flourishing, but the reality is they are flourishing behind the scenes, under the table,"" Eyal said. ""There is a simple explanation for that ... in public policy terms and reputational terms, such contact with Israel will do nothing for the credibility of Arab governments. What does that tell us? It tells us in practical terms it would be difficult to get a deal which pacifies the Middle East without answering the Palestinian question.”

The winnowing of the 2020 Dem field will begin in 3 months,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/winnowing-2020-dem-field-will-begin-3-months-n1011311,"WASHINGTON — The Democrats’ presidential field is guaranteed to become smaller three months from now — at least when it comes to who qualifies to make the debate stage. The Democratic National Committee announced this morning that ABC-Univision is slated to host the third set of debates on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 (if enough candidates make the threshold to require two nights of debates).
But here’s the hitch: To qualify for the third round of debates, candidates must hit 2 percent in four qualifying polls released between June 28 and Aug. 28.
That’s up from the current polling threshold of 1 percent.
And they will need to raise money from 130,000 unique individual donors — up from 65,000.
To understand how that new polling requirement will winnow the field, only nine Democratic candidates have hit 2 percent or above in just one of the last three qualifying national polls ( Fox , Quinnipiac , Monmouth ).
Those nine: Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Buttigieg, O’Rourke, Klobuchar, Booker and Castro.
That’s it.
And it’s quite likely the 130,000 donor threshold reduces that number even further.
Bottom line: This means performance at the first two sets of debates in June and July — where a total of 20 candidates get to participate — will really matter.
You snooze, you lose. You thrive, you survive.
In addition, this will force some candidates on the fence to spend early money — either nationally or in the early states — to boost their poll numbers.
One way to think about this winnowing: It used to be that the August straw poll in Ames, Iowa served as a way to reduce the size of the Republican presidential field.
But this coming August — before the September debate(s) — Democrats will have their own straw poll of sorts in whether or not they hit/surpass 2 percent.
On Justin Amash’s town hall last night Few Democrats have articulated beginning impeachment proceedings against President Trump as clearly as Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich.
In his first town hall since coming out in support of impeachment, Amash last night fielded nearly 30 questions from a mix of Democrats, Republicans, Amash supporters and Trump supporters, per NBC’s Alex Moe and Leigh Ann Caldwell.
And this might have been the highlight of the night, as CNN flagged :
“If you have a society where all we care about is that the other side is bad, and therefore we don't have to do the right thing, that society will break down, and you will have no liberty.""
2020 Vision: Biden says America is less divided today than in the 1970s At a fundraiser in Houston last night, Joe Biden said:
“America’s less divided today on issues than when I got to the Senate as a 29-year-old kid. Then we were divided on everything from war, to the women's movement, to civil rights, across the board.”
On the one hand, Biden’s right — when you think about the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, women’s rights.
On the other hand, that observation is about as relevant to our current politics as a Baby Boomer talking about the 1960s and 1970s: “Hey, America was more divided during the Civil War than today.”

“Are we going to go back to the days of back alley abortions? Women died before we had Roe v. Wade in place,” Harris said. “And so I'm going to tell you, on this issue, I'm kind of done.”
When asked by MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell how she would acquire the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to pass such a proposal, Harris said voters must turn their attention to Senate races, along with the presidency, in 2020.
“Everything that we need to do is going to require 60 votes in the United States Senate, which is why I would say to everybody: 2020 is about the White House, [but] it's also about the United States Senate,” she said.

A girl of just 11 in that world-changing summer of 1944, when the Allied liberation of western Europe began, Yvette Lethimonnier, recalls with vivid clarity how their saviors, a unit of Canadian troops, saluted when they found the refugees in their cavernous hiding place. Even the most elderly clambered to their feet, roused by the thrill of sudden freedom. All their voices joined in belting out the rousing words of the French anthem: ""Arise children of the fatherland, the day of glory has arrived!""
""It was such a deliverance, infinite happiness,"" the now 86-year-old Lethimonnier remembers. ""In fact, every time I hear 'La Marseillaise,' it has an indescribable effect on me. Because I see my father again, in the quarry, singing it.""
Without the huge underground stone quarries that sheltered thousands of people in and around the city of Caen, a major objective of the Allied force that landed on beaches to the north on June 6, 1944, the civilian toll of roughly 20,000 French dead in the battle for Normandy might have been steeper still.
Yvette Lethimonnier, 86, recounts how she and her family survived after D-Day in a Fleury-sur-Orne quarry, near Caen, Normandy. John Leicester / AP When World War II veterans gather with leaders of still-grateful Allied nations in Normandy for the 75th anniversary of D-Day to remember the feats and sacrifices, there'll also be lower-key ceremonies to honor civilian casualties. Even now, the work of understanding how civilians in Normandy suffered through and survived their liberation continues. Archaeologists using laser scanners are mapping the quarry where Lethimonnier and other families found refuge in the outskirts of Caen, shedding new light on an under-explored aspect of D-Day history dominated by Allied military exploits.
The cavern, inaccessible to the public but visited by an Associated Press team, is one of the best-preserved makeshift bomb-shelters in Caen, a 1944 time-capsule filled with traces of the civilians who hid there and their ordeals. There are abandoned shoes, a doll's head, broken plates, a rusty key, cutlery, a rosary, and other personal objects that spark the imagination. Abandoned vials show where a first-aid station used to be. The long-rotten remains of straw beds amid the puddles and gooey mud eloquently speak of the extreme discomfort the refugees endured.
""We slept as we could,"" Lethimonnier recalls. ""There were lice, bedbugs, fleas, cockroaches.""
The extreme precision of laser mapping is allowing programmers to computer-generate 3-D visualizations of the underground space and its abandoned objects, preserving the history. When posted online, possibly next year, the 3-D modeling will allow viewers to virtually tour the cavern and get a taste of the refugees' rat-like existence.
""It will enable the public to understand what happened in the quarry, to visit it without actually going down,"" says Laurent Dujardin, a Caen historian who has documented the quarries' wartime role and is working with the archeological teams. ""The aim is to make what happened here understandable.""
To dislodge Adolf Hitler's forces from towns and villages of northern France where they'd had four years to build defenses and dig in, the Allies sometimes had to destroy them, dropping tens of thousands of tons of bombs, firing salvos from warships at sea, and unleashing hundreds of thousands of ground troops who battled their way inland from the landing beaches.
St.-Lo, to name just one martyred Normandy town, was all but destroyed and later unflatteringly named ""The Capital of the Ruins"" by playwright Samuel Beckett. Allied leaflets dropped before raids urged people to: ""Leave now! You don't have a minute to lose.""
Caen was heavily bombed and shelled and some 2,000 of its inhabitants were killed. D-Day planners expected Allied troops to quickly take the strategic city but German resistance was so furious that its liberation instead took six weeks. A saving grace for Caen were the quarries from which its famous creamy limestone had been extracted for centuries, for churches and castles and faraway monuments such as the Tower of London and Cologne Cathedral. Roughly one-third of the 60,000 inhabitants took refuge in the caverns, the biggest sheltering thousands of people.
During breaks in the fighting, refugees scavenged outside for food. Lethimonnier says her father sliced meat for stew off the carcasses of farm animals that had been killed. She would sneak out, too, clambering up a narrow shaft from the quarry to see the destruction for herself. On one such escapade, chasing a rumor that spread among kids in her cave that soldiers outside were distributing chocolate, she was injured in the left leg by shrapnel from a shell-burst.
""The smells were horrific. There was a smell of burning. You could see a foot, an arm or a body in the ruins,"" Lethimonnier recalls. ""The smoke lingered for I don't know how long.""
The inevitable vanishing of witnesses from World War II makes the work of preserving the history only more urgent, a race against time. To help archeologists better understand how refugees organized themselves, with latrines in one corner, a makeshift kitchen by the quarry entrance, and families marking out spaces in the dirt, Lethimonnier agreed to go back into the dark, lowered into the quarry on a rope down the same narrow shaft she'd scaled as a girl.
She says returning to the cave was cathartic. A picture of innocence when she went down the hole on the morning of D-Day, muddying the white dress she was wearing to mark her first communion two days earlier, Lethimonnier was a changed kid when her family finally emerged after nearly two months, with the Allies then heading for Paris and beyond. Their house was ruined, leaky with blast holes. She remembers her father taking the boots off a German officer's corpse, because he'd lost his own shoes.
Lethimonnier says she has come to understand that destruction couldn't be avoided.
""They did what was necessary for us to get back our freedom,"" she says. ""It was difficult. But the simplest thing is to say, 'Thank you.'"""
Trump urges Roy Moore not to run for Senate again despite having 'nothing against' him,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-urges-roy-moore-not-run-senate-again-despite-having-n1011296,"President Donald Trump made clear Wednesday morning he does not want Roy Moore, a former Alabama state Supreme Court chief justice, to make another Senate run. ""Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn’t, and probably won’t.""
""If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our Pro-Life victories,"" Trump continued. ""Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating. ... Judges and Supreme Court Justices!""
Trump's tweet followed Moore's comments Tuesday hinting that he might make another run for Senate.
“He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones,” Moore tweeted after Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala,, warned voters against backing Moore as the Republican nominee to take on Jones, a Democrat who beat Moore in 2017. Byrne is running in the GOP primary to challenge Jones.
Moore told The Associated Press that he Trump's comments will not influence whether he runs in 2020, adding that he will make an announcement on that decision next month.
""I think the president is coming under pressure from people in Washington, scared that I will run for the Senate, scared I will win and know I can win,"" Moore, 72, said.
""Everybody knows I can win and that's what's worrying in Washington,"" he said.
Moore lost to Jones in a special election to fill then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' seat after multiple women accused Moore of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. He denied the allegations.
While other Republicans distanced themselves from Moore after those women came forward, Trump stood by Moore in light of the allegations.
Following Trump's tweet, Moore tweeted : ""Ever wonder why the mere mention of my name scares the 'hell' out of the Washington DC establishment, liberals, and LGBT? Like Pres Trump I want to see America great again, but that is a job only God can do!""
On Tuesday, Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., responded to Moore's comment signaling a possible bid for the seat, blasting the former judge for contemplating a run.
""You’re literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,"" Trump Jr. tweeted , adding, ""If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it's time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.""
Speaking with NBC News , Perry Hooper Jr., a Republican fundraiser and former state representative, said the president seemed interested in Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University head football coach, in the GOP primary. Hooper said Trump asked him specifically about Tuberville during a meeting at the White House this month.
Alabama's Republican Senate primary takes place next March.

Soccer fans stay away as debate over Arsenal's Mkhitaryan clouds Europa League final in Azerbaijan,www.nbcnews.com,Alexander Smith,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/fans-stay-away-debate-over-arsenal-s-mkhitaryan-shrouds-europa-n1011261,"LONDON — When Arsenal faces Chelsea in a major European soccer final Wednesday, the club will be missing one of its star midfielders. But Henrikh Mkhitaryan is not injured, suspended, or out of favor with his coach.
He will miss one of the games of his life because of an obscure, Soviet-era conflict that's been simmering for decades on the fringes of Europe and Asia.
Wednesday's game is not being held in London, where the two rivals are separated by a short 45-minute hop on the subway. Instead, it will take place some 2,500 miles away in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
Hosting the showpiece Europa League final was meant to be a public relations coup for the country.
Instead it has become something of a publicity nightmare for both Azerbaijan and the sport's governing bodies, which picked it as the venue for this year's game.
The country has an ""appalling"" human rights record, according to Human Rights Watch , and has proved maddeningly inaccessible for many fans traveling from western and central Europe.
For Arsenal's Mkhitaryan, it presented an even more acute problem.
Mkhitaryan has scored six goals in 39 appearances for Arsenal this season. Hannah McKay / Reuters file He is from neighboring Armenia, which is locked in conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Under the Soviet Union, the region belonged to Azerbaijan, but 95 percent of its population are ethnic Armenians. At the twilight of the Cold War, Nagorno-Karabakh attempted to declare independence, sparking a conflict between the neighbors that left 30,000 people dead before a cease-fire in 1994.
Since then, Armenian forces have controlled the territory. Negotiations chaired by the United States, Russia and France have seen little progress, and border skirmishes still claim several lives each year.
Given the volatile atmosphere, Uefa, the sport's governing body in Europe, said it had ""sought and received assurances"" about Mkhitaryan's safety ""from the highest authorities in the country.""
The player was not convinced. He consulted his family and his club, and ultimately decided to stay home.
The neighbors have severed diplomatic ties, but Azerbaijani officials insist that Mkhitaryan would not only be welcomed, but that his safety would be given the utmost priority.
""He will be welcome in Baku, he will be safe in Baku, I offered him my personal guarantees up to the highest degree — whatever I can do, whatever I can provide — to make him change his mind,"" Tahir Taghizadeh, Azerbaijan's ambassador to the United Kingdom, told NBC News in a telephone interview Tuesday.
[...] It‘s the kind of game that doesn’t come along very often for us players and I must admit, it hurts me a lot to miss it.I will be cheering my teammates on! Let’s bring it home @Arsenal 🏆💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼 #uel #final #arsenal #chelsea #AFC #COYG pic.twitter.com/gnDA6oyolw
— Henrikh Mkhitaryan (@HenrikhMkh) May 21, 2019 Azerbaijan has accused Armenia of using the soccer final for ""provocative purposes"" and attempting to ""turn sport into an instrument of politics."" The ambassador suggested he believes Mkhitaryan's decision was not born out of genuine safety concerns.
""If I tell you that I don't believe him and I think that there is politics at play, then I will be criticized for not trusting a player, not trusting the man's feelings,"" Taghizadeh added. ""If I tell you that I trust him, then I will be going against my own convictions and against my own position, against my beliefs that it is safe in Baku. ""
Azerbaijan points out that other Armenian athletes have competed in the country before, but none nearly so high profile as the Arsenal star. And even these minor athletes were subjected to boos and heckles from the crowd.
""We have a situation that is completely unacceptable,"" Arsenal’s managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, said. ""It is not our decision or Henrikh’s but one we made together.""
Mkhitaryan isn't the only one caught up in this dispute.
A number of British fans of Armenian heritage were initially denied a visa, and only granted one after Uefa intervened and contacted the Azerbaijani government, the sports governing body told NBC News in an email.
For many critics, it is unthinkable that such a high profile sporting event should be awarded to a country where the safety and attendance of players and fans is even open to question.
""This is a scandal. It is a deeply ugly side to the beautiful game,"" Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, said in the House of Commons last week.
Watson highlighted Uefa's slogan: ""Everyone should be able to enjoy football. No matter who you are, where you’re from or how you play.""
In reality, most supporters will skip the game altogether.
London to Baku is about the same distance as Los Angeles to New York, but on the week of the final there were only three direct flights, all of which sold out almost immediately.
When Uefa awarded the final to Baku in 2017, it admitted that its airport was so small it would have to compensate by reducing the number of tickets allocated to the finalists.
Each team was awarded about 6,000 tickets, despite the Baku Olympic stadium having a capacity of 68,000. Francois Nel / Getty Images Even so, both Arsenal and Chelsea said they have returned around half of these tickets unsold because demand is so low.
Many die-hard supporters are staying away because of what Chelsea called ""a complicated and challenging process.""
The few fans who are traveling were faced with grueling and expensive journeys.
""It's an awful place to put a European cup final. Baku isn't even geographically in Europe,"" said Keith Ly, 26, one of the Arsenal supporters making the trip.
His journey took 37 hours, flying from London to Prague, then onto the Ukraine capital of Kiev and finally Tbilisi, Georgia. From there, still some 300 miles from his destination, he took a 12-hour train to the Azerbaijani capital.
""It's been an incredibly long journey for just one game of football,"" said Ly, who works as a barrister in London. ""I'm just pleased my employer have given me the time off work.""
Keith Ly has finally arrived in Baku ahead of Wednesday's final. Keith Ly It's not just the flights.
In its own report on Baku's hosting bid, Uefa noted that the number of hotel rooms near the stadium ""falls short of Uefa's minimum requirements."" Some fans have reported price-gouging, and even hotels canceling their rooms and releasing them again at a higher rate.
Given the Mkhitaryan situation, coupled with the impractical location and questions over human rights, the event is seen by many as emblematic of a wider malaise within the sport.
These critics decry what they say is yet another example of the game’s authorities dismissing fans' and ethical concerns, and instead prioritizing global commercial appeal.
Many of the same allegations are directed at FIFA, soccer's international governing body, which awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar despite fears about the unsuitably hot climate, corruption and human rights.
Azerbaijan, around the size of South Carolina and with a population of around 10 million people, has no real footballing pedigree. It sits 108th in the FIFA world rankings behind Kenya and Madagascar.
The Maiden Tower in Baku. Maxim Shemetov / Reuters When the country's president, Ilham Aliyev, was re-elected last year with more than 86 percent of the vote, Human Rights Watch said the ballot ""lacked competition,"" ""took place in a restrictive political environment"" and curtailed ""fundamental rights and freedoms.""
Dozens of journalists and human-rights activists remain imprisoned in the country, the watchdog says.
For Uefa, the obscurity was part of the reason it awarded the final to Baku.
Its reasoning is that most high-profile games are in an elite group of countries, such as Saturday's Champions League final in Madrid, Spain. It says that other, less well-known countries should be exposed to these events.
""It is fair and due, not only to give other fans the possibility of a unique live experience, but also to stage events which can greatly boost the promotion of football in an entire region,"" Uefa said in a statement reacting to the criticism from the fans, teams and lawmakers.
""It will put us even more on the international map,"" Taghizadeh, the ambassador, said.
""Besides getting more and more fans, it's also in terms of spreading the geography of the game … to make it wider and to make the game more popular.""

Pokemon will track user's sleep in new app,www.nbcnews.com,"Ryan Browne, CNBC",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/pokemon-will-track-user-s-sleep-new-app-n1011316,"On the back of success with the major mobile hit “Pokemon Go,” The Pokemon Company has a new game app in the works: “Pokemon Sleep.” Details on the new smartphone-based title out of the company behind the “Pokemon” franchise are scant, but one thing is clear — this one’s all about tracking your sleep.
The aim is to turn sleep into a form of entertainment, the company says. It will collect data on how long a player sleeps and what time they wake up to impact gameplay.
“After walking, we decided to focus on the act of sleeping,” The Pokemon Company’s CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said at a press conference Wednesday.
“Everyone spends a large part of their life sleeping, and turning that into entertainment is our next challenge at Pokemon.”
Exactly how that works is something of a mystery at this stage. The game is set to be released in 2020.
Also announced Wednesday was a sleep-tracking device from Nintendo called the Pokemon Go Plus +, which comes equipped with an accelerometer to track time slept and send the data to a user’s phone through Bluetooth.
The Pokemon Company said the gadget, which resembles a Pokeball, has the same functions as its predecessor. The original Pokemon Go Plus lets users catch creatures from the franchise without taking their phone out of their pocket.
The move could be interpreted as a combination of gaming with health and wellness. “Pokemon Go” was remembered for encouraging players to step outside of their home and walk about, instead of the sedentary approach seen in a lot of games consoles.
Based in Tokyo, The Pokemon Company was established in 1998 with joint investment from Nintendo, Game Freak and Creatures, which all hold copyright to the franchise.
Its augmented reality game “Pokemon Go,” made in partnership with San Francisco-based Niantic, became the top-grossing app on Apple’s U.S. App Store following its 2016 release.
Mobile gaming has grown rapidly, taking up almost half of all global games revenues — equivalent to $63.2 billion — according to industry research group Newzoo ."

""It’s overwhelming. It’s really surreal. When I walked up to the display, I was brought to tears of joy,” said Edgardo Miranda-Rodríguez of his 2016 comic book creation, La Borinqueña .
The costume of the young female superhero, who gets her powers from the Taíno gods of her Puerto Rican ancestors, was added this month to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History’s Superheroes exhibition, which has a comic books section.
Comic book artist Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez in front of the Smithsonian's display of his creation. Jaclyn Nash / National Museum of American History La Borinqueña's costume, with the colors of the Puerto Rican flag, made its first appearance at the 2016 National Puerto Rican Day Parade.
Miranda-Rodríguez, a New York-based Puerto Rican artist, created La Borinqueña in 2016 and has since received widespread attention for creating Marisol, a New York City college student turned superhero who uses her powers to save the environment and her beloved island of Puerto Rico.
Miranda-Rodríguez’s character is the only superhero in the exhibit that was created and published independently and is not part of a large comic book imprint like Marvel.
La Borinqueña derives her name from Borinquen, the name given to the island by the Taíno indians, who lived there prior to Spanish colonization. It's also the title of the U.S. territory's anthem.
Related News News Move Over JLo, There's A Puerto Rican Superhero and She Can Fly Miranda-Rodríguez said that to have his three-year-old comic book hero sharing equal space with the likes of Superman as part of a museum exhibit is ""magical.""
“One of the things I want to do with my work is continue to keep Puerto Rico in the national discourse. The exhibition reminds all Americans that Puerto Rico is a part of the United States and there are three and a half million American citizens living on the island and another six and a half million across the States,"" Miranda-Rodríguez said.

In fact, the original lyrics of the island's La Borinqueña anthem were written by a woman, Lola Rodríguez de Tió.
The exhibit shows superhero items like Captain America's shield and Batman's mask. But when it comes to full costumes, it only displays two — those of Wonder Woman and La Borinqueña.
Artist Edgardo Miranda-Rodriguez and family in front of his creation at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History on May 7, 2019. Jonathan Rodriguez Melinda Machado, director of the Smithsonian’s Office of Communications and Marketing, said they chose to display these loaned costumes to showcase that superheroes are not limited by gender or diversity.
“The fact that both of these costumes were worn by Latinas (Wonder Woman’s Linda Carter is Mexican American) is fitting with the Smithsonian’s American Women’s History Initiative, #BecauseOfHerStory in which we are highlighting the many ways women play a role in our culture,” said Machado.
The exhibit, which runs through September, has been garnering positive reviews.
Flavio Cumpiano, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is a native of Puerto Rico, said he's happy that La Borinqueña is not only a Latina, but a Puerto Rican woman at a time when the island has gone through ""major crises and disasters.”
“Many kids, in fact people of all ages, will probably learn about Puerto Rico by asking about La Borinqueña, where she is from and who she represents,"" said Cumpiano. ""She becomes an instrument for education, empowerment and, of course, entertainment.”

“To have this exhibit in Washington, D.C., is a complete affirmation of the power that is emanating right now with Puerto Rican women such as (Supreme Court Justice) Sonia Sotomayor and the new generation with (New York congresswoman) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,"" he said.
“We don’t always have to make a political statement through a march or a protest, but also through the arts,"" Miranda-Rodríguez said. ""And having this character powerfully stand in her superhero pose along these American icons is indeed empowering and a powerful message.”

""The report is my testimony,"" Mueller said at the Justice Department in his first comments on the two-year probe of Russian election meddling and possible obstruction by President Donald Trump.
Mueller said of his 448-page report : ""We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.""
""I would not provide information beyond what is already public in any appearance before Congress,"" Mueller said.

""No one has told me whether I can or should testify,"" he said.

The special counsel made it clear that he felt constrained from the beginning of his probe by Justice Department rules that prohibit the indictment of a sitting president. The method for charging and removing a president, he said, lies outside the criminal justice system, referring to the Constitution's provisions for impeaching and convicting a president.
Under longstanding Department of Justice policy, Mueller said, ""a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office.""
""That is unconstitutional,"" Mueller said. ""Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""
Mueller, who also said he is resigning to return to private life, did not take questions from reporters after his roughly 10-minute statement. He said he was ""speaking out today because our investigation is complete.""
Mueller explained that while existing legal guidance ""explicitly permits"" investigating a sitting president, the guidance also says that accusing a president of committing a crime is governed by different rules.
""The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” he said.
That comment — an apparent nod to the appropriateness of Congress handling such matters — is likely to touch off continued calls from Democrats to initiate impeachment proceedings.
Mueller, however, added that his report was also guided by ""principles of fairness.""
""It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge,"" he said. ""That was Justice Department policy. Those were the principles under which we operated.""
""And from them, we concluded that we would, would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,"" Mueller said. ""That is the office's final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president.""
When it came to discussing Moscow's interference in the 2016 election, Mueller was emphatic that Russian figures had — through ""sophisticated cyber techniques"" like hacking computer networks and email accounts and posing as Americans on social media — ""launched a concerted attack on our political system.""
""There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American,"" Mueller said.
A senior White House official said that the White House was notified on Tuesday night that Mueller might make a statement, but did not know the content of what Mueller would say. The official added that the White House made no attempt to stop Mueller from speaking.
Moments after Mueller's statement, Trump tweeted that the ""case is closed.""
Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2019 Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would be charged with initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump, indicated that Congress is ready to act.
“Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump — and we will do so,” Nadler said in a statement released after Mueller's. “No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.""

Mueller has not made any comment on the investigation since he was named special counsel in May 2017. House Democrats are seeking to have him testify before Congress in the coming weeks. Last week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said Mueller was willing to testify but only in private.
Mueller's planned remarks come after a new book reportedly asserted that Mueller drew up a three-count indictment against President Donald Trump before deciding to abandon it. Mueller's office denied that assertion on Tuesday, and Mueller did not comment on it Wednesday.
In March, Mueller submitted to Attorney General William Barr his 400-plus page report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, whether the Trump campaign or Trump associates conspired with Russia in those efforts and if Trump sought to obstruct justice.
Days later, Barr released a four-page summary of Mueller's report which the special counsel said ""did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance"" of his investigation. Trump used the Barr summary to claim he was exonerated in the weeks that followed before, in mid-April, Barr released a lightly redacted version of Mueller's report.
In his report, Mueller extensively detailed Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, multiple contacts between the Trump campaign and associates with Russians, and Trump's efforts to quash the probe. Mueller wrote that the evidence he reviewed was not enough to establish a Trump-Russia conspiracy while, on obstruction, he said he could not come to a traditional prosecutorial decision.
""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,"" Mueller wrote , later adding that Trump's ""efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""

Michael John Wolfe, 52, is charged with two counts of aggravated murder, one count of aggravated murder with domestic violence and two counts of kidnapping, according to court documents.
His son, William ""Billy"" Fretwell, and the mother of the child, Karissa Alyn Fretwell, were reported missing May 17, according to the Salem Police Department. Although investigators have not found any bodies, they say there's probable cause to believe Wolfe killed them.

Authorities are continuing the search for the mother and son.
Fretwell verified through DNA testing last year that Wolfe was her son's father, and he had recently been ordered to pay $900 a month in child support, according to a probable cause affidavit. A babysitter told police that Wolfe and the woman he's married to had threatened to take custody of the child.

Read Mueller's full statement, as prepared for delivery.
Two years ago, the Acting Attorney General asked me to serve as Special Counsel, and he created the Special Counsel's Office.
The appointment order directed the office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This included investigating any links or Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.
I have not spoken publicly during our investigation. I am speaking today because our investigation is complete. The Attorney General has made the report on our investigation largely public. And we are formally closing the Special Counsel’s Office. As well, I am resigning from the Department of Justice and returning to private life.
I’ll make a few remarks about the results of our work. But beyond these few remarks, it is important that the office’s written work speak for itself.
Let me begin where the appointment order begins: and that is interference in the 2016 presidential election.
As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who were part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system.
'The report is my testimony:' Watch full statement by Robert Mueller May 29, 2019 09:21 The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information, and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks. The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate.
And at the same time, as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to interfere in the election.
These indictments contain allegations. And we are not commenting on the guilt or innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.
The indictments allege, and the other activities in our report describe, efforts to interfere in our political system. They needed to be investigated and understood. That is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office.
That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation. The matters we investigated were of paramount importance. It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.
Let me say a word about the report. The report has two parts addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate.
The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign’s response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.
And in the second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the President.
The order appointing me Special Counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation and we kept the office of the Acting Attorney General apprised of the progress of our work.
As set forth in our report, after that investigation, if we had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that.
We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the President did commit a crime. The introduction to volume two of our report explains that decision.
It explains that under long-standing Department policy, a President cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view—that too is prohibited.
The Special Counsel’s Office is part of the Department of Justice and, by regulation, it was bound by that Department policy. Charging the President with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.
The Department’s written opinion explaining the policy against charging a President makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation. Those points are summarized in our report. And I will describe two of them:
First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting President because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents are available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could now be charged.
And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting President of wrongdoing.
And beyond Department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge.
So that was the Justice Department policy and those were the principles under which we operated. From them we concluded that we would not reach a determination – one way or the other – about whether the President committed a crime. That is the office’s final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the President.
We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the Attorney General—as required by Department regulations.
The Attorney General then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and the American people.
At one point in time I requested that certain portions of the report be released. The Attorney General preferred to make the entire report public all at once. We appreciate that the Attorney General made the report largely public. I do not question the Attorney General’s good faith in that decision.
I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak about this matter. I am making that decision myself—no one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.
There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself.
The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.
In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.
So beyond what I have said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress.
It is for that reason that I will not take questions here today.
Before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the FBI agents, the analysts, and the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner. These individuals, who spent nearly two years with the Special Counsel’s Office, were of the highest integrity.
I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments—that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election.
That allegation deserves the attention of every American.
Thank you."

By Minyvonne Burke and Ali Gostanian A white KOA campground worker in Mississippi has been fired after a now-viral video showed her pulling a gun on a black couple at a lake. Jessica Richardson, who filmed the encounter and posted it on her Facebook page , wrote in her video’s caption that she and her husband, who is a military veteran, went along with their dog to a lake at Kampgrounds of America in Starkville to have a picnic on Sunday. Minutes after arriving, Richardson said, a woman pulled up in a truck and started screaming at them. “She then jumps out of her truck with a gun,” Richardson wrote on Facebook. “And proceeded to point it at the 3 of us, simply because we didn’t make reservations.” A KOA spokesperson confirmed the incident happened at the Starkville location. The woman who pulled the gun was an employee but has since been fired. “Kampgrounds of America does not condone the use of a firearm in any manner on our properties or those owned and operated by our franchisees,” the spokesperson said. “The employee involved in the incident has been relieved of her duties.” In the video, which had been viewed more than 7,000 times as of Wednesday morning, Richardson tells the woman that she and her husband did not know they needed to make a reservation to use the lake. “We didn’t know lady. All you had to do was tell us,” Richardson says in the video. “We would have left. You did not have to pull a gun.” The woman, who is seen holding the weapon in her hand before putting it in her pocket, tells Richardson and her husband to leave. The video ends as the couple, with their dog, walks away. After leaving, Richardson’s husband stopped by the campground’s office and was told that they did not need to make a reservation for the lake. The KOA spokesperson told NBC News that reservations are not required but guests have to register at the campground’s office.

"Midwife slapped with $4,836 bill for laughing gas during her labor",www.nbcnews.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/midwife-slapped-4-836-bill-laughing-gas-during-her-labor-n1011336,"Nurse-midwife Karli-Rae Kerrschneider wanted the same supportive birth experience she promises her own patients — and that included the use of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, to dull her discomfort. The delivery of the gas during labor has come back in vogue in the U.S. in the past few years as a less invasive alternative to an epidural administered by an anesthesiologist.
Senate to introduce bipartisan measure to stop surprise medical bills May 15, 2019 01:47 With a tank in the hospital room, a woman in labor can take breaths of the gas as she needs it.
“Nitrous doesn’t take away the pain so much as make you not care about it,” Kerrschneider said, noting its mild euphoric effect.
Kerrschneider had an epidural for the birth of her daughter in 2016 and didn’t like being immobilized and confined to her bed during labor. For the birth of her son last December, she opted for nitrous oxide at Hudson Hospital in Hudson, Wis.
The labor was long — 11 hours — but it went just as she’d hoped, with no complications and great care from a nurse-midwife and doula. Being able to take puffs of nitrous was empowering and “took the edge off” as she moved around and hung out in the bathtub during her contractions. She estimated she breathed in the nitrous 10 to 15 times an hour in active labor.
She and her husband, Christopher, welcomed their son, Leviathan, on Dec. 19.
“It was amazing,” she said. “I would do it all over again.”
Then the bill came.
Nitrous oxide is used as a noninvasive way to dull labor pain. Patients breathe into a mask to access the gas, which is a mix of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen, and its resulting euphoric effect. Kara Jo Prestrud / Birth Made Beautiful Patient: Karli-Rae Kerrschneider, 32, a certified nurse-midwife who lives with her husband and two children in Baldwin, Wis. She is insured through Medica, which her job at Western Wisconsin Health provides.
Total Bill: $11,890 for the hospital stay, including $4,836 for the nitrous oxide.
Service Providers: Hudson Hospital, a 25-bed critical access hospital in Hudson, Wis. It’s part of HealthPartners, a nonprofit regional health system and insurer based in Bloomington, Minn.
Medical Service: Kerrschneider had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery attended by a nurse-midwife and a doula. Her water delivery was followed by a two-day hospital stay for herself and her newborn. Her only pain relief during her labor was the analgesic gas, which is a mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen.
What Gives: As hospitals have adopted billing practices common in other businesses, more and more of their services are billed by the minute — for example, the time a patient spends lying in the recovery room after surgery, the time a cancer patient spends receiving a drug infusion or the time a patient is hooked up to heart monitoring.
Kerrschneider was charged for 39 units of nitrous oxide, or about $124 for every 15 minutes the tank was in her room after a nurse showed her how to use the gas — whether or not she was using it. After almost 10 hours, the charges amounted to $4,836.
“I think it’s ridiculous that they charged so much,” she said, pointing out that she didn’t even have IV pain relief. “I can buy my own machine for that.”
Related Health Health Surprise medical bills: Two babies, two very different price tags Kerrschneider even joked with her husband that for that amount of money she could have had the baby at home, bought her own nitrous oxide machine and rented it out to other people afterward. Well, she was close. A new nitrous oxide delivery machine retails for around $6,500 and tank refills cost less than $50, according to CareStream America, a company that sells the equipment.
Judith Rooks, a retired nurse-midwife and past president of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, helped popularize the use of nitrous oxide during childbirth. Rooks said that while she was appalled to hear of the hefty bill, she wasn’t too surprised.
“There is no transparency or standardization,” Rooks said, noting that charges can vary widely for nitrous oxide during labor.
Part of that problem comes down to the recent resurgence of the practice in the U.S. In 2011, two hospitals offered nitrous oxide for childbirth in the U.S. Now an estimated 1,000 hospitals and 300 birthing centers provide it, said Michelle Collins, a professor and director of nurse-midwifery at Vanderbilt University School of Nursing.
The use of nitrous oxide has long been common during childbirth in the United Kingdom and Canada, in part because of its low cost. Many people in the U.S. have learned about the practice while watching the popular British period drama “Call the Midwife,” set in the 1950s. Epidural anesthesia largely displaced nitrous oxide in the U.S. in the ’70s.
Typically (and safely) overseen by nurses, nitrous oxide is commonly billed at a flat fee — anywhere from $100 to $500 for access to the machine and gas. Sometimes hospitals charge for the mask, typically $25, Collins said. Laughing gas itself is very cheap — it costs about 50 cents an hour during labor, she said. Sometimes hospitals don’t charge anything for it at all.
But billing can change if nitrous oxide is administered or supervised by a physician or nurse anesthetist, which means the intervention can be assigned an anesthesia code.
Kerrschneider welcomed her son, Leviathan, without ever seeing an anesthesiologist. Kerrschneider says she ""wouldn't trade it for anything."" The nitrous oxide she opted for instead of an epidural cost $4,836. Ackerman + Gruber / for Kaiser Health News Kerrschneider was charged under this method, contributing to her higher bill. This raised red flags for Kerrschneider because an anesthesiologist wasn’t present during any part of her labor at the hospital, which led her to question her bill.
Hudson Hospital told Kaiser Health News in a statement that the anesthesia category is the one it uses to bill for that service, noting that “the billing category is broad and does not necessarily indicate that an anesthesiologist or a certified registered nurse anesthetist performed a service.” For comparison, though, Hudson Hospital charges, on average, only $1,495 for an epidural, according to its communications office. That’s less than a third the cost of the nitrous.
“I’ve seen these ridiculous bills for birth — I can’t believe anybody pays them,” Rooks said. “That’s completely out of step with any kind of actual cost, but so is pretty much any bill that comes through.”
Related Politics Politics Dem, GOP senators say they have a fix for surprise medical bills Resolution: When Kerrschneider saw she had been billed for anesthesia, she called the hospital repeatedly about the coding, wondering if the hospital had accidentally charged her for an epidural. She protested further when she discovered the high charge was simply for nitrous. She knew that the hospital where she works charges a flat fee of about $100 for the same thing.
Insurer Medica told Kaiser Health News it refused to pay the $4,836 Kerrschneider was charged for nitrous oxide costs, citing “provider responsibility.” That means Medica did not specifically judge the charge for nitrous to be too high, but that it had an agreed upon rate for childbirth with Hudson Hospital, and total charges can’t exceed that amount.
The hospital knocked the nitrous oxide charge down to the one-hour rate of $496 — still almost five times what her own hospital would charge.
Kerrschneider eventually gave up and accepted the reduced nitrous charge since she didn’t want to further antagonize people in the region where she also works as a nurse-midwife. Altogether for the care she and her son received for his birth, she was on the hook for deductibles and copayments that totaled of $3,635. She paid it.
“I was just tired of dealing with it,” she said. “I had a newborn I was breastfeeding, and I didn’t want to have it hanging over my head anymore.” Still, she was appalled that a birth with so few interventions could end up costing so much. “How many people have given birth at this hospital and have paid it in cash or whatever just because they didn’t know?” she asked.
The Takeaway: Nitrous oxide used during labor and delivery does not have a standardized charge or code, which is surprising considering there are medical charge codes for just about everything — including being pecked by a chicken or getting sucked into a jet engine .
Prices, and billing methods, for childbirth can vary widely among hospitals. Some hospitals may offer a price that includes items like an epidural, use of a birthing tub, breastfeeding education and nitrous, if desired and needed. Others will charge for each item — sometimes a lot and, sometimes, by the minute.
Related Health Health Surprise medical bills lead to liens on homes and crippling debt Kerrschneider said she didn’t think to ask about charges for nitrous oxide, considering her own hospital charged so little for the service.
Before you decide where to have your baby — before any elective hospitalization — ask for an all-inclusive estimate and a pricing breakdown, and be sure you understand how the hospital calculates its bills.
Once you’ve left the hospital, ask for an itemized bill and scrutinize it carefully. Kerrschneider was an informed medical professional who works in the labor and delivery field, which helped her realize she was being overcharged. But if, for example, you see a big charge for anesthesia when you never saw an anesthesiologist, ask questions, make a fuss. Only you can catch some types of unscrupulous billing: You were in the delivery room. Your insurer was not.

The company did not release a numeric threshold for when it will remove users from the platform.
“Respect is a two-way street, and so is accountability,” Uber said in a statement. “Drivers have long been expected to meet a minimum rating threshold which can vary city to city. While we expect only a small number of riders to ultimately be impacted by ratings-based deactivations, it’s the right thing to do.”
Safety risks for passengers are widely recognized thanks in part to a variety of reports about drivers assaulting riders . Uber's new policy reflects concerns about driver safety, which was underscored by video that recently surfaced of a Lyft driver being violently attacked by a passenger .
The Independent Drivers Guild, a union that represents 70,000 rideshare drivers in New York City, praised Uber's decision.
""Holding riders accountable for their behavior on the Uber platform is an important safety measure to protect drivers as well as fellow riders who may book shared rides,"" a spokesperson for the guild said. ""While most riders are respectful, banning riders who threaten driver safety, spew racist rants, and disrespect or damage our vehicles is the right thing to do.""
Uber’s decision is part of the company’s revised community guidelines that are rolling out in the United States and Canada.
The company said that riders who are at risk of losing their access to the app will have several opportunities to improve their score before any action is taken.
Uber said it will not be releasing a minimum rating level that keeps riders out of the danger zone, partly because the score will be dependent on the average passenger ratings in a person's city.
“Each city has its own minimum threshold which is directly related to the average rider rating in that city,” the company said in a statement.
“Ultimately, we expect this to impact only a very small number of riders who have been consistently rated poorly by drivers and, as a result, have a low rating,” the company said, adding that banned riders will also not be able to use the company’s Uber Eats feature.
The new policy comes after Uber’s $90 billion initial public offering was met with protests from some drivers who feel unfairly compensated and mistreated by the tech company.

These maps show how severe the Midwest weather is,www.nbcnews.com,Nigel Chiwaya,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/extreme-weather-midwest-2019-floods-tornadoes-n1011126,"From Ohio to Idaho, and Minnesota to Louisiana, extreme weather has hammered America's heartland for weeks. With swollen rivers threatening to spill over levees and dams, and damaging tornadoes ripping through homes, the storms have endangered millions of Americans. Here's a look at what plagues the region. When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned in March of major flooding in the Midwest , it noted that major rains could combine with heavy snow melts to put more than 200 million people at risk.
That’s exactly what has happened.
Heavy rainstorms have stalled over the region for more than a month , filling the Mississippi, Missouri, and Arkansas rivers to near-historic proportions. In St. Louis, waters reached 42 feet as of Tuesday, and the waters rose to 31 feet in Jefferson City, Missouri, the state capital, which was also hit recently by a tornado. Flood watches are in effect along virtually the entire lengths of the rivers .
The rains intensified over the holiday weekend, as severe thunderstorms triggered flash flood warnings in five states.
Late spring is peak tornado season, and the country has been battered. Tornadoes hit Kansas and touched down in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, and that evening, New Jersey and New York City residents were alerted to a rare tornado warning. Tuesday was the 13th straight day with at least one tornado , and the ninth day in a row of tornado outbreaks . More than a dozen tornadoes landed on Memorial Day, killing an 81-year-old man in Dayton, Ohio, and knocking out power to more than 60,000 homes .

"Nadler: Congress will need to 'respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing' by Trump",www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nadler-congress-will-need-respond-crimes-lies-other-wrongdoing-trump-n1011436,"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that ""nothing is off the table"" for Democrats investigating President Donald Trump, as the number of lawmakers in her party calling for impeachment surged in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller's remarks. Speaking at an event with the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco a few hours after Mueller delivered his first public statement about his two-year investigation, Pelosi said that Democrats had scored several legal victories last week that will help Democrats move toward advancing the facts.
""Where they will lead us, we shall see. Nothing is off the table,"" she said.
Pelosi, 'gravely disappointed' in Justice Dept., wants 'ironclad case' against Trump May 29, 2019 07:01 Last week, Pelosi held an emergency meeting with House Democrats behind closed doors to discuss Trump oversight efforts, as calls for an impeachment inquiry intensified among rank and file members — many of whom, the moderator pointed out Wednesday, are currently willing to go further than the speaker on that front. ""Many constituents want to impeach the president, but we want to do what is right and what gets results,"" responded Pelosi.
Pelosi reiterated that it took ""months and months"" of researching impeachment during the 1970s before the the House even considered pursuing that path, and noting that Democrats controlled the House and Senate at the time.
""We have a different scenario,"" she said. ""The case has to be very compelling to the American people.""
Her comments echoed those of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., following Mueller's remarks. ""With respect to [the] impeachment question, at this point, all options are on the table and nothing should be ruled out,"" Nadler said on Wednesday, when asked about his current stance on that process.
In an earlier statement following the special counsel's comments, Nadler said it now ""falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump,"" and that the Constitution “points to Congress to take action to hold the President accountable.”
Watch Rep. Nadler's response to Mueller's Statement on Russia probe May 29, 2019 05:08 “Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump — and we will do so. No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law,"" he added.
Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday that ""[d]espite Department of Justice policy to the contrary, no one is above the law – not even the President.""
""The Congress holds sacred its constitutional responsibility to investigate and hold the President accountable for his abuse of power,"" she added. “The Congress will continue to investigate and legislate to protect our elections and secure our democracy. The American people must have the truth.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Mueller’s statement ""also makes clear that Congress has a right—we believe an obligation—to continue our constitutionally mandated oversight without interference or stonewalling and follow the facts wherever they may lead.”
Schumer did not mention impeachment. Nadler, who did not mention impeachment in his initial statement, chairs a committee that has the power to initiate an impeachment inquiry, which a number of his Democratic colleagues are now demanding.
'The report is my testimony:' Watch full statement by Robert Mueller May 29, 2019 09:21 Many of those lawmakers said that Mueller’s statement Wednesday validated their position to begin an inquiry, in the wake of recent moves by the White House to block multiple congressional subpoenas issued by Democratic chairmen for testimony and documents.
Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., who before Wednesday hadn't called for an impeachment inquiry, went even further than many of her colleagues and said the House should already file articles of impeachment.
""It is very clear that President Trump is engaging in a cover-up, obstructing of justice, and betraying his oath of office. I fully expect the responsible House committees to expedite their investigations and, as soon as possible, formally draft articles of impeachment,"" she said in a statement.
Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., a member of the Judiciary panel and of Democratic leadership, tweeted that with Mueller’s work done, “it is time for Congress to do its job.” Cicilline was among three key Democrats who pressed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week to launch an impeachment inquiry.
According to an NBC News review, more than 40 House Democrats back initiating an impeachment inquiry, as does Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., the lone Republican in Congress in favor of taking that action.
Following Mueller’s remarks, Amash tweeted, “The ball is in our court, Congress.” He first voiced support for an impeachment inquiry over a week ago in a series of tweets, and he stood by his position at a town hall back home in his district in Grand Rapids, Michigan on Tuesday.
Another pro-impeachment inquiry Democrat, Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, tweeted that Mueller made it clear Wednesday that his investigation didn’t exonerate Trump and “directly contradicts Attorney General William Barr’s public statements.""
Special Counsel Mueller makes it clear that his investigation did not ""exonerate"" Trump, and directly contradicts Barr's public statements.
Barr should resign, and Congress should open an impeachment inquiry into the President's potentially criminal acts. https://t.co/IovdGvDbPT https://t.co/hIE6SbWOFB
— Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) May 29, 2019 And Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., who told reporters last week that he favored Pelosi's strategy of not jumping to impeachment, said in a Wednesday statement that he had changed his mind, and that Mueller had made clear that any ""remedy"" for a president who has committed crimes is in the hands of Congress.
""Mr. Mueller’s statement that his office could have exonerated Donald Trump but did not is nothing short of an alarm bell above the door of our republic,"" Pascrell said.
""In addition to continuing our other investigations into rampant corruption throughout this government, Congress must proceed with an Article I inquiry of whether Donald Trump committed ,"" he added. ""If, from our own inquiry, we find he did obstruct justice or committed other high crimes, then we will have no other avenue but impeachment of this President.”
Many Democratic lawmakers on Twitter pointed to one Mueller remark in particular: ""If we had had confidence that the president had clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""
House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who has suggested that Democrats may have no choice but to start impeachment proceedings against Trump, tweeted Wednesday that Mueller’s statement, “confirms both the evidence of obstruction by the president and the critical role of Congress under the Constitution going forward.”
And Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., joined the bandwagon of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Wednesday to call on the House to start an impeachment inquiry .
Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.
— Cory Booker (@CoryBooker) May 29, 2019 Most Republicans who reacted quickly to the special counsel's statement stuck to their previous stance that the case is closed on the Russia investigation.
“Today’s statement by Mr. Mueller reinforces the findings of his report,"" tweeted Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., ""And as for me, the case is over. Mr. Mueller has decided to move on and let the report speak for itself. Congress should follow his lead.”
Today’s statement by Mr. Mueller reinforces the findings of his report.
And as for me, the case is over.
Mr. Mueller has decided to move on and let the report speak for itself.
Congress should follow his lead.
— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 29, 2019 Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, tweeted, “9 minute and 39 second press conference. Same conclusions. No new information. Time to move on.”
And Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., another frequent defender of Trump, criticized Mueller's appearance. “If @realDonaldTrump doesn’t take a question for a few weeks, the media claims democracy is on life support. Robert #Mueller took 22 months to do the investigation. Followed by a 9 minute drive-by obstruction allegation. And then does not take a SINGLE QUESTION.”
Mueller indicated Wednesday that he had made the decision himself that he did not want to testify on Capitol Hill — or to offer further public comment on the probe. “I hope and expect that this is the only time that I will speak to you in this manner,” he said. “...The work speaks for itself. The report is my testimony.”
His remarks on Wednesday came amid a week-long congressional recess, with lawmakers set to return to Washington next week.

'The case is closed!': Trump continues to claim vindication after Mueller speaks,www.nbcnews.com,Dartunorro Clark,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/case-closed-trump-continues-claim-vindication-after-mueller-speaks-n1011431,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday continued to claim vindication in the Russia investigation moments after special counsel Robert Mueller gave his first public comments on the probe. ""Nothing changes from the Mueller Report,"" Trump tweeted. ""There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.""
Mueller said Wednesday that he did not come to a traditional prosecutorial decision on whether Trump obstructed justice in his report, explaining, as he did in that document, that he was bound by a Justice Department policy that prohibits charging a sitting president with a crime.
""If we had had confidence that he clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so,"" Mueller said. ""We did not, however, make a determination to whether the president did commit a crime.""
""The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" Mueller added, explaining the department policy — a reference to the constitutional provisions by which Congress may impeach and convict a president.
Beyond Justice Department policy, his team was guided by ""principles of fairness,"" in that ""it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge,"" he said.
Related Politics Politics Mueller says charging Trump wasn't an 'option', won't comment beyond his report Mueller, who also announced his resignation Wednesday, also said his report ""speaks for itself"" and ""is my testimony,"" suggesting that any testimony of his before Congress would not provide information ""beyond what is already public.""
Mueller's remarks, however, challenge Attorney General William Barr's assertions in a summary of the report's key findings that he sent to Congress in March. In that memo , Barr said Mueller's decision not to reach a conclusion about whether Trump had tried to obstruct justice had left it him to him to review the evidence, which he found insufficient to support such a charge. But Mueller's remarks, as well as the report itself , referenced a role for Congress in checking the president.
After Mueller spoke, Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani characterized his statement as a win for the president.
""A declination by any other name is a declination,"" Giuliani tweeted. ""Mueller’s statement just repeated his report there is no case, collusion or obstruction. Despite DOJ policy on charging, he used over 430 pages and a brief press statement to reach that result. No case!!!""
A declination by any other name is a declination. Mueller’s statement just repeated his report there is no case, collusion or obstruction. Despite DOJ policy on charging, he used over 430 pages and a brief press statement to reach that result. No case!!!
— Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) May 29, 2019 Another of Trump's attorneys, Jay Sekulow, emphasized Barr's conclusion on the question of obstruction, saying in a statement after Mueller's remarks that the probe ""produced no findings of collusion or obstruction against the President.""
""The Attorney General conclusively determined that there was no obstruction by the President,"" Sekulow said. ""In the words of Attorney General Barr: ‘the report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct.’”
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders echoed their comments, saying, ""The report was clear— there was no collusion, no conspiracy — and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction.""
""After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same,” she added.
In his report, Mueller extensively detailed Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, multiple contacts associates with Russians, and Trump's efforts to end the probe. Mueller wrote that the evidence he reviewed was not enough to establish a Trump-Russia conspiracy, and, on obstruction , said he could not come to a traditional prosecutorial decision because of Justice Department legal opinion.
""Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,"" Mueller wrote , later adding that Trump's ""efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.""
Related Politics Politics Report highlights: The most interesting parts from 448 pages Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that Mueller's statement reaffirmed the findings in his report and justified the congressional inquiries into the president's actions.
""Although Department of Justice policy prevented the Special Counsel from bringing criminal charges against the President, the Special Counsel has clearly demonstrated that President Trump is lying about the Special Counsel’s findings, lying about the testimony of key witnesses in the Special Counsel’s report, and is lying in saying that the Special Counsel found no obstruction and no collusion,” Nadler said in a statement.
""Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump – and we will do so,"" he added. ""No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.""
Vice President Mike Pence's spokesperson, Alyssa Farah, countered Wednesday that Democrats were clinging to ""discredited allegations,"" adding again that the Department of Justice ""concluded there was no collusion and no obstruction.""
""For two years, the White House fully cooperated with the investigation turning over millions of pages of documents and making witnesses available for hundreds of hours of testimony,"" Farah said.
""While some Democrats may cling to discredited allegations against the President, the American people can be confident: this Administration will continue to focus on making our nation stronger, safer, and more secure,” she added.

Rihanna sends SZA a Fenty Beauty gift card after singer says she was profiled at Sephora,www.nbcnews.com,Minyvonne Burke,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/rihanna-sends-sza-fenty-beauty-gift-card-after-singer-says-n1011381,"Rihanna surprised SZA with a Fenty Beauty gift card after the ""Love Galore"" singer said she was racially profiled while shopping at a Sephora makeup store in California. In a recent Instagram Story, SZA shared that Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Fenty, sent her a handwritten note along with the gift card.
""Go buy yo Fenty Beauty in peace sis!"" wrote Rihanna, who launched the cosmetics brand in 2017.
""Tanks queen!"" SZA, 28, who was born Solána Imani Rowe, captioned the Instagram photo.
In a series of tweets several weeks ago, SZA said she was shopping for Fenty Beauty products at a Calabasas store outside of Los Angeles when an employee, whom she nicknamed ""Sandy Sephora,"" called security to make sure she wasn't stealing.
""We had a long talk,"" the Grammy-nominated singer wrote in an April 30 post . ""U have a blessed day Sandy.""
In a second tweet SZA added: ""Can a b**** cop her fenty in peace er whut.""
Sephora did not immediately return NBC News' request for comment.
In a message on Twitter to SZA a day after her post, Sephora said it was looking into the incident .
""You are a part of the Sephora family , and we are committed to ensuring every member of our community feels welcome and included at our stores,"" the beauty company wrote. ""We want to let you know we take complaints like this very seriously and are actively working with our teams to address the situation immediately.""
