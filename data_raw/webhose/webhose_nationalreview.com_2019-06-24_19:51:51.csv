Barrs Mandate to Declassify | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/william-barr-mandate-declassify-information-intelligence-activities/,"May 26, 2019 7:51 PM Attorney General William Barr testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., April 9, 2019 (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters)
President Trump has given Attorney General Bill Barr the authority to declassify information having to do with “intelligence activities relating to the campaigns in the 2016 Presidential election and certain related matters.”
The late senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) was pretty convincing on the point that the federal government classifies too much information that should be available to the public, and it would certainly be worth having more information about how the federal government handled investigations in 2016 and afterward. Trump is acting well within his constitutional authority. Advertisement Advertisement
But there is the possibility that declassification will be pursued selectively in a way that furthers the administration’s preferred political narratives. If Bill Barr still had the high reputation he had in both parties when he started this job, that suspicion would have been lessened. But he has spun for the president aggressively, which is within the rights of an AG but has reduced his capital. (Not that some of his critics themselves have much of a reputation for sobriety to lose. This morning Rep. Hakeem Jeffries called him “ the so-called attorney general ” on Meet the Press .)
The order also appears in a worse light because the president has suggested over the last week that James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and others had committed “treason” — even after being reminded that treason is punishable by death. Advertisement
Trump’s campaign against Comey et al also creates a political problem for Republicans. GOP officials keep insisting that it is time to move on from the endless controversy over alleged Russian collusion and obstruction of justice, while also extending that controversy. Barr himself said to Congress that “we have to stop using the criminal-justice system as a political weapon.” Perhaps he should make that case to a president who is, like a lot of his opponents, very free in throwing around the term “treason.” Advertisement"
"Going Beyond Abortion Debate, Longing for Motherhood | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/going-beyond-abortion-debate-longing-for-motherhood/,"May 27, 2019 5:30 AM (Pixabay) We can be more tender in our conversations, debates, and lives.
‘N o one should be forced into lifelong parenting if they don’t want to take on that role,” Chelsea Patterson Sobolik recently wrote, responding to some of the confusion in the recent, frenzied abortion debates across the country. “My own birth mother was unable to parent me. However, she didn’t abort me in the womb. She made the brave and courageous decision for me and allowed me to be adopted by a couple in a position to love and raise a child. I’m able to advocate for the lives of others, particularly for the little ones in the womb, who can’t speak for themselves.”
In her book Longing for Motherhood: Holding On to Hope in the Midst of Childlessness , Sobolik describes her early days in an orphanage in her native Romania:
The majority of children placed in communist orphanages weren’t actual orphans; they were simply children whose parents were unable to care for them. Such orphanages were known as “slaughterhouses of souls.” . . . I was one of those babies whose mother couldn’t afford to keep her child. My birth mother was a nineteen-year-old girl with no money, no husband, and limited resources. Her decision to place me up for adoption wasn’t an easy one. My birth mom longed for motherhood, but instead she had to choose childlessness.
The couple who would become her adoptive parents desired children, but they suffered the pain of infertility and miscarriage. In the middle of an “excruciatingly long” domestic adoption process, they wound up watching a 20/20 documentary called “Shame of a Nation” about Romanian orphans. “The documentary introduced the world — and Bobby and Christie Patterson — to these children, struggling to survive,” she writes. “In the days following, my parents prayed about what they’d just witnessed. Starving children. Disabled children. Children who had experienced massive amounts of trauma.” Five weeks later, the Pattersons were on a plane to Romania. After visiting several orphanages and meeting several birth mothers, they found Ana and her daughter and “immediately began the necessary paperwork to legally adopt” Chelsea. After five weeks, the new family flew home to North Carolina.
The Pattersons would go on to adopt four more children internationally (though not from Romania, as adoption laws changed and foreigners could no longer adopt from there).
Fast forward to 19 — the same age Ana was when she placed Chelsea up for adoption — and a doctor delivers the brutal news that Chelsea, who was raised in a family of six children, who babysat and volunteered at summer camps — surrounded by other children for as long as she can remember — would never be able to have biological children:
Sure, I was looking forward to going to college, starting a career, meeting someone, falling in love, and getting married. But I’d always anticipated the day when my husband and I would find out that I was pregnant, share the good news with our friends and family, and start planning and preparing for our little one to enter the world. This was the natural course of life I was expecting and longing for.
She writes tenderly and transparently. In conversations about women and motherhood today, hers is a uniquely powerful voice, as a young married woman sorting through what longing for motherhood looks like in a culture with orphans of all kinds. She writes about spiritual motherhood and mentoring. She has a sensitivity to women who don’t feel called or ready to be mothers, to women — and men — hurt by abortion, and women and men choosing life but desperately in need of help and resources. She represents so many women and men who not only talk about being pro-life but also work toward a revolutionary reality, one in which every child’s life is treasured.
“Childlessness touches the lives of many women and the precious people who love them,” she writes.
Infertility alone affects approximately 12 percent of the US population — that’s over one in ten couples. According to estimates, roughly 15 to 20 percent of all pregnancies in the US will end in miscarriage. The risk of miscarriage in known pregnancies under twelve weeks is one in five.
And those numbers don’t even take into account couples who have experienced the devastation of a child dying because of illness or accident. It doesn’t take into account single women who are reaching the end of their ideal childbearing years and who nonetheless want to be mothers. It is only a start in putting all of this pain in perspective. We never do really know the pain another bears.
“The world may never know how many tears you’ve cried, but you can rest in the fact that not one tear has fallen to the ground without God noticing,” Sobolik notes too, having shed more than a few herself. Advertisement
Out of the depths of love and pain, Sobolik, who is the policy director for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, uses her voice to offer us an opportunity to think about the children who need a loving home today, the women and men with broken hearts for children — both out of loss and longing. She invites us to have a conversation about life and love and children and family that can be about more than our often miserable politics, which seem stuck in one long argument over a woman’s right to choose abortion. There’s so much more to life — and a longing to get on with it. Advertisement"
"Health-Care Reform: To Stop Socialized Medicine, Expand Individual Choice | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Avik Roy,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/stop-socialized-medicine-expand-individual-choice/,"May 27, 2019 6:00 AM (Pixabay) The old “repeal and replace” mantra is no longer sufficient.
R epublicans and conservatives have repeatedly complained that Obamacare amounts to the “government takeover of the U.S. health-care system.” The only problem is it isn’t true.
It’s fair to say that Obamacare was a meaningful expansion of the role of the federal government in health care. But the real government takeover of U.S. health care took place in 1965, when LBJ signed into law the amendments to the Social Security Act, enacted by bipartisan majorities in Congress, that created Medicare and Medicaid. Advertisement Advertisement
Today, more than 115 million Americans — one-third of the population — are enrolled in socialized, single-payer, government-run health insurance. In America, de facto single-payer programs include Medicare (38 million enrollees in its single-payer form), Medicaid (62 million enrollees), the Children’s Health Insurance Program (7 million), the Veterans Health Administration (9 million), and other programs. Of that 115 million, Obamacare has contributed only 12 million , through its expansion of Medicaid. (About 8 million people receive subsidies to participate in Obamacare’s private insurance exchanges, which, for all their flaws, are not single-payer systems.)
All this to say that socialized medicine — and single-payer health insurance — are hardly as foreign to America as conservatives tend to believe . “I’m not going to cut Medicare,” Donald Trump promised when campaigning for president. It’s not an accident that Bernie Sanders and his compatriots call their plan “Medicare for All” — they do so because Medicare is the most popular single-payer health-care program in the country.

Conservatives and Republicans are eager to talk about the push for single-payer because it represents favorable political ground. Obviously, “If you like your plan, screw you” is a sub-optimal strategy for Democrats in 2020.
It would be, however, a colossal mistake for conservatives to kick up their heels and enjoy this moment. If they embrace the status quo — and do nothing to address the real problems with the high and rising cost of American health care — the popularity of socialized health insurance will only grow stronger.
Nowhere is this more apparent than among the 159 million Americans who get their health insurance through their employers. While the employer-based system deploys private insurers, it is far removed from an actual market for health insurance , because few workers have the opportunity to choose their own coverage with their own money. Employers enjoy controlling their workers’ health benefits, because doing so makes it harder for employees to take their coverage with them if they leave.
Because of this desire by employers to use health benefits as a retention tool, and because workers lack a clear picture of how much is coming out of their paycheck to pay for health coverage, the cost of employer-sponsored insurance is rising faster than the cost of other U.S. health-insurance programs. Advertisement Advertisement
Hospitals, for example, take advantage of their regional monopoly power to charge those with employer-based coverage 2.4 times more than what they charge those on Medicare for the same services. Deductibles for employer-based coverage have tripled in the last ten years, increasing the frustration that workers have with private insurers.
That’s why polls are showing increasing support for government-run health insurance — among Republicans. An April poll for the Associated Press asked 1,108 Americans whether they would favor the creation of a “new government health insurance plan” that they could buy instead of private coverage. Republicans favored the idea 44–32. (Voters overall supported the proposal 53–17, with Democrats in support by a margin of 65–8.)
If Republicans stick their heads in the sand, over time, socialized health insurance will become more popular, not less. Pragmatic Democrats have developed alternatives to Berniecare that deploy “public options,” such as the one described in the AP poll, that offer workers a lower-cost alternative to private employer-based coverage. “Public option” government-run insurance has lower premiums than employer-based coverage, because it pays Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates to hospitals instead of the wildly inflated employer-based rates. Advertisement
In 2010, Democrats tried to enact a public option through regular order, requiring 60 votes in the Senate. They won only 58. Next time around, they will try enacting a public option through reconciliation, which will require only a simple 50-vote majority. The Congressional Budget Office will score public option-based plans, unlike Berniecare, as reducing the deficit, because their lower premiums will lead to lower levels of tax subsidies for employer-based coverage and Obamacare-based private insurance.
Conservative M isconceptions about H ealth R eform Advertisement
The good news is that there are ways to roll back the socialist tide. But first, conservatives have to overcome three misconceptions they have about the state of health-care policy in America.
The first is that Obamacare is the most important component of government-run health care. As we discussed above, it’s at best a distant third, far behind Medicare and Medicaid. Advertisement
The second is that there is no legitimate role for the federal government in helping Americans afford health insurance. In fact, it’s the federal government that created the problem of runaway health-care inflation, by preserving World War II–era wage controls in the form of excluding employer-sponsored coverage from taxation, and later by building Medicare on top of the employer system. The federal government made this mess, and the federal government is the only institution with the power to fix it.
The third misconception is the most important: that the only way to achieve universal health-insurance coverage is by further expanding the role of government in health care.
Americans enjoy universal smartphones, universal cable TV, and, today, nearly universal employment for those who seek it. Conservatives understand that each of these achievements took place not because of an expansion of government, but because of a reduction of it. Free-enterprise innovation is the reason that so many things are universal in our economy and scarce in socialist ones. Advertisement
So why is it that so many of us have accepted the left-wing narrative that the only path to universal health insurance is through more government, when we would never accept that narrative about any other sector of the economy?
In The Art of War , Sun-Tzu famously observed that “every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought.” Conservatives have preemptively lost the war on health care, because they are fighting on the terrain of the Left: that the only way to universally affordable coverage is through government control. Since the public is understandably concerned with the affordability of health insurance and health care, conservatives who equate “affordability” with “big government” are destined to lose on policy, politics, or both.
Affordable H ealth C are for E very G eneration
There is a different way forward for conservatives, one that embraces the goal of ensuring that health insurance is affordable for every American — and not just those living today, but also those from the generations to come , the ones who will inherit our health-care-entitlement-fueled $21 trillion federal debt.
The first thing to understand about American health care is that almost every American with health insurance gets some sort of federal subsidy. The poorest of the poor get subsidized coverage through Medicaid. The disabled get subsidized coverage through Medicaid and Medicare. Everyone with employer-based coverage gets a subsidy through the tax code: a benefit that is far more generous to wealthy bankers and law-firm partners than it is to cashiers or truck drivers. Warren Buffett, who is worth $84 billion, gets taxpayer-subsidized health insurance, because he is over 65 and eligible for Medicare.
Basically, the federal government subsidizes coverage for everyone except for a category of the working poor: those who don’t get insurance through their employer but earn too much to benefit from Obamacare’s subsidies. In a sense, this is the opposite of the system we ought to have, one in which those who work hard and play by the rules — but still struggle to afford coverage — are the ones we strive most to help.
Imagine an America in which the only people whose health insurance we subsidized were those who could otherwise not afford it: the poor, the sick, the vulnerable, and working Americans in lower tax brackets. Not only would such a system be fairer, but it would be far less expensive. Even if we did nothing else to improve our health-care system, a rebalancing of insurance subsidies could reduce the federal deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
Of course, such a transition could not be achieved overnight, for political and other reasons. But we can move substantially in that direction, by introducing gradual reforms whose value compounds over time.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, many luminaries of the conservative movement have embraced universal coverage. Ronald Reagan, in the 1964 Republican National Convention speech that launched him to stardom, said that “no one in this country should be denied medical care for lack of funds.” In another contemporaneous speech, he said that “any person in the United States who requires medical attention and cannot provide for himself should have it provided for him.” Milton Friedman, in a 2001 essay for The Public Interest , endorsed “providing every family in the United States with catastrophic insurance (i.e., a major medical policy with a high deductible).” Friedrich Hayek, in The Road to Serfdom , wrote:
Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision . . . in the case of sickness and accident . . . where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks. . . . There is no incompatibility in principle between the state providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom.
While Reagan supported universal coverage, he opposed Medicare, because it was “compulsory health insurance through a government bureau for people who don’t need it or who have . . . even a few million dollars tucked away.” On the Reagan model, we can gradually introduce more means-testing into Medicare , so that middle-class taxpayers are not forced to subsidize coverage for the wealthiest Americans, people who should have saved enough on their own to buy insurance in their golden years.
Reducing how much we subsidize health insurance — especially for the wealthy — will not only balance the budget. It will also slow the growth of health care inflation, because 75 years of massive government subsidies are the biggest driver of higher health-care prices, much as federal subsidies for mortgage interest have artificially driven up the price of housing.
Choice and C ompetition W ill L ower H ealth -C are P rices Advertisement
And that gets us to the fundamental problem with American health care: It is far too expensive. Despite Obamacare — and, in many cases, because of it — 25 million legal U.S. residents remain uninsured. Tens of millions more have private coverage but struggle to afford it and find that rising health-insurance premiums are reducing their disposable income.
Here again, just as choice and competition make products and services less expensive in the rest of the economy, they can do so in health care. We must substantially expand Americans’ freedom to choose their own health insurance — both in public and private programs.
The freedom to choose is not just a fundamental economic principle. It is also the strongest moral argument against single-payer health care, which would abolish private health-care choices and replace them with a bureaucratically determined, one-size-fits-all government-run insurance agency.
But this doesn’t mean that America’s private health-insurance system lives up to that principle. Today, few workers with employer-sponsored insurance are able to choose their own plans. Instead, those plans are foisted upon them by corporate bureaucrats whose interests do not always align with those of their workers. The Trump administration is finalizing a rule enabling forward-thinking companies to change this, by allowing them to fund tax-advantaged Health Reimbursement Accounts that workers can use to buy the coverage they want on the open market. We can build on that rule by requiring that newly incorporated businesses use that approach to sponsor coverage. In that way, we preserve traditional arrangements for existing employers, but modernize employer-sponsored coverage for the workers of the future.
Similarly, we should gradually convert the Medicaid program from its current single-payer form into one in which enrollees receive tax credits to buy private insurance. And we should strengthen Medicare Advantage, the market-based form of Medicare whose consumer-driven structure has incentivized insurers to offer broader benefits, lower out-of-pocket costs, and better health outcomes than traditional Medicare does. On average, Medicare Advantage HMOs deliver the traditional Medicare benefit for 93 cents on the dollar, leaving plans room to offer seniors these additional benefits at a still-competitive price. It’s not uncommon at left-leaning health-policy conferences to hear experts softly complain that single-payer Medicare is no longer “competitive” with Medicare Advantage. Naturally, Senator Sanders and his friends are offended by this.
When Obamacare was enacted, the Medicare actuary predicted that MA enrollment would get cut in half, because Obamacare partly paid for its subsidies to the uninsured by cutting payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Instead, enrollment in Medicare Advantage has more than doubled . Within ten years, under current law, it’s possible that there will be more people enrolled in Medicare Advantage than in single-payer Medicare, even if we do nothing.
But we can do more. Today, Americans who turn 65 and don’t choose their own Medicare plan are defaulted into Medicare’s single-payer program. Instead, their default enrollment should be into a private Medicare Advantage plan, with the ability to opt out into the single-payer program if they want it. Other subtle tweaks such as competitive bidding can accelerate price competition among private plans in Medicare, lowering costs for seniors and taxpayers alike.
Finally, freedom of choice doesn’t just apply to insurance. It also applies to health-care goods and services. As we discussed above, throughout the U.S. health-care system, government has incentivized the rise of monopolies that exploit their market power to charge egregious prices to patients and taxpayers. This is especially true in two of the largest components of U.S. health-care spending: hospitals and pharmaceuticals.
President Trump has exhibited genuine leadership in tackling monopoly power among drug companies; he and congressional Republicans need to do the same for hospitals . More competition will lead to lower health-care prices, which in turn will make both private health insurance and public insurance programs more affordable.
The N ew C onservative H ealth -C are L eaders
So, to sum up: We can make health care affordable for every generation — both those living today and those yet to come — if we do three things.
First, we have to end welfare for the rich , and refocus health-care subsidies on those who truly need the help.
Second, we have to expand the freedom to choose customized, private health-insurance plans: both in the employer-sponsored system and in public programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Third, we have restore competition to the provision of health care, so that hospital monopolies, drug monopolies, and the like have an incentive to reduce prices and improve quality. Advertisement
More competition, lower costs, and fewer subsidies: This is the only market-based approach to health reform that can gain broad public support and get enacted by Congress.
The good news is that a number of young, enterprising congressional Republicans have taken up that mantle. Representative Jim Banks of Indiana has introduced the Hospital Competition Act of 2019 , which would restore competition to highly consolidated hospital markets. Representative Mark Meadows (N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, has introduced an antitrust exemption for insurers , leveling the playing field between monopoly drug manufacturers and fragmented health insurers.
Most impressively, Representative Bruce Westerman (Ark.), a third-term congressman, has produced the Fair Care Act of 2019 , which is designed to increase the number of Americans with health insurance while lowering federal spending."
"American Revolution: Remember Its Starving, Barefoot, Heroic Troops | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jay Cost,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/remember-soldiers-american-revolution/,"May 27, 2019 6:00 AM The March to Valley Forge , 1883, by William Trego (Wikimedia) Our young nation was very poor, the war was very expensive, and Congress and the states wanted everyone else to pay.
M emorial Day is a day to remember and appreciate the ultimate sacrifice given by men and women who have served in our armed forces. Far and away, the Civil War was the deadliest conflict in American history. After that is World War II.
Way down the list is the American Revolutionary War, with “only” 4,435 battle deaths , according to Veterans Affairs. Though few in number, these soldiers bore a unique sacrifice — for, unlike other soldiers throughout our history, these heroes had to fight off the would-be British conquerors without sufficient support from their own government. Advertisement Advertisement
On an absolute scale, the American Revolution was a relatively modest affair. However, judged in light of the tiny American economy of 1776–83, it was an enormous undertaking. As a percentage of GDP, the Revolutionary War cost the United States about as much as World War I did (and remember that, before the absolutely massive conflict of World War II, World War I was known as “the Great War”).
For such large-scale conflicts, financing usually comes through issuing public debt. It is just too much to pay via taxation on the citizenry. And indeed, if you look through the government propaganda of World Wars I and II, you will see a relentless emphasis on purchasing war bonds. The problem for America in the 1770s and 1780s was that debt financing was largely unavailable. Domestic wealth was tied up in land, which cannot be quickly turned into cash. And while foreign governments did loan some money to us, none of them lent enough to finance the entire conflict.
That meant that the bulk of public financing had to come through inflation — which at the time meant an increase in paper money not backed by specie (or coins minted from precious metals). The government would print money to pay for goods and services necessary for the war, which would increase the price of those goods and services, inducing the government to print more, and so on. Inflation is essentially a tax on holding cash, and it was in this way that most of the Revolutionary War was paid for. Advertisement Advertisement
The Americans suffered two closely related problems with this strategy of finance. A long-run program of inflation sapped public confidence in the currency, which led to the runaway inflation that was evident by 1780, so the currency was not worth anything at all. As a result, the government had to provision the soldiers through impressment of private goods. Meanwhile, private citizens had to barter with one another, because paper money was totally unreliable. When it came to perishable goods that could not immediately be bartered, such as crops, Americans had no incentive to preserve them. This made it all the more difficult for the government to acquire provisions. That led to the bizarre situation of soldiers starving while crops were rotting in the fields.
Unfortunately, this grim situation was worsened by the actions of the Continental Congress. Embarrassed by the low regard for the currency, Congress effectively stripped itself of the power to print money in 1780, outsourcing the authority to the states. Yet this only subjected the public finances of the nation to the same collective-action problem that plagued other essential functions — in other words, each state had an incentive to “free-ride” on the war effort, leaving the burden to everybody else. Advertisement
This dire financial situation hit the enlisted men worst of all. If you examine, for instance, William Trego’s iconic painting The March to Valley Forge , you will notice the sorry state of the infantry. Some of them are trudging through the snow barefoot. Part of this was owing to the massive scope of the war effort. The United States was a poor country undertaking an expensive war, so provisioning was always bound to be difficult. (It is hard, after all, to find shoes for soldiers in a country that does not make many shoes.) But this difficulty was compounded by the government’s lack of sufficient access to credit markets, the need for inflation with all its attendant problems, and the Continental Congress’s short-sighted policy response to that inflation.

Buckley Jr. We can arm ourselves with the best thinking of our contemporaries and the wisdom of our ancestors, and we can make the case for liberty.
W hen I was asked to write a book about socialism eight years ago, I was a little skeptical. “Aren’t we kind of . . . done with that?”
Standing athwart History, yelling, “You @#$%&! idiots cannot possibly be serious!”
But they are serious.
When National Review — now in the midst of its Spring webathon , and encouraging your generous support — was launched in 1955, central planning was the wave of the future, supposedly. The prestige of science had never been higher, and neither had popular faith in the wisdom of experts. In the United States, the federal government’s reputation was at an all-time high, too: The combination of a misunderstood Great Depression, the popularity of the New Deal, the remarkable war mobilization, and the prosperous postwar years had shaped the thinking and assumptions of a generation whose members by that point were, in no small part, ready to hand over much of life to bureaucracies directed by benevolent, dispassionate managers who, being liberated from ideology, would simply follow science and pragmatism wherever they led. And where they were leading, all the best people assured us, was progress . Advertisement Advertisement
In this understanding, the problem with socialism as practiced behind the Iron Curtain was that the central planners were the wrong people — tyrants and caudillos, and partisans of dictatorship. But then socialism ruined the United Kingdom, which foundered in one-unthinkable dysfunction. The “democratic” socialists of Europe turned out to have a great deal in common with the more explicitly nasty ones in Russia, China, Cambodia, Vietnam, and elsewhere. It took them a long time to figure it out — and not all of them figured it out — but the truth eventually became too obvious to deny: When it comes to central planning, there are no right people. The problem isn’t really the people — it’s the central planning. As the apostate Communist Willi Schlamm famously put it, the problem with socialism is socialism. Advertisement
(The other half of that proverb, quoted frequently in these pages, that the problem with capitalism is capitalists, will be familiar to conservatives familiar with the ethics of Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) Advertisement
I saw grown men cry watching on television as the Berlin Wall come down in 1989 — in sorrow for all the suffering and murder it stood for, in gratitude for its having come to an end. It wasn’t the end of history, but it was the end of a particularly awful chapter.
Or so we thought. Advertisement
For many of us who grew up during the Cold War, the thought of the hammer and sickle returning to be greeted with anything other than horror and revulsion — the same kind of horror and revulsion that might greet the return of that other red flag, the one with the swastika — was hard to imagine. And then I went down to Occupy Wall Street with Charlie Cooke and saw for myself: The activists parading around in East German army uniforms , the Lenin tracts being hawked, the little red flags.
One of the phrases that I have had to expunge from my conversation is, “Nobody could be that stupid.” Now, when I hear that something is foolproof, I want to meet the fool and judge for myself. Advertisement
It is our unhappy duty at the moment to report on the doings of many of these fools, including self-proclaimed socialists such as Senator Bernie Sanders, New York mayor Bill de Blasio, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Two of those fools are running for president, the third is excluded, for now, by her youth. Like generations of socialists before them, they are laboring under the delusion that they can plan the world, that they can substitute their utopian blueprint for the organic order of human life, and that the terrible means necessary to build this new paradise somehow will be rendered less inhumane and less oppressive than they have without exception throughout history if only they amend the word “democratic” to their revolutionary manifesto.
“There are no lost causes,” T. S. Eliot assures us, “because there are no gained causes.” National Review has been making the case for liberty and against arrogant utopianism since 1955, and the fight is not over and is not going to be over because it cannot be over. Wisdom is another one of those commodities that is not evenly distributed, and human nature is what it is. Advertisement
What do we do? What can we do? We can arm ourselves with the best thinking of our contemporaries and the wisdom of our ancestors, we can make the case, we can remind those who have forgotten about the gulags and the hunger-terror, we can keep alive the memory of the 100 million martyrs to utopia who died at the hands of various socialist regimes in the 20th century, we can report on the facts of socialist life today in Venezuela and North Korea. We can, and we must. And, if possible, we can do it without being too grim about our prospects or ungrateful for the blessings bestowed so abundantly upon us here in this thriving — but not uncontested — haven for liberty."
Washington State’s ‘Progressive’ Policies Harm Blacks and Help Whites | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nicholas Kerr,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/washington-state-progressive-policies-harm-blacks-help-whites/,"May 27, 2019 6:00 AM Skyline of Seattle, Wash., in 2017. (Chris Helgren/Reuters) Democrats in the state government are harming blacks and helping whites.
W ashington State progressives who like to position themselves as allies of blacks are failing to live up to their promises. In the state’s most recent legislative session alone, Democrats passed several measures that will do considerable harm to minorities, while whites will be the chief beneficiaries.
For example, Democrats broke 2017’s bipartisan agreement on school funding, which will almost certainly result in greater racial inequity in our school system. In order to satisfy a state-supreme-court decision, two years ago our legislators agreed to raise the state property tax by an average of 17 percent, on the condition that local school taxes would not be raised. The court had found the use of local taxes inequitable because schools in wealthy neighborhoods with higher property values received more funding. As progressives at the time pointed out, these same neighborhoods are predominantly white. During this session, they kept the increase in state taxes and allowed $2.8 billion in additional taxes at the local level. By breaking 2017’s agreement, we’re returning to the status quo ante and local levies are all but certain to be raised across the state, resulting in the same inequities the court previously identified.

Democrats also dropped a provision that would have ensured that charter schools would receive any increases in local school funding along with traditional public schools. Minorities are overrepresented in most Washington charter schools — the percentage of blacks in these schools is often two or three times the percentage of blacks in the communities in which they operate. Minority parents know all too well how traditional public schools have failed their children, and they are lining up to get their kids in: Almost all have waiting lists.
Further, ever-increasing property taxes in Washington have hit low-income minorities the hardest. My family used to live in Seattle’s Central District, where many of our neighbors were retired black homeowners on fixed incomes. As property-tax demands inexorably rose, these families were forced out of the neighborhood. Simultaneously, rising property values have shut out younger minorities from purchasing their own first homes in Seattle. As Gene Balk reported , in 1970 King County had a 49 percent black-homeownership rate, well above the national average, but now it has the fifth-lowest black-homeownership rate in the country among the 100 U.S. counties with the largest black populations.

Balk also notes that “while a racial-affordability gap exists in housing markets across the country, it is more extreme here than in most places.” Strong demand due to population growth is one factor. But another key driver has been a dramatic increase in land-use regulations since progressive Democrats passed 1990’s Growth Management Act. As a University of Washington study found, over the 17 years through 2006, the median inflation-adjusted price of a Seattle home rose from $221,000 to $447,800, and fully $200,000 of that increase can be attributed to land-use regulations. While they might be well-intentioned, these rules add significant costs that hurt the poor the most and close off their opportunities. Advertisement
Nina Martinez has lobbied against another favorite progressive policy, bike lanes, arguing that they “displace the underprivileged and reapportion to the privileged, public monies.” And she has a point. “Residents who have access to a working bicycle are more likely to be white, male, and under 45 years of age,” the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) found. “Older residents and non-white residents are the least likely to have access to a working bicycle.” Moreover, as the most recent U.S. census found, only 2.8 percent of Seattle residents commute to work by bike. In a city that spent $12 million for a one-mile bike lane and has a 1.4-mile, almost $25 million project underway , both of which will mostly be used by white males, it’s hard not to conclude that progressive policies are disproportionately benefiting one race. Advertisement
As minorities and lower-income residents have been priced out of Seattle and into the suburbs, they’ve also been forced to pay more in the form of longer commutes. And as congestion has gotten worse, these residents have become cut off from job opportunities they once could have traveled to. While the Seattle area has been a job-making machine over the past decade, the average number of jobs within a typical commute distance fell between 2000 and 2013 by up to 8 percent for some residents of South King County . For those living in Seattle or on the Eastside, both predominantly white areas, the number of nearby jobs rose between 6 and 9 percent. Although a stated goal of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is congestion relief, blacks in South King County shouldn’t expect help any time soon, because WSDOT’s secretary, Roger Millar, has made it clear it has other priorities and he’s largely given up on it ."

Attorney General William Barr Declassification Debate | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/william-barr-declassification-authority-debate/,"Follow Andrew C. McCarthy on Twitter May 28, 2019 6:30 AM Attorney General William Barr speaks at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, in Washington, D.C., April 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The media panic notwithstanding, the buck still stops with the president.
L ast week, President Trump conferred on Attorney General Bill Barr the authority to declassify documents relevant to his inquiry into what we can collectively call “the Russia investigation.” This includes not only “Crossfire Hurricane,” the counterintelligence probe formally opened by the FBI in late July 2016, but all of the relevant investigative threads, including those pursued by other intelligence agencies — such as the CIA’s collaborations with foreign intelligence services, beginning in 2015. Advertisement Advertisement
In other words, the public is about to learn a lot more about decision-making during the Obama administration. As night follows day, the Democrat-media complex went apoplectic. Gone are the days when the press always wanted more information because it perceived its role, vouchsafed by the Constitution, to be the public’s eye on government.
Much of the mainstream media is now in an all but openly declared partnership with one of our two major political parties. Consequently, when a Republican administration is in power or being questioned, classified leaks are the order of the day. When a Democratic administration is under the microscope, we get lectures on the wages of compromising intelligence secrets, especially methods and sources.
So, naturally, we are treated to hysterical reports that the attorney general — whose Justice Department cannot enforce the law effectively unless it can entice cooperation from reluctant sources — is going to expose covert operatives gratuitously, ensuring that no courageous spy or foreign intelligence service will ever risk cooperation with the United States again. Advertisement
It is an absurd narrative. Advertisement
Barr started his government career working for the CIA. As much as any AG in the history of the country, he grasps the nexus between covert intelligence-gathering and national security. Frankly, he grasps it better than the president does. He understands the inter-agency “equities” in our trove of defense secrets — not least, the commitments made to sources and foreign intelligence agencies, the assurances of confidentiality in exchange for cooperation. He is less apt than our mercurial president to direct a sweeping declassification order that would disregard these concerns.
So far, the heated discussion about this issue has been the reductive Manichean idiocy that all debate of complex issues becomes: Either our intelligence law-enforcement agencies must be completely immune from inquiry, or all classified information must be exposed such that we can no long protect secrets or the country.
Things never actually work that way. There are always accommodations that respect the vital interests on both sides of the equation — political accountability and national security. Courts, for example, are called on in many cases to apply the Classified Information Procedures Act . It involves just this kind of line-drawing in the not-uncommon situations in which (a) the criminal law could not be enforced if the price tag of charging a defendant were the possibility that a court would erroneously order disclosure of defense secrets on due-process grounds; or, relatedly, (b) it would not be possible to have a fair trial if an accused were not given classified information that actually is essential to the defense. Advertisement
It is almost always possible to disclose the information needed for some proper public purpose while safeguarding what must be kept secret. That is not to say it is always easy to do. Sometimes, in lieu of disclosing top-secret information, the government must acknowledge facts it would prefer not to acknowledge. In lieu of, say, identifying a specific confidential informant, the government might admit that it engaged in questionable behavior (such as investigative tactics that were too intrusive under the circumstances that obtained). Advertisement
That’s an important distinction that has been lost in the public debate. Declassification is not the same thing as disclosure. The fact that an intelligence agency may be directed to declassify information so that investigators are permitted to see it does not necessarily mean the information will be made publicly available. Ultimate investigative conclusions will be made available, but some information (maybe a lot) will be withheld to protect vital intelligence (though made available to Congress — probably through senior bipartisan leadership and the relevant committees with security clearances). Think, for example, of the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment of Russia’s interference in the 2016 campaign. Most underlying intelligence remains concealed, but enough was declassified that a public report could be issued explaining the essence of what happened. Advertisement
To argue that this cannot be done is to say that unelected government officials can do whatever they want, and the people’s representatives cannot question them. That’s dangerous and ridiculous. Advertisement
Finally, the attorney general has been delegated only a sliver of the power that the president already had. There is nothing new here — in the sense that there is nothing Barr is now in a position to disclose that Trump was not already empowered to disclose. Barr will now have more influence over disclosure decisions, but even that is only a presumption. Advertisement
Obviously, Barr would not willy-nilly disclose a national-defense secret without first hearing any and all objections from, most prominently, National Intelligence Director Dan Coats, CIA director Gina Haspel, and General Paul Nakasone, who runs NSA and the U.S. Cyber Command. Barr would no doubt carefully weigh any objections by FBI director Chris Wray, even though he is technically Barr’s subordinate. There is no reason to believe these highly experienced, competent officials, each of whom understands the competing interests, cannot work out most disagreements — something that happens every day in government, and that is unremarkable (at least when it does not involve matters the media-Democrat complex would rather keep concealed)."

1963 —Retired justice Felix Frankfurter, having witnessed the appointment of his replacement, Arthur Goldberg, create a majority bloc of liberal activists on the Supreme Court, writes to Justice Harlan to lament “the atmosphere of disregard for law and to a large extent of the legal profession that now dominates the present Court and the Court on which I sat.” (Source: Seth Stern & Stephen Wermiel, Justice Brennan .) Decades later, the situation will be transformed—but, alas, for the worse—as “a large extent of the legal profession,” having been indoctrinated by the disciples of the Warren Court, will display a similar “disregard for law.” Advertisement Advertisement
2013 —In two 5-4 rulings (with Justice Kennedy joining the four liberals), the Supreme Court creates more confusion over federal habeas procedures.
In McQuiggin v. Perkins , the Court, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, creates an “actual innocence” exception to the statute of limitations on federal habeas petitions set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Never mind, as Justice Scalia points out in dissent, that AEDPA provides its own actual-innocence exception (one that the petitioner failed to satisfy). Scalia’s lead item in what he calls the Court’s “statutory-construction blooper reel” is the Court’s “flagrant breach of the separation of power” in concocting an exception to AEDPA’s “clear statutory command.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
In Trevino v. Thaler , the Court, in an opinion by Justice Breyer, significantly broadens a purportedly “narrow exception” that it had created just the previous year. As Chief Justice Roberts (joined by Justice Alito) complains in his dissent, the Court in that earlier ruling (which they both joined) had been “unusually explicit about the narrowness of [its] decision” and had included “aggressively limiting language.” But today it “throws over the crisp limit [it] made so explicit just last Term” and instead adopts an “opaque and malleable” standard that will lead to “years of procedural wrangling [that] undermine the finality of sentences necessary to effective criminal justice.” Advertisement
Justice Scalia’s brief dissent (joined by Justice Thomas) points out that he observed in his dissent in the earlier case that the Court’s “line lacks any principled basis, and will not last.” Scalia’s prophecies have often proved true, but it usually takes more than a year.
The broader lesson, which ought to be old news, is: Don’t be fooled by the liberal justices’ unprincipled and ad hoc limitations on their rulings, as those limitations will disappear at the first convenient opportunity.

President Trump isn’t subtle about his strategy to defeat Joe Biden if the former vice president becomes the Democratic nominee. Trump plans to wage the same sort of campaign against Biden that he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Back then, Trump defined Hillary as the candidate of entrenched interests who used a long career in politics for familial gain. He highlighted Clinton’s support for the 1994 crime bill and for NAFTA and TPP, driving wedges between the former secretary of state and important Democratic constituencies. And he went after Hillary’s foreign-policy credentials, painting her as an interventionist who had weakened America’s standing in the world. Advertisement Advertisement
It’s Biden’s turn. Biden’s close to a half century in American politics hasn’t exactly made him rich, but that hasn’t stopped Trump from drawing attention to the murky relationship between Biden’s diplomacy and his son Hunter’s business practices. Trump says that Biden, like Hillary, has been around for a long time, but what has he accomplished? Biden represents the ancient regime that Trump overthrew. Early polls aside, it’s not clear that American voters want a restoration.
One of the reasons Trump is going after Biden’s support for the 1994 crime bill is that the same tactic worked against Clinton. The same goes for his focus on Biden’s vote for NAFTA. These moves not only highlight divisions within the Democratic party. They also have the potential to cut into Biden’s support from African–American voters and from voters in the Rust Belt. And they might force Biden to move left on race and on trade. Suburban moderates won’t be happy. Advertisement "
John Bolton's Taiwan Meeting: A Good Sign | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/john-bolton-was-right-to-meet-with-taiwan/,"About Kevin D. Williamson May 28, 2019 12:22 PM National Security Advisor John Bolton during a graduation ceremony at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., May 22, 2019. (Michelle McLoughlin/Reuters) Its existence as a nation independent from China is a fact.
N ational Security Adviser John Bolton has caused a furor in Beijing by meeting with his counterpart from Taiwan, leading an entire generation of young Americans to ask: “ Where? ”
Taiwan once loomed large in the American consciousness, and the American Right was particularly solicitous of its well-being. In the political vocabulary of the time, the Republic of China — Taiwan — was a tiny outpost of freedom menaced by Red China — the so-called People’s Republic. Advertisement Advertisement
Taiwan is still a thriving republic. China is still a single-party police state, grown perhaps a slightly paler shade of red. But American politics has changed and, to some extent, moved on.
Bolton, a movement conservative of Cold War vintage, apparently has not moved on. Good for Bolton.
The existence of Taiwan as an independent nation is a fact. It is no more a breakaway province of the People’s Republic of China than Massachusetts is a rebellious British colony. Its 24 million people constitute the largest nation to be excluded from the United Nations and from full American diplomatic recognition, and its economy of more than $600 billion is the largest of any country to be marginalized by the global economic and diplomatic communities. The Holy See is one of a tiny handful of sovereign states recognizing Taiwan. Advertisement
Taiwan, too, once was a single-party police state, but it evolved out of that sorry state of affairs — and then some: The Freedom House index currently ranks Taiwan as a more free country than the United States. It is robustly democratic, forward-looking, and ambitious. Advertisement
All of which gets up the nose of Beijing. “The one-China principle is the political basis for China–U.S. relations,” Chinese foreign-ministry spokesman Lu Kang said after the Bolton meeting. “We are firmly against the U.S. engaging in any official contact with Taiwan in whatever form and under whatever pretext.” As CNN put it, Beijing “ordered the Trump administration to cease diplomatic engagements with the island.” Ordered . One wonders how President Trump will take that.
The United States has followed a policy of engagement with China going on 50 years now, since Richard Nixon’s famous visit in 1972. This is the correct policy: The state governed from Beijing, like the one governed from Taipei, is a fact, and one that cannot be ignored. The United States and China maintain a close and cooperative economic relationship — some call it symbiotic. Many in the Trump administration believe that relationship is too close. The president himself believes that the American trade relationship with China disadvantages the U.S. economy (he is mistaken about that), while others make a moral case against dealing with China as though it were Sweden or Canada rather than a totalitarian state that operates gulags and harvests the organs of political dissidents. Advertisement
Engagement with China is predicated largely on American self-interest — as it should be — and to the extent that idealism enters into it at all it is in the belief that such improvements as have been enjoyed by the Chinese people have been enabled by their country’s economic progress, and that it is easier for the government of a thriving and confident nation to liberalize than it is for a hungry and desperate one. Advertisement
The advocates of engagement have the better case, and they always have, even though progress has been slow and halting. That the Chinese government as represented by Lu believes itself entitled to bark orders at the United States indicates that there still is far to go.
We should be frank, open-handed, and generous in our relations with Beijing — for our own good, for the good of the Chinese people, and for the good of the world. But the spirit of generosity is distinct from the spirit of acquiescence, and the United States is not obliged to defer to Beijing in the matter of Taiwan or in any other matter, especially those involving American relations with the free and self-governing peoples of the world."

California senator and Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris is set to announce Tuesday a proposal that would require the Justice Department to approve new state laws restricting abortion before they could be implemented.
Harris’s proposal would require states and localities with a history of attempting to crack down on abortion access to obtain approval from the Justice Department before enacting laws restricting the procedure. Under the plan, the DOJ would determine if a restriction was consistent with Roe vs. Wade before it could take effect.
“Extreme politicians in state legislatures have been working to systematically chip away at Roe for decades,” Harris’s campaign said in a news release . “This will shift the burden to jurisdictions with a pattern of violating Roe to prove any new law or practice does not deny or abridge the fundamental right to access abortion.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

Recently, several states have passed what the Harris campaign called “dangerous and deadly laws” severely restricting abortion, often barring the procedure after about six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected but before most mothers know they are pregnant. An Alabama law passed earlier this month prohibits abortions at any point except in cases where the mother’s life is at stake."
Michael Wolff Claim: Mueller Team Wrote Draft Obstruction Indictment against Trump | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/michael-wolff-claim-mueller-team-draft-indictment-obstruction-trump/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 28, 2019 5:18 PM Author Michael Wolff appears on NBC’s Today show to promote his book Fire and Fury in 2018. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
As discussed on today’s Three Martini Lunch podcast , let’s walk through the sequence of events that notorious author Michael Wolff — last seen being mocked as a fabulist on S aturday Night Live — expects readers to believe .
In his new book, Wolff writes that the office of special counsel Robert Mueller “drew up a three-count outline of the president’s alleged abuses, under the title ‘United States of America against Donald J Trump, Defendant.’ The document sat on the special counsel’s desk, Wolff writes, for almost a year.” Wolff claims that the document charged the president with obstructing a federal investigation, tampering with a witness, and retaliating against a witness. Wolff also claims that Mueller’s office prepared a draft memorandum of law opposing an anticipated motion to dismiss. Advertisement Advertisement
It would be remarkable for the revelation of those charges – what Wolff describes as a “draft indictment” — to not leak at all for an entire year, but Mueller reportedly ran a tight ship, so let’s assume that’s possible for the sake of argument.
Wolff writes that after his team completed all of that work, Mueller chose to simply not pursue the charges. He also apparently did not mention the preparation of these charges in his report, and no one on Mueller’s team leaked anything about those prepared charges, either when Attorney General Barr summarized the report, upon the report’s release to the public, or in the weeks since.
But the part that really strains credulity is that in Wolff’s version of events, “sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel,” who have the documents detailing the draft indictment, suddenly are holding the political equivalent of a bundle of dynamite. They have an opportunity to go to any journalist in the world with a scoop that would shake the administration to its foundations. Washington is crawling with well-established, trusted reporters who have been reporting on this story for the better part of two years. Advertisement Advertisement
And those sources chose not to go to the Wall Street Journal , or New York Times , or Washington Post , but instead give it to . . . Michael Wolff. The guy with longstanding questions about the reliability of his reporting . The guy who famously claimed Donald Trump and Nikki Haley were having an affair and then backed away from the claim once confronted about it. The guy who pretends his earpiece isn’t working when he gets tough questions .
And these “sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel” chose to give this mega-scoop to Wolff, so he can sell more books. Advertisement "
Suicide Prevention & Terminal Illness -- Pushing Suicide as Merely a Choice | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pushing-suicide-as-merely-a-choice/,"May 28, 2019 3:08 PM (Pixabay)
The focus on suicide prevention continues to erode . In Ozy — which bills itself as being about “ fresh stories and bold ideas ” — self-described “ reporter ” Molly Fosco applauds that suicidal depression is increasingly being looked upon as a “ terminal illness, ” and hence, opines that we should view the suicides of the deeply depressed as a normal part of dealing with the disease process. From, “ Suicidal Tendencies Should be Treated Like a Terminal Disease ” :
If a family member has a terminal illness and decides to stop treatment to end their suffering, we’re far more likely to understand. Sure, it might be upsetting that they don’t want to keep “fighting,” but ultimately, we agree that ending their suffering is more important.
We should think of suicide the same way.
This is the concept of “ rational suicide ” — a minority view in the mental health professions–that claims a psychiatrist/psychologist/social worker should “permit” or validate suicides they believe are “rational,” and only unequivocally oppose those they deem “irrational. ” Talk about an abandonment of the anguished person by the one person who might be able to make the difference between life and death!
Alas, some in the suicide prevention community apparently want us to look upon suicide in a non-judgmental way:
Cerel thinks the culture around suicide in the U.S. is starting to shift. For example, the American Psychological Association no longer uses the word “commit” when referring to suicide. Instead, “died by suicide” is now used. “‘Committed’ really connotes that someone committed a crime or committed a sin,” Cerel says. “It’s very pejorative.”
Ponder this: If someone stays alive because suicide is seen widely as wrong, isn’t that a good thing? Doesn’t the impact of such “peer pressure ” save lives? Why in the world would we want to remove an important impediment to committing suicide? (Yes, I will continue to use that term because I want people to live.)
Of course, Fosco is all on board with the word engineering that will open the door to more suicides:
And that’s the thing. We shouldn’t look at those who die by suicide as bad, selfish or sinful. Of course, it’s devastating to lose someone you love, and it’s normal to be angry. But we need to try harder to put ourselves in their shoes. If every day is unbearable and death is the only way to relieve the pain, perhaps we shouldn’t think of suicide as a choice.
“I think more people are realizing that those who are suicidal aren’t making a choice to end their lives,” [Dr. Julie] Cerel [president of the American Association of Suicidology] says. “They’re trying to get out of completely intolerable circumstances.”
“Bad, selfish, sinful, ” what have you, isn’t the point behind disfavoring all suicides. Saving lives is the point! Advertisement
Moreover, Cerel makes the exact argument that Compassion and Choices (formerly, the Hemlock Society) makes about why doctor-assisted suicide of the terminally ill should not be considered suicide , and instead be known by the gooey euphemism,“aid in dying. ” The purpose is to normalize self-killing . If this deflection succeeds — and expands, as this article promotes — pretty soon we will do away with the accurate term “suicide ” altogether so that no one feels negatively about a self-killing. It’s all just “choice, ” don’t you know. Advertisement Advertisement
Not surprisingly, the American Association of Suicidology has opined that the terminally ill asking for assisted suicide should not receive suicide prevention. Cerel’s statement just furthers the organization’s betrayal of suicidal people.
Fosco gives lip service to suicide prevention. But that’s all it is. Approving some suicides — as she clearly does — is akin to telling a smoker to use filtered cigarettes instead of quitting, making self-harm more, rather than less, likely. Advertisement "
HBO's Chernobyl: Historical Drama Conservatives Should Watch | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/conservatives-ought-to-watch-hbos-chernobyl/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 29, 2019 10:00 AM An employee walks through a pump room of the stopped third reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Chernobyl, Ukraine, April 20, 2018. (Gleb Garanich/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: HBO shocks us all by offering us one of the greatest television miniseries of all time — and one that conservatives should be giving a standing ovation; the mainstream media’s biggest institutions flunk their latest test in the form of author Michael Wolff; and the Democrats finally begin laying out criteria to separate the real presidential candidates form the aspiring celebrities. The Triumph of HBO’s Chernobyl How often do conservatives get to celebrate an offering from HBO with full-throated rousing cheers and applause? HBO’s miniseries Chernobyl is every bit as good as you’ve heard. The show is not fun to watch, unless you take a certain grim satisfaction in watching Soviet Union officials squirm in their seats, so terrified of the consequences of telling the truth that they assent to brazen lies that will lead to the painful deaths of hundreds and perhaps thousands of their countrymen. The Soviets experienced the biggest and most catastrophic nuclear disaster in human history and their first (and second, and third, and fourth) instinct was to not tell anyone and hope no one noticed. Almost everyone in the Soviet system comes across as callous, shrugging off the painful deaths of good men and women as simply a requirement of ensuring the state’s good reputation. Mikhail Gorbachev appears in a few scenes, alternating between deer-in-the-headlights terror and grumpy irritability that he has to deal with it all. Chernobyl is that rare docudrama that is simultaneously a horror movie, and it’s way more terrifying than most offerings in the horror genre because it’s all true (or as accurate as the brilliant creator-writer Craig Mazin could determine, given contrasting historical accounts). The radiation is one of the monsters bedeviling the characters on screen. The other monster is the Soviet bureaucracy, full of blind denial, insane priorities, moral cowardice, and a depraved indifference to human life. And according to those who lived through the era, the attention to detail in portraying mid-1980s Soviet life is amazing . The nearly all-British cast, and their use of their native accents, initially threw me. The series has everyone speak English, but radio broadcasts, emergency telephone-call recordings, the TV news, are in Russian, and I don’t know if the mix works as well as the creators intended. But if the first half-hour of the first episode doesn’t engross you, stick with it. The explosion is deliberately underplayed. Towards the end of the first episode, one of the managers of the plant insists the radiation levels are not dangerous, then mid-sentence becomes overcome with sickness and vomits right onto the table in front of local officials. But the episode really picks up near its close when an old apparatchik speaks up at the local government’s emergency meeting. This is the moment when we would expect a sagacious old man, veteran of the wars and wise with experience in matters of life and death, to offer the confused and frightened local officials guidance and perspective they desperately need. Instead, the old man declares that as good Communists, they have a duty to not evacuate or even inform the residents of Pripyat that they should stay indoors; that scaremongering would only distract the people from their duties to the state. The room bursts into applause. All of us watching at home know that everyone in that room just simultaneously committed mass murder and collective suicide. They’re doomed — and the system they serve was perhaps always doomed. Chernobyl is an epic five-part comprehensive denunciation of the Soviet Union, and with it the intrinsic systemic dishonesty that was required to keep the Communist system in power. But it’s worth keeping in mind that shameless dishonesty in order to avoid embarrassment is a human trait, not just a Socialist one. In almost any governmental system on earth, those running the system can blur their sense of their personal interest and the national interest. A bad leader will prioritize his image above all else and see every issue through that lens. A bad leader will deny the seriousness of threats because speaking honestly about an emerging danger would require admitting being wrong earlier. A bad leader will insist that a failing solution is really working. When challenged, those types of leaders focus on finding scapegoats instead of solutions. This approach to leadership is also futile; the Soviet government’s obsession about not being humiliated led to one of its greatest humiliations. The Media Chooses to Learn Nothing from the Michael Wolff Debacle Yesterday, after examining one particularly implausible claim in Michael Wolff’s new book, I wrote , “the mainstream media’s treatment of Wolff’s new book will be a good indicator of whether those institutions that once touted Fire and Fury learned anything from experience.” We have our answer: Not much. Axios runs an excerpt about the Kavanaugh fight , depicting Trump lamenting that not enough Protestants are on the court. Are Wolff’s sources reliable? Does Axios trust that they exist? Eh, as Fred Armisen said in his impression of Wolff on Saturday Night Live , “You read it, right? And you liked it? You had fun? Then what’s the problem? You got the gist, so shut up. Even the stuff that’s not true, it’s true.” NPR acknowledges the author’s serious credibility issues, but concludes, “If nothing else, Wolff has performed a kind of service in Siege by taking us back over this rocky ground and reminding us what a long strange trip it has already been.” You will never see a kinder assessment of unreliable reporting. The New York Times writes a review and an article about the book. The Atlantic writes about the book with more skepticism , but still repeats some of Wolff’s biggest claims, and mostly laments that White House tell-all books haven’t damaged Trump’s reputation much. Newsweek eagerly repeats the book quoting Steve Bannon, predicting Trump’s downfall. This is an embarrassing display of credulity towards a man who falsely claimed Trump and Nicki Haley were having an affair. It appears that if a story makes Trump look bad enough, no one needs to check it out. The Democrats Prepare Steps to Pare down their Field of 24 Candidates "

The legislation was a mixed bag — including an ineffectual assault-weapons ban and billions for supposed prevention — representing the blunderbuss approach typical of sweeping bipartisan federal legislation.

Rather than the foundational act of the American penal state, it is best viewed as part of a much larger, long-running effort to strengthen the criminal-justice system that helped drive down crime."
Facebook: Public-Utility Model a Bad Idea | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/declaring-facebook-a-utility-wouldnt-assuage-users-concerns/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter May 29, 2019 1:33 PM Facebook’s founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 24, 2018. (Charles Platiau/Reuters) It could, however, ruin the things users like about the platform.
T oward the end of his new book, The Shadow War: Inside Russia’s and China’s Secret Operations to Defeat America , CNN national-security correspondent Jim Sciutto addresses the disinformation and propaganda that Russian intelligence’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) spread on Facebook and other social-media networks during the 2016 election and afterward. Sciutto offers a lengthy series of quotes about the problem from Michael Hayden, the four-star Air Force general who is the only man to serve as director of both the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency — and, like Sciutto, an employee of CNN.
“Facebook’s business model requires you to stay. The business model – profit – is based on clicks. It’s based on time on target,” Hayden said. “The longer you stay, the more the algorithm drives you to like-minded people because, scientifically, the algorithm knows you stay longer because you’re being reinforced.”
“You can complain about Zuckerberg posting fake news. You can complain should be under the same rules for political advertisement as you are [presumably a reference to CNN and television], but it’s worse than that,’ he continued. “It’s the very business model that drives us deeper into the darker corners of our own ghettos. It actually is built to divide us as a nation.”
“That business, that algorithm, sucks,” said Hayden, remarkable words to hear from the former director of the CIA.
His solution? Declare Facebook a utility and allow the government to regulate the social media network by mandating changes to its algorithm and business model.
Hayden is not alone. In 2017, Steve Bannon argued that Facebook should be regulated like a utility because the company, along with Google, had become “effectively a necessity in contemporary life.” At The Nation , Bruce Shapiro called for regulating Facebook as a utility, while recognizing that “the root of the problem isn’t Facebook. It is about ideas and about politics: the mindless corporate libertarianism that dominates this company and the entire tech industry.” Over at LawFareBlog , Peter Squire offered a serious-minded assessment of the pros and cons of a utility scheme. Advertisement
It’s easy to understand the frustration with Facebook over the Russian disinformation that infected its pages during the 2016 election and the power afforded by the proprietary algorithm that determines what posts appear on what user pages. Facebook’s description of the algorithm and what it prioritizes is vague and contradictory. In January 2018, Facebook publicly declared that it would prioritize “posts that generate conversation between people” in user’s News Feeds. But it also warned that “using ‘engagement-bait’ to goad people into commenting on posts is not a meaningful interaction, and we will continue to demote these posts in News Feed.” “Engagement-bait” was defined as efforts to “goad users into interacting with likes, shares, comments, and other actions.” Advertisement
What is depressingly clear is that the more provocative, incendiary, and controversial the post, the more likely it is to “generate conversation between people,” and the more likely it is to be boosted on the news feed, being shared with more users. But this is also a reflection of long-established audience tastes — the old journalistic adage “if it bleeds, it leads,” applied to our brave new journalistic world. Advertisement
Hayden’s point that “the business model – profit – is based on clicks” applies to every news and media site, including CNN and NRO. Every website wants to attract the largest audience it can, and there’s nothing inherently sinister, cynical, or corrupt about that motivation.
The algorithm may “suck” as Hayden puts it, but users probably wouldn’t like an algorithm that prioritized posts unlikely to “generate conversation between people.” (“Your friends are not talking about the following stories; you may find them worth not talking about as well!”) Beyond the algorithm, Facebook also has humans whose job is to try to find news of interest to users, but this simply replaces a technological problem with a human-judgment problem. Facebook news curators told Gizmodo in 2016 that they routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network’s influential “trending” news section, and in February a Facebook contractor talked to Project Veritas about efforts to “de-boost” particular pages.

Every cry to treat Facebook like a utility is a vote of no confidence in how Zuckerberg and the company’s leadership have handled the issues of fairness, accuracy, and openness so far. But declaring a particular social-media platform — even a hugely popular one such as Facebook — a utility creates confusion about just what it is . Entities that are currently regulated as utilities are actual utilities : They deliver services that you as a consumer literally can’t find anywhere else: your electricity, water, sewage, natural gas. Your utility companies, often in partnership with government, built and maintain the physical infrastructure that allows these services to reach your home. Because they are the only game in town, so to speak, the government is obligated to regulate their pricing, their delivery of services, and the safety and efficiency of their infrastructure. Advertisement
Facebook has little physical infrastructure; it didn’t build special Facebook wires connecting your home, laptop, or phone to the rest of its network. More to the point, consumers have the option of not using Facebook and using other social networks. It is fair to ask, as Senator Lindsey Graham asked Mark Zuckerberg, which companies represent Facebook’s competitors if it’s not a monopoly. Zuckerberg answered that “the average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people ranging from text to email.”
That answer isn’t completely satisfying. No other social network is quite like Facebook’s, with its combination of your friend’s vacation pictures, your high-school classmate announcing that he’s experiencing a power outage, the “memories” of the cookout that got rained out two years ago, your cousin’s videos of her cat, and your grandmother sharing memes. But yearning for a competitor to challenge Facebook means yearning for a less-useful Facebook. The breadth of Facebook’s reach is what makes it valuable to users — it’s often your best bet for connecting with that old college buddy, that long-lost childhood friend, or that black-sheep relative. If there were two separate and disconnected Facebook-like companies providing the same kind of service, then people would be annoyed, trying to stay in touch with the friends who were only on Facebook A and the ones who were on Facebook B. The whole point of the social network is to be able to connect with lots of those you know and want to know. You could say that much like Soylent Green, Facebook is made of people. Advertisement
If breaking up Facebook’s existing networks is undesirable, then, can its business structure be broken up? Earlier this year, Elizabeth Warren proposed that Facebook — along with Google and Amazon — should be declared a “platform utility.” Under her plan, “companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as ‘platform utilities.’” These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Advertisement Advertisement
Warren would require Facebook to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram; she contends this move would put more pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including those concerning privacy. But asked to list Facebook’s faults, few users would list ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram near the top. The best way to get Facebook to be more responsive to user concerns about privacy is for users to be loud about their concerns or to turn away from the product, not to make the product less attractive by forcing the company to sell off other its most popular apps.
(It’s also worth noting that Warren’s vision would bar these big companies from branching out into new industries, even when producers and consumers were pretty happy with the options such forays afforded them. For example, Amazon would be prohibited from simultaneously being an online bookseller and also owning a book publisher.) Advertisement "
Missouri & Abortion: Planned Parenthood Clinic Could Lose License | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alexandra Desanctis,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/last-abortion-clinic-in-missouri-likely-to-close/,"Follow Alexandra DeSanctis on Twitter May 29, 2019 12:51 PM A Missouri State flag waves outside of Planned Parenthood St. Louis Region, Missouri’s sole abortion clinic, in St. Louis, Mo., May 28, 2019. (Lawrence Bryant/Reuters)
Last fall, Planned Parenthood stopped performing abortion procedures at its clinic in Columbia, Mo., after its license expired and the affiliate had no physicians with admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, a violation of state law. That left Planned Parenthood with only one location providing abortions in the state, a facility in St. Louis. Advertisement Advertisement
Now, Missouri is likely to become the first state since 1974 without an abortion clinic, as Planned Parenthood’s last remaining location risks losing its license for failing to comply with an audit to determine whether it is in compliance with state abortion regulations.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services informed the abortion provider earlier this month that it was in violation of three policies, threatening its license renewal. Planned Parenthood agreed to adjust its practices to comply with state requirements related to mandatory abortion counseling and pelvic exams for women seeking an abortion.
But Missouri officials also notified Planned Parenthood that the state needs to conduct interviews with seven physicians who work at the St. Louis location, and several of those doctors declined to be interviewed. Planned Parenthood told CBS News that it will not allow the state to interview physicians who are not Planned Parenthood employees, so the situation is at an impasse. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
On Tuesday, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit to try and prevent the Missouri government from denying the license renewal, and arguments are scheduled for this afternoon. If the abortion group loses, it will no longer be able to perform abortion procedures at its St. Louis facility beginning June 1. Advertisement Advertisement
Should that happen, it would be the fifth abortion clinic in Missouri since 2008 to cease performing abortions. In 2017, then-governor Eric Greitens, a Republican, signed a bill enforcing stricter regulation of abortion clinics, seeking to create safeguards to protect the health and safety of women obtaining abortions.

Washington Post Calls out Planned Parenthood on Illegal Abortion Deaths | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/washington-post-calls-out-planned-parenthood-whopper-on-illegal-abortion-deaths/,"May 29, 2019 12:14 PM (File photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
Leana Wen, the head of Planned Parenthood, has been repeating the old claim that thousands of women died from illegal abortions every year before Roe v. Wade . Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler takes a chainsaw to that claim. The evidence he mentions has long been available — to repeat a point that Cecil Adams made for “ The Straight Dope ” back in 2004 — but variants of the false claim are persistent and it’s gratifying to see the Post dispel the myths. Kessler notes two data points worth mentioning: “ The CDC began collecting data on abortion mortality in 1972 , the year before Roe was decided. In 1972, the number of deaths in the United States from legal abortions was 24 and from illegal abortions 39, according to the CDC . ” That could, of course, have been an undercount, but it gives you a sense of the scale — and Wen’s estimate is wildly off.

Catholic Church Sex Abuse Scandal: Seal of Confessional Must Remain | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Declan Leary,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/california-cant-win-its-confession-fight/,"May 29, 2019 1:51 PM (Nikola Solic/Reuters) John of Nepomuk is a name not often heard these days; Wenceslaus IV, even more so. John was a Bohemian priest of the 14th century. As the story goes, he was the confessor to the queen, Wenceslaus’s wife. When John refused to reveal information divulged to him during the sacrament of confession, the king had him drowned in the river Vltava. John considered his religious obligation — the seal of the confessional, an absolute duty of confidentiality between priest and penitent — inviolable, no matter the objections of the secular authority or the punishments threatened. Nearly 600 years later, at the height of the Cristero War in Mexico — a Catholic uprising against a militant secularist state — another priest, Mateo Correa Magallanes, was arrested while delivering communion to a woman who was unable to travel to Mass. At his captors’ request, Father Magallanes heard the confessions of a number of other prisoners. When General Eulogio Ortiz, commander of the unit that was holding him, demanded that Magallanes reveal what had been told to him in confession, the priest refused. He was shot the next morning. The seal of the confessional is an ancient tradition of the Catholic Church. Father Pius Pietrzyk, O.P., a lawyer of both U.S. and canon law, has outlined the nature of the seal and the importance of protecting it. It has been enshrined in the law of the Church at least since the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and in practice is even older than that — as old, in fact, as the sacrament itself. For about as long as the sacrament and its seal have existed, there has been a history of secular authorities demanding its violation. To my knowledge, none has ever succeeded. Nevertheless, they persist. Last week, the California senate passed S.B. 360, requiring priests to violate the seal of the confessional whenever the confession pertains to sexual abuse committed by another priest or employee of the Church. The motivation is understandable — the protection of children is of paramount concern, and an area where the Church has notoriously failed time and time again. But the proposal is, for one thing, unlikely to do any good to this end, even if priests comply; responding to the passage of similar laws in Australia, the Australian Conference of Catholic Bishops observed that “perpetrators of this terrible sin very rarely seek out confession, and if mandatory reporting of confessions were required, they would certainly not confess.” This is not a practical solution to the very real problem at hand. It is a blatant attempt to assert the authority of the secular state over the Church, and a clear violation of the right to religious liberty. History gives us a pretty good idea of where priests will fall if California forces them to choose between civil and religious obligations. The state, together with the Church, should absolutely pursue comprehensive reforms toward the elimination of abuse. But it needs to find paths that don’t demand that priests betray a sacred duty in deference to a power they will always view as lower. If California continues down this road, it will only make more martyrs of priests, and a villain of itself. "
Human Genetic Engineering: Don't Let Biotech Profiteers Take Control | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/human-genetic-engineering-biotech-sector-profiteers/,"May 29, 2019 5:44 PM (Pixabay)
Early in the 1932 classic, Brave New World , Aldous Huxley conjures a future in which embryos are created through a mass IVF-type process, genetically engineered to possess desired traits, artificially gestated, after which, the babies are “ decanted ” at a “ hatchery. ” The point of the enterprise, readers learn early-on, is to guarantee social stability and prevent any challenge to the ruling order. Advertisement Advertisement
Huxley wrote the book as a dire warning. But we aren’t paying heed. In our own impending brave new world, profit is the accelerant driving the dehumanization of procreation. “ Big Fertility ” (a term popularized by my friend Jennifer Lahl, head of the Center for Bioethics and Culture) already makes billions creating masses of embryos via increasingly sophisticated IVF techniques — complete with quality control, including rudimentary eugenics applications — and sometimes deploying surrogate mothers (dehumanized in industry parlance as “ gestational carriers ” ) to birth the babies for those who can’t or don’t wish to do it themselves. That isn’t “ decanting, ” but it sure is a giant step in that direction.
We may now be on the verge of adding germline engineering to the menu of available reproductive services, that will, for a price, offer to edit “ desired ” genetic characteristics into embryos — both health-related and enhancements — that will pass down the generations. Indeed, the first germline altered babies were born in China six months ago — setting off a firestorm of controversy (now well banked because much of it was faux) but still landing the scientist who performed the procedure, He Jiankui, in prison (as if Chinese authorities didn’t know what he was up to all along). Advertisement
As some in the science community expressed outrage at JK (as he is known) — not, in my opinion, over what was done, but when — a business director of a Dubai fertility clinic emailed the scientist to congratulate the genetic engineer for the “ achievement of the first gene-edited baby delivered by your technique. ” The email then got the real point of the communication: The clinic wanted to send its embryologist to China to learn the technique so genetic engineering could added to its menu of available services. (JK shared the email with Stanford bioethicist William Hurlbut — who disclosed it publicly at a recent biotechnology symposium.)
The alacrity with which the Dubai clinic reacted to the birth of a genetically engineered baby –before its safety has been determined, much less its moral propriety fully explored — illustrates that greed and profit will be the accelerant that drives genetic engineering into widespread deployment. It will, that is, unless stringent and legally enforceable regulations prevent the biotech wildcatters from taking control. Advertisement Advertisement
But that isn’t happening. There has been a lot of talk, but no effective action. Early calls for an international moratorium have not been agreed to. Indeed, some in the biotech and science communities resist any regulatory actions that would take parameters of the research out the hands of scientists. Never mind that these experts could have financial and professional conflicts of interest in determining how to proceed. In this ideological view, only scientists can determine what is ethical in science.
Meanwhile, Democrats are trying to repeal a relatively weak impediment (akin to the Hyde Amendment) first enacted in 2016 that prevents the FDA from approving a clinical application “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
No! This technology is too powerful and its potential impact too encompassing to leave to the biotech sector and others with a vested interest. By their inaction in cooperating with the promulgation of binding international laws, by their refusal or inability to enact and enforce a meaningful moratorium on genetically engineering human gametes and embryos, “ the scientists “” and their business partners have already proved they can’t be trusted to exercise the required self-restraint.

European Elections -- The Real Winners Are the Greens | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Iain Murray,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-real-winners-of-the-european-elections-the-greens/,"Follow Iain Murray on Twitter May 29, 2019 5:04 PM Members of the European Greens party Gabor Vago and Bas Eickhout campaign for the European Elections in Budapest, Hungary, May 3, 2019. (Gabor Banko/LMP/Handout via Reuters)
Now that the dust has settled following last week’s European elections, it appears the real winners were the Western European Greens. Yes, populist firebrands Nigel Farage and Matteo Salvini redrew the political maps of the United Kingdom and Italy, respectively, and Eastern Europe stubbornly insists on going in its own direction, but in most of Western and Northern Europe, a political realignment now under way is shaking up the left as much as the right — and the Greens stand to benefit the most. Advertisement Advertisement
The contours of this political realignment are well described by Dr. Stephen Davies of the Institute of Economic Affairs in this Cato Unbound discussion. As he points out, the primary dividing point is the politics is identity — nationalism versus globalism. To date, new nationalist voices have gained the most attention. As Davis notes, many of these nationalists favor collectivist economic policies — a strong welfare state (for nationals only), protectionist trade barriers, and antitrust action against large multinationals — and reject the free-market ideas that conservative parties have adhered to for the past 40 or so years.
Yet, less appreciated has been the direction of the left. As I argued in my 2008 book, The Really Inconvenient Truths , environmentalism has replaced social-justice Christianity as the driving force of the Western left. And, with the emergence of globalism, an ideology based around tackling global problems such as climate change has accordingly risen to prominence. Rather than socialists coopting environmentalism, the reverse has started to happen. The Green Parties of Europe are in the process of overtaking the Social Democrats and hard-left parties alike. Advertisement
Britain provides a great example. The Labour Party, currently hard-left under its leader Jeremy Corbyn, is being squeezed in both its heartlands from different directions. In the urban northeast of England, which has reliably voted Labour since the party’s founding, voters deserted en masse to the nationalist Brexit Party. In the south, with a more highly educated and cosmopolitan population, a substantial number of Labor voters went for the Greens this time, and many said they did so because of policies other than Brexit. While most say they will return to the Labour Party at the next general election, Labour will face continual pressure from the Greens going forward. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
In Germany and France, the process is further along. The Greens came in second in Germany, comfortably beating the Social Democrats, and topping the poll among people 24 and younger by some way. In France, Les Verts came third behind the nationalists and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrists. The Greens comfortably beat France’s traditional Socialist party, which controlled the presidency only recently. Advertisement Advertisement
Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian co-convener of the Green group in the European Parliament, told journalists, “We can see that with an uptick in nationalism and populism, that to forge a stable European union the Greens are going to be indispensable.” As the realignment takes hold, the battle lines will probably see the Greens in the vanguard against the nationalist parties.

"Eugenics, Abortion, and Adam Cohen’s Empty Criticism of Justice Thomas | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/eugenics-abortion-and-adam-cohens-empty-criticism-of-justice-thomas/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter May 29, 2019 4:45 PM
In his 20-page concurring opinion yesterday in Box v. Planned Parenthood , Justice Thomas argued that Indiana’s law barring abortions sought solely because of the child’s race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, or non-lethal disabilities “promote[s] a State’s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.” Thomas traced the ugly history of eugenics in this country and documented the enthusiasm of some eugenicists for legalizing abortion. He also argued that “abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.” In support of that argument, he cited the very high rate of abortion of children diagnosed with Down syndrome, the widespread practice of sex-selective abortions in Asia, and the “considerable racial disparity” between abortion rates among blacks and whites in this country.

On the Atlantic’s website, Adam Cohen, author of the book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck , has an essay purporting to criticize Justice Thomas’s use of his book. But Cohen’s essay is just another in the sorry genre of “you properly cited my work in the course of an argument I don’t agree with.” It turns out that it is Cohen, not Thomas, who fails to fairly present the work of the other.
Cohen’s title and subtitle set forth three propositions, none of which his essay supports: “Clarence Thomas Knows Nothing of My Work: The justice used my book to tie abortion to eugenics. But his rendition of the history is incorrect.” Advertisement
By my count, Thomas cites Cohen’s book for a dozen or so propositions, none of which “tie abortion to eugenics”: for the coinage of the term eugenics ; for the role that inheritance plays in eugenic understanding of abilities; for the foundation of eugenics in social Darwinism; for the “‘intellectual craze’” that eugenics had become in the 1920s, “particularly among progressives, professionals, and intellectual elites”; for the “prominent positions” that eugenicists held in major universities; for the role of eugenic arguments in support of the Immigration Act of 1924; for the supposed qualities of dysgenic individuals; and for the marriage bars and forced-sterilization laws adopted by states.
Cohen does not take issue with any of Thomas’s actual citations of his book. Advertisement
Cohen instead contends that Thomas “relied on a kind of historical guilt-by-association,” supposedly “suggest[ing]” that “abortion is inseparable from America’s history of eugenics. He further contends that Thomas “cited real history that is not particularly relevant to abortion.” Advertisement
But Cohen badly misrepresents the history that Thomas provides. By Thomas’s account, “Many eugenicists … supported legalizing abortion” in order to prevent “unfit” people “from being born in the first place,” and “abortion advocates—including future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher—endorsed the use of abortion for eugenic reasons.” (Slip op. at 3.) He documents that some eugenicists “were enthusiastic” about the possibility of using abortion as a method of eugenics and “believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics.” (Slip op. at 13; see id. at 13-15.) Cohen does not even acknowledge, much less dispute, this history in Thomas’s opinion. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The only point on which Cohen actually disagrees with Thomas is semantic: over whether voluntary abortion has the potential to become (in Thomas’s words) “a tool of eugenic manipulation.” As Cohen puts it, a woman “who has an abortion because the child will be born with a severe disability is not acting eugenically—she is not trying to uplift the human race.” Advertisement
Cohen’s semantic objection is worthy of consideration. But that consideration ought to include Thomas’s weighty evidence (e.g., Down syndrome abortions) that individual abortion decisions can collectively have a eugenic impact—that they can “be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.” But Cohen doesn’t even inform his readers of Thomas’s evidence or of what he is actually arguing. Further, there is plenty of room to interpose here the usual progressive concern about whether such individual decisions are subject to subtle biases and coercion. (Yes, there is a flipping of the usual left-right valence here. In the context, say, of the racial composition of schools, those on the left typically refer to racially imbalanced schools as segregated even when the racial imbalance results from voluntary choices of parents, and those on the right typically reject that label.)

In sum, Justice Thomas made proper use of Cohen’s book, but Cohen failed to present his readers an accurate account of Thomas’s opinion. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Declining Birthrates and the Role of Government Subsidies of Families | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/declining-birthrates-government-subsidies-wall-street-journal/,"Follow Ramesh Ponnuru on Twitter May 29, 2019 6:45 PM
The editors of the Wall Street Journal take note of declining birthrates and warn conservatives not to attempt to reverse them by subsidizing families. Broad cultural trends, they say, are unlikely to be reversed by government policies. Our focus should be on removing government-created obstacles to affordable family formation.
I agree both that we should be humble about the power of policy changes to affect these trends and that we should have a strong preference for obstacle removal to subsidy expansion. Advertisement Advertisement
But there are three considerations that, I think, tell against their pessimism about the possibility that government policy toward families can be improved in ways that will make a difference. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
First, the Journal has an unjustifiably broad definition of what counts as a subsidy. Cutting taxes on families through the child tax credit, for example, is properly understood as a step closer to governmental neutrality toward families rather than as a subsidy. Allowing people to take some of their Social Security benefits when they have children rather than when they retire is better seen as an increase in flexibility in an existing government program than as an expansion of government.

The Washington Post joins a host of media outlets this morning in contending that Mitch McConnell has “reversed” his position on considering Supreme Court appointments in presidential election years. McConnell said last night that he would “ fill ” any Supreme Court vacancy that arose next year. This, apparently, is “ hypocritical ” given his refusal to acquiesce to the nomination of Merrick Garland back in 2016. Advertisement Advertisement
Trouble is, McConnell has not actually reversed his position, which was not that Supreme Court vacancies should always be left open in presidential election years, but that vacancies should be left open in presidential election years when the president is of a different party than the majority in Senate. McConnell also argued that his position was justified because Obama was a “lame duck.” "

We need your help. Some of our critics object to National Review ’s recent blast against what we see as resurgent socialism. Hasn’t this dragon been slain? Aren’t you fighting the old fights?
No. (And we hope you will help us to continue the endless struggle by making a donation .)
The vanguard of intellectuals and elected officials who call themselves socialists is still small. But polls show majorities of young people embracing this discredited governing philosophy. And most troubling of all is that we see a quintessentially socialist spirit rising in the hearts of men and women, one that would impose political doctrines on every institution of common life, every corporate board, every HR meeting, every parent–teacher conference, every church, and every home. Advertisement Advertisement
Socialist societies strangle and eventually kill the institutions of civil society, by co-opting them all to the same political goal of “building socialism together.” So in socialist countries, not just the press but the print shop, the priesthood, and even the local fence painters are dragooned into projects that do not interest them, or are hateful to them. Or all these institutions are simply corrupted from the political pressure put on them.
This is usually an advanced symptom of socialist societies, and yet we see it happening today in America and many other countries of the free West. Children’s books that fail the purity tests of the Left are now pulped and destroyed before publication. Movie studios now quake in fear, not from a government censor, but from the unofficial censors that operate across media and academia; an emerging government in fact, if not yet in law. The whole culture of political debate and dispute is subjected to a conformist spirit. If you don’t say the magic words, suddenly an online mob will command major corporations to boycott you, to deplatform you, to make it as if you no longer existed. Advertisement
We see how this perverted instinct cares little about dismantling the power of Google and Facebook, and not at all about redistributing their wealth, because socialism never was about equality, but about power and subjection. Our modern socialists see these behemoths as tools that can be used to build socialism together. Digital technologies and publishing disruption have destroyed most of our local newspapers. These companies have essentially brought the public square under their own control. And this culture is bidding them to censor voices like ours, and yours. Advertisement
NR stands athwart this malign spirit of censorship. And you must do so as well. We have to be strong. It is in the storm that a ship’s crew comes together, doing their various jobs and proving themselves. You have a role to play in these stormy times.
Our readers are as much a part of the institution of National Review as the writers, the editors, and the business team. William F.

Government Protectionism Is Harming the Economy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Will,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/protectionism-crony-capitalism-harming-economy/,"May 30, 2019 6:30 AM A combine harvester in a wheat field in Dixon, Ill., in 2013. (Jim Young/Reuters) Today’s system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls.
T he cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called “iatrogenic government.” In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government — except the damage it currently is doing is not inadvertent — was on display last week. Advertisement
The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds — predictable and predicted — from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration’s tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the Treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.
The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year) and the $28 billion probably will not be the government’s final restitution, using other people’s money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration’s tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers. Advertisement
President Trump, who deserves Winston Churchill’s description of U.S. secretary of state John Foster Dulles (a “bull . . .who carries his china closet with him”), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S. farmers (“@POTUS loves his farmers”) and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?
In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Obama’s chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have “serious market implications” in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations. Advertisement Advertisement
The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation’s economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods — e.g., China is one of Boeing’s biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in America.
Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in the Wall Street Journal , has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the U.S. purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. “China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world.”
The New York Times recently reported that Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is “encouraging [U.S.] firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere” — meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors. Advertisement Advertisement
Today’s system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average — but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, the New York Times reports, “manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs.” The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 American manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of over $817,000 a job."
Silicon Valley Companies Take on Role of Censors | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michael Brendan Dougherty,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/silicon-valley-social-media-companies-censors/,"Follow Michael Brendan Dougherty on Twitter May 30, 2019 6:30 AM Attendees walk past a Facebook logo at the company’s developers conference in San Jose, Calif., April 30, 2019. (Stephen Lam/Reuters) Left-wing activists aren’t going to stop with social-media networks, or with nibbling at the soft right-wing fringe of discourse.
S ilicon Valley’s behemoth companies are incapable of steering through the cross-pressures pushing them to censor more. These pressures come from social activists working on them through threatened boycotts, it comes from activists among their own employees and on their boards. These pressures come from centrist and liberal-leaning governments, which increasingly blame social media companies for their electoral failures. And surely these pressures also come from corporations who want to buy advertising on these massive platforms.
Several stories from the last week highlight the sheer variety of these pressures. The health-and-exercise movement Crossfit has recently seen one of its diet-discussion groups suppressed on Facebook. And the group subsequently urged the withdrawal of its members from the platform in stark terms, effectively alleging that Facebook is part of a larger corruptive force in social life:
Facebook is acting in the service of food and beverage industry interests by deleting the accounts of communities that have identified the corrupted nutritional science responsible for unchecked global chronic disease. In this, it follows the practices of Wikipedia and other private platforms that host public content but retain the ability to remove or silence — without the opportunity for real debate or appeal — information and perspectives outside a narrow scope of belief or thought.
Last week YouTube also took down a new documentary, Borderless , produced by right-wing activist Lauren Southern. The documentary features interviews with human traffickers, and undercover recordings of workers for non-governmental organizations who are assisting migrants. Southern is one of the many “alt-light”-style YouTube stars who have emerged there. YouTube’s decision to take down her video is renewing an argument on the right that access to digital platforms should be a right. This argument is being made vociferously in the renewed Human Events , by Will Chamberlain:
Southern has over 700,000 subscribers on YouTube. Those subscribers belong to her, not the company. She should be able to count on those subscribers seeing a film that violated none of the YouTube terms of service. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine that Southern would have embarked on this project had she not assumed she could show the end product to her audience.
Southern didn’t simply rely on her platform to justify all the time and energy spent making Borderless ; she relied on YouTube’s previous commitments to content neutrality to justify building up her platform in the first place. And yet YouTube is utterly flippant about deleting her content.
It’s not just a matter of being careless over its own commitments, of course. YouTubers could make an argument that not only the near-monopoly position of YouTube in social video but the fact that digital platforms like it were, because of their viewpoint neutrality, privileged over traditional media companies in the law, has allowed it to capture and profit so much of the public square, and so government has a compelling democratic interest in guaranteeing greater freedom of expression on these platforms.
Finally, Canada seems to be giving Silicon Valley a warning ahead of its upcoming elections. The current government, under Justin Trudeau, announced that it had come to “an agreement” with Microsoft and Facebook to “boost security.” It also happens to be the case that the government is currently underwater in the polls. Advertisement Advertisement
Canada’s government claims that bad actors, including Russia, could try to interfere with their election. Though this is something that is rumored or feared in all big elections. You may recall that ahead of the last presidential election in France, there were wild reports of Russian interference on behalf of populist nationalists; Russia had hacked Emmanuel Macron’s email. News reports flew out with the heavy implication that one would be carrying out the Russian interest to vote for the nationalist Marine Le Pen’s National Front. Oddly, the defense against election hacking took on an international character. America’s National Security Agency announced that indeed it had evidenc e that the Russians had hacked France’s democracy. Months later it was admitte d that there was no evidence to suggest that Russia had hacked Emmanuel Macron’s email. In other words, by suggesting falsely, that foreign actors were interfering in French elections, security agencies had in reality tarred domestic political enemies as dupes and patsies. Advertisement
Nevertheless, Canada is being quite plain that it expects to see action from Silicon Valley, or else. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould has emphasized that Internet and social-media companies that don’t freely make their platforms acceptable to her government will face regulation. “The Wild West online era cannot continue — inaction is not an option,” said Gould. “Disinformation must not stand.” Advertisement
Liberal governments (and journalists who act as their hype men) were not at all troubled by the way Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign abused the privacy settings on Facebook. They celebrated it. Sash Issenberg gushe d in Technology Review that by using the power of social-media companies, “Obama’s campaign began the election year confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans whose votes had put him in the White House.” But when Cambridge Analytica studied a much smaller data trove on behalf of conservative and populist causes, it became a major problem for democracy.
Let’s stipulate right from the start that Silicon Valley is making up the rules as it goes along. And it is terrible at the job of censorship and political management. It responds to one set of panicked demands in Germany, then another in America. It goes from one publicity crisis manufactured by the mainstream press to another. And we know which direction those cut. The left-winger who was arrested ahead of a plan to bomb Trump Tower bragged on Instagram about donating money to Hamas, an organization deemed terrorist by most Western governments. Facebook, the parent company, did nothing to restrain his behavior. But the weirdos of the online Right — even the fringes — get banned for doing acts of journalism. Advertisement Advertisement
Google banned advertising in the run-up to Ireland’s national referendum on abortion rights last year for fear of “meddling,” a claim that it did not substantiate. The campaign looking to introduce legal abortion welcomed the ban , because it plainly helped them. Facebook also censored an ad, by the conservative Iona Institute, that featured a computer-generated image of an intact fetus. It had to reverse that decision later .
The problem goes beyond the large social networks. Bank s , credit-card companies, payment processors, fundraising site s , Internet-hosting sites, and registrars have all been pressured to apply some political tests against users. Looked at from a certain angle, left-wing activist groups have asked that tools and tactics developed by the military and private companies to combat the rise of ISIS and al-Qaeda be deployed against conservatives on the home front. Advertisement
But let’s take it a step further and posit that Silicon Valley’s executives and their boards further lack the intellectual wherewithal to come up with, in their terms of service, privacy and expression guidelines that they would be willing to defend during a controversy. What then?
The traditional libertarian answer is to throw up one’s hands and say that private companies can do as they wish. Consumers and readers and Internet users will tire of these ever-changing rules, and surely these social-media giants will go into decline like others before them. For some of these companies, that does seem like one possible fate.
Another traditional conservative response is to see size as the problem. Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms have swallowed expression that had been previously spread over a decentralized Internet, and with power, they have become more corrupt, and make for easy targets for activism. One only has to convince a few handfuls of people in order to create wide-reaching change in this model. Advertisement"

One of my biggest problems with the worldview that Sohrab Ahmari outlines in the course of criticizing David French — and, for that matter, with the general tenor of the Deneen-inspired “anti-liberalism” that First Things is presently indulging — is that it gets extremely fuzzy when it reaches the questions, “What do we actually want?” and “How do we intend to get there?” Ahmari says he wants to “fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” Okay. But what does that actually mean in practice? What does a “defeated enemy” look like? By what mechanism is the “public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good”? Which “public square”? — there are many in America. And what is the “common good and ultimately the Highest Good”? Who decides? Ahmari? The Pope? Nicolás Maduro? Advertisement Advertisement
I must confess that I am not entirely sure that Ahmari and his compatriots know. And this justification for his present approach — provided by Ahmari on Twitter yesterday — has deepened that suspicion: Kavanaugh snapped something in me.
— Sohrab Ahmari (@SohrabAhmari) May 30, 2019
I have heard from a lot of people that the Kavanaugh affair “snapped something in” them. That’s understandable. Indeed, if you look back at my writing at the time, I was absolutely outraged by what happened — and how . But the thing is, we won the Kavanaugh fight. And, crucially, the supposedly supine David French was unsparing in his defense of Kavanaugh. If that was the moment that Ahmari resolved to don a pith helmet and run to the barricades, he shouldn’t have shunned David French for his uselessness, but immediately linked arms with him. I can’t think of an incident that provoked behavior in David that was further from Ahmari’s straw man. He was unblenching. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Moreover, I struggle to remember an incident that better highlighted the need for (classical) liberalism. Ultimately, it was precisely the insistence upon classically liberal values such as cross-examination, hard evidence, and the presumption of innocence that won the day for Kavanaugh, against the sort of ends-oriented illiberalism that Ahmari seems increasingly to admire. The person who secured Kavanaugh’s confirmation, remember, was . . . Susan Collins, and the (correct) reason she gave for her vote was that nothing had been proven and that that was unacceptable to her. She said:
But certain fundamental legal principles—about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness—do bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them.
In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be. We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.
The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nominee’s otherwise exemplary record. I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.
This is a David French argument. It is not a Sohrab Ahmari argument. Advertisement "

(Jim Bourg/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: How Robert Mueller dropped the ball on his one big job, the pro-life movement is on the verge of a major victory in Louisiana, a reviewer finally gives Michael Wolff what he deserves, and some far-flung strange and scary places you can read about soon. You Had One Job, Robert Mueller! Mueller’s press conference was extraordinarily frustrating, for a variety of reasons. First, Mueller emphasized the grammatically muddled point, “If we had had confidence that the president had clearly not committed a crime we would have said so.” As Charlie Cooke lays out , this is not the legal standard in the United States. Either the president committed a crime or he didn’t, and as Mueller said elsewhere in his statement, “Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.” Prosecutors and law-enforcement officials are not supposed to hold press conferences before the national media and say, “This person may have broken the law, or they may not have, after all my investigation, I can’t tell. But Americans should know it’s a possibility before they cast their vote.” That’s not all that different from what James Comey said about Hillary Clinton on July 5, 2016, and Mueller is now turning this into a tradition. Second, Mueller is making it clear he has no interest in testifying before Congress. If he does, it is a near-certainty that he will get asked some variation of, “Did President Trump commit a crime/obstruct justice, yes or no?” For whatever reason, Mueller does not want to directly answer “Yes, he did” or, “No, I cannot prove it.” He keeps giving us this “If we had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” which is neither here nor there when the country really could use one or the other. As much as I understand Mueller’s reluctance to step into the partisan maelstrom, this is a big part — some might say the crux — of what he was assigned to figure out. Mueller determined Trump didn’t collude, but along the way, evidence piled up that Trump at least wanted to obstruct justice — although he may have never succeeded in obstructing justice because his underlings ignored his orders. A desire to obstruct justice, and only being hindered by reluctant underlings, is a really bad quality in a president. But it’s also a really thin reed for the first removal of a sitting president in American history. Back in 1998, I thought suborning perjury was sufficient reason to remove a president, but the country disagreed. We are now approaching some sort of emerging consensus that suborning perjury isn’t enough to remove a president from office, but an unfulfilled desire to obstruct justice is. (The notorious David French points out that the legal definition of obstruction of justice is so broad, it could cover legitimate and lawful exercises of the president’s power.) My suspicion is a lot of people apply the legal standard that “presidents I don’t like should be impeached, but presidents I do like should not be impeached.” I would refer them to the landmark decision of Goose v. Gander. Quite a few Democrats believe the subtext of Mueller’s remarks was, “Yes, you should impeach the president.” A matter as important as this shouldn’t be left to subtext. If Mueller really believes that what he laid out in the report warrants impeachment, he could have and should have said, “The actions described in the report meet the legal definition of obstruction of justice. If Donald Trump were not president of the United States, he would be charged with the crime of obstruction of justice. Under our Constitution, it is up to Congress to determine the appropriate steps from here.” Third, if, as Mueller claimed, the aim of yesterday’s press conference was to ensure that people remained focused on the threat of Russian hacking and online disinformation, he failed completely. As John Podhoretz observes : Mueller just made sure all the oxygen in Washington will be sucked into talking about the president’s post-election conduct and not Russia’s 2016 conduct. And he will reinforce the president’s willful refusal to take Russian hacking seriously (because he wrongly thinks if he does so, he would somehow be acknowledging his election was illegitimate). Mueller cannot be blamed for how Trump reacts, but he just made reaching bipartisan consensus on the need for cyber-protections against electoral interference far more difficult. Fourth, if you just want your report to be all you have to say on the subject, let your report be all you have to say on the subject. Don’t hold a ten-minute press conference to reiterate some points and then announce that’s all you’re willing to say. Fifth, if you’re hired by the Department of Justice to investigate matters of extraordinary importance, I think you’re obligated to answer some questions, either under oath before Congress or to reporters. If Mueller wants to answer every Congressional question with, “I discussed that matter extensively in the report, please read it completely,” then fine. Sixth, put me down as someone who felt like Mueller was a good man put in a tough situation but also a man who made mistakes. His Sphinx-like silence throughout the investigative process was old school and professional, but also allowed a pop-culture driven narrative fill the vacuum, cultivating an always-unrealistic faith among less-informed Trump-haters that at some point Mueller was just going to take Trump away in handcuffs . Somehow Mueller spoke for nine minutes and we’re left with less clarity in what he thinks than before. As former FBI supervisory special agent James Gagliano — who served on Mueller’s protective detail — wrote, “I am disappointed. The Mueller report and the subsequent special counsel statement left me, and many others, still seeking answers… Though he announced his intention to return to private life, Robert Mueller must be subpoenaed to testify in front of Congress.” Finally, can we dispense with this notion that there’s something significant in the redactions that the public ought to know? The redactions were made in cooperation with Mueller’s office, and if the special counsel had any objection to any of the redactions, he could have and would have expressed them yesterday. He did not. Does the Abortion Debate Change When a Democratic Governor Approves a New Ban? It’s going to be fascinating to see how the abortion-industrial complex reacts to a Democratic governor during a year he’s up for reelection . Conservatives might have gripes with the governor on a slew of other issues, but on abortion and life issues, he walks the walk : "

A politician being accused of lying is not exactly newsworthy. But a politician being summoned to court to answer a criminal charge for lying — or, “misleading the public by endorsing and making statements about the cost of European Union Membership, which he knew to be false” — certainly is. Comments
The country in question is the United Kingdom, the politician is Boris Johnson (former foreign secretary and ardent Brexiteer), and the allegedly fraudulent claim is the one that appeared on the Vote Leave’s bus campaign: that Britain sends £350 million a week to the EU when it could be spending this money on its National Health Service instead.
Although there are mixed views about the accuracy of the Leave slogan , this is beside the point. After more than £200,000 was raised through crowdfunding, a private prosecutor brought forward a charge of misconduct in public office. In a statement, Johnson’s defense remarked that:
The application represents an attempt, for the first time in English legal history, to employ criminal law to regulate the content and quality of political debate. That is self-evidently not the function of criminal law.
Quite so. Dragging politicians to court in this way sets a dangerous precedent both for the future of free speech in British politics generally, and for individuals who find that — whether they are right or wrong — their enemies have deeper pockets. "
Contra Michael Dorf on Justice Thomas’s Box Concurrence—Part 2 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/contra-michael-dorf-on-justice-thomass-box-concurrence-part-2/,"May 30, 2019 11:52 AM
Numbering serially from my Part 1 post :
2. Also much like Adam Cohen , Michael Dorf argues that “eugenics cannot be an individual project” and that Justice Thomas misuses the term eugenic when he applies it to “an individual decision by an individual woman to have an abortion.”
As I indicated in my response to Cohen, I think that the semantic objection is both worthy of consideration and not really responsive to Thomas’s argument. Like Cohen, Dorf does not inform his readers of Thomas’s weighty evidence that individual abortion decisions can collectively have a eugenic impact. For example, “In Iceland, the abortion rate for children diagnosed with Down syndrome in utero approaches 100%.” Dorf also ignores the possibility that there might be weighty systemic biases that influence individual abortion decisions. Advertisement Advertisement
More broadly, the eugenics movement tried to harness the voluntary actions of individuals. As Cohen explains in his book Imbeciles (p. 3), “[w]omen’s clubs filled their agendas with lectures on … arranging eugenic marriages”; clergymen “competed in national eugenic sermon contests” to address the responsibility of churches for “improving the human stock”; and “mass-market magazines urged their readers to do their part to breed superior human beings.”
In short, Dorf’s observation that an individual abortion decision “can have no more than a marginal impact on the composition of the overall human gene pool” does not establish that Thomas is wrong to state that “abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation.” Advertisement
3. Like Justice Ginsburg, Dorf objects to what he sees as Thomas’s “tendentious language.” Advertisement
In a footnote, Thomas addresses a lower-court judge’s “suggestion that regulating the disposition of an aborted child’s body might impose an ‘undue burden’ on the mother’s right to abort that (already aborted) child.” In her own footnote response, Ginsburg asserts that “a woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a ‘mother’.” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Dorf (unlike Ginsburg) objects that Thomas “refers to the abortion of a ‘child,’ without distinguishing early from late abortions.” But where exactly would Dorf draw the line? And what better term would he use for the living human being that is on the early side of that line?
We often use the term child in a special way in the context of the mother-child relationship. If you ask a 70-year-old woman how many children she has and she answers “None,” you would be very surprised to learn that she has two adult sons and two adult daughters. Advertisement
Dorf’s misreading of Thomas’s argument about the history of eugenic support for abortion (the subject of my Part 1 post) seems designed to set up his inapt joke that “To Clarence Thomas, all fetuses are Socrates.” Among the things that Dorf misses is that Socrates was his mother’s child when he was a fetus. Advertisement
On Ginsburg’s insistence that “a woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a ‘mother’”: I’ll first refer the reader to Adam White’s fine tweet thread exploring Ginsburg’s apparent “postmodern” notion that motherhood is a “state of mind,” as well as to Princeton professor Robert P. George’s metaphysical reflections on the matter.
I’ll add, in Ginsburg’s defense, that her assertion might depend on the meaning of “is.” Perhaps Ginsburg is saying that a woman who has aborted her child is no longer a mother because her child no longer exists. (In sympathy for those mothers who have had all their children predecease them, I’d prefer “once a mother, always a mother.”)
But if that’s not what Ginsburg means, I’ll note that the Court’s decisions in both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey frequently refer to the pregnant woman seeking abortion as the mother . (E.g.: “the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother , may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.) So I don’t see how Ginsburg and Dorf can find Thomas’s use of the term mother objectionable.
4. Citing a book by a colleague of his, Dorf contends that sex-selective abortion doesn’t happen in this country. But he doesn’t acknowledge, much less address, Thomas’s evidence to the contrary:
[R]ecent evidence suggests that sex-selective abortions of girls are common among certain populations in the United States as well. See Almond & Sun, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in 2010 U. S. Census and 2011–2013 U. S. Natality Data, 176 Soc. Sci. & Med. 21 (2017) (concluding that Chinese and AsianIndian families in the United States “show a tendency to sex-select boys”); Almond & Edlund, Son-Biased Sex Ratios in the 2000 United States Census, 105 Proc.

Law professor Michael Dorf offers several criticisms of Justice Thomas’s concurring opinion in Box v. Planned Parenthood , in which Thomas argued that Indiana’s law barring abortions sought solely because of the child’s race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome, or non-lethal disabilities “promote[s] a State’s compelling interest in preventing abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.” Let’s consider them:
1. Much like Adam Cohen, whose inaccurate account of Thomas’s argument I addressed yesterday, Dorf contends that Thomas is making an argument of “guilt by association” that “goes like this”:
[Margaret] Sanger favored birth control on grounds of eugenics; she also opposed abortion; but the eugenics-based arguments she used in favor of legal birth control apply “with even greater force to abortion”; therefore, abortion is a form of eugenics. This has all the logic of the syllogism in Love and Death that culminates in the conclusion that “all men are Socrates.”
I don’t see how Thomas’s argument can fairly be read this way. Rather than again present my own summary of his argument, I will quote Thomas’s argument at length (with my underlining):
Although Sanger was undoubtedly correct in recognizing a moral difference between birth control and abortion, the eugenic arguments that she made in support of birth control apply with even greater force to abortion. Others were well aware that abortion could be used as a “metho[d] of eugenics,” 6 H. Ellis, Studies in the Psychology of Sex 617 (1910), and they were enthusiastic about that possibility. Indeed, some eugenicists believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics . See Harris, Abortion in Soviet Russia: Has the Time Come To Legalize It Elsewhere? 25 Eugenics Rev. 22 (1933) (“ [W]e are being increasingly compelled to consider legalized abortion as well as birth control and sterilization as possible means of influencing the fitness and happiness and quality of the race ”); Aims and Objects of the Eugenics Society, 26 Eugenics Rev. 135 (1934) (“The Society advocates the provision of legalized facilities for voluntarily terminating pregnancy in cases of persons for whom sterilization is regarded as appropriate”). Support for abortion can therefore be found throughout the literature on eugenics . E.g., Population Control: Dr. Binnie Dunlop’s Address to the Eugenics Society, 25 Eugenics Rev. 251 (1934) (lamenting “the relatively high birth-rate of the poorest third of the population” and “the serious rate of racial deterioration which it implied,” and arguing that “this birth-rate . . . would fall rapidly if artificial abortion were made legal”); Williams, The Legalization of Medical Abortion, 56 Eugenics Rev. 24–25 (1964) (“ I need hardly stress the eugenic argument for extending family planning”— including “voluntary sterilization” and “abortion”—to “all groups , not merely to those who are the most intelligent and socially responsible”).
Abortion advocates were sometimes candid about abortion’s eugenic possibilities. In 1959, for example, [Planned Parenthood president Alan] Guttmacher explicitly endorsed eugenic reasons for abortion . A. Guttmacher, Babies by Choice or by Chance 186–188 (1959). He explained that “the quality of the parents must be taken into account,” including “[f]eeblemindedness,” and believed that “it should be permissible to abort any pregnancy . . . in which there is a strong probability of an abnormal or malformed infant.” Id., at 198. He added that the question whether to allow abortion must be “separated from emotional, moral and religious concepts” and “must have as its focus normal, healthy infants born into homes peopled with parents who have healthy bodies and minds.” Id., at 221. Similarly, legal scholar Glanville Williams wrote that he was open to the possibility of eugenic infanticide, at least in some situations, explaining that “ an eugenic killing by a mother, exactly paralleled by the bitch that kills her misshapen puppies, cannot confidently be pronounced immoral .” G. Williams, Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law 20 (1957)….
But public aversion to eugenics after World War II also led many to avoid explicit references to that term. The American Eugenics Society, for example, changed the name of its scholarly publication from “Eugenics Quarterly” to “Social Biology.” See D. Paul, Controlling Human Heredity: 1865 to the Present, p. 125 (1995). In explaining the name change, the journal’s editor stated that it had become evident that eugenic goals could be achieved “for reasons other than eugenics.” Ibid. For example, “[b]irth control and abortion are turning out to be great eugenic advances of our time . If they had been advanced for eugenic reasons it would have retarded or stopped their acceptance.” Ibid. But whether they used the term “eugenics” or not, abortion advocates echoed the arguments of early 20th-century eugenicists by describing abortion as a way to achieve “population control” and to improve the “quality” of the population . One journal declared that “abortion is the one mode of population limitation which has demonstrated the speedy impact which it can make upon a national problem.” Notes of the Quarter: The Personal and the Universal, 53 Eugenics Rev. 186 (1962). Planned Parenthood’s leaders echoed these themes. When exulting over “‘fantastic . . . progress’” in expanding abortion, for example, Guttmacher stated that “‘the realization of the population problem has been responsible’ for the change in attitudes. ‘We’re now concerned more with the quality of population than the quantity.’” Abortion Reforms Termed “Fantastic,” Hartford Courant, Mar. 21, 1970, p. 16.
In short, Thomas was plainly not making the “guilt by association” argument that Dorf alleges. Instead, he was showing that eugenic thinking has indeed played a significant role in the thinking of some leading advocates of abortion. Is that ugly reality really contestable? Recall that in an unguarded moment, Ruth Bader Ginsburg spoke openly (point 2 here ) of her perception in the 1970s that Medicaid funding of abortion would address the “concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don’t want to have too many of .” Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "
Salesforce & Guns: Boycott Tech Company Trying to Stop Customers from Selling Semiautomatic Guns | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/boycott-salesforce/,"From a Washington Post story :
While Salesforce is hardly a household name, it is a dominant provider of software and services that help businesses manage their customers. With roughly 40,000 employees and a market value of nearly $120 billion, it has become a behemoth in San Francisco. Its branded skyscraper also towers over the city as the tallest building and a major landmark.
. . . Comments
Salesforce’s new policy bars customers that sell a range of firearms — including automatic and semiautomatic — from using its e-commerce technology. The policy also precludes customers from selling some firearm parts, such as “magazines capable of accepting more than 10 rounds” and “multi-burst trigger devices.”
This is a private company and it can do business with whomever it chooses. But if it would like to pick a fight with gun owners, gun owners — and everyone who doesn’t think corporate giants should be leveraging their power to stop the sale of legal products — should fight back. Businesspeople who chafe at such restrictions should stop using Salesforce products, even if they don’t fall under the new restrictions themselves, and pro-gun customers should prefer businesses that use alternatives.

Joe Biden Is Not Another Hillary Clinton | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/joe-biden-campaign-not-another-hillary-clinton/,"Follow Jonah Goldberg on Twitter May 31, 2019 6:30 AM Joe Biden speaks at the kickoff rally of his 2020 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Pa., May 18, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The 2020 Democratic front-runner doesn’t carry the same baggage.
I s Joe Biden Hillary Clinton — or George W. Bush?
The first, most obvious and literal answer is, he’s neither. He’s Joe Biden, one of the most known and familiar personalities in American politics.
Matt Continetti, editor of the Washington Free Beacon , recently asked: “Is Biden the new Hillary?”
“Trump plans to wage the same sort of campaign against Biden that he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016,” Continetti wrote for National Review . “Back then, Trump defined Hillary as the candidate of entrenched interests who used a long career in politics for familial gain. He highlighted Clinton’s support for the 1994 crime bill and for NAFTA and TPP, driving wedges between the former secretary of state and important Democratic constituencies. And he went after Hillary’s foreign-policy credentials, painting her as an interventionist who had weakened America’s standing in the world.” Advertisement Advertisement
Continetti is surely correct that this is Team Trump’s game plan. Both D.C. scuttlebutt and public reporting suggest that they see Biden as the biggest threat to Trump’s reelection prospects. That’s certainly borne out in the polls, which show Biden leading Trump by 8 points (according to the RealClearPolitics average). Biden’s lead in some crucial states is even more worrisome for Trump. Advertisement
A recent Quinnipiac poll had him ahead by double digits — 53 percent to 42 percent — in Pennsylvania. Biden has a 10.5 percentage-point lead in Michigan, 8 points in Wisconsin (though polling there is sparse), and 4 points in Ohio, and is tied in Florida, according to the RealClearPolitics average. Advertisement
Trump won the Electoral College by taking a handful of states out of the traditional Democratic column with razor-thin margins. It’s insanely early, but the scary part for Trump is that Biden is not only wildly beating the other Democrats in the field, he’s also outperforming Clinton at a comparable time in 2015.
And this points to a possible flaw in the effort to turn Biden into another Hillary. Clinton ran as an experienced Washington hand, Continetti notes. But “after 16 months of Trump attacks, 77,000 voters in three states denied her the presidency,” he adds. “The same could happen again to a nominee easily caricatured as the epitome of Beltway cluelessness. What looks like Joe Biden’s greatest strength — electability born of experience — may also be a debilitating weakness.” Advertisement
Maybe. But while Trump’s attacks on Clinton were surely effective at times, Trump was aided enormously by the fact that Americans, particularly Republican and Republican-friendly ones, were skeptical or outright hostile to her already, thanks to decades of experience with, and criticism of, her. Trump didn’t define Clinton as much as she did. Advertisement
Moreover, implicit to her campaign was the promise of both a third Obama term and a restoration of the Clinton dynasty. Trump did not need to work all that hard to convince voters exhausted or frustrated by the Obama years or disdainful of Clinton Inc. to vote against her.
Biden occupies a different space, psychologically and politically. There’s a lot of conventional wisdom in Washington that the early front-runner always loses. And that’s true except when it isn’t. In 2003, former Vermont governor Howard Dean dominated the polls. Then he lost Iowa, screamed, and eventually skulked away.
But in 1999, George W. Bush dominated the polls and, except for a brief scare from Senator John McCain in the New Hampshire primary, essentially cruised to victory. Advertisement
A key part of Bush’s early success, not just in polls but in fundraising, stemmed from the fact that he was promising a Bush restoration. Indeed, some of his early approval ratings were a direct result of nostalgia for his father, with whom he shared a name.
Also, he was offering a referendum on the incumbent president and the scandals and partisanship that defined the end of his administration. He vowed to restore “honor and dignity to the Oval Office” and to be a “uniter not a divider.”
The very different context notwithstanding, this is pretty much Biden’s campaign message. The ideological, activist, and Twitter-obsessed base of the Democratic party may not like Biden’s pitch. But it sure looks like rank-and-file Democrats do, particularly African-American women who may see in Biden something of an Obama restoration."
Film Review: Brian De Palma Regains His Power with 'Domino' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/film-review-domino-brian-de-palma-regains-power/,"May 31, 2019 6:30 AM Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Carice van Houten in Domino His new terrorist thriller comes to terms with moral and media decline.
S o many pop artists have recently let political partisanship cloud their vision of fairness — and even sully their craft — that it’s understandable to have given up on a boatload of them. Will we ever again see a credible performance from Robert De Niro? Will we ever want to hear a new Madonna or Bruce Springsteen song? Will The Simpsons ever be funny again? Will Brian De Palma ever regain his power? Advertisement Advertisement
Domino answers that last question with a thriller plot, set in the near future — 2020 — that plays out global paranoia about Islamic terrorism. Copenhagen police officer Christian (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) responds to a routine call that thrusts him into a global nightmare, from Denmark to Spain, testing his loyalty; his new partner Alex (Carice van Houten) is full of life yet sustains personal grief; Libyan immigrant Ezra (Eriq Ebouaney) kills to protect his family; meanwhile fanatic Salah Al Din (Mohammed Azaay) plots terrorist attacks over Europe’s changing moral stage (symbolized by a climax in an arena).
This is a second-tier, non-event film (a commendable rejuvenation for De Palma), and its brisk narrative moves as if on impulse. De Palma’s mastery of pace and composition makes the briefest image and sharpest edit count. When Christian confronts Ezra, their initial alarm is conveyed through European/African facial contrasts — film noir close-ups burning with sociological dread — that, thanks to cinematographer José Luis Alcaine, raise the movie’s temperature. Each character’s desperation and personal motivation are vivid; the global nightmare is conveyed with such quick efficiency that Domino plays like a B-movie dream of a great De Palma film. (The media’s hostility toward it suggests that Domino — which dares pinpoint Islamic terrorism — isn’t PC enough.) Advertisement
For various reasons owing to our political and moral disorientation, it seems impossible for contemporary American filmmakers to deal with national or global crises. (Note that Domino ’s non-American cast mostly speaks in American idioms.) But De Palma’s formidable technique helps him puzzle out this artistic dilemma ahead of his peers. His signature use of split screens throughout Domino shows such assurance and depth that it relays our split moral consciousness. Domino proves that De Palma’s relation to new media includes coming to terms with the horror of ISIS beheading videos — the new media depersonalization that is inseparable from the private commemoration in cellphone photo swipes and facial-recognition technology that destroys all privacy. That concern animates every scene. It’s total illumination of our digital-age crisis.
De Palma’s 2007 film Redacted was a predictably sour retort to George Bush’s continuation of the Iraq War. De Palma couldn’t get over the cynicism he developed in the countercultural Sixties, and his knee-jerk liberalism forced him to shortchange his sympathy with the film’s soldier characters, unforgivably showing them as moral criminals. With screenwriter Petter Skavlan, DePalma’s Domino premise updates Eisenhower’s 1950s domino theory so that the warning against Communism’s spread becomes an allegory for this century’s spread of rampant, even murderous, incivility.

"Climate Change Policy: Pursue Fee and Dividend Plan, Not Lawsuits | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jeremy Carl,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/climate-policy-fee-and-dividend-plan/,"May 31, 2019 6:30 AM (Larry Downing/Reuters) To address this contentious issue, bipartisan policy is needed, not damage suits.
L ast week BP and Shell both pledged support for the Climate Leadership Council’s (CLC) proposal for a revenue-neutral “carbon fee and dividend” plan, under which extractors of carbon-based fuels would be charged a fee, and all of the money collected would be distributed to the public as a dividend. While conservatives have a wide variety of views on how, or even whether, to address climate policy, this initiative is perhaps the most genuinely bipartisan attempt so far to move forward on a famously contentious issue. Advertisement Advertisement
Under the CLC plan, the fee and dividend provisions would be combined with the repeal of a number of Obama-era regulatory policies, including the Clean Power Plan, that try to accomplish similar emissions-reduction goals, but in a less economically efficient manner. Its efficiency-focused approach has drawn the support of a significant number of Republicans, even some who are skeptical of the Left’s broader climate claims.
While I have not been involved with or taken a position on the CLC plan, I was privileged to spend the last decade directing the Task Force on Energy Policy at the Hoover Institution, chaired by two of the CLC plan’s initial co-authors, former U.S. secretary of state George Shultz and Ambassador Thomas Stephenson. I’ve also written extensively about the empirical effects of carbon pricing in my own scholarly work. Advertisement
Shultz and Stephenson joined a distinguished group of GOP luminaries that includes former secretary of state James Baker, former Treasury secretary Hank Paulson, former Council of Economic Advisers head Martin Feldstein, and former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan in creating the original CLC plan.
But while some critics have referred to the CLC as a Republican proposal, it was also endorsed by a number of prominent Democrats, including Larry Summers and Steve Chu, who served as Treasury secretary and energy secretary, respectively, under President Obama. It was also a rare proposal that won support from sources as diverse as major environmental NGOs (such as Conservation International) and industrial titans (such as Ford and GM). The plan’s core principles were endorsed by 27 Nobel Prize–winning economists and leading economic policymakers, including every living former chair of the Federal Reserve and 15 former chairs of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisers from both parties. Advertisement
But instead of expressing happiness that some of the biggest oil producers were willing to accept a major concession to help lower emissions under a plan with almost unprecedented bipartisan support, many on the left have complained because the plan also limits climate-change-related litigation. An article in the liberal blog ThinkProgress called this provision the oil companies’ “present to themselves.” According to Daniel Zarillo, an aide to New York mayor Bill de Blasio, it’s a “transparent attempt by fossil fuel companies to avoid the liability for decades of deception and denial about the consequence of burning fossil fuels.” Tom Butt, the mayor of Richmond, Calif., called it a “Trojan Horse proposal that attempts to prevent cities, counties, states, or others from holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate change-related damages they knowingly caused.” Advertisement
None of these climate-change lawsuits have succeeded, and there’s no reason to think they will. They all require novel, if not frivolous, legal theories. Even far-left European Union courts have thrown out suits of this type.
Moreover, even if they were successful, most such suits would do little to limit emissions going forward. The lawsuits are based on the idea that oil companies intentionally concealed evidence of severe damages from climate change. Even if these highly contestable claims were true, pursuing them is simply not the most productive approach to actually moving Americans toward a politically durable climate-policy solution. Advertisement Advertisement
Further, contrary to the implicit claims of Butt, Zarillo, and others who share their views, there is no significant evidence that oil and gas companies’ public positions on climate science have driven substantial changes in oil and gas consumption. Simply put, we use oil because it allows us to do important things that are very difficult to do without it. The vast majority of climate activists still fly on airplanes, drive gasoline-powered cars, and use plastics and other materials made from petroleum. Pricing carbon could change incentives and promote alternatives, while retrospective lawsuits do nothing to alter present realities.
Furthermore, even if activists somehow managed to bankrupt every major oil company without shifting the fundamental incentives in the energy markets, new investors would simply purchase their assets and restart the cycle. So why is the Left so invested in these lawsuits? Advertisement Advertisement
Beyond financial self-interest, they have a deeper ideological motivation: using climate change not just as an environmental-policy issue, but as a way to right all their perceived societal wrongs. Their primary concerns are not creating good public policy but promoting a political theology that I have referred to as “The Church of Environmentalism.”"
Robert Mueller Investigation: When Did He Know There Was No Collusion? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Deroy Murdock,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-investigation-report-no-collusion/,"About Deroy Murdock May 31, 2019 6:30 AM Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers a statement on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., May 29, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) If so, why did he do it?
W hat did Robert Mueller know, and when did he know it?
This was among the questions that the Russiagate special counsel dodged at Wednesday’s Justice Department photo opportunity. More concretely, did Mueller promptly report his no-collusion conclusion, or did he cover it up for months, to enervate President Donald J. Trump and energize Democrats? Meanwhile, America tore itself in two. Advertisement Advertisement
Mueller’s 22-month-long inquiry was like chemotherapy — an invasive, all-consuming nightmare, though seemingly necessary to excise a malignancy. Serious suspicions existed that the Republican party’s standard-bearer conspired with the Kremlin to capture the White House.
The chemo eventually worked. It confirmed that there was no collusion. The Oval Office is not occupied by a Russian asset. If Dr. Mueller determined this in, say, mid-February and informed Attorney General William Barr on March 22 , then Americans should applaud this fair timeline.
But what if Dr. Mueller last year deemed Team Trump cancer-free but, nonetheless, continued this exhausting, divisive, demoralizing chemotherapy — for at least eight extra months? Advertisement
Why such cruelty? Did Mueller intend to keep Trump off balance and unable to focus completely on his agenda? Did Mueller mean to rejuvenate Democrats, so that they would resist the “Russian agent” who denied Hillary her “birthright?” And did Mueller (or his angry-Democrat staff ) leave this smear against Trump uncorrected so that information-deprived voters would hand Democrats the House? Advertisement
Under-covered passages of Mueller’s report strongly suggest that he engaged in malpractice rather than good medicine.
“As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new Administration,” the report states on page 144. “They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with senior officials around the President-Elect.”
“At approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks received a telephone call,” Mueller’s report continues. Through this person’s thick foreign accent, Hicks deciphered the words “Putin call.” The next morning, Nov. 9, 2016, Hicks received the email she requested from the caller. Advertisement
Russian Embassy official Sergey Kuznetsov contacted Hicks via Gmail. Subject line: “Message from Putin.” In an English/Russian attachment, according to Mueller, “Putin offered his congratulations to Trump for his electoral victory, stating he ‘look[ed] forward to working with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis.’” Advertisement
Hicks and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, according to his congressional testimony, then spent time authenticating this email by identifying, locating, and contacting Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. After Moscow’s man in Washington validated the email, Mueller’s report states, “Hicks conveyed Putin’s letter to transition officials. Five days later, on November 14, 2016, Trump and Putin spoke by phone in the presence of Transition Team members. …”
These delays frustrated Putin. Mueller cites Petr Aven, chief of Alfa-Bank, Russia’s largest commercial lender: Mueller states that Aven had a “one-on-one meeting with Putin” in the fourth quarter of 2018. “Aven also testified that Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by the Russian government in getting in touch with the incoming Trump Administration,” Mueller writes. “According to Aven, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and generally did not know the people around the President-Elect.”
If Trump and Putin had been in cahoots, they would have speed-dialed each other and toasted Trump’s triumph on Election Night. Instead, Putin’s greeting crawled toward the president-elect for five days. Advertisement
What did Mueller know? “Trump-Russia collusion” was a Red Square-sized lie.
When did he know it? Kushner testified on July 24, 2017. Hicks spoke to the FBI on Dec. 8, 2017. Aven sang on Aug. 2, 2018."

Michael Bogren is a nominee for a judicial seat in Michigan. He is currently defending the city of East Lansing, Mich., in a lawsuit brought by Steve and Bridget Tennes. The Tenneses are a faithful Catholic family who operate Country Mill Orchard and Cider Mill. After they stated publicly that they believe in the Bible’s teachings on marriage and adhere to those beliefs for their business, the city barred them from participating in the local farmers market. They were then forced to sue the city to defend their rights.
Mr. Bogren responded with a scorched-earth strategy in his litigation against the Tennes family. He wrote, “Plaintiffs attempt to dress their arguments up in a shimmering gown of First Amendment and religious righteousness and parade it down the runway of moral superiority.

He compared their Christian beliefs about marriage to the racism of the Ku Klux Klan, arguing that following the teachings of their faith by not celebrating same-sex weddings on their farm was “no different than the ‘White Applicants Only’ sign.” He also attacked the sincerity and the consistency of their beliefs, arguing that they only “selectively” apply their faith to their lives.

Lawyers have a duty to their clients, as I well know. I’ve represented many myself. But a lawyer can give his clients a vigorous defense without stooping to personal attacks and vicious rhetoric. Mr. Bogren’s repeated attacks on the Tennes family go beyond merely representing the city. His hostility toward their faith raises questions about his fitness to be a federal judge.
I asked Mr. Bogren about these statements at a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Shockingly, he stood by them as merely representation of his client. Advertisement
As attorneys, our oaths require us to do much more than advocate on our clients’ behalf. We also swear to uphold the law itself and to always conduct ourselves with integrity. And that means not launching gratuitous attacks against faith groups — especially when you represent the government. It’s one thing to advocate on behalf of your client, but Bogren went too far. Last year’s Masterpiece Cakeshop decision makes clear that government officials who show “hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs” of bakers like Jack Phillips and farmers like the Tenneses violate the First Amendment."
Teen Girl Faces Child-Porn Charges for Making Video of Herself | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Katherine Timpf,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/teen-girl-faces-child-pornography-charges/,"May 31, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) Officials say that while the sex act was legal, filming it and sending it to her friends was not.
A 16-year-old Maryland girl — identified only as “S.K.” — is facing child-pornography charges because she made a video of herself performing a consensual sex act and sent it to a couple of her close friends.
According to an article in Reason , S.K. shared a video of herself performing oral sex on an unidentified, age-appropriate male and sent it two of her classmates, only for those classmates to then go and tell school resource officers on her. She was the only one who was charged with a crime — and convicted. Advertisement Advertisement
As crazy as it sounds, the state’s Special Court of Appeals upheld S.K.’s child-pornography conviction, arguing that it didn’t matter whether the act was consensual. According to the court, although it was not illegal for S.K. to perform the act itself, taking a video of it and sending it to people amounted to distributing child porn.
“The First Amendment to the United States Constitution did not protect conduct of a minor who distributed digital video file of herself engaged as a subject in consensual sexual conduct,” the court stated.
It will now be up to Maryland’s highest court to decide whether or not S.K.’s charge stays. It heard oral arguments on the case in February, and is expected to rule on it later this year. Advertisement
S.K.’s attorney, public defender Claudia Cortese, has argued that the statute that the state is using to charge S.K. was never intended to punish children, but rather to protect them. Advertisement
The prosecutor, however, argued that S.K. needs “some guidance, rehabilitation for something deeper” and that she should probably have to undergo a mandatory health evaluation and serve time on probation. What’s more, the prosecutor also insisted that the state “is just trying to help” S.K.
Now, I have absolutely no doubt that a young girl who takes a video of herself performing a sex act and then sends it to people very well might be in need of “some guidance.” What I don’t understand is this: Just how in the hell does anyone actually think that a criminal charge is going to be something that will “help her” in any way at all?
Now, since S.K.’s case was in juvenile court, she thankfully doesn’t have to worry about having to register as a sex offender or serving a mandatory sentence. Rather, she was just referred for a mental-health evaluation and put on probation. The thing is, though, this is something that the law should never have been involved in at all. Advertisement
Cortese is absolutely right: Child-pornography statutes were intended to protect children, not to punish them — and the way that the state is using this statute is nothing short of draconian. We all know why child-pornography laws were put into place, and it was not to punish minors for what they choose to do with their own bodies. If both parties are legally able to consent to engage in an act, one party shouldn’t be punished for filming it. Think about it: In what other case would filming something totally legal, and then sharing the video, constitute a crime? I can’t think of a single one, and it shouldn’t constitute one here, either.

Robert Mueller Investigation: Extraconstitutional Legal Standard for Obstruction | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-investigation-legal-standard-obstruction/,"Follow Rich Lowry on Twitter May 31, 2019 6:30 AM Special counsel Robert Mueller delivers a statement on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., May 29, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) Mueller invented an extraconstitutional legal standard for his obstruction investigation.
I n the end, by-the-book Robert Mueller departed wildly from the book.
He invented an extraconstitutional legal standard for his obstruction investigation and acted, at best, in violation of the spirit of the special-counsel regulations.
His departing act was a public statement meant to influence the public debate in a manner inappropriate for a prosecutor, in part because the long public report he wrote that was also inappropriate for a prosecutor lacked clarity. Advertisement Advertisement
A hallmark of the Trump era is that the norm-defying president goads everyone appalled by him to violate norms. The former Marine and G-man Robert Mueller would seem least likely to fall prey to this dynamic, but here we are.
First and foremost, Mueller ditched the presumption of innocence. In the normal course of things, all of us are considered innocent unless a jury finds us guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Mueller switched this around. Rather than finding conclusive evidence of Trump’s guilt, he had to find conclusive evidence of his innocence. Since he didn’t find this exculpatory evidence, Mueller deemed Trump “not exonerated.” Advertisement
In surely one of the more gobsmacking utterances ever made by someone from a Justice Department podium, he said that “if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”
If this standard had been applied to any person other than Donald Trump, it would have been widely denounced, and the American Civil Liberties Union would be crusading against it. Advertisement
Naturally, Trump’s critics immediately concluded from Mueller’s statement that if Trump hadn’t been found innocent, he must be guilty. The snarky headline on a New York magazine piece put it aptly enough: “Mueller: Trump is Not Not a Criminal.”
Well, you might say, of course Robert Mueller departed from standard operating procedure — he’s a special counsel operating in novel circumstances that require novel approaches. Advertisement
But this is not his writ. A special counsel, under the regulations, has the “investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.” He is supposed to “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”
One of those rules, set out by the department’s Office of Legal Counsel, famously says that a sitting president can’t be charged with a crime. Mueller explained in his public statement that this ruling led his office to conclude that it couldn’t “reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.”
So, Mueller, by his own account, conducted a two-year investigation knowing from the beginning that he wouldn’t make the either/or decision that prosecutors exist to make. Advertisement
Mueller offered several reasons for conducting an obstruction investigation anyway. One was to preserve evidence. But for what? The idea that a post-presidency Trump will get prosecuted as a private citizen for firing FBI Director James Comey is manifestly absurd. Another was that the president can be accused of wrongdoing in “a process other than the criminal justice system,” i.e., impeachment by Congress.
Here, Mueller is basically describing Volume 2 as an impeachment referral. But this isn’t a purpose contemplated by the special-counsel regulations, which say that the special counsel “shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions.”
They don’t say a special counsel shall fail to reach a prosecution or declination decision, then write a long report for congressional consumption anyway, and additionally go out and make a public statement to catalyze congressional action.
It should be up to Congress, not an inferior executive branch, to launch such an inquiry or not. Even more bizarrely, since Mueller considered Trump’s public statements as potential obstruction, any objections by the president to this quasi-impeachment inquiry were more evidence of alleged wrongdoing.

1994 Crime Bill: Remove Children from Sex-Offender Registries | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mona Charen,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/sex-offender-registries-children-1994-crime-bill/,"May 31, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) There are good reasons to reconsider some aspects of the 1994 Crime Bill, because we’ve had a chance to see the unintended consequences.
W ith several septuagenarians competing for the presidency, the ghost of the 1990s looms over the 2020 race. Joe Biden has faced criticism for his sponsorship of the 1994 crime bill. President Trump tweeted: “Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected.”
Here’s some context. Violent crime rates in the United States began a steep climb in the mid-1960s and reached their peak in the early 1990s. Americans were extremely worried. Donald Trump, for example, recommended bringing back New York’s death penalty in response to a much-publicized Central Park attack. Politicians listened. Many states passed tough anti-crime measures, and in 1994, the federal government got into the act. Though Republicans criticized the federal crime bill for gun restrictions and what they called “pork,” the measure passed the House on a voice vote and the Senate by 61–38 with many Republican votes. Advertisement Advertisement
Crime has dropped dramatically since. Was that due to the law? Doubtful. Crime also rose and fell in Canada at about the same rate during the same time period (though it started at a much lower baseline). Some possible causes that have been floated: abortion, immigration, cellphones, and community policing.
In any case, there are good reasons to reconsider some aspects of the 1994 act and subsequent revisions, because we’ve had a chance to see the unintended consequences.
One feature of the 1994 law that has had baleful unanticipated effects was the adoption of sex-offender registries. At the time, experts advised that sex offenders never reformed. To protect the community from those found guilty of such offenses after their return to society, registries would require them to identify themselves (sometimes even with signs in their windows). Understandably, penalties were particularly harsh for anyone who harmed a child sexually. Advertisement Advertisement
What the law’s authors didn’t anticipate is that children themselves would be caught up in this net. The Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia has been studying those effects.
The old assumption that sex offenders never change has proved mistaken. The national recidivism rate for all crimes is roughly 40 percent. The rate for adults who commit sex offenses is about 13 percent. For children, the rate is about 7 percent.
Sex-offender registries in many states make no distinction between crimes committed by adults against children and offenses children commit against one another. Children as young as eight years old have been required to register as sex offenders and remain on the registry for life.
Sometimes, children commit serious offenses. But children mature and change. Should a youthful offense or stupid mistake carry a lifetime punishment? Advertisement
And not all offenses that can land you on a registry are serious. “Isaac E” pleaded guilty to “indecent liberties by forcible compulsion.” He touched a girl’s chest. They were both twelve at the time. But Isaac must post a new picture of himself every year, while the age of his victim is always listed as twelve. This makes it appear to anyone who consults the registry years later that the adult Isaac assaulted a child.
Children who have been labeled sex offenders often struggle to lead normal lives after serving time. Strict rules limit where sex offenders can live or work. Some cannot live with family members who have children, and missing a deadline can result in a felony conviction for failing to register. “Gabriel” had been arrested for sexually touching a playmate at the age of eleven. He did not reoffend, but he lived on the streets after leaving the Texas Youth Center at age 17 when he failed to find an apartment that would accept him. In a Catch-22 faced by many on registries, he was then arrested for failing to register a home address (a felony) and sentenced to a year in prison. Other offenses that can trip up those on registries: changing their Yelp account username, parking in a different place, failing to have mail forwarded to a new address. Advertisement
A 15-year-old Pennsylvania girl who took nude selfies and posted them online was convicted of manufacturing and disseminating child pornography. She was charged as an adult and will remain on the registry for life. Advertisement
A 16-year-old who had been on the Louisiana registry for two years told Human Rights Watch , “For sex offenders, our mistake is forever available to the world to see. There is no redemption, no forgiveness. . . . There is never a chance for a fresh start. You are finished. I wish I was executed because my life is basically over.”"
Barack Obama & Gun Laws -- Former President Is Lying About America's Gun Laws Again | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles C. W. Cooke,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/barack-obama-is-lying-about-americas-gun-laws-again/,"May 31, 2019 10:06 AM
Barack Obama is still lying about America’s gun laws. Per the Daily Mail :
Former president Barack Obama has claimed US gun laws ‘don’t make sense’.
The Democrat – who pushed for tighter restrictions during his two terms in office – said it was too easy ‘to buy machine guns.’ Speaking about the Sandy Hook school shooting that saw 20 children and six adults massacred, he described it as the ‘hardest day of his life’. ‘The worst thing for me was that I could not bring their children back or promise that we would change the laws,’ he told the 10,000-strong crowd. ‘Gun laws in the United States don’t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, anytime without, you know, without much if any regulation. They can buy over the Internet. They can buy machine guns.’
This just isn’t true. It is possible for individuals to buy “ machine guns ” in some states, but, because the legal inventory contains only weapons that were made before 1986, they cost upwards of $10,000. Moreover, buying or transferring a machine gun in the United States requires an enormous amount of federal paperwork, an in-depth federal background check, and the adding of the transferee’s name to a national registry. At present, this process takes around 16 months to complete."

(Mark Makela/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: What we’re learning about American history, whether the pendulum is swinging too far on the crime issue and is due to swing back, and a well-covered Democratic presidential candidate isn’t as well-known as his fans in the media may think. Those Who Do Not Learn from History Are Doomed to Chaperone School Field Trips However you’re ending your week, I hope it’s been a good one. As you read this, I’m on my way to Gettysburg National Military Park, chaperoning a school trip. Last time I did this, chaperoning a school trip to Jamestown, three kids barfed on the bus on the way there. This class trip to a Civil War battlefield is apparently an increasingly rare experience for America’s youth : The National Park Service’s five major Civil War battlefield parks—Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, Chickamauga/Chattanooga and Vicksburg—had a combined 3.1 million visitors in 2018, down from about 10.2 million in 1970, according to park-service data. Gettysburg, in Pennsylvania, the most famous battle site, had about 950,000 visitors last year, just 14% of its draw in 1970 and the lowest annual number of visitors since 1959. Only one of these parks, Antietam, in Maryland, has seen an increase from 1970. John Daniel Davidson writes over at The Federalist: . . . in a country where large numbers of college graduates do not even know the half-century in which the Civil War occurred , but are convinced that Confederate monuments should come down , we should expect genuine interest in the Civil War to wane if not to disappear entirely, except perhaps as an object for political activism. The argument that modern Americans aren’t interested in history doesn’t quite mesh with certain cultural trends. If you look at the nonfiction bestseller list at any given moment, a good chunk of the top titles will be history books. At this moment, there’s David McCullough’s The Pioneers , Rick Atkinson’s The British Are Coming, Jared Diamond’s Upheaval , Tony Horwitz’s Spying on the South , Dan Abram’s Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense , and Tom Cotton’s Sacred Duty , about the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment. The major book-review sections of American newspapers — to the extent they still exist — are heavily focused on history books. Our pop culture is bursting with depictions of past eras — documentaries, docudramas, and historical fiction. More than $500 million has been spent on tickets for a musical about Alexander Hamilton, with roughly two million seats sold, an amazing sum for a live performance show. Historical dramas dominate the Oscar nominations. American audiences seem to have a persistent interest in British history. A few years back, folks went nuts for Downton Abbey , and now it’s Peaky Blinders , The Crown, The Tudors , and Victoria . Beyond the British Isles, there are series about Marco Polo, the Medicis, and the Vikings. I realize not everybody is into history, and perhaps popular interest focuses heavily on particular chapters of American history. Judging by the bookstore shelves, it’s easy to believe American history began with the Revolutionary War, moved on to the Civil War, then on to World War Two, and that led up to today. Back in 2003, I watched the sketch comedy play The Complete History of America (Abridged) in London. The first act covered from the Revolutionary War up to the Civil War. The Second Act began with World War One. Apparently, nothing significant happened from 1865 to 1917. You do wonder if part of our intense polarization comes from two or more Americans learning and choosing to see two different versions of American history. John Daniel Davidson worries about the kids learning the Howard Zinn version. I wonder if those who learned the old-school version of American history realize just how many different groups shaped America from its earliest days. (The negative and in some cases furious reactions to that piece always surprised and baffled me. Who gets angry over discussion of Crispus Attucks, Maximiliano Luna, the Manilamen who fought alongside Andrew Jackson, Haym Salomon, Hadji Ali, or the Harlem Hellfighters? Why is there this perception that history is a zero-sum game, and that discussion of the achievements and bravery of nonwhite Americans somehow takes away from the discussion of the achievements and bravery of white Americans?) You know I’ll be telling the kids today about Canton-born Joseph Pierce fighting at Pickett’s Charge . Your understanding of what made America is going to have an enormous impact on how you see the country today, and how you think it should be in the future. The slogan “Make America Great Again” assumes a certain understanding of history — that in some past era America was great, that it lost that greatness, and that electing a particular president is the right step to restore that greatness. Is the Stage Getting Set for a ‘Law and Order’ Comeback? By and large, crime is a second-tier issue at the national level — certainly compared to the 1980s and 1990s. Advocates of criminal justice reform have scored significant policy victories at the federal and state level. But Michael Graham wonders if the pendulum might be swinging too far in that direction, and we may be headed towards a correction. "

Trump’s announcement, made Thursday on Twitter, called for a 5 percent tariff on all products from Mexico to take effect on June 10. On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,..

The U.S. will progressively raise tariffs to 25 percent by October if Mexico refuses to take action on immigration, according to the White House.
“Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,” the White House said.
American companies Ford and Walmart trade heavily wit Mexico. About 6 million American jobs rely on trade with Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce."

Senator Elizabeth Warren was on that great forum of political philosophy, The View , talking up her plan to confiscate the total assets of certain well-off Americans at a rate of 2 percent annually. She argues that this tax can pay for . . . almost everything: writing off college loans, paying for raises for certain workers, etc. She did not go so far as to claim that it turns a sandwich into a banquet , but she’s well into huckster territory.

The problem: Senator Warren’s claims about the wealth tax almost certainly are not true .
Harvard’s Professor Lawrence Summers estimates that the Warren wealth-confiscation scheme would raise somewhere between 12.5 percent and 40 percent of what Warren claims. Her estimates are, amusingly enough, partly based on some old-school self-financing voodoo, for example claiming that the taxes would help to pay for themselves by encouraging certain kinds of additional economic activity by supplementing the incomes of favored Democratic constituencies. (The Republican superstition of self-financing tax cuts is the GOP version of the same wishful thinking.)"
GMO Fungus Mass Kills Malaria Mosquitoes | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J.

Genetically modified organisms offer so much potential to save lives, improve the environment, and generally promote a more prosperous and healthier future. For example, “ golden rice ” –genetically modified to contain vitamin A — promises to be a great preventative of blindness and death for destitute children in the developing world.
In the latest example, scientists have genetically modified a fungus that infects malaria mosquitoes to contain lethal spider venom. In a controlled test, the population of these dangerous insects collapsed once the GMO fungus was introduced into the population. From the BBC report :
A 6,500-sq-ft fake village – complete with plants, huts, water sources and food for the mosquitoes – was set up in Burkina Faso. It was surrounded by a double layer of mosquito netting to prevent anything escaping. A so-called “mosquitosphere” tests the fungus in real-world conditions, without releasing it into the wild
The fungal spores were mixed with sesame oil and wiped on to black cotton sheets. The mosquitoes had to land on the sheets to be exposed to the deadly fungus. The researchers started the experiments with 1,500 mosquitoes.
The results, published in the journal Science, showed numbers soared when the insects were left alone. But when the spider-toxin fungus was used, there were just 13 mosquitoes left after 45 days.
That success presents us with an astounding opportunity to save lives without using pesticide, which is more environmentally friendly. Making the development of the GMO fungus a more urgent priority, malaria mosquitoes are developing resistance against existing poisons and infection rates are increasing."

Historians Misread Justice Thomas’s Box Concurrence? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ed Whelan,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/historians-misread-justice-thomass-box-concurrence/,"Follow Ed Whelan on Twitter May 31, 2019 10:52 AM
This Washington Post article presents seven historians of the eugenics movement who criticize Justice Thomas’s account, in his concurring opinion in Box v. Planned Parenthood , of the historical link between abortion and eugenics. But it seems to me that they are mistaking Thomas’s account of that link.
According to the article, the historians say that “leading eugenicists and organizations of the day were largely opposed to abortion and birth control.” (My emphasis.) That proposition is entirely compatible with Thomas’s statement that “ some eugenicists believed that abortion should be legal for the very purpose of promoting eugenics.” (My underlining; Thomas’s italics.) Thomas supports his statement with citations. (I quote the passage in full here .) Do any of Thomas’s critics believe that his citations don’t support his statement? Advertisement Advertisement
More broadly, Thomas’s argument that “[f]rom the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics” is much more a statement about the role of eugenic thinking among early advocates of abortion and birth-control than it is a statement about the role of abortion and birth control in the eugenics movement. The article doesn’t indicate that the historians who criticize him are paying attention to that distinction.
The article further states that “many of the historians were quick to point out that abortion—a personal choice by an individual—differed significantly from the state-mandated programs foisted involuntarily on others by eugenicists.” But Thomas doesn’t contend otherwise. He argues, rather, that “abortion has proved to be a disturbingly effective tool for implementing the discriminatory preferences that undergird eugenics.” Further, one can recognize that government-enforced eugenics present a special evil and be concerned at the same time about the aggregate eugenic consequences of individual choices. (I discuss the latter more fully in point 2 of this post .) Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelanEPPC "

The Illinois House of Representatives has voted to legalize the possession and sale of cannabis to residents over the age of 21, making it the eleventh state to establish a recreational-cannabis market.
The legislation , which passed in a bipartisan 66–47 vote, will now go to the desk of Governor J.B. Pritzker, who campaigned on a platform of cannabis legalization and has said he will sign it.
“This will have a transformational impact on our state, creating opportunity in the communities that need it most and giving so many a second chance,” Pritzker said in his statement.
Under the new legislation, which will take effect January 1, Illinois residents over the age of 21 can possess up to 30 grams of cannabis, 5 grams of cannabis concentrate, or a cannabis-infused product containing 500mg of THC, while nonresidents can possess up to 15 grams of cannabis.

A dvocates of laws permitting late-term abortion have pushed the boundaries too far by advocating for late-term abortion — essentially, infanticide. They have no one but themselves to blame for the recent passage of conservative pro-life legislation that aims for protection of life at all stages.
They have publicized truly tragic cases to justify third-trimester abortion. The New York Times , for example, leading the call for New York’s liberalization of its 1970 abortion law, ran the story of Erika Christensen. She discovered in her 30th week of pregnancy that her child suffered from a birth defect that would cause him “to choke to death minutes after birth.” New York’s law was already the most permissive in the country. It allowed abortion “on demand” up to 24 weeks’ gestation and prohibited it after that except to preserve the mother’s life. Christensen had to travel to Colorado for the abortion. Similarly, Christian Cauterucci, in “The Case for Third-Trimester Abortions,” in Slate , described similar cases of children who would be unable to survive long after birth.

In reality, hard cases like Christiansen’s are exceedingly rare. Most late-term abortions are performed for no real reason. None need be given, except a physician’s belief that a continuation of pregnancy would cause psychological stress. This was part of the fraud of the New York Times ’ presentation. No change in the New York State law was necessary to accommodate Christiansen’s case. If her physician had performed the abortion because he deemed the pregnancy dangerous to her psychological health, he would have been perfectly safe under repeated Supreme Court rulings. It was not the law that compelled her to travel to Colorado to find a physician who would perform a late-term abortion. It was rather the unwillingness of more than a handful (four who admit it) of physicians to do so.
Moreover, such cases are really cases of euthanasia; the same reasons that might justify killing before birth could be given for killing after birth. This is what Virginia governor Ralph Northam meant when he said infamously that the fate of children who survived abortions would be decided by a “discussion” between mother and physician.

The presentation of these cases raises the question: If late-term abortions need to be justified , why don’t all abortions? Advocates for unlimited abortion rights have undermined the argument for abortion rights generally. Advertisement
Before Roe v. Wade imposed a national abortion code, every state permitted abortions for “therapeutic” reasons, maternal life (as in the 1970 New York law) being the most common. The American Law Institute drafted a model law that about a dozen states adopted in the late 1960s. It added cases of rape, incest, fetal deformity, and — the kicker would become the basis of “abortion on demand” — maternal health, including psychological health. But these laws required that more than one physician, or that a hospital committee, review the reasons and approve the abortion. This policy reflected the commonsense understanding that the taking of a human life required justification.
These authorities authorized very few abortions and left abortion advocates disappointed with the new laws. That led them to call for the repeal of all abortion laws (today’s NARAL was then the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws — same acronym), which the Supreme Court effectively gave them in Roe. The truth was that by the middle of the 20th century there were seldom any physical reasons for therapeutic abortions. Alan Guttmacher, one of the founding fathers of the abortion-rights movement, admitted as much in the 1950s. Advertisement
Americans did not understand how extensive Roe was, and they still do not. Justice Harry Blackmun, the author, allowed that states could permit only licensed physicians to perform abortions. Chief Justice Warren Burger insisted that the case did not amount to “abortion on demand.” Commentators at the time and since then have inaccurately claimed that the case permitted only “early abortions.” Advertisement
We’ve been through this fog of deception many times before. The New York Times and other media outlets routinely exaggerated by an order of magnitude the number of women who died from illegal abortions before Roe . Pro-abortion-rights historians have repeated these claims. (The number of women killed by abortion has probably increased since legalization.) No realm of truth has suffered more than history, as professional historians repeatedly prostituted themselves in an effort to convince the Court that abortion was a traditional common-law liberty, or that 19th-century abortion laws were intended to protect maternal health, not fetal life."
Scripps Annual Spelling Bee: Eight Co-Champions | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mary Spencer,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/scripps-national-spelling-bee-eight-champions/,"About Mary Spencer May 31, 2019 6:54 PM From left: Shruthika Padhy, 13, of Cherryhill, N.J.; Erin Howard, 14, of Huntsville, Ala.; Rishik Gandhasri, 13, of San Jose, Calif.; Christopher Serrao, 13, of Whitehouse Station, N.J.; Saketh Sundar, 13, Clarksville, Md.; Sohum Sukhatankar, 13, of Dallas, Texas; Rohan Raja, 13, of Irving, Texas; and Abhijay Kodali, 12, of Flower Mound, Texas, celebrate their eight-way tie in the final round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee in National Harbor, Md., May 31, 2019.

What does a photodynamic South-African sheep disease (Geeldikkop), navel-gazing hesychastic prayer (omphalopsychite), and Dionysian theatre altars of antique Greece (thymele) have in common? Frankly, not much. But each word from which these definitions derive featured in the 92nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee.
This year stood out not merely for the number of words with enough syllables to make any red-blooded American sweat, but for the final number of champions. Advertisement Advertisement
The bee began on Sunday, with 562 competitors, all of whom were no more than 15 years old or beyond eighth grade, and concluded yesterday. On Thursday, May 30, at the 17th of 20 rounds, for the first time in a long time, the dictionary seemed to have met its matches.
Dr. Jacques Bailly, who has been the official pronouncer of the Scripps Spelling Bee since 2003, declared to the finalists: “we’re throwing the dictionary at you and so far, you are showing the dictionary who is boss.”
At the end of the 20 rounds, there were still a total of eight co-champions: Rishik Gandhasri; Erin Howard; Saketh Sundar; Shruthika Padhy; Sohum Sukhatankar; Abhijay Kodali; Christopher Serrao; and Rohan Raja. Advertisement
When Erin Howard received her final word, erysipelas, the name of a bacterial skin infection, she nearly wept with joy. Surely one of few people to react to that word without consternation or confusion. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
There have been co-champions in previous years, but never as many as eight at once. Some spelling bee veterans expressed disapproval following the result. Rahul Walia, the founder of the South Asian Spelling Bee, said that “this would never happen at my bee…They need to use harder words. The words are available.” Advertisement
Although it is true that many of the roots of the words used in the final rounds were traceable, and the bee featured few totally etymologically ambiguous or anomalous words, another cause of this year’s surfeit of successful spellers is also likely the formalization of studying techniques.
Scott Remer, author of Words of Wisdom: Keys to Success in the Scripps National Spelling Bee , commenting on the extraordinary end to the bee, told the Atlantic that “a great speller not only knows a lot of words, but can basically spell even words they haven’t practiced before—because they understand the logic and the languages, and they’re able to apply word roots to novel words that they run across.” Advertisement
Supposedly with the help of Remer’s book and devoted tutors, more and more children have mastered the formula for bee success, hence the octo-champions. Advertisement
No matter the explanation, more nimble spellers seems like a boon to us all. And besides the satisfaction of a job well done, each winner will receive a $50,000 prize.
Congratulations! Felicitations! Accolations! And so on and so forth, et cetera, et cetera."
Jeff Koons’ ‘Rabbit’: What a $91 Millions Sculpture Says about the Art World | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Matthew Scully,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/what-a-91-million-inflatable-bunny-sculpture-says-about-the-art-world/,"June 1, 2019 6:30 AM Jeff Koons sculpture Rabbit (Courtesy Christie's/Handout via Reuters) The success of Jeff Koons is worth pondering, even if his works aren’t.
I t’s not often I stop in my tracks on hearing news from the world of modern art, but the other day brought an amazing story and an image I just can’t shake. At a Christie’s auction, for $91 million, an unknown buyer laid claim to a metal sculpture resembling a rabbit-shaped balloon. The sales fee alone was $10 million, headlines announced The Most Expensive Work Ever by a Living Artist, critics marveled at the piece — “this deathless bunny cast in silver steel” — and to begin processing all of this, well, you simply have to see the Rabbit . Advertisement
To prepare bidders for the experience, as Fortune captures the scene, “the piece occupied a temple-like rotunda at Christie’s, displayed in blazing white light on a pedestal under an oculus.” The auction house’s lot essay reflected on the “inscrutability” of the work: “The steel surface of the titular bunny initially appears smooth and balloon-like, the forms reduced to some abstract, Platonic ideal.”
No mere sculpture, explained Christie’s chairman of contemporary art, the three-foot-high Rabbit stands for “the end of sculpture and the antithesis of ‘the perfect man,’ Michelangelo’s David.” How so? Well, David “is young, he’s muscular, he has long arms, strong legs. He’s carved by one of the greatest artists of all time with a chisel, out of one block of the purest white marble. The end of this is not a computer screen because that’s not a carved figure. The end is a small bunny.’” Advertisement
The creative force giving rise to such insights is one Jeff Koons, a big name in “conceptual art” who brought forth the Rabbit back in 1986 — although, we’re assured by a New York Times art critic, “it continues to speak to us.” His works over the years have fetched some $600 million. This includes an auction price of $58 million for Balloon Dog (Orange) , rendered in a fashion similar to the bunny, and $22 million that someone parted with in exchange for a ten-foot-high aluminum sculpture duplicating a mound of Play-Doh. A departure from Mr. Koons’s “Inflatables” series using balloon toys, cartoon figures, and commercial and sexual images, Play-Doh , Christie’s noted, evokes “childhood memories of play and creativity — that age before the constraints of taste and learning have been imposed.”
“Conceptual” captures more than Mr. Koons’s feats of imagination. Apparently, much of the actual labor is done by a sizeable production staff of painters, fabricators, engineers, and other assistants along with contractors, leaving the master to oversee their progress or to concentrate on his next inspiration. An exception would be the artist’s “Made in Heaven” series prepared (in his “Early Work” phase) for the Whitney Museum, in which his hands-on participation consisted of featuring himself and his soon-to-be wife in various pornographic pictures. This was celebrated as a daring assault on the conventions of artistic taste, a “recontextualizing” of the public and private, or something along those lines. Advertisement
If the uninitiated do not detect much creativity in any of the pieces themselves, there’s certainly enough of it in the writings of art critics who strain to make us see why Mr. Koons and his $91 million piece are so very “important.” They read like entries in a college essay contest in which students are required to reach 1,000 words or more with as much as can possibly be said about the artistic merits of a balloon rabbit. Inspecting the object, a Guardian critic observes that “there is indeed something special about the contrast symbolised by the heaviness of the material used for each statue, and the seeming lightness the motifs give the impression of.” The sum effect is profoundly “counterintuitive.” One might even call it, with the Washington Post ’s critic, “a compelling proposition about tensions in our culture between mass popularity and seriousness, between art and kitsch, and between pleasure and shame.”
In so many ways, says the Times writer of Mr. Koons, “he changed the way we see the world, elevating overlooked objects, like inflatables — sometimes giving them a startling, disturbing gravity, and other times just making them bigger, not better.” Perhaps this is why, after learning of the balloon rabbit, I couldn’t stop thinking about it:
because the strongest works imprint themselves on our visual memories with a striking if uneasy singleness. The various curved forms of the “Rabbit” — head, torso and legs — function as a cascade of concave mirrors. Often compared to an astronaut, the creature is at once alien and cute, weirdly sinister and innocent, weightless and yet armored. The idea that something is inside, or nothing is, is equally disturbing. “Rabbit” is intractable, a little warrior, yet it also vanishes into its reflections, which are full of us looking at it.
All so “disturbing,” an accolade in these circles, and naturally even in their ruminations about the silly rabbit we’re not going to get by without mention of some deep, uneasy cultural connection to Donald Trump. Yes, concludes the Post critic, while the Rabbit might “succeed as art,” in the unorthodox style, “Koons effected in art what President Donald Trump effected in politics: He choreographed a total collapse of the distinctions between achievement, fame, wealth, taste and success.” But art critics, like silver bunnies, can vanish into their own reflections, and Republican presidents are a mainstay of the genre whenever cultural decline is the theme. Of Mr. Koons it was said in 2005, by the rare critic who wasn’t impressed: “You can’t imagine America’s singularly depraved culture without him. He fits into Bush’s America the way Warhol fitted into Reagan’s.”
Actually, if there’s political insight to be gleaned from all this, it probably has more to do with inflatable reputations, gullible audiences, and the spell of progressive groupthink — problems that grow only more hopeless with money. If you left the Rabbit on a curb, no one would steal it, but set it in that temple-like rotunda under the blazing light, declare it the “end” or “antithesis” of something or other, applaud its defiance of convention, its challenging of Western norms, etc., etc., and the bidding can start at $40 million.
The decadence of modern, post-modern, avant-garde, “shock” art, or whatever we’re now supposed to call such works, is always easier to see than its temptations. “Subjectivity” is a favorite word of devotees, in frequent reminders that our standards of taste, excellence, beauty, or decency might not be shared by others. And maybe part of the thrill is just to give offense with impunity. Take, for example, those early porno works by Mr. Koons, displayed to this day in the National Gallery of Scotland. What’s so brilliantly achieved in the collection, we read at the gallery’s website, is “blurring the boundaries between fine art and pornography,” leaving the unfortunates who wander by “to make their own decisions about what is acceptable.” Doubtless the drawing power of all such works is as over-hyped by museum curators as the art itself. And to the extent they have a hold on anyone, the Guardian ’s critic probably comes closest to the mark:
Koons’s whole aesthetic . . . puts everything on exactly the same level as anything else: the classical sculpture and the Disney ballerina, the basketball, the pig and the baby Jesus. Nothing is greater or lesser or more significant: not the smart new Hoover or the martyred saint. And the works . . . put past and present on equal footing.
That’s the “aesthetic,” although the critic doesn’t catch its most subversive, counterintuitive effect of all: It takes some real doing to reduce so many intelligent people to the level of defending vulgarity and nonsense, and of discoursing on the meaning of Play-Doh and the like as if they were beholding the Pietà .
Such a waste of talent all around, including no doubt Mr. Koons’s. And never mind putting “past and present on equal footing”: They’d all be better off reflecting on the judgments posterity will make. Taking the Christie’s chairman up on his absurd pairing of Michelangelo’s David with the Rabbit , we know that the former has held up pretty well over time, as an achievement of art and humanity. How’s that silver bunny going to look in a few hundred years, if anyone by then even knows where to find it? Advertisement"
'Play It Loud': Metropolitan Museum’s Rock & Roll Exhibit A Worthwhile Affair | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/play-it-loud-instruments-of-rock-and-roll-metropolitan-museum-exhibition/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter June 1, 2019 6:30 AM Guitarist Don Felder with a Gibson double-neck guitar, which is featured in Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll (Courtesy Michael Helms) One lesson from the Met exhibit is that rock matters — or at least that it mattered.
A n exhibit devoted to artists’ tools seems beside the point; it’s the work that was produced with them that matters, isn’t it? We want to see Rembrandt’s paintings, not his paintbrushes. Nor would those brushes look much different from Picasso’s.
Ah, but the stories told by the objects in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibition Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll ! Some of them are beautiful, some are strange, some are aggressively homely. But they’re not just objects. They’re also cultural signifiers. We know them not just for the music that came out of them but for the cultural freight they carry. Advertisement Advertisement
The instruments of Bruce Springsteen, Jimmy Page, Pete Townshend, the Edge, Keith Richards, Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, and many other rock musicians make for a thrilling collection (running through October 1) that has drawn upwards of 200,000 visitors to the Met. Curators were expecting the crowd to consist mainly of Baby Boomers but have been pleasantly surprised by the enthusiasm shown by young adults, teens, and even children. As I was departing on Wednesday, the galleries were filling with fascinated high-school students. None of them were looking at their phones. Rock is not dead.
The power of the display hits you straight away, as forcefully as the opening chords of Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode.” The guitar upon which Berry played them serves as the introduction to the exhibition, mounted on a plinth that cheekily refers to the similar ones upon which the facing Roman statues rest in the adjacent hall. Berry, Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix: contemporary analogues for the Roman gods. Here are the weapons with which they conquered civilizations: “Love Drops,” the Flying G Gibson upon which Hendrix played “All Along the Watchtower.” “Micawber,” the 1954 Fender Telecaster that Richards got as a 27th-birthday present from Clapton and played on Exile on Main Street , its E string removed and the remaining five tuned in open G to create a distinctive sound. “Frankenstein,” Eddie Van Halen’s jury-rigged monster, a hybrid of Gibson and Fender parts the musician cobbled together himself, decorated with spray paint and strips of tape. Bruce Springsteen’s 1953–54 Esquire Telecaster, the one slung behind him on the back cover of Born to Run. “Blackie,” the Stratocaster Clapton bought in Nashville in 1970, liking it so much he bought three more Stratocasters for his pals Pete Townshend, Steve Winwood and George Harrison. One of the songs Clapton recorded on Blackie was “Cocaine,” but he sold the instrument at auction to fund the Crossroads Centre — where people go to deal with their cocaine problems. Advertisement
Individual items are chapters in the medium’s history: Here is the guitar upon which Bob Dylan famously went electric at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. There is the Martin upon which Eric Clapton played his shocking acoustic version of “Layla,” on MTV Unplugged in 1992, inaugurating an era of contrarian reconsiderations of Baby Boomer classics. The sole surviving poster for a teen skiffle group called The Quarrymen, from 1959, takes its place on a wall of delightful artwork. Their successor band is represented by Ringo Starr’s drum kit and Harrison and John Lennon’s guitars from around the time the Beatles played The Ed Sullivan Show . McCartney’s bass from that era is not available; he’s still playing it. Advertisement Advertisement
That the musicians remain loyal to such ancient instruments down the decades brings up an intriguing detail: Despite all of its ex nihilo poses and Year One lyrics, rock is a medium of deep respect for the past. To a man, rockers venerate their elders, beginning with Berry and Muddy Waters, and so on across generations. Each of these musicians consciously added to the great palimpsest that is rock, instead of starting with a blank sheet. Even their acts of destruction were performative — show business. Sometimes they were gestures of respect: Here is a guitar Kurt Cobain played at a 1993 concert at which Van Halen was present. Cobain went backstage and had a tech drill holes in the instrument so he could smash it up on stage and in so doing impress the senior man. Rock’s anger was a marketing gimmick, just as diplomat’s son John Graham Mellor would assume the role of nihilist punk Joe Strummer. (The Clash founder’s 1966 Fender Telecaster, plastered with stickers, looks suitably like it was born in a junkyard.) Staging his guitar-demolishing act solely for the cold-blooded purposes of a promotional photo shoot, Townshend destroyed a Gibson SG Special as Annie Leibovitz snapped away for Rolling Stone in 1977. The bits have been put together and encased in a block of Lucite. Destruction gets honored by preservation.
One superfluous if understandable choice the Met has made is to play over its visitors’ heads snippets of classic rock. Hearing only a few seconds of each track is irritating, and in the poor acoustical environment it ventures close to being noise. Between two rooms I had the unpleasant sensation of hearing “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “Gimme Shelter” at the same time, each one clanging harshly against the other. The Museum should have left the soundtrack to the audio tour. Advertisement"
Benjamin Netanyahu’s Future in Doubt | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/benjamin-netanyahu-israeli-government-politics/,"June 1, 2019 6:30 AM Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrives at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, May 5, 2019. (Abir Sultan/Pool via Reuters) A second election could reshuffle Israel’s political deck.
I srael’s political system was derailed this week over a conflict between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews over national service. Or at least that was the reason given by Avigdor Lieberman, the politician whose hard-line stand in favor of requiring the ultra-Orthodox to serve in Israel’s military — as does the rest of the population — prevented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming a government despite apparently winning election to a fourth term. Advertisement Advertisement
But, as with political conflicts in any democracy, it’s not quite that simple.
The refusal of Lieberman and his Israel Beitenu party to join the coalition Netanyahu had assembled, despite having run in the April 9 election on a pledge to join the prime minister, effectively erased what had seemed like a decisive victory for the Likud.
When Israelis elect their Knesset, or parliament, they don’t vote for individual members in districts. Instead, they cast a single ballot for one of the host of political parties representing every conceivable political, religious, and ethnic constituency. Any party that passes the cutoff point for entry into the Knesset — a mark that has varied over the years but is currently set at 3.25 percent of the total vote — gets a proportional share of the 120 total seats up for election. That has made it virtually impossible for any single party — no matter how mainstream its appeal — to attain a majority on its own. That’s why every Israeli prime minister since the country’s founding has been forced to assemble a coalition of like-minded or at least compatible factions in order to get to the 61 votes that would enable them to govern. The system has functioned because the various parties are members of blocs; they compete with each other for influence but join together once the election is over.
Thus, it was assumed that Lieberman’s party would join with Netanyahu’s Likud. But Lieberman, who once was a personal aide to Netanyahu and has served as foreign minister and defense minister over the course of the last decade of Likud-led governments, had other ideas. Without the five votes of Lieberman’s faction, Netanyahu was stuck at 60, one short of a majority. And no amount of persuasion or inducements, including offers of office, could get any members of the opposition to give him the ability to govern. Advertisement Advertisement
Netanyahu could have chosen, as is the tradition, to respond to this dilemma by having Israel’s president ask someone else to take a shot a getting a majority. But Netanyahu had no intention of allowing Benny Gantz — the former general who heads the Blue and White party, which tied the Likud for the most seats in April but doesn’t have enough smaller allies to get to 61 votes — a chance at the job. So instead, Netanyahu asked and got a majority of the Knesset — which had been sworn in only a few weeks ago — to vote to dissolve itself and hold new elections in September.
For all of the chaos and unseemly wrangling that usually attends Israeli coalition-building, nothing like this has ever happened before. And as angry as the voters may be at the waste of time, effort, and money that will go into holding a second national election, it’s not clear whether the results will change. Advertisement
There is a perception that Netanyahu, who has stood atop Israel’s political world virtually unchallenged over the course of the last ten years, has been weakened and may be nearing the end of his time as Israel’s leader. And it is that weakness, rather than any devotion to principle, that induced Lieberman to send the country careening down this path. Advertisement
Lieberman’s party has always been perceived as an offshoot of Likud that appealed directly to voters who were, like its leader, immigrants from the former Soviet Union. They are mostly secular, and like the rest of the country’s non-religious population, they deeply resent the fact that — stemming from a deal made with the ultra-Orthodox by David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first prime minister — religious young men who are enrolled in Torah-study programs are exempt from the military draft to which all non-Arab Israelis, male and female, are subject. In Ben Gurion’s time, the arrangement affected only a small number of potential draftees, but now, due to the growing ultra-Orthodox population — a group that is distinct from those who consider themselves Modern Orthodox and enthusiastically embrace the obligation of national service — involves tens of thousands of men. Given the political clout of the parties that represent this group, change has been impossible.
But while the issue is a legitimate sore point for voters, Lieberman’s stand was hypocritical. The bill that he insisted Netanyahu pass in the coming Knesset would not actually increase the number of people drafted. Lieberman has a record of cooperation with the ultra-Orthodox political parties, whose total of 16 Knesset seats makes them integral to any coalition Netanyahu might form, and he had expressed no interest in the issue when he was defense minister. Advertisement Advertisement
The real reason for Lieberman’s obduracy was his belief that Netanyahu will be taken down by the corruption investigation that is hanging over him. With a hearing scheduled now for October over three possible charges, it appears the only way for Netanyahu to avoid being indicted is for the next Knesset to vote to give prime ministers immunity from criminal charges while in office. While such immunity is far from abnormal in modern democracies, Netanyahu’s critics claim the passage of such a law would be a blow to the legitimacy of Israel’s system. With a majority, Netanyahu could probably have won approval for such a law, because his political allies — and the majority of the voting public — consider the charges against Netanyahu (which include dubious claims of attempted bribery of hostile media) to be too flimsy to justify his removal from office.
But by delaying the installation of a new government until after the October hearings that will finally decide whether Netanyahu will be indicted, Lieberman has likely ensured that an immunity bill can’t be passed until after the prime minister is formally charged. Though Israeli law doesn’t require him to resign under those circumstances, it remains to be seen as to whether he could actually govern. Advertisement
That sets up Lieberman as a potential kingmaker: He could possibly name Netanyahu’s successor, whether it is Gantz or, more likely, one of the prime minister’s colleagues in the Likud caucus."

(Courtesy Russell Collection of Vermontiana, Martha Canfield Memorial Free Library, Arlington Vt.) No myth maker, he accurately captured small-town Vermont life. I know, because I live in the town he often painted. F or the past few months, the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., has been traveling the Four Freedoms paintings by Norman Rockwell (1894–1978), which the museum owns. Rockwell finished them in 1943. They were quickly published in The Saturday Evening Post and became famous. The show, Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt, and the Four Freedoms , opens this week at the Museum of Fine Arts in Caen in Normandy as part of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on June 6. Also 75 years ago, in wartime America, these paintings travelled to department stores throughout the country as the calling card for the federal government’s most lucrative war-bond drive ever. It raised $133 million, equal to about $2 billion today. I’ll write this week and next about these four pictures. They’re the visual mission statement for America’s role in World War II. They’re also part of the visual vocabulary for most Americans thinking about what it means to be an American. My perspective is possibly unique, since as far as I know, I’m the only art historian in tiny Arlington in southwestern Vermont, where Rockwell lived when he made these images. I know for certain that I’m the only art historian from Arlington who both writes for National Review and knew many of the models Rockwell used. These pictures, as I’ll show, are very much products of the real Vermont as Rockwell experienced it when he lived here between 1937 and 1953. Rockwell visualized four subjects — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear — inspired by a 1941 speech President Franklin Roosevelt delivered before a joint session of Congress. Less than a year before the Pearl Harbor attack and as the European war raged, Roosevelt pitched what soon became the heart of America’s wartime mission statement. First, who saw these pictures? The better question is “who didn’t?” or, today, “who hasn’t?” They’re icons, and it’s worth asking, “icons of what?” The four paintings were done exclusively for publication in The Post , which commissioned the project by Rockwell, who worked as the magazine’s top illustrator. They appeared in the publication, America’s preeminent news and lifestyle periodical, over four weeks in 1943. The Post then had a circulation of about 3 million. Millions bought a special reprint of the series. The Office of War Information (OWI) distributed about 8 million posters advertising the government’s 1943 Series E war bonds. Since the end of the war, countless millions have seen the images, with Freedom of Speech for many years the symbol for the American Civil Liberties Union, before it abandoned its mission of championing unfettered free speech for defending only speech it likes."

What I want to say up front is: I love you. Okay, technically not all of you. Some I merely like. But as a collective, I cannot begin to express how much the National Review audience has meant to me over the years, starting in 1998 when I joined NR and started the Goldberg File (a blog before we had the word, then a column, then a “news”letter, and, soon, a dessert topping and a floor wax), straight through the launches of NRO, the Corner, and all the rest. I’ve made real and lasting friendships — in the meat space, not just in the digital space — with some of you, and I’ve learned a ton from a lot of you. Advertisement Advertisement
My appreciation for you, Dear Readers, is only exceeded by my appreciation for my friends and colleagues here at NR, starting of course with Rich Lowry. I often say he hired me to pay me back for saving his life in prison — WFB loved that joke — but the truth is, he took a flier on me early in his role as editor, and I’m eternally grateful for it. Advertisement
Speaking of Bill Buckley — another object of my eternal gratitude — he liked to say “Lowry, what were you thinking hiring this guy?” But he also liked to say, “Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius.” Really. He’d say it like it was a normal thing for a person to say. It roughly means to include is to exclude, and he often invoked the phrase to explain why he couldn’t thank everyone in attendance at a meeting or talk. There are so many friends and colleagues I am grateful for that if I start naming them, I’ll run the risk of forgetting someone or using up this entire “news”letter calling the roll of my indebtedness. Also, while I may be leaving the magazine, I’m not leaving the family. I’ll be staying on as a fellow at the National Review Institute and staying in touch with everybody. Even so, I feel like I’m amputating part of my soul. Okay, enough with that. Advertisement
If I keep going the pollen out here will only get worse. Advertisement
Down (And Up) With the French
One of the earliest traditions of NRO was, to put it bluntly, French-bashing. I used to write an annual Bastille Day G-File recounting the perfidy of what my longtime NR colleague John Miller called in a book by the same name “ Our Oldest Enemy.” Long before the anti-French boom during the lead-up to the Iraq war, I was quoting Groundskeeper Willie’s (of The Simpsons ) felicitous phrase, “cheese-eating surrender monkeys.” I became so associated with it that when the “freedom fries” folderol started, countless major news outlets attributed the epithet to me, even though I never claimed to have coined it. Advertisement
I bring this up because of a strange irony. As I head out the door, NR is caught up in an outpouring of pro-French sentiment. Of course, I don’t mean the country but the man ( mensch is a better label) David French. (Please buy my album, Rational and Seamless Segues Were Never My Bag, Baby .)
Sohrab Ahmari, a very decent fellow whose writings I’ve long admired, has been on quite an intellectual journey. Almost exactly two years ago, he wrote an insightful essay for Commentary entitled “Illiberalism: A Worldwide Crisis.” It was — to stick with the French theme — both a cri de couer and a tour d’horizon of the global crisis of faith in classical liberalism. “As an ideology and as a governing philosophy, liberalism is fast losing ground,” Sohrab warned. Russia’s Putin and Hungary’s Orban weren’t the only avatars in the rising tide of illiberalism, Sohrab wrote: “Trumpism (and Bernie Sanders-ism) are but the American symptoms of a global phenomenon: the astonishing rise of illiberal movements of the far right and far left.” They represented a pas de deux of illiberal convergence. “The strength of the Trump and Sanders presidential candidacies has revealed the hollowness of this liberal consensus in the 21st century.” Advertisement
No better proof of that hollowness can be found than Sohrab’s own metamorphosis. I am not accusing Sohrab of bad faith. His conversion to one form of illiberalism — or, if you prefer, anti-liberalism — is surely sincere and a byproduct of his good-faith Catholicism. But that just demonstrates the point. For Sohrab, to be a good Catholic, as he understands it, requires jettisoning – or again, in abundance of fairness, questioning — the classical liberal and civil-libertarian faith in pluralism that David French models in almost everything he does (though his fondness for Aquaman remains troubling). Advertisement Advertisement
But while I can’t gainsay Sohrab’s sincerity and personal decency, I also can’t adequately express my conviction of his profound error in analysis and strategy. The idea that David French — and the civility and decency he manifests daily — are what’s holding social conservatives back from “victory” in the culture war strikes me as one of the most preposterous claims to be taken seriously by intelligent conservatives in recent memory. I can’t really improve upon the replies by David himself and Charlie Cooke , and I really do like Sohrab, so I’ll just endorse what they said.
Victory You Can Taste but Never Swallow Advertisement
Instead, let me turn to the larger project Sohrab is associating with. The First Things crowd, and various allied parties, have become intoxicated with the bizarre notion that social conservatives can win the culture war if they lean into Trumpism, nationalism, and some of the worst caricatures of the Christian right. R. R. Reno, the editor of First Things , is giddy about the fact that Trump broke the old conservative consensus around limited government, free markets, individual autonomy, and the foundational metaphysical claims of the American Founding. He sees the New Deal as a nationalist attempt to impose social solidarity from above. And he’s right. He just celebrates the effort, while traditional conservatives do not.
Last March, Reno organized a group of intellectuals — some of whom I admire — to sign a manifesto of sorts. It drips with disdain for capitalism, or to be fair, it creates a platoon of strawmen, calls that “capitalism,” and then sets fire to it. Now, let me be clear: I agree with many of their concerns. Though Reno clearly didn’t bother to read my book before “reviewing” it, I wrote at great length about many of the problems they identify, including the role capitalism itself can play in eroding vital institutions, most importantly the family, organized religion, and traditional communities.
Still, my disagreement stems from what I think is a mix of bad analysis of the roots of the problem and worse thinking about what to do about it. As Sohrab often implicitly concedes, most of the outrageous assaults on religion don’t come from liberal democratic capitalism, but from the state. Capitalism didn’t attack the Little Sisters of the Poor, the state did. And as both Charlie and David note, the best and only available means of defending such victims are the tools provided by the liberal order and the Constitution. Religious liberty is a concept as close to being definitional of the American order as any I can think of.
The potted idea that a policy of right-wing statism — fight fire with fire! — is the solution rather than a compounding of the problem is deeply dismaying me to me. I’m reminded of my favorite exchange from A Man for All Seasons , in which the cinematic Thomas More (a different fellow than the real one) explains why rules matter:
Roper: So now you’d give the Devil benefit of law!
More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?
Roper: I’d cut down every law in England to do that!
More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned ’round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man’s laws, not God’s — and if you cut them down — and you’re just the man to do it — do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety’s sake.
Conceding the idea that the State should impose one faction’s conception of virtue on the entirety of the country is only a smart play (in the realpolitik sense) if you’re sure your faction is the one that gets to call the shots. When your faction is in the minority with few prospects of becoming the majority, it’s tantamount to turning the asylum over to the inmates.
Since David French set this whole thing off, I’ll use an analogy he’ll like. Like the Greyjoys in Game of Thrones , the First Things coterie are a belligerent band that is formidable only in proximity to their own shores. The farther they extend their forces, the weaker and ultimately ineffectual they become. They can dream of ruling, but they should recognize that’s all it is: a dream. In the larger game — i.e., the game of power — the best they can do is harass the enemy from their home base.
The idea that observant Catholics — a group I admire and sympathize with — can successfully win the culture war entirely on their terms is absurd, particularly if part of that strategy requires defenestrating the likes of David French — not to mention countless secular conservatives, traditionalists, and libertarians — for the sake of not theological or ideological purity but mere tactical consensus. David’s emphasis on “decency and civility” (Sohrab’s words) offers one of the only plausible ways of converting large numbers to the cause. More importantly: Since total victory is impossible, convincing the unconverted and unconvertible, that religious conservatives nonetheless deserve fair treatment and autonomy in a pluralistic society requires first convincing them that the religious right’s real objective isn’t to seize the commanding heights of the culture and turn their guns on the enemy. If average Americans, forget progressives, think the religious right wants to use the state to force everyone else to heel, the assault on religious liberty will only get worse.
But hey, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the First Things crowd has a brilliant plan for mounting a successful — and permanent–– benign, mildly theocratic takeover of all three branches of the government, the administrative state, as well as the universities, media, and state and local governments:
Step One: Purge the Frenchian Squishes
Step Two:
Step Three: Bask in “a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” (Sohrab’s words).
And let us just take two seconds to chuckle at the notion that Donald Trump is precisely the man to pull that off. Advertisement
Back to the Future
Now, I don’t think Sohrab’s utopian society, if achievable, would be such a terrible place. But “utopian” is a neologism that means “no place.” The only goal we can strive for is eutopia, which means “good place.” And the Founders believed that a good place was a polity where individuals were free to pursue an individual conception of happiness. You can argue that this idea has gone off the rails, as Sohrab does, and I’d have some sympathy. But let’s be honest about their proposed solution: to have the state impose on people its conception of virtue. Stay Updated with The G-File
Jim Geraghty's guided tour of the news and debates driving the day.
Replying, “Yeah, but that’s what the state is doing now and their definition of virtue sucks,” doesn’t require surrendering to the idea that the Right should do it too, throwing out the metaphysics of the founding in the process.
It’s a cliché to say that nationalism’s resurgence is a response to globalization. Obviously, there’s truth to that. Less discussed is the fact that American nationalism — both on the right and the left — is a response to, well, nationalization . What I mean by that is that technology has tended to make the nation smaller and more intimate. Distances are shorter. Media — social, cable, the Internet etc. — creates a national racket where the equivalent of small-town busybodies thrive. We feel like we’re living cheek by jowl with people who actually live thousands of miles away from us. This feeling arouses anger and animosity because we’re exposed to people we think are living wrong and that leads to the desire to use the state or Twitter mobs to make people live the right way.
On the left, this is a very old argument. Woodrow Wilson thought the Constitution had outlived its usefulness in an era with railroads and telegraphs. The whole of the country was now bound together and must now live as a single organic whole (George Will’s forthcoming book is excellent on this, and many other, points). Wilson repudiated the Constitution stem, branch, and root because the Madisonian vision of letting multiple factions bloom was inorganic and divisive. Progressivism, from the New Deal to the Great Society to Obama’s New Foundation, never shed this basically Wilsonian view. The only two important players on the board are the government and the individual whose first commitments and basic needs would be met by it. Classical liberalism doesn’t want a nation of Julias; modern liberalism does.
As I noted in my forthcoming conversation with George Will on CSPAN, what’s amazing to me is that at the precise moment conservatives are finally recognizing the moral horror of the Wilson administration, they are simultaneously adopting his premises.
The idea that a vast, and vastly diverse, continental nation can be united in a singular conception of national purpose that gives everyone a sense of meaning and belonging is just as ludicrous when ornamented with right-wing verbiage as it is when it comes out of the mouth of Wilson, Obama, or the vast horde running for the Democratic nomination. It’s even more dangerous because it would make the race to statism bipartisan, with no serious movement arguing for the ideas and ideals that made this country great.
Again, the solution isn’t to get the best right-wing technocrats to run the economy and the culture. It’s to deny the state the power to run either. Send power back to the communities where people live. If North Dakota wants to be a theocracy, that’s fine by me as long as the Bill of Rights is respected. If California wants to turn itself into Caligula’s court, I’ll criticize it, but go for it.
The enemy here is the state, because by aggrandizing to itself the power to tell people how to live, people put all of the blame on a far-off government in Washington — or even more distant “globalists” — for their problems. Federalism, part of the forgotten portions of the Bill of Rights, is the only system that lets the most people live the way they want to live, in communities they have power to influence and direct. In a real community, there are no faceless “powers that be.” There’s Phil and Sarah, or even Mom and Dad.
And the glorious thing about this kind of pluralism — i.e., for communities, not just individuals — is that if the community you’re living in isn’t conducive to your notion of happiness or virtue, you can move somewhere that is. We want more institutions that give us a sense of meaning and belonging, not a state that promises to deliver all of it for you. Advertisement
People are misdiagnosing the problem of social, institutional and familial breakdown. A healthy society is a heterogeneous one, a rich ecosystem with a thousand niches where people can find different sources of meaning or identity. A sick society is one where people find meaning from a single source, whether you call it “the nation” or “socialism” or any of the other brand names we hang on statism.
Heck, don’t call it federalism if that sounds too ickily modern to your ear. You can call it “ subsidiarity ,” a good Catholic word.
The bipartisan love affair with statism — whether it’s called nationalism or socialism — is simply a modern-sounding version of the old games of thrones from the past. Substitute Protestant for “progressive” and Catholic for “traditionalist,” and these fights would be recognizable to Europeans three or four centuries ago. The ideas being thrown around by the new nationalist conservatives aren’t new. The only new part is that conservatives , long the heroic defenders of the American Founding, are spouting them.

Well, I guess it’s only fitting that the final installment of this “news”letter ends with a sweaty rant written in nicotine-fueled haste with dogs constantly demanding my attention. I didn’t plan on this topic (because I never plan this thing), but I did choose it this morning because I think it addresses one of the central concerns of this “news”letter from the beginning: defending conservatism as I understand it.
Now, as my wife hears me say all too rarely, it’s time for some housecleaning. The G-File will live on . For the next few months (and possibly beyond) this “news”letter will only be available as an email newsletter.

I can’t really say that separating from the mothership will free me up to make it more outspoken because Rich always let me fly my freak flag any way I wanted in this space. But who knows what changes are in store?
So if you want a front-row seat for the adventure ahead, or if you feel like part of the Remnant and don’t want to feel so lonely, or if you agree with Rusty Reno that I “[exemplify] the decadence and dysfunction of today’s public discourse” and you crave such decadence

Perhaps Pippa’s forced independence from the mater familias is even causing her to stick up for herself more. The other day at the creek, she didn’t let the big dogs get her ball. The only problem is that the eau de chien after their midday visits to the creek can assault the nostrils with an almost Sex Panther intensity.

The Iraq War Was a Just Cause Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/iraq-war-just-cause-saddam-hussein-threat-stability/,"Follow David French on Twitter March 20, 2019 7:08 PM U.S. soldiers walk past an image of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Tikrit, Iraq, December 27, 2003. (Zohra Bensemra/Reuters)
Today is the 16th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, and Twitter is alive with condemnations of the conflict — countered by precious few defenses. Yet I believed the Iraq War was just and proper in 2003, and I still believe that today. When Donald Trump condemned the war during the 2015 primary campaign and claimed that if Saddam was still in power we “wouldn’t have the problems you have right now,“ I believed he was dead wrong . As I argued then, from the moment Hussein took power until he was deposed in 2003, there were few greater instruments of instability in the world than Saddam Hussein. Advertisement Advertisement
Before he was allegedly “contained” by constant, substantial American military deployments, he invaded his neighbors, gassed his people, harbored and supported terrorists, and was responsible for not one but two of the largest conventional military conflicts since World War II — the horrific Iran–Iraq war and Operation Desert Storm. Even after American containment efforts attempted to lock into place and limit his malign reach, he was a prime supporter of a deadly Palestinian suicide-bombing campaign that caused proportionately more Israeli civilian casualties than American civilians lost on 9/11, he tried to assassinate an American president — George H. W. Bush — and he routinely fired on American pilots enforcing lawful no-fly zones. He violated the Gulf War cease-fire accords, interfered with weapons inspections, and hid away chemical weapons by the thousands . No, his WMD program wasn’t nearly as extensive as we thought, but it is fiction to believe his weapons were entirely gone. Americans were injured by Saddam’s chemicals during the war.
Moreover, it’s easy to forget that before Barack Obama’s terrible decision to withdraw in 2011, the Iraq War had been won. Saddam was gone, the follow-on insurgency had been wiped-out — reduced to a few hundred fighters scattered in a vast country — and American and Iraqi forces were masters of the battlefield. Joe Biden asserted that Americans would look at Iraq as “ one of the great achievements of this administration .” But Obama withdrew too soon. He squandered American gains, opened the door to unrestrained factionalism, and left the fragile Iraqi nation vulnerable to renewed jihadist assault. Advertisement
And lest we think that non-intervention can’t also carry a terrible price, we can’t forget the Ba’athist dictator we left alone, Hafez al-Assad. His nation was caught up in the unrest and ferment of the Arab Spring — a movement that began far from the Iraq War. His nation has since become a charnel house, and not only did it spark a refugee crisis that has helped destabilize Europe, but it became the battleground where the remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq were reborn as ISIS, a genocidal force that invaded a weakened Iraq from Syria, ignited yet another phase of the Iraq War, and inspired a renewed wave of terror in the Europe (and deadly attacks in the United States). Non-intervention does not always bring peace, and the consequences can include death on a mass scale."

1992 —In Davis v. Davis , the Tennessee supreme court decides a battle between a divorcing couple over rights to their frozen embryos stored in a fertility clinic. Writing for the court, Justice Martha Craig Daughtrey undertakes a lengthy excursus that culminates in an ad hoc balancing test weighted strongly in favor of destruction of the human embryos: “Ordinarily, the party wishing to avoid procreation should prevail.…” Daughtrey extrapolates a state constitutional “right of procreational autonomy” from the provisions of the state constitution that protect freedom of worship, that prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures, that guarantee freedom of speech, and that regulate the quartering of soldiers in homes. She then relies on skimpy psychotherapy articles to concoct a right of a voluntary “gamete-provider” to avoid unwanted genetic parenthood. Advertisement
The obvious explanation for Daughtrey’s various frolics and detours is that Davis was decided weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court was expected—wrongly, as it turns out—to use its Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and to restore abortion policy to the democratic processes. By her opinion, Daughtrey contrives to establish a Tennessee version of Roe .

Trump's Mexico Tariffs: A Bad Idea | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,The Editors,06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/trump-tariffs-mexico-bad-idea/,"June 1, 2019 3:03 PM President Trump speaks during a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Calexico, Calif., April 5, 2019. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
P resident Trump believes, not without good reason, that the Mexican government is not doing its utmost to stop the illegal flow of Central Americans crossing the U.S. border. And so he has responded with . . . a $17 billion–a–year–and–rising sales tax on Americans.
The president loves tariffs. He believes that they are an effective means of protecting American firms from unfair overseas competition and a good negotiating tool as he works to reform trade agreements that he believes are disadvantageous to Americans. But the question of who ends up actually paying any given tax is complicated. The price of those tariffs, and the retaliatory tariffs they have provoked, is very high for American companies: For example, the tariffs Beijing imposed in response to Trump’s have cost American farmers an enormous part of their export market (half of exported U.S. soybeans used to go to China; the tariffs have been a gift to Brazilian producers), but the U.S. tariffs themselves are an enormous problem, too. Many American manufacturers import raw materials and components from abroad, and complex products such as automobiles and electronics may cross the border several times in the course of production. Advertisement Advertisement
A 5 percent tariff on Mexican goods would notionally amount to about $17 billion on U.S. imports from Mexico, touching everything from industrial components to fruit and crude oil. In reality, it is difficult to say how much money would be raised, because buyers respond to tariffs in unpredictable ways. In any case, many of those costs will be borne by American consumers and — this cannot be emphasized enough — American businesses that rely in some part on imported inputs. More important, it would cause uncertainty around a North American supply chain that has evolved organically over many years as the result of enormous investment by American companies and their business partners. Advertisement
President Trump envisions a tariff that will potentially ratchet up to 25 percent.
The president here is unnecessarily complicating his own life. He has just overseen the successful renegotiation of NAFTA, which will be reconstituted as the U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). But that agreement has not yet been ratified — not by the United States, and not by Mexico. Imposing punitive tariffs over a policy dispute unrelated to trade five minutes after negotiating a new trade pact makes the Trump administration — and the United States — look like an unreliable negotiating partner. Mexico is not wrong to resent it, and even Trump allies such as Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) are against him on this. Advertisement
Also, it’s a good rule of thumb to fight one trade war at a time. If the administration, correctly, wants to focus on China’s malign trade practices — and not just during the current dispute but over the long term — it needs good trading relationships with its allies, especially here in North America. Advertisement
Illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America is a significant problem, and President Trump did well to put it at the center of his agenda. Many of the policies he has proposed — walls, increased enforcement, changes in asylum policy — are worthwhile and would likely prove effective if implemented. But Congress isn’t interested in passing them, which has left the president to grasp for unilateral ways to solve the border crisis. Some of these are politically unsustainable or of dubious legality, e.g. the zero-tolerance policy and the unilateral spending under the emergency declaration.
Mexico has played ball with Trump on immigration policy more than anyone would have expected at the outset of his presidency, but there are limits to the Mexican government’s effectiveness and its willingness to subordinate its interests to ours. Ideally, we’d get Mexico to sign a “safe third country” agreement. That would allow us to exclude asylum-seekers who transit through Mexico on the basis that they should be applying in Mexico instead. Of course, Mexico has no incentive to make it possible for asylum-seekers to stay there instead of enabling them to quickly move on to the United States. Advertisement"
Elizabeth Warren's Corporatism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/elizabeth-warren-corporatism-progressive-ideological-ends/,"June 2, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren in Fairfield, Iowa, May 26, 2019. (Rachel Mummey/Reuters) The Left has endorsed a new form of corporate paternalism.
‘ C orporatism” is one of the most misunderstood words in the political vocabulary. American progressives use it to indicate the domination of the state by business interests, when in fact it means something closer to the opposite: the subordination of commerce and industry to political mandates.
Corporatism is a concept closely associated with the fascist government of Benito Mussolini. The word “fascism” surely has earned the stink attached to it, but it, too, is widely misunderstood as a body of policies. As George Orwell wrote back when fascism was still something of a going concern, the word “fascist” is used as very little more than a term of denigration. Advertisement
But the corporazioni of the Italian fascist model were not the profit-oriented private concerns we now call “corporations.” They were something closer to consultative associations, in which the interests of business owners, workers and workers’ organizations, and the Italian state were, in theory, all represented. The concept, which is a variation on socialist central planning, was that privately owned businesses were entitled to a profit, but not too much profit; that the workers were entitled to as much compensation and to such working conditions as were consistent with the overall health of the Italian economy and state; and that the state was entitled to coordinate these calculations and negotiate the related interests, and also entitled to have its interests trump those of either the business owners or the workers.
Fascism more or less disappeared as a brand name after that unpleasantness toward the end of the first half of the last century, but corporatism never really went away. The German workers’ councils that are much admired by many American progressives are corporatist undertakings; Senator Warren’s agenda is fundamentally corporatist. It would impose federal charters on businesses with more than $1 billion in revenue and empower the federal government to dictate to those firms the composition of their boards of directors, their compensation practices, the details of their internal corporate governance, their personnel policies, the scope and content of their political speech, and much more. She calls the legislation she is proposing the “Accountable Capitalism Act.” Advertisement
Accountable to whom ? There you have it. Advertisement
Using corporations as instruments of politics is attractive to politicians for many reasons, cowardice prominent among them. If Senator Warren wants to increase the purchasing power of low-income workers by $1 trillion, she could propose legislation that would entail the appropriation of money for this purpose and distribute that $1 trillion to the workers in question on any terms she saw fit. But that would bring with it difficulties: That $1 trillion appropriation would show up on the budget, which would mean an uncomfortable discussion about raising taxes to pay for it (Senator Warren has fanciful views about taxation, the progressive version of “voodoo economics”) or its contribution to the deficit (which is why the Obama administration leaned on the CBO to endorse, jaw clenched, its ludicrous claims about the debt-reducing features of the Affordable Care Act) and more. The politically expedient alternative to that is to impose a mandate on businesses to pay those workers an additional $1 trillion in wages or benefits, which shows up on the books as a regulation rather than as an expenditure . When government proposes to spend money, somebody — Senator Paul, Representative Amash — can be counted on to ask, “How do we pay for this?” The corporatist model says to businesses: “You can figure out how to pay for this.”
Subordinating business interests to political mandates in the matter of economic policy is old hat. But politics is more than a question of taxing and spending, and American progressives are now pushing corporatism to purely ideological ends, for instance by deputizing Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other tech companies to act as proxy censors to suppress political speech that progressives do not wish to be spoken, and using employers ranging from Silicon Valley giants to Starbucks and fast-food restaurants as enforcers of political discipline, dismissing senior executives and obscure food-service workers alike for their private political views and speech. The business corporation has become the disciplinary corporation, an instrument of direct social domination put to explicitly political and ideological ends. Advertisement
Sometimes the state takes the lead in this, as in New York Democrats’ authoritarian efforts to ruin the NRA financially by using New York’s regulatory whip hand over financial institutions to deny the advocacy group ordinary financial services. (Marijuana-based businesses face similar pressure, even when they operate in states where their business is legal.) Sometimes, progressive business owners take the lead, as in the case of Salesforce, which has announced that it will forbid certain companies that deal in firearms to use its software. As a purely libertarian question, Salesforce has every right to exclude businesses based on its own moral sense. (Set aside, for the moment, that progressives would deny the same license to firms such as Hobby Lobby, and even to explicitly religious organizations such as the Little Sisters of the Poor.) The convulsions of Facebook, which operates simultaneously under scores of local legal regimes and the pathologically homogeneous and homogeneously pathological political monoculture of seven very expensive ZIP codes in California, should alert us to the practical limitations of such a model. Advertisement
But there are larger concerns. To what extent do we want private corporations to function as the effective censors of political speech? At the moment, progressives are very comfortable with that, mostly because they believe, with some reason, that they can dominate those corporations and bully them into submission. To what extent do we want the welfare state offloaded to the corporate payroll and benefits departments rather than treated as a straightforward transfer? The fact that millions of Americans have been effectively held hostage by employer-based health-insurance plans shows one obvious downside to this model. Advertisement "

Matt Continetti has an excellent piece on the home page on the current splits on the Right. A theme of the column is that some of the factions, no matter how fervently they think they are correct and their colleagues or erstwhile colleagues wrong, don’t have any policy specifics to bring to the table. This is also one of the points Ramesh makes in his post on the contention over “French-ism.” Indeed, the intra-conservative debate over the last year has generally been bereft of such details, even as it has been incredibly impassioned and often poisonous. The questions, What and How? almost never appear, i.e., w hat policies are we talking about and how are we going to achieve them? In the Tucker Carlson populism–free market debate, almost no one on either side mentioned what might be affirmative policies to address working-class discontents and why we should support or oppose them — a re-imagining of high school, increased apprenticeships, wage subsidies, lessons from Germany’s experience making its workers more productive , etc. As for the Frenchism debate, it’s even more content-free because the anti-Frenchist side hasn’t, as far as anyone can tell, taken the first step to thinking through, What and How? So, we’re all effectively living in Irving Kristol Alcove 1 at CCNY in the 1930s, the site of doctrinal debates that may have been interesting and important — and produced some impressive people — but weren’t always closely tethered to the real world."
The Highwaymen Review- Netflix Movie Punctures Bonnie & Clyde Myths Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/the-highwaymen-chasing-bonnie-and-clyde/,"April 3, 2019 1:55 PM Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner in The Highwaymen (Netflix) The Highwaymen , just released on Netflix, punctures the myths surrounding the murderous Barrow gang.
T he Highwaymen , Netflix’s new manhunt film starring Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson, is a suspenseful and morally fraught take on the story of the ex–Texas Rangers who tracked down the most famous bank robbers of 1934. But this movie about chasing Bonnie and Clyde is also a movie about Bonnie and Clyde . It’s a pleasing tale of resourceful, hard-nosed cops that’s also something of an essay on cinema and society. Advertisement Advertisement
Arthur Penn’s 1967 cinematic landmark (which is also streaming on Netflix) launched an American New Wave of counterculture films about anti-heroes and misfits contesting a nefarious system. Penn’s successors painted a bleak leftist vision of America as a land of beautiful eccentrics destroyed by materialism, militarism, greed, conformity, and corruption. Exactly two decades after Bonnie and Clyde , though, Costner became a star in The Untouchables , which heralded a Reaganite restoration in which movies celebrated lawmen and the military as the good guys who brought order to chaotic times.
Retelling Bonnie and Clyde from the point of view of the actual heroes of the story is a superb idea that took far too long to come to screen. Hired by the governor of Texas, “Ma” Ferguson (Kathy Bates), aging ex-Rangers Frank Hamer (Costner) and Maney Gault (Harrelson) are given a special mandate to end a reign of terror that left 13 people dead, yet was celebrated as a romantic tale of sexy desperadoes who were folk heroes to the newspapers of the Great Depression and later easily adapted into symbols of Sixties liberation. Advertisement
Channeling Hamer’s rage and disgust, The Highwaymen attacks the myth of Bonnie and Clyde, who are seen only in glimpses. Far from robbing banks on behalf of hapless victims of the Depression, the Barrow gang mostly stuck to soft targets such as gas stations and grocery stores. Yet ordinary Americans were enthralled by the rebel legends and are seen concealing information to cover for the killers — though they were cheap, vicious cowards who would do anything for a buck. Governor Ferguson (Kathy Bates) replies to reporters pushing the Robin Hood narrative, “Did Robin Hood ever shoot a gas station attendant in the head for four dollars and a tank of gas?”
John Fusco’s shrewd and meditative script has fun trolling Bonnie and Clyde : The scene in the earlier film in which Bonnie dramatically reads aloud her poem about her life and anticipated death inspires a scene in which Hamer and Gault consider the same poem and note that it’s moronic. “Used to be, you had to have talent to get published. Now you just have to shoot people,” notes Gault. In another scene Gault just about has Clyde in his sights when the bandit’s car is suddenly mobbed by adoring fans. Advertisement Advertisement
Directed by the Texan John Lee Hancock, who tends toward warm, heartland-friendly films such as The Blind Side and Saving Mr. Banks , The Highwaymen falls far short of Penn’s visual style — the editing and cinematography are lackluster in the manner of a TV movie, and the new-looking sets don’t supply much Depression grit. Thomas Newman’s hokey score is also unfortunate.
Yet the film is alive with ideas. Its core is conservative in its determination to set the record straight about the relative values of law and order on one hand and unchecked narcissism on the other, but it departs from a major conservative principle. Like the heroes of Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, and Sylvester Stallone movies, the highwaymen take the law into their own hands in pursuit of these vicious lawbreakers. The ex-Rangers blithely stray far from their Texas jurisdiction, and Hamer beats up a gas-station attendant to make him talk. This may make for gratifying entertainment, but it’s also wrong.

Conservative PAC's Donation Scams are What's Wrong with Conservatism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-real-problem-conservatism-faces-today/,"June 3, 2019 9:37 AM Roger Stone speaks at the American Priority conference in Washington, D.C., December 6, 2018. (Jim Urquhart/Reuters) Making the click-through worthwhile: A rare single-topic Jolt this morning, as I’ve watched the two millionth “the problem with conservatism is people like you, the solution for conservatism is people like me” debate, and I’m just sick and tired of so many of our brethren averting their eyes from the big, glaring, worsening problem that rips off so many decent, hard-working folks. The Huge Albatross to the Conservative Movement that Few Want to Talk About Back in 2013 , Conservative StrikeForce PAC raised $2.2 million in funds vowing to support Ken Cuccinelli’s campaign for governor in Virginia. Court filings and FEC records showed that the PAC only contributed $10,000 to Cuccinelli’s effort. Back in 2014 , Politico researched 33 political action committees that claimed to be affiliated with the Tea Party and courted small donors with email and direct-mail appeals and found that they “raised $43 million — 74 percent of which came from small donors. The PACs spent only $3 million on ads and contributions to boost the long-shot candidates often touted in the appeals, compared to $39.5 million on operating expenses, including $6 million to firms owned or managed by the operatives who run the PACs.” Back in 2015, RightWingNews reviewed the financial filings of 21 prominent conservative PACs and found the ten 10 groups at the bottom of their list spent $54.3 million only paid out $3.6 million to help get Republicans elected. Back in 2016, campaign finance lawyer Paul H. Jossey detailed how some of the PACs operated and lamented , “the Tea Party movement is pretty much dead now, but it didn’t die a natural death. It was murdered — and it was an inside job. In a half decade, the spontaneous uprising that shook official Washington degenerated into a form of pyramid scheme that transferred tens of millions of dollars from rural, poorer Southerners and Midwesterners to bicoastal political operatives.” In 2016, Roger Stone founded the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. It raised $587,000 and spent $16,000 on independent expenditures supporting Trump . In 2016, Great America PAC raised $28.6 million from donors. They donated $30,125 to federal candidates. In 2018, Great America PAC raised $8.3 million from donors. They donated $31,840 to federal candidates. In 2017, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said that despite the actions of a PAC that claimed to be raising money for a Clarke bid for U.S. Senate, he was not running. That PAC raised $2 million . In 2018, a federal indictment declared grassroots conservatives across the country gave $23 million to scam PACs run by William and Robert Tierney from 2014 to 2018, believing they were supporting conservative groups like “Republican Majority Campaign PAC,” “Americans for Law Enforcement PAC,” and “Rightmarch.com PAC.” Only $109,000 went to candidates. In the 2018 cycle, Tea Party Majority Fund raised $1.67 million and donated $35,000 to federal candidates. That cycle, Conservative Majority Fund raised just over $1 million and donated $7,500 to federal candidates. Conservative Strikeforce raised $258,376 and donated nothing to federal candidates. Put Vets First PAC raised $3.9 million in the 2018 cycle; they gave $9,000 to federal candidates. Earlier this year , it was revealed that David Bossie’s group, Presidential Coalition, had raised $18.5 million in 2017 and 2018 to support state and local candidates in furtherance of the Trump agenda. Only $425,442, or 3 percent, went to direct political activity. Not every non-donation expense is illegitimate; legit political-action committees have to pay for rent, electricity, computers, the phone bill, etcetera. But when such an exceptionally small portion of the money they raise goes to the candidates they’re allegedly designed to support or measurable efforts on their behalf, one can fairly ask what the true purpose of the organization is. Politico didn’t specify which 33 PACs they reviewed; if their list overlaps entirely with the RightWingNews list, then the total sum listed above would be $127 million; if they don’t overlap at all, it would be $177 million. That is money that could have gone directly to candidates’ campaigns or other actions that would have advanced the conservative cause in recent cycles. But instead it went into more fundraising expenses, more overhead costs, or into the pockets of those running these PACs. And some folks want us to believe that the problem with the conservative movement is David French? Why is the conservative movement not as effective as its supporters want it to be? Because day after day, year after year, little old ladies get called on the phone or emailed or sent letters in the mail telling them that the future of the country is at stake and that if they don’t make a donation to groups that might as well be named Make Telemarketers Wealthy Again right now, the country will go to hell in a handbasket. Those little old ladies get out their checkbooks and give what they can spare, convinced that they’re making a difference and helping make the world a better place. What they’re doing is ensuring that the guys running these PACs can enjoy a more luxurious lifestyle. Meanwhile, conservative candidates lose, kicking the dirt after primary day or the general election, convinced that if they had just had another $100,000 for get-out-the-vote operations, they might have come out on top. What’s more, most of these PACs thrive on telling conservative grassroots things that aren’t true. Clarke didn’t want to run for Senate in Wisconsin, Laura Ingraham wasn’t interested in running for Senate in Virginia , and Allen West wasn’t running for Senate in Florida . The PACs propagate a narrative in which they’re the heroic crusaders for conservative values, secure borders and freedom, up against corrupt establishment elites . . . when they’re in fact run by those coastal political operatives and keeping most of the money for their own operations. Perhaps you’re thinking, “Oh, every PAC does this.” Nope. In that RightWingNews study , Club for Growth Action PAC had 88 percent actually went into independent expenditures and direct contributions. Republican Main Street Partnership had 78 percent, and American Crossroads was at 72 percent. That allegedly corrupt “establishment” is way more efficient at using donors’ money than all of these self-proclaimed grassroots conservative groups. Over on the liberal or Democratic side, ActBlue charges a 3.95 percent processing fee when passing along donations to campaigns. When these individuals get called out for the way they’re spending donors’ money, they revert to a familiar responses of denial, evasion, and blaming the messenger. When asked about how little of the money his group raised was spent on political activity, Bossie’s first response was “this is fake news brought to you by a collaboration of the biased liberal media and unabashed left-wing activists.” Never mind the fact that the criticism was based upon his own group’s periodic reports of contributions and expenditures with the IRS (forms 8872) in addition to annual tax returns (forms 990). Imagine if instead of disappearing down rat holes and being spent on more fundraising, just $10 million of that $127 million to $177 million sum had been better spent. Imagine if that $10 million had gone to the campaigns of the GOP candidates in the 20 House districts that they lost by five percentage points or less in 2018. That’s $500,000 per campaign. If Mia Love had 625 more votes in Utah, she would have held her seat. Think she and her campaign could have identified and mobilized another 700 Love-supporting voters in her district if they had another half-million? In California’s 21st District, David Valadao lost by about 900 votes. In Maine’s 2nd, Bruce Poliquin needed about 3,500 more votes. In Georgia’s 6th, Karen Handel needed 8,000 more votes. If Leonard Lance had about 16,000 more votes, he would have kept his seat. Maybe not every one of these close races would be reversed if each one of those GOP candidates had another half million for GOTV. But right now, Republicans need to flip 19 seats to regain control of the House. Doing just 2.25 percentage points better in 2018 would have saved 13 seats! What has grassroots donor money going to scam PACs cost the conservative cause? Perhaps GOP control of the U.S. House of Representatives , and now at least two years of Trump’s presidency will be spent on defense instead of attempting to turn conservative policy ideas into federal law. But hey, tell me again how David French’s “civility and decency” are what’s holding the conservative movement back! Like the drunk looking for his keys where the streetlight shines, some folks want to believe that the writer who annoyed them the most this morning must be the albatross that is dooming the Good Ship Conservatism. They’re either too lazy, too cynical, too incurious, or too scared to turn their scrutiny to lesser-known entities. Of course, assessing that folks like David Bossie and Roger Stone are part of a major impediment to the effectiveness of the conservative cause means criticizing people who are considered close to Donald Trump. And for far too many inattentive grassroots conservatives, an association with Donald Trump is a moral get-out-of-jail-free card — even when these guys are acting contrary to the president’s interests and putting their own self-interest first. There are a lot of self-proclaimed watchdogs that will find it easier and more convenient to bark at whatever talking head said something about Trump on Morning Joe that day rather than point out that former allies of the president are using his name to raise money and line their own pockets, diverting funds away from efforts that would actually help the president enact his agenda . If you’re a Trump supporter, you should be livid with these guys. So why the recent ire at David French? I suspect it is because David is a big easy target if you’re trying to win applause and attract the attention of Trump supporters. David thought about running for president as an independent for about 20 minutes in 2016, and a lot of folks want to believe he’s an amalgamation of Arlen Specter, Charlie Crist, and Benedict Arnold because of that. David French has jack squat to do with whatever nutty “Bi-curious George” drag-queen reading is going on at the Sacramento Public Library. But if you’re trying to show Trump supporters that you’re one of the good guys and you’re standing up against the weak quisling types, by golly, denounce David French — the guy who served his country in uniform in Iraq, sues universities when they restrict speech , and who adopted a child. Because he’s the real problem with conservatism, not all those groups that continue to send those letters emails and phone calls to little old ladies, telling them that the nation’s future depends upon them writing one more check. We can apply this beyond the realm of politics, as well. Why is America not enjoying a widespread revival of Christian values? There are a bunch of reasons, but we can start with televangelist Kenneth Copeland attempting to justify his purchase of a third private plane, a Gulfstream V . Copeland’s excuse was that flying commercial “like getting into a long tube with a bunch of demons.” I’m pretty sure I’ve sat next to the passengers he’s describing, and we all got through it okay.

The Court further rules that the opposing party has standing to assert the excluded juror’s equal-protection claim. Advertisement

Brooken College Accreditation System Almost Kills a Women's HBCU | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,George Leef,06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/our-miserable-college-accreditation-system-almost-kills-a-womens-hbcu/,"About George Leef June 3, 2019 11:18 AM
Our college accreditation system is ridiculous. It does nothing to ensure academic quality — no school ever loses accreditation because its curriculum is full of fluff courses or its academic standards are laughable — but sometimes the accreditors pounce on a school that’s in financial difficulty. They’ll warn the administration that it is on thin ice and put the school on probation for a couple of years. After that, unless there has been a turnaround, the accrediting bigwigs pull the plug. If a college is not accredited then it can’t receive any federal money, a virtual death sentence for many. Advertisement Advertisement
That’s the story of Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C. I write about it in today’s Martin Center article .
The accrediting agency involved, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, saw that Bennett was in serious trouble in 2016, with falling enrollments and rising deficits. It put Bennett on probation. After two years, SACS looked again and still saw a struggling school, despite an uptick in enrollment. Because its rules do not allow a school to remain on probation more than two years, it decreed that it was pulling its accreditation. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Bennett got a court order staying that decision, and went on a remarkable fundraising campaign, raising more than $8 million in less than two months. Wouldn’t that be enough for SACS to give the school a new lease on life? No. Advertisement"

A federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled Monday against House Democrats in their bid to block President Trump from reallocating Defense Department funds for the construction of his long-promised border wall.
U.S. district judge Trevor McFadden found that Congress should rely on a legislative approach to stop the president from funding the construction of his border wall through a national emergency declaration, rather than challenging the administration in court.
“Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,” McFadden wrote in the decision . “These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration’s planned construction of the border wall.”
Trump declared a national emergency in February in order to unilaterally appropriate $2.5 billion from the Defense Department’s anti-drug trafficking funds and $3.6 billion from its construction budget for the construction of a border wall. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Senator Josh Hawley (R., Mo.) on Tuesday sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook urging him to allow customers to opt out of having their personal data recorded by third-party developers who sell their apps on the company’s platform.
In the letter , Hawley praised Cook’s decision to roll out a new operating system that will provide customers with an Apple login designed to protect their personal email from app developers, but argued that the CEO could be doing more to prevent app developers from profiting off of user data collected for reasons unrelated to their apps’ functionality.
Citing a recent Washington Post report , Hawley pointed out that while developers cannot track certain “system-level data” such as contact and locations, they are not prevented from “pilfering mountains of other data and then sharing it with third parties.”
Hawley, who has emerged as the foremost Republican critic of tech censorship and privacy abuses just months into his first term, then asked that Cook support his recently introduced “Do Not Track Act,” which would allow Americans to opt out of data tracking in much the same way they can now join a “do not call” list to avoid telemarketing calls.

Making the click-through worthwhile: The United States has completely fumbled the ball regarding China in the 30 years since Tiananmen Square, to the point where your pension fund may be helping finance China’s Orwellian surveillance state; a couple of ideas on how to fight scam PACs; and the universal madness of authoritarian regimes.

Your Pension Fund Might Be Helping Expand the Chinese Surveillance State
On June 4, 1989 — 30 years ago today — the Chinese government decided it had been patient enough with the 50,000 to 100,000 demonstrators occupying Tiananmen Square. The protesters had called for democracy and liberty, but also denounced corruption and cronyism. What began as the Tiananmen Square protests became remembered as the Tiananmen Square massacre. Anywhere from hundreds to 2,600 Chinese protesters were killed, thousands more were wounded, and while many nations condemned the crackdown at the time, China and the world quickly moved on. The iconic “ tank man ” was never identified and his fate will probably forever remain unknown.
This morning Jonah shared a Twitter thread from a Chinese scholar , detailing how many of the protesters of that era adapted after the crackdown. The short version is that many who participated in the protest came to accept the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. The fight was unwinnable, those who went into exile were forgotten, and state-managed prosperity was arriving. He contends that most Chinese know exactly what happened at Tiananmen Square, but they see even acknowledging it to a foreign journalist as extraordinarily risky.
Helen Raleigh writes on NRO today :
While outside of China the world will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre that took place on June 4th, 1989, inside the country President Xi Jinping’s regime will continue its campaign of silence: not acknowledging the massacre ever took place; not apologizing to victims and their families; strongly condemning any commemorative activities outside China; and deploying its massive cyber-security force to vigorously scrub any mention of the incident from the domestic Internet.
The censorship will be so thorough that Chinese people won’t even be able to send a text message that contains any one of the numbers eight, nine, six, and four.
How overwhelming is Chinese censorship? They just banned 40 percent of numerals . If you lived in China, you wouldn’t be able to text the sentence preceding this one because of the “4.” Advertisement
The American government’s reaction to the Chinese government since the Tiananmen Square massacre was pretty underwhelming; some would call it a betrayal of our values. Until very recently, there was a bipartisan tradition of the party out of power calling the party in power soft on China and calling for a tougher stance, followed by that party getting into power and deciding that they didn’t want to disrupt America’s trade relationship with China too much. In the 1990s and 2000 , both Bill Clinton and some prominent GOP Congressional leaders assured us that greater trade with China would bring them closer to democracy, freedom of expression, and respect for human rights. That argument was either wildly naïve, willful blindness, or ruthlessly cynical in its dishonesty. Advertisement
There are a lot of times when arguments about “the elite” and “the common people” get oversimplified and overwrought. But the issue of how to handle China, and whether an ever-growing trade relationship really serves our interests, is one where the divide is real. Year by year, American attitudes shift around about China, at least according to Pew Research , but Americans worry about debt to China, cyberattacks, China’s impact on the environment, loss of jobs to China, the trade deficit, China’s policies on human rights and aggression to its neighbors. It’s likely most Americans found the “one child policy” morally unacceptable. When there’s a dispute between a dictator and free people somewhere in the globe, China’s usually stepping in to help out the dictator. Advertisement
Oh, and the regime has put 2 million Uyghurs into concentration camps , complete with torture, squalid living conditions, and constant indoctrination. Modern minds look back at the genocidal regimes of the 20th Century and wonder how anyone could stand by as such brutality reigned. Then they shrug as every major country and government on the planet continues to do business with a government running concentration camps.
Status as one of our biggest trading partners turned into a get-out-of-consequences-free card for the regime. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Now the Chinese government is establishing some of the most explicitly Orwellian policies imaginable — massive facial-recognition databases that allow the government to monitor anyone walking down the street, connecting them with the extensive government file kept on their activities. Who’s financing these enormous projects to expand the Chinese government’s control over their citizens? In some cases, Americans, as BuzzFeed found .
Chinese authorities have detained more than a million Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in political-reeducation camps in the country’s northwest region of Xinjiang, identifying them, in part, with facial recognition software created by two companies: SenseTime, based in Hong Kong, and Beijing’s Megvii. A BuzzFeed investigation has found that U.S. universities, private foundations, and retirement funds entrusted their money to investors that, in turn, plowed hundreds of millions of dollars into these two startups over the last three years. Using that capital, SenseTime and Megvii have grown into billion-dollar industry leaders, partnering with government agencies and other private companies to develop tools for the Communist Party’s social control of its citizens.
Also among the diverse group of institutions helping to finance China’s surveillance state : the Alaska Retirement Management Board, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Rockefeller Foundation all of which are “limited partners” in private equity funds that invested in SenseTime or Megvii. And even as congressional leaders, such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, have championed a bill to condemn human rights abuses in Xinjiang, their own states’ public employee pension funds are invested in companies building out the Chinese government’s system for tracking Uyghurs.
Google refuses to work with the U.S. Department of Defense, but it worked with the Chinese government to develop a censored version of its web search . There are a lot of elites who seem to see the U.S. government, and in particular our military and intelligence agencies, as untrustworthy, dangerous, abusive, and a malevolent force in the world. But they’re completely cool with working with the Chinese government.
In foreign-policy circles, you’ll often hear the cliché that “China represents a challenge to the United States of America, our role in the world, and our values.” Thirty years after Tiananmen Square, it’s clear we flunked that challenge. China’s rulers offered the world’s corporations a billion new customers, and the world’s companies, including almost all of the biggest American businesses, were willing to accept all kinds of moral compromises to make that money. The Chinese state is expanding their leverage on every continent, building up their army, expanding their territory through artificial islands, and hacked just about all of the records in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management . By and large, our policymakers under-responded to every provocation, averted our eyes from countless crimes, and explained away almost every act of aggression.
Amazingly, we still have lawmakers and potential presidents who don’t see any of this, and cling to some wildly outdated and naïve perspective that China is a still-emerging technologically challenged rising power that will play nice with just a little more trade and U.S. concessions.
Joe Biden’s full quote , about a month ago:
China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man. They can’t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west. They can’t figure out how they are going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they’re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they’re not competition for us.”
If Biden gets the Democratic nomination, let’s put China policy front and center in the 2020 election. Donald Trump is a man of copious sins and flaws and problems. But his reflexive protectionism has led him to see the leadership of China more clearly than a generation of elites going back to Tiananmen Square.
What to Do About Scam PACs

The Universal Insanity of Authoritarian Regimes

In discussing authoritarian regimes lately — whether it’s discussing China above, or the recent discussions of the Soviet Union in the context of HBO’s Chernobyl — it depressingly clear that he leadership almost always loses touch with reality and bends an entire nation to a will that grows increasingly deranged. A section of Between Two Scorpions takes place in Turkmenistan, and I came across details of life under dictatorship that are simultaneously fascinating, horrifying, and revolting: Advertisement
A half-generation ago, Turkmenistan’s president, Saparmurat Niyazov, aspired to turn his country, a largely ignored, mostly poor but oil and gas-rich Central Asian landmass, into “the new Kuwait.” A key part of his vision was building a new airport, one he insisted upon designing himself. Leaving basic aeronautic engineering decisions to a man with no experience led to predictable problems, such as the control tower being built on the wrong side of the runway, and the new terminal blocking the view of air-traffic controllers when they were trying to guide pilots. The president hand-waved away the warnings, declaring simply, “It looks better this way.”
In a country such as Turkmenistan, nothing was required to make sense; the arbitrary will of the state claimed supremacy over all other forces, including logic and physics. Authoritarian, paranoid, unpredictable states like this were dangerous from the moment you booked the ticket, as Katrina knew from experience and family history. Katrina wondered if they were a giant involuntary experiment attempting to induce mass psychosis. Like the story of the emperor’s new clothes, everyone knew that telling the truth was dangerous and quickly punished, so daily life required insisting outwardly, at all times, that the authorities were correct, and your eyes were lying. And if you did it enough outwardly, did you begin to do it inside as well? At some point did it become easier to believe the lie, even when you knew it was a lie? Advertisement "
Kyrsten Sinema Votes Yes On Donald Trump Appointee | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Thomas Jipping,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/a-democrat-voting-for-a-republican-nominee-shouldnt-be-big-news/,"About Thomas Jipping June 4, 2019 10:58 AM
A recent headline read: “Kyrsten Sinema Votes Yes on Two More Trump-Appointed Judges.” You know the confirmation process is a partisan mess when a senator voting for a nominee of the other party is news worth a headline.
These two judges were appointed to the U.S. District Court. Between 1789 and 2016 — from President George Washington to President Barack Obama — the Senate confirmed nearly 3,000 judges to this court and only 4 percent received even a single vote against confirmation. For more than two centuries, no matter which party was in the White House or controlled the Senate, every senator supported nearly every district-court nominee. Advertisement Advertisement
By comparison, 49 percent of President Donald Trump’s nominees to the U.S. District Court have received votes against confirmation. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The U.S. District Court judges appointed by Presidents John F. Kennedy to Obama receive an average of less than one negative confirmation vote, compared to 15 for Trump’s district-court nominees. And opposition to Trump’s judicial nominees has been increasing since he took office. His district-court nominees received an average of eight negative votes during his first two years, but that has jumped to an average of 38 negative votes this year.
The point here is that a Democrat like Sinema voting for a Republican judicial nominee, especially to the U.S. District Court, was the almost universal norm until Trump took office barely two years ago. Even then, however, Sinema has voted against six district-court nominees in the five months since she took office. It took the three longest-serving Democrats in Senate history — Robert Byrd (W.Va.), Daniel Inouye (Hawaii), and Edward Kennedy (Mass.) — a total of 148 years in the Senate to do that. Advertisement
Senate Democrats today are departing radically from how the Senate has handled judicial nominees since America’s founding. They are using Trump’s nominees as proxies for Trump himself, and have turned the confirmation process into simply another front in their war against the president.

4. Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley was the keynote speaker last night at the Susan B. Anthony List’s annual dinner. In it she talked about her husband’s time in foster care and their own struggles to conceive.
She said , in part:
Many of you know I am married to my incredible, super cool husband, Michael. He is a combat veteran and a Major in the South Carolina National Guard. He is truly a saint and being married to me you know he has to be exceedingly understanding.
But many don’t know that Michael and his four siblings spent several years in foster care. Foster care can be amazing, but it was not kind to Michael and his siblings. It was unkind.
Luckily, when Michael was five, he and his younger sister were adopted by a kind, loving couple who couldn’t have children of their own.
I often think about what would have happened if Michael hadn’t been so lucky…if his biological mother had chosen a different path…if his adoptive parents hadn’t been so compassionate…
In politics, people assume that if you’re Republican you’re pro-life, because that’s what the party tells you to be. I’m pro-life, because I get the chance to spend every day with my husband knowing that I am blessed.
Many of you also might not know that Michael and I struggled to have a family of our own. We are blessed to be the parents to two smart, thoughtful, occasionally challenging children, but that path was not an easy one for us.
Like so many other couples and families, we struggled for many years, riding a roller coaster of false hopes and painful disappointment. Throughout the slog of doctor visits and invasive tests, I had days that tested my faith and my resolve. But when I held our daughter in my arms for the first time, I felt what countless parents feel: that nothing could be more perfect and right in the world.
These experiences – the good and the bad – solidified for me what I had long known intellectually – that each and every life is a gift from God. That so many loving families want more than anything to raise and love a child. I can’t stomach the idea that we wouldn’t do everything in our power to protect and nurture those lives.

5. A segment from a recent PBS Frontline documentary on abortion has been making its way around social media. Viewers watch as a woman takes the initial pills that abortion clinics distribute in what they call a “medical abortion.” The woman explains to an interviewer that she hopes for a “sense of peace in terms of these two beings who I’ve chosen not to bring into the world.” She then seems moved to say goodbye to her unborn children. “Thank you for choosing me. And I’m honored to be given this gift of life.” She goes on to say: “I can’t do it right now.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

She was 37 years old and pregnant and leaves behind her husband and three other children. I never met Chan but many people I know all over the country knew her well. One of the writings she leaves behind is an academic-journal article imploring pro-lifers to always talk in terms of mothers and children and relationality, not rights and persons. Give birth to a more loving and welcoming vocabulary, in other words. May God be good to her and may we live radiantly through the eyes of faith as all testimonies make clear she did.

"Lucicano Pavarotti Documentary: Joyful, Inspiring | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/luciano-pavarottis-joy-of-living/,"June 4, 2019 11:52 AM Luciano Pavarotti in Yes, Giorgio (MGM) A new documentary traces the hectic life of the exuberant, talented tenor.
G rowing up in postwar Italy at age 12, Luciano Pavarotti fell ill with tetanus and sank into a coma for two weeks. When he woke, he thought that if only God would grant him recovery, “I will enjoy life, I will enjoy the sun, the sky, the trees, everything.”
Few promises have been kept so exuberantly: Pavarotti lived a life of joy, at operatic scale. In the hundreds of still photos the director Ron Howard displays in his unspeakably beautiful documentary Pavarotti , the tenor is smiling vastly in almost all of them (albeit suffering and soon to perish in the ones taken of him performing on the stage, where he died hundreds of times). An Italian flutist remembers Luciano telling him to pack a suitcase full of tortellini and prosciutto and other delights when joining the singer on tour. In a 1979 TV appearance, the daytime talk-show host Phil Donahue corners Pavarotti as the tenor demonstrates his spaghetti-cooking prowess: “Can we agree, sir, that it is fattening?” Donahue presses, the self-appointed pasta policeman. Pavarotti replies: Why, yes, Phil Donahue. Yes it is! A daughter recalls, at age eight, being asked to describe what her father did in an essay. “My father is a crook,” she wrote confidently, citing the following evidence: He would steal away at night and had a mysterious case full of fake beards and mustaches. Advertisement Advertisement
A career in opera, like an evening at Tosca , requires patience. When Pavarotti made his stage debut in La Bohème in April of 1961, the subjects of Howard’s previous music documentary were playing for £2.50 a night each in Hamburg. The Beatles came back to London, started recording, became worldwide sensations, remade their medium, broke up, and entered middle age before you knew the name Pavarotti. His future girlfriend Madelyn Renée says she had never heard of him when they met while she was studying singing at Juilliard in the late 1970s. Advertisement
Pavarotti has soccer to thank for one of his great breakthroughs. In 1990, a one-off concert to celebrate the finale of the World Cup in Italy brought him together with Plácido Domingo and José Carreras in the first of what became known as the Three Tenors concerts. Singing in the remains of Roman baths, the trio exhibit a fraternal, frolicsome energy — opera with the looseness of rock. They go into a huddle to choose an encore on the spot: the conductor, Zubin Mehta, mimes the sleepy-time gesture to his orchestra, and they’re off with “Nessun Dorma,” the greatest of all arias. The concert recording became the best-selling classical album of all time and launched a new populist era in marketing classical recordings. At 54, Pavarotti had realized his dream of bringing opera to the people. Purists thought he went a bit too far, performing with the likes of the Spice Girls and Jon Bon Jovi. As is often the case, the purists were right. But opera music hadn’t enjoyed such a high profile in decades.
Howard’s film is, in the spirit of opera and very much not in the spirit of most contemporary movies, wide-open to the passions. In a new interview, Domingo notes that “voice” is a feminine noun in Italian, Spanish, and French. The voice is beautiful but she is volatile and jealous. The voice is high-maintenance. The relationship with her is tempestuous, and the more thrilling for it. Considering that, why not live a life of the heart? Pavarotti luxuriates in beauty and pain, savoring everything. It’s not just an introduction to its subject; it shows us how to live. In the 1980s the tenor bonded with Princess Diana when, during a drenching rain in a London outdoor concert, he asked her and everyone else in the audience to put away their umbrellas and accept a soaking. Her celebrated coif sits in meltdown atop her skull as she meets him backstage in a laughing, what-the-hell mood. As the two became friends, he took up her charitable habits con gusto . He discovered he could open a school by opening his mouth. Advertisement"
Secret Life of Pets 2: Where the Homophobic Meets the Homicidal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pets-2-where-the-homophobic-meets-the-homicidal/,"About Kevin D. Williamson June 4, 2019 12:11 PM
I enjoyed Kyle’s observations on white minstrel performer Bruce Springsteen and “Born in the U.S.A.” It is a fact: Nobody listens to the lyrics.
I was reminded of that last night when I overheard a commercial for The Secret Life of Pets 2 , which was lifted up by a peculiar musical choice: DMX’s “Where the Hood At?” It is a great, anthemic song . . . about murdering homosexuals. The first verse is about that, anyway. The last verse is, strangely enough, a homosexual rape fantasy. DMX is sending some mixed signals. Advertisement Advertisement
I don’t object to the use of the song, and I assume that if it is in the film it has been artfully deployed, as in the commercial. I think attempting to use moralistic criteria to evaluate art — even pop songs — is an error. "
Against Conservative Cultural Defeatism | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/against-conservative-cultural-defeatism/,"June 4, 2019 1:18 PM President Ronald Reagan in 1982 (National Archives) We face a challenge, not a crisis, and there is no need to turn our back on our nation’s founding principles to overcome it.
O ne of the strange realities of the current fight over the direction of the conservative movement — double down on classical liberalism or reject many of its tenets in favor of a version of Christian statism? — is that it is taking place in the presence of an unjustified sense of despair and defeat. There is a wholly incorrect sense that the previous approach to the hot-button cultural issues of our day, centered around appeals to constitutional rights conducted (mostly) with civility and dignity, has failed. The argument is, in short: We lose, so we must change. Advertisement Advertisement
This is false. And one need only look at the news of the last month to see that it’s false. Even as entire quarters of the intellectual Right throw their hands up in cultural despair, an immense, contiguous American geographic region is passing the most significant wave of pro-life legislation since Roe. And this legislation follows a previous wave of pro-life laws , passed during the Obama administration, that resulted in more abortion regulation than at any other time since Roe .
But let’s step back and take a larger look at both life and religious liberty, the two areas of most concern to cultural conservatives. Let’s step back an entire generation, to 1981, the beginning of the Reagan presidency. Advertisement
I don’t pick that year at random; it marked two grim milestones. The first and by far most important was that the abortion rate hit its post- Roe high, a horrifying toll of 29.3 abortions per 1,000 women. The second was that religious liberty and free association were at grave legal risk. After years of Warren Court jurisprudence, SCOTUS was hearing arguments in a case called Widmar v. Vincent to determine whether the Establishment Clause actually prohibited a university from permitting a Christian student group to use empty classrooms or empty university facilities for religious worship or teaching. This was a threat to liberty far graver than anything the occasional student mob at Berkeley or Middlebury could pose.
To compound the challenge, there existed no truly functional cultural-conservative legal or political infrastructure to counter these developments. The liberalization of mainline denominations meant that countless Christians were making hard personal choices to change churches, and to the extent a Protestant political establishment existed, it backed social liberalism. Even the Southern Baptist Church initially applauded Roe . Advertisement Advertisement
What happened over the course of the next generation was truly astonishing. On December 8, 1981, the Supreme Court handed down the Widmar decision and ruled overwhelmingly in favor of the Christian student group, granting it equal access to campus facilities. In 1982, Yale law students founded the Federalist Society. In the years that followed, Christian leaders founded Christian legal organizations, like my former employers at the Alliance Defending Freedom and the American Center for Law and Justice, and they got busy formulating and prosecuting one of the most successful litigation strategies in modern American history.
In short order, it was established that Christian student groups had equal access to universities, equal access to university student-fee funding, and equal access to high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools. Free-speech jurisprudence (combined with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) rectified many of the worst ramifications of Justice Scalia’s terrible free-exercise opinion in Employment Division v. Smith , to the point where any person visiting an American college campus or an American high school (especially in the South) is going to find a large, vibrant group of Christians worshiping God in the halls. Advertisement
And in the battle for life, activists exercising the same rights of free speech and freedom of association that were carved in judicial granite in the 1980s and 1990s began the long, patient process of winning over hearts and minds. The abortion rate began to drop. The rate dropped throughout the Reagan, first Bush, Clinton, second Bush, and Obama administrations. It is now lower than it was when Roe was decided. The decline represents millions of lives saved, and while it has many causes, the presence and persistence of the pro-life movement is an important one. Advertisement
What about college campuses? From the onset of the modern culture war, the campus has represented the epicenter of illiberal leftist power. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, campuses passed rules and regulations expressly designed to suppress speech. By the 2000s, Foundation for Individual Rights in Education surveys of hundreds of campuses (full disclosure: I’m a former president of FIRE) revealed that more than 70 percent of college campuses had one or more “red light” policies that clearly restricted constitutionally protected expression. Advertisement
In response, civil libertarians on the left and right launched a legal and political onslaught. State legislatures began passing campus free-speech acts, and students brought lawsuits in virtually every federal circuit. Every time a court considered a speech code on the merits, the First Amendment prevailed. Now, the number of surveyed schools with speech codes has declined for eleven consecutive years. Only 28.5 percent of such schools have speech codes. And the speech codes that do exist are largely dead-letter policies, still on the books but never enforced. Advertisement
Does this sound like retreat and defeat to you? Advertisement
It is very true that we continue to face cultural challenges, often in the form of public shaming and corporate activism, but it’s important to remember that those who shame and boycott are exercising their own constitutionally protected rights. The answer to their bad speech isn’t the exact kind of government censorship and control that civil libertarians spent three decades successfully fighting. Instead, it’s personal courage. It’s better speech. It’s choosing to withstand the mob."
Conservatives & Culture War: What Constitutes Victory? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/what-constitutes-defeating-the-enemy-in-the-culture-wars/,"June 4, 2019 1:43 PM (Yuri Gripas/Reuters)
Can you stand one more addition to the discussion on the Ahmari-French debates?
The most positive assessment I can make of Sohrab Ahmari’s side of the argument is that many of us on the Right want to believe that we have a free and fair system for expressing our views and attempting to get the government to enact the policies we want, and under the law, we do. But in practice, the deck is stacked particularly high against conservative Christians, and some of our country’s most powerful institutions are less inclined to even give lip service to the concept of treating all citizens and viewpoints with respect or even permitting free expression. Advertisement Advertisement
The alliance and ideological monoculture of big media institutions, Big Tech, Hollywood, the rest of corporate America, and educational elites means that publicly arguing for the conservative Christian viewpoint can be not merely ineffective but economically dangerous. Brendan Eich gets tossed from a company he founded, the Little Sisters of the Poor get taken to court if they don’t offer birth control, and somehow YouTube has decided that Dennis Prager is the world’s most dangerous man. Our cultural debates are held with one side having regular access to powerful reinforcements. A drag queen who wants to set up readings in the children’s section of the local public library will usually get celebrated and defended, but the parent who objects will likely get publicly demonized and possibly fired from his job for “hatred” or “intolerance.”
Periodically you’ll see conservatives asking why their side hasn’t formed its own tech giants, its own online social networks, its own far-reaching television media (beyond Fox News), and its own powerful cultural establishments that would ensure that conservative Americans’ voices and beliefs always would have a safe harbor and institutional protections. (Er, maybe it’s partially because $127 million to $177 million of grassroots donors’ money was wasted on PACs that didn’t use it to help the candidates as promised!) Advertisement
But as Rich observed about the “ what and the how ,” once you’re done objecting to the state of things, it’s not quite clear what the next step is, beyond various “fight harder!” slogans. Ahmari wants conservatives to “fight the culture war with the aim of defeating the enemy and enjoying the spoils in the form of a public square re-ordered to the common good and ultimately the Highest Good.” Okay, what does that mean in terms of policy proposals and tactics that the conservative movement isn’t doing already?

Abortion Debate: Steve Chapman's Terrible Parallels | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/abortion-debate-steve-chapman-terrible-parallels/,"Follow Ramesh Ponnuru on Twitter June 4, 2019 6:27 PM
The columnist uses various analogies to try to justify exposing unborn children to lethal violence. All of them are inapposite. Comments
We would not legally require a father to give up his liver to save his child, or force people to donate kidneys to others who need them, because we typically value bodily integrity and autonomy. So, too, Chapman argues, we should not “force women to go through pregnancy and give birth.” Advertisement
In none of the analogies, however, is anyone taking an action or even refusing to perform an action in order to kill someone else. Killing someone else is neither the goal of the non-donors nor their means of achieving a goal. In the vast majority of abortions, stopping the life of a human organism is both means and end. That is why many people believe abortion should generally be banned while nobody has ever seriously maintained that every effort to save someone’s life should be legally required."
"After All These Years, Ortega Still Rules in Nicaragua, and Viciously Review",www.nationalreview.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nicaragua-now-ortega-still/,"March 15, 2019 10:13 AM Edipcia Dubón in Mexico City, February 26, 2019 (Jay Nordlinger)
That woman in the picture above is Edipcia Dubón. She is an interesting, brave, and touching person. She is a Nicaraguan, born in the Sandinista 1980s. She, her father, and other relatives had great hopes for the Sandinistas. So did many other Nicaraguans. But the Sandinistas turned out to be another dictatorship, which Nicaraguans were all too used to, in their sad, unfree history. Advertisement Advertisement
In 1990, Nicaragua held a free election, thanks to U.S. and U.N. pressure, and voters chose Violeta Chamorro as president. Hers was the first democratic government in Nicaragua ever. The country enjoyed a hiatus — a hiatus from dictatorship for 16 years (under three different presidents, including Chamorro).
Edipcia Dubón studied economics. Her country was desperately poor — the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, after Haiti. Did it have to be that way always? Could Nicaragua experience any relief?
In 2006, something remarkable happened: Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista dictator from the 1980s, returned to power. He did so in a clever way — even an ingenious way. And he would rule (again) with similar cleverness. This time around, he was not so much a Sandinista as a typical Latin American strongman or caudillo — with an especially sinister streak (and a wife to go with it).
Edipcia Dubón ran for office and was elected a deputy in the National Assembly. Then she was kicked out — not by the voters but by the Ortega regime. Soon, she had to run for her life, like lots of other Nicaraguans. Some 80,000 of them have gone into exile. Advertisement"
Trump and Britain: New Kind of Special Relationship | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/trump-britain-special-relationship-brexit-politics/,"About Madeleine Kearns June 5, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May hold a joint news conference in London, England, June 4, 2019. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) The run-up to Brexit is no time for political pettiness.
A s the U.K. moves toward breaking from the EU, the special relationship becomes increasingly critical. But Trumpian diplomacy, especially in the age of Twitter, is unlike anything that’s come before.
During his state visit to the United Kingdom this week, the president of the United States was met with angry protesters (some peaceful, some thuggish), insults from the (ineffective) mayor of London, boycotts from Labour-party MPs, and scathing criticism from the mainstream British press. Advertisement Advertisement
If the president were anyone other than Donald J. Trump, such hostile behavior from Britain’s political establishment toward our most important ally would be a source of national shame. But the president is Donald J. Trump. And, as some activists thought it powerful to remind us by projecting onto the Tower of London, Trump’s approval rating in the U.K. is at 21 percent where Obama’s was at 72 percent. Hi @realDonaldTrump . Just so you know, you’re wildly unpopular here in Britain. SAD! People REALLY don’t like you (though they love @BarackObama ). Hope you like seeing your FAILING approval numbers projected onto the Tower of London. #TrumpUKvisit pic.twitter.com/oT332Fd6fE
— Led By Donkeys (@ByDonkeys) June 3, 2019
These are not , of course, the approval ratings of the American people, a country nearly 40 times the geographical size of the U.K., but never mind that. . . . Advertisement
Trump, as we know, gives as good as he gets. Before his plane had touched down on British soil, he tweeted that the mayor of London is a “stone-cold loser.” Later, he refused the invitation to meet Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party, explaining that he is a “negative force” (which is true, if inappropriate). After this rejection, Corbyn then volunteered himself as the key speaker at an anti-Trump rally.
The outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May — a woman of little political talent — appeared dignified, though severely uncomfortable, in Tuesday’s press conference with the president. Which is understandable given what happened last year. In July 2018, Trump told the Sun, Britain’s best-selling newspaper, that May had mishandled Brexit and that her proposed deal with the EU would “probably kill” any deal with the United States. Then, in a press conference, he denied saying this, calling it “fake news.” Trump further embarrassed May when he weighed in on domestic affairs and suggested that foreign secretary Boris Johnson would make “a great prime minister.” Advertisement
Much has happened since then, and Trump seems to have softened in response. The withdrawal deal with the EU was rejected thrice by Parliament, and the prime minister herself was rejected by her own party. As Theresa May prepares to step down, 13 candidates (including Boris Johnson) are now positioning themselves to take her place as Tory leader. Advertisement
In a business roundtable, the president told May, “I don’t know exactly what your timing is [Friday is her last day] . . . but stick around, let’s do this deal.” Later, in a news conference, he said, “[You’re] probably a better negotiator than I am” and “I think you deserve a lot of credit.” (Quite the U-turn on a largely unchanged deal.) Advertisement
When asked about Boris Johnson, Trump reiterated his earlier support and also spoke highly of Nigel Farage, whom, at this writing, he is scheduled to meet.

"Jeffrey Deskovic: Exonerated of Rape and Murder, Graduates Law School | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Michelle Malkin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/jeffrey-deskovic-exonerated-graduates-law-school/,"June 5, 2019 6:30 AM (Pexels) Jeffrey Deskovic is ‘the future of the grassroots innocence movement.’
W hat would you do if you were falsely accused and convicted of a brutal rape and murder you didn’t commit?
How would you handle a violent maximum-security prison, sentenced to 16 years to life, at age 17?
And where would you go, what would you choose to do, if you won your freedom back after full exoneration? Advertisement Advertisement
Jeffrey Deskovic, 45, graduated from Pace University School of Law three weeks ago to rousing cheers from friends, family, and faculty. On its own, the achievement warrants celebration. Any graduation does. But Deskovic’s feat is just one of an extraordinary set of milestones in the extraordinary life of an extraordinary man I’m honored to know and support.
Hollywood couldn’t manufacture a nightmare and redemption script as compelling as Deskovic’s real-life saga. Advertisement
In November 1989, Deskovic’s Peekskill, New York, high school classmate, 15-year-old Angela Correa, was raped, beaten, and strangled to death. Detectives decided that Deskovic had acted excessively upset at the murdered sophomore’s memorials. Police succumbed to tunnel vision and confirmation bias, misinterpreting Deskovic’s amateur passion to help solve the crime as a sign of guilt. After speaking with him multiple times, steadily feeding him information about the case, they brought Deskovic in for a polygraph.
The teen who had never been in trouble with the law was interrogated for more than seven hours without a lawyer, family member, or food. Detectives bullied, cajoled, and lied to him about failing the testing. It’s a classic recipe for a false confession and undue process. The coercive interrogation ended with Deskovic in a fetal position under the polygraph table. Advertisement
Despondent, Deskovic attempted suicide twice before trial. In January 1991, a jury convicted him of first-degree rape and second-degree murder, even though DNA results showed he wasn’t the source of semen in the victim’s rape kit. Deskovic told Westchester Magazine : “It just didn’t seem real. It was like I was observing it from the outside. I felt I was in Fantasyland.”
Maintaining his innocence from the start, the sensitive high schooler who grew up behind bars earned an associate’s degree and appealed to anyone on the outside who would listen. After multiple rejections, the Innocence Project took up his case and won postconviction DNA testing that identified the real rapist and killer: a man named Stephen Cunningham. Advertisement
Injustice compounded injustice: While Deskovic was paying the price for the guilty man’s sins, Cunningham was on the loose in 1993, committing a second murder. The victim was Patricia Morrison, his girlfriend’s sister. He was in prison for that tragically preventable crime when new forensic testing methods yielded a hit in a state DNA database of convicted felons, and Cunningham confessed to killing Correa.

In 2006, Deskovic was freed and won a judicial determination of actual innocence. He received an apology from an assistant district attorney, along with multimillion-dollar civil suit awards from New York state, Westchester County, Peekskill, and Putnam County. Transitioning to life as a free man was not easy, but Deskovic has not wasted a single moment of it as an exoneree. On a whirlwind quest to prevent and undo miscarriages of justice like the one he suffered, he has earned a bachelor’s degree, a master’s from John Jay College of Criminal Justice and now a law degree (making the dean’s list the last four semesters).
While in law school, he traveled to Armenia and Argentina to give wrongful-conviction presentations, played an instrumental role in prosecutorial-misconduct reform in New York State, gave dozens of radio, TV, and documentary interviews (including one for my 2017 program called Railroaded: Surviving Wrongful Convictions ), started the Deskovic Foundation for Justice (which has helped exonerate seven people), and taught multiple classes on criminal justice to judges and police academies. Advertisement
Phew! Is there a bucket list that can match this one?
It’s Deskovic’s unique willingness to reach out to law enforcement and enlighten them, instead of to demonize them, that makes him an invaluable leader in criminal-justice reform. Lieutenant Michael Devine of the Bergen County Law and Public Safety Institute was so impressed with Deskovic’s presentations to corrections recruits that he successfully requested that the exoneree become a certified instructor for the New Jersey Police Training Commission.
Dr. Kevin J. Barrett, a 32-year veteran of the Englewood, N.J., Police Department and chairman of the criminal-justice department at Rockland Community College, says his students were “mesmerized” by Deskovic’s presentation and “will carry the lessons they learned from Mr. Deskovic for the next 25 years of their careers. He has a much-needed story to tell.”
And the rest of this story has only just begun. Advertisement Advertisement
Deskovic will take the bar exam in eight weeks. His foundation just helped win retrial scheduled in September for Andrew Krivak, a man wrongfully convicted of the rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl in Putnam County, N.Y., in 1997. No physical evidence connected Krivak or co-defendant Anthony DiPippo to the victim or the crime scene. The prosecution relied on a fake polygraph exam administered by the same official involved in Deskovic’s wrongful conviction. (I told you Hollywood couldn’t make this up!)"

Tariffs Adding up to Historic Tax Increase | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alison Acosta Winters,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/tariffs-adding-up-to-historic-tax-increase/,"June 5, 2019 11:39 AM Imported automobiles are collected in a lot at the port of Newark, N.J., February 19, 2019. (Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) The administration’s plan that will impose tariffs up to 25 percent on all Mexican imports is sending shockwaves around the world. The move is perplexing for several reasons, including the use of tariffs to address an issue completely unrelated to trade, and the timing as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico work to enact United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement implementation legislation through their respective legislatures. What’s even more confounding is that Mexican tariffs promise to undermine the administration’s enormously successful pro-growth tax and regulatory policies that have brought about a strong economy, record-low unemployment and – finally – rising wages. Tariffs are taxes – taxes paid by Americans. The tariffs on Mexican imports will cost Americans $17 billion at their lowest level of 5 percent, and $87 billion at the full 25 percent levy. Over 10 years, Americans would shell out nearly $900 billion on these imports alone. Taken together, all the president’s tariffs add up to the largest tax hike in post-World War II history as Bryan Riley and Demian Brady write at the National Taxpayers Union. Let’s take a look back at the annual cost of billions of dollars in new taxes levied on Americans over the last 18 months, in chronological order: Advertisement"

In response to Joe Biden’s defense of the Hyde amendment, which bans direct federal funding for abortion, another 2020 presidential hopeful, Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), dismissed the notion of compromising with pro-life Americans and called for the amendment to be repealed.
Biden’s campaign aides told NBC News this week that the former Delaware lawmaker remains supportive of the Hyde amendment. The admission came less than one month after Biden told an ACLU-trained voter that the 1976 statute “can’t stay.” Our volunteer Nina asked Joe Biden whether, as president, he would lift the Hyde amendment, which bans federal insurance coverage of abortion.
— ACLU (@ACLU) May 8, 2019
Biden’s campaign later told CNN that he misheard the voter and thought she was referring to the Mexico City policy, which prohibits the federal funding of non-governmental organizations that provide abortion counseling or referrals abroad.
In response, Sanders — who represents the most significant threat to Biden’s capturing the nomination, according to polling — dismissed the notion of coming to any sort of compromise with his pro-life colleagues and vowed to repeal the amendment. There is #NoMiddleGround on women’s rights. Abortion is a constitutional right. Under my Medicare for All plan, we will repeal the Hyde Amendment."
Mexico’s Hypocritical Asylum Policy Hurts U.S. | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mark Krikorian,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/mexico-asylum-policy-hypocrisy/,"Follow Mark Krikorian on Twitter June 5, 2019 1:03 PM A migrant lays on a cot in a shelter at the Southwestern New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Deming, May 27, 2019. (Adria Malcolm/Reuters) It embraces an expansive definition of asylum, then passes the buck by waving asylum-seekers northward.
P resident Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexican goods starting next week may or may not get Mexico to be more cooperative in preventing third-country “asylum-seekers” from passing through on the way to our border. I’m not too concerned about the costs that such a tariff would impose on U.S. businesses and consumers ( which would be real ), because the costs would be worth it if the tactic were actually to work. I’m skeptical it will, since Mexico always has a chip on its shoulder with regard to us. But recent signs suggest I might be pleasantly surprised. Here’s hoping. Advertisement Advertisement
Perhaps more important than the means, however, are the desired ends. During a call with reporters last week, acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan laid out three specific steps the administration wants Mexico to take. First is tightening security on Mexico’s border with Guatemala and chokepoints in southern Mexico (such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ). Second is targeting the smuggling organizations; as McAleenan said, “The logistical effort to move 100,000 people through a country every four weeks is immense. This is noticeable.”
Mexico might well agree to these two demands, potentially averting the tariffs. But the third demand is the most consequential, and the most difficult. As McAleenan put it, “We need to be able to protect people in the first safe country they arrive in — really, all through the hemisphere, but certainly with our partner to the south.” In other words, the administration wants Mexico to sign a “safe third country” agreement, whereby foreigners who pass through Mexico would not be permitted even to apply for asylum at the U.S. border, and Mexico would agree to take them back, because if they were genuinely fleeing persecution, they should have applied in the first safe country they reached. As Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation wrote last fall about one of the migrant caravans, “ignoring Mexico’s asylum process is prima facie evidence that a claim for asylum in the U.S. is bogus.” Advertisement
The U.N. treaty governing these issues specifically allows for such agreements. Article 31 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees says that illegal aliens cannot be denied the ability to seek asylum so long as they are “coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened.” (Emphasis added.) Advertisement
(“Refugees” and “asylum-seekers” are both people who fear persecution, but in U.S. law are geographically distinct; a refugee is not yet in the country where he seeks refuge, whereas someone seeking asylum is already there, either as a visitor or an illegal alien, and is asking to stay. In other countries, the terms are often conflated, so that someone granted asylum may simply be referred to as a refugee.) Advertisement
A safe-third-country agreement requires those seeking asylum to apply in the first country that’s party to the agreement, rather than forum shopping, as it were. That was the intent of the Dublin Regulation in Europe; the 2015 migration crisis was sparked when Angela Merkel decided to ignore it and take asylum applications from people who’d already passed through other (less prosperous) participating countries.
U.S. law specifically allows the executive branch to prevent people from applying for asylum if they can be removed to a country with which we have a safe-third-country agreement. We already have such an agreement with Canada , though it applies only to those arriving at ports of entry, not sneaking across the border. Advertisement
An agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, allowing us to simply turn asylum-seekers (including those who jump the border) around, would erase the incentive that’s drawing increasingly large numbers of people to our southwestern border. In April, nearly 110,000 people were apprehended by the Border Patrol, or were inadmissible at ports of entry, more than double the total from the previous April and a six-fold jump from April 2017. The May number will be even higher. Advertisement
The majority of these people are no longer single men trying to sneak past the Border Patrol, but families and “unaccompanied” minors turning themselves in and applying for asylum. They do this because loopholes in our laws guarantee release into the U.S. (with work authorization for the adults) to anyone bringing a child, or any child who arrives “unaccompanied” (i.e., brought up to the border by a smuggler, then sent across on his own). They have been coached to claim fear of return to their home countries and are released to pursue an asylum claim (though only half of them even bother, since the goal for many is just to be released into the U.S.). Even those who are rejected are almost never deported.
This means, as one Guatemalan told McAleenan, “a child is like a passport for migration.” Advertisement Advertisement
And while the majority of those currently exploiting these loopholes are Central Americans, word is spreading. Migrants from Africa have been passing through Latin America and showing up at our border for some time now, but last week saw the first-ever large group of Africans illegally crossing the border and turning themselves in to the Border Patrol. Bangladeshis claiming to be minors are also now showing up in large numbers to exploit these loopholes.
Of course, Mexico has little incentive to agree to take back third-country nationals once they’ve crossed into the U.S.; in the game of asylum hot potato, we’ve lost. Hence the tariff threat, to try to change the Mexicans’ incentives.
But as a matter of principle, the U.S. demand that Mexico sign a safe-third-country agreement is stronger than it looks. It’s not just that Mexican authorities often look the other way — or even provide assistance — as hundreds of thousands of foreigners pass through its territory on the way north. Rather, the possibility of asylum in the U.S. serves as way for Mexico to avoid the consequences of its own very expansive asylum laws.
Mexico is a signatory to the 1951 Convention (and the 1967 Protocol, which expanded the refugee treaty from just Europe to the whole world). Under that treaty, the definition of a refugee is anyone outside his country who is unwilling to return because of a “well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” This definition has been added to U.S. law . Advertisement
In addition, though, Mexico joined a number of other Latin American countries to sign the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees . That declaration significantly expands the definition of a refugee to include “persons who have fled their country because their lives, security or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.” This standard, which has been formally incorporated into Mexican refugee law , is so broad as to extend asylum protections to hundreds of millions, potentially billions, of additional people.
Mexico has an asylum bureaucracy, the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR), to implement this all-embracing definition of asylum, complete with a helpful video on how to apply.
Of course, Mexico has no intention whatsoever of giving asylum to millions of foreigners. But how to avoid that while maintaining its more “generous” standards for asylum — on paper — compared to the pinched and miserly U.S.? By making sure asylum seekers keep moving north, whether they’re from Central America or from farther afield and using Central America as a staging point.
Mexico’s incentive to keep people moving north is highlighted by the increase in the number of foreigners taking Mexico up on its expansive offer of asylum. The wave of bogus asylum-seekers transiting Mexico with children in tow, or paying smugglers to transport “unaccompanied” children, began to gain steam in 2013, sparked by Obama’s 2012 DACA edict, which granted work permits and Social Security numbers to young illegal aliens. In that year only about 1,300 foreigners applied for asylum in Mexico. By 2017, the number of applicants was nearly 15,000. It doubled in 2018 and is expected to double again this year, to 60,000."
Donald Trump & Mexico: Two Shots in the Foot | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Frank Lavin,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/donald-trump-mexico-tariff-two-shots-in-the-foot/,"About Frank Lavin June 5, 2019 10:52 AM
Last week, President Trump announced that he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods imported from Mexico, beginning on June 10. Over time, the tariffs would rise to 25 percent unless illegal immigration from Mexico to the U.S. stops.
This pronouncement illuminates a seeming paradox in international trade: I mports drive exports . The more open an economy is to imports, the more competitive its production and the greater its exports. This is one of several reasons why efforts to “help” a country’s economy by limiting imports tends to be self-defeating. I helped conduct a NAFTA study last year for Ecipe, a European think-tank, which examined the relationship between imports and exports. We saw two significant causal relations. Advertisement Advertisement
The first relationship is that almost 15 percent of the value of U.S. exports is sourced from foreign countries , with Mexico third in the rankings (behind only Canada and China). Indeed, some 8.6 percent of that 15 percent comes from Mexico. In other words, just over 1 percent of what the U.S. exports was imported from Mexico. Raising the price of that 1 percent makes the remaining 99 percent less competitive. Stay Updated with NR Daily

The second reason why imports drive exports: A significant percentage of what the U.S imports from Mexico includes inputs that originally came from the U.S. So Mexican manufacturers source from the U.S., then export finished (or semi-finished) goods to the U.S. For Mexico, 15.7 percent of the value add of its manufactured exports to the U.S. originally came from the U.S."

(Andrew Innerarity/Reuters)
President Trump has said that he would appeal to the Supreme Court if Democrats ever tried to impeach him. Former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz claims that while many people have criticized Trump’s remark as constitutionally ignorant, the president has a point: “[I]t is certainly possible” that the Supreme Court would move to stop an impeachment trial in the Senate. Advertisement Advertisement
Dershowitz cites a case arising from the Nixon impeachment — the impeachment, that is, of Judge Walter Nixon. He quotes then-justice David Souter: “If the Senate were to act in a manner seriously threatening the integrity of its results . . . judicial interference might well be appropriate.” The ellipses are from Dershowitz. Here’s what it conceals: “convicting, say, upon a coin toss, or upon a summary determination that an officer of the United States was simply ‘ a bad guy. ’ ”
Dershowitz’s argument is one of many, on all sides of the impeachment question, that ignores a crucial constitutional fact about impeachment. It can’t succeed without an extremely strong political consensus."
A Win for Gun Rights in Pennsylvania - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/a-win-for-gun-rights-in-pennsylvania/,"Follow David French on Twitter June 5, 2019 3:51 PM A man inspects a handgun during the National Rifle Association annual meeting in Indianapolis, Ind., April 28, 2019. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The Pennsylvania supreme court rules that legal gun owners aren’t second-class constitutional citizens. SCOTUS, take note.
E arlier this week, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court delivered a message that the United States Supreme Court desperately needs to hear: The lawful exercise of your Second Amendment rights does not make you a second-class citizen.
Here’s the context. For the last two years, federal courts — including, sadly, the Supreme Court — have endorsed a legal regime where police can use even the lawful exercise of gun rights as a pretext for the violation of other constitutional rights, principally our Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. Advertisement Advertisement
For example, in 2017, the Eleventh Circuit held that a police officer enjoyed immunity from suit when he pounded on the door of the wrong apartment late at night, failed to announce himself, and then shot dead a young man when he lawfully answered the door, armed. The existence of the gun granted the officer the right to shoot with absolute legal impunity.
Two months later, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of police officers who, without a warrant, entered the modest dwelling (a one-room shack) of a man named Angel Mendez and opened fire when he pointed a BB gun at them. Mendez lost his leg. His girlfriend was also injured. SCOTUS then used this case as an occasion to reverse a Ninth Circuit use-of-force rule that would impose liability when police “provoke” a violent confrontation through an “independent Fourth Amendment violation.”
But perhaps the best expression of gun owners as second-class citizens under the Bill of Rights came from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals . The court ruled that police could frisk a person if they believed that the person carried a firearm, even if he possessed a concealed-carry permit. According to the court, “the danger justifying a protective frisk arises from the combination of a forced police encounter and the presence of a weapon, not from any illegality of the weapon’s possession ” (emphasis added).
In a concurring opinion, a federal circuit-court judge actually typed these words:
The majority decision today necessarily leads to the conclusion that individuals who elect to carry firearms forego other constitutional rights, like the Fourth Amendment right to have law enforcement officers “knock-and-announce” before forcibly entering homes. . . . Likewise, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that individuals who choose to carry firearms necessarily face greater restriction on their concurrent exercise of other constitutional rights, like those protected by the First Amendment.
In plain English, this means gun owners must choose: carry their weapon and lose the full protections of the rest of the Bill of Rights, or never pick it up and enjoy your other rights. For people who live in high-crime areas, people who are often poor and sometimes nonwhite, this presents a wholly unacceptable dilemma. The people who have the most urgent need for self-defense find themselves facing the greater risk of the loss of their liberties.
Enter the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In Commonwealth v. Hicks , police responded to a citizen call after Hicks was spotted showing his handgun to another person outside a convenience store. He did not rob the store. He did not do anything illegal. He was a concealed-carry holder in lawful possession of his gun. “Numerous” police officers responded to the call, stopped the vehicle, restrained him, and conducted a search. They smelled alcohol and found a small bag of marijuana. They then arrested him for driving under the influence and disorderly conduct. Advertisement
Hicks challenged the legality of his arrest, and while the trial court dismissed the disorderly-conduct charge, it upheld the legality of the initial search. The court ruled that “possession of a concealed weapon in public creates a reasonable suspicion justifying an investigatory stop in order to investigate whether the person is properly licensed.”
Thus any concealed-carry holder could be subject to search simply because he chose to carry his weapon, to exercise rights guaranteed by state law and buttressed by the Bill of Rights."

Joe Biden & Hyde Amendment -- Campaign Says He Misheard Question About Hyde Amendment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/biden-campaign-says-he-misheard-question-about-hyde-amendment/,"June 5, 2019 4:52 PM Joe Biden speaks during a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Pa., May 18, 2019. (Mark Makela/Reuters)
Here ’s the Biden campaign’s statement explaining why he told an ACLU activist one month ago that he would repeal the Hyde amendment:
“Biden misheard the woman on the ropeline and thought she was referring to the Mexico City rule, which prevents federal aid money from going to organizations overseas that perform abortions. He supports the repeal of the Mexico City rule because it prevents critical aid from going to organizations even if abortion is a very small fraction of the work they are doing. He has not at this point changed his position on the Hyde Amendment.”
It’s hard to imagine Biden “misheard” the activist: The words “Hyde amendment” don’t sound much like “Mexico City Policy.” What the campaign is trying to say is that the candidate “confused” the two policies. It’s still odd that the campaign waited two weeks after the Washington Post first reported Biden opposes the Hyde amendment to clean up this gaffe.
Odder still is the Biden campaign’s statement that he might eventually change his mind and support repealing the Hyde amendment after four decades of supporting it: “Given the current draconian attempts to limit access to abortion, if avenues for women to access their protected rights under Roe v. Wade are closed, he would be open to repeal.”"
