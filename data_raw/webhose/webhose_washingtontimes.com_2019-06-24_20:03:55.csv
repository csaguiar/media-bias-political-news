First-ever private border wall built in New Mexico - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Stephen Dinan,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/27/first-ever-private-border-wall-built-new-mexico/,"(Image courtesy of We Build the Wall) more > First-ever private border wall built in New Mexico Half-mile section to close 'gap' in Border Patrol's fence By Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times - Updated: 7:21 p.m. on Monday, May 27, 2019
A private group announced Monday that it has constructed a half-mile wall along a section of the U.S.-Mexico border in New Mexico, in what it said was a first in the border debate.
The 18-foot steel bollard wall is similar to the designs used by the Border Patrol, sealing off a part of the border that had been a striking gap in existing fencing, according to We Build the Wall, the group behind the new section.
The section was also built faster and, organizers say, likely more cheaply than the government has been able to manage in recent years.
Kris Kobach , a former secretary of state in Kansas and an informal immigration adviser to President Trump, says the New Mexico project has the president’s blessing, and says local Border Patrol agents are eager to have the assistance.
“We’re closing a gap that’s been a big headache for them,” said Mr. Kobach , who is general counsel for We Build the Wall.
The announcement comes at a critical time for the border.
Mr. Trump’s plans to build hundreds of miles of new and replacement wall took a hit late last week when a federal judge ordered a halt to part of his emergency declaration and shifting of money within the Pentagon to make up for Congress’s refusal to grant him the money he wanted.
Judge Haywood Gilliam says the president can’t spend money when Congress has debated it and refused to approve it.
Enter We Build the Wall, which says, now that it’s proved it can build border wall, that it has eyes on other areas where private parties hold border lands, and want to build barriers there to cut down on the illegal traffic across their property.
The new wall begins at the Rio Grande and runs up to the lower elevations of Mount Cristo Rey. The wall on the Texas side ends at the river, and there used to be a gap on the New Mexico side running from the river over to Mount Cristo Rey.
Two parking lots, one on the Mexican side and one on the U.S. side, with nothing but a ditch to separate them, offered a convenient staging point for would-be migrants.
Mr. Kobach says agents have told him perhaps 100 migrants a night cross — but the bigger problem is that they would cross, gaining agents’ attention, then drug smugglers would use the distraction to run drugs through elsewhere in the gap.
A typical night could exceed $100,000 worth of drugs through the gap, Mr. Kobach said.
We Build the Wall made waves over the last six months as it used crowdfunding to raise money. Its campaign set a $1 billion goal and has raised more than $22 million from more than 265,000 pledges through GoFundMe.
The group posted photos of the New Mexico section to the pledge page on Monday.
“We did it,” the group said on Facebook.
Construction began Friday and will be completed Tuesday, Mr. Kobach said. Tommy Fisher’s Fisher Sand & Gravel did the construction.
Mr. Fisher has been in the news recently with Mr. Trump suggesting repeatedly and publicly that the government should consider his outfit for future border wall construction.
He was one of the contractors selected in 2017 to build wall prototypes in San Diego. None of those prototypes was deemed contract-worthy, and Congress has forbidden the Border Patrol from using any of those designs anyway.
More recently Mr. Fisher announced he could build 234 miles of fencing at $1.4 billion — or about $6 million per mile. That’s about a quarter of the cost of Mr. Trump’s current fencing, which goes off at about $25 million per mile.
The half mile in New Mexico cost $8 million, but Mr. Kobach said because part of it involved building on Mount Cristo Rey and involved moving a lot of dirt, that’s more expensive than most mileage would be.
We Build the Wall had recently faced criticism in the media over lack of visible progress. Mr. Kobach said the half-mile wall exposes those complaints as without merit.
He said the group kept the project under wraps to prevent anti-wall activists from disrupting them. For that same reason, he declined to disclose even the states where future construction might happen.
A private wall has been a dream of border security enthusiasts for years.
More than a decade ago, adherents of the Minuteman movement, which sought to draw attention to the lack of border barriers in Arizona, constructed some fencing on a ranch in southeastern Arizona. The fencing was approved by local authorities as a way to corral cattle, but was also seen as a way of blocking illegal migration, The Arizona Daily Star reported in 2006.
Organizers said funding didn’t materialize to finish that project.
The new wall in New Mexico is up along the border, and designed just like the Border Patrol’s structures, intended to be a deterrent to illegal crossing.

Democrats falsehoods on Trump Russia involvement exposed by Mueller report - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Rowan Scarborough,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/26/democrats-falsehoods-trump-russia-involvement-expo/,"My register 6' Former CIA Director John Brennan, left, and Wendy Sherman, right, a former State Department official and top negotiator of the Iran nuclear deal, arrive to meet with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., about the situation in Iran, at ... more > Mueller's vindication of Trump exposes falsehoods from Democrats on Russian involvement By Rowan Scarborough - The Washington Times - Sunday, May 26, 2019
President Trump has been labeled repeatedly as a Moscow agent by top Democrats and their intelligence officers, but in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report he comes up clean.
An analysis by The Washington Times didn’t find one instance in which Mr. Mueller found that the businessman-candidate communicated with Russian government officials, was spying for Moscow or was being blackmailed.
The lack of evidence is important. Attorney General William Barr has assigned U.S. Attorney John H. Durham to investigate how the FBI decided in July 2016 to open a counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign — meaning in effect the president. The FBI specifically targeted Mr. Trump in May 2017 as a possible Moscow agent.
Inside the Obama administration , some of the same officials who nurtured those investigations, such as then-CIA Director John O. Brennan and then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe , are the same people who strongly suggested on TV that Mr. Trump was a Kremlin asset.
Conservatives suspect the FBI was influenced by the anti- Trump dossier compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele. It is a well-circulated Democratic Party -financed opposition research paper that accused Mr. Trump of being a Russian informant. Today the dossier has been officially debunked by the Mueller findings.
Mr. Mueller had access to 40 FBI agents and U.S. intelligence community files to make the case that Mr. Trump is in bed with the Kremlin. Instead, Mr. Mueller said his 22-month investigation failed to establish an election conspiracy between Moscow and the Trump campaign.
In the report section titled “Russian government links to and contacts with the Trump campaign,” there is no evidence that Mr. Trump maintained communications with the Kremlin.
Mr. Mueller’s assignment from the Justice Department was to investigate “any links” between a Trump person and Moscow . If he had found such a Trump -Kremlin relationship, it almost certainly would have been detailed in a report that tried to capture all Russian contacts.
As the Mueller report noted, immediately after Mr. Trump ’s election win, the Kremlin scrambled to make contact with the transition office but didn’t know how.
“As soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government officials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new Administration ,” the report said. “They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with senior officials around the President-Elect.”
Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Mr. Brennan, President Obama’s White House adviser and CIA director, has painted a far different picture of a president who is somehow deeply tied to Moscow .
Some examples:
⦁ Mrs. Pelosi. Last July she asked reporters, “What do the Russians have on Donald Trump — politically, financially and personally?”
On Jan. 25, she tweeted, “What does Putin have on @realDonaldTrump, politically, personally or financially?”
(Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, now a Trump antagonist, testified to Congress this year that he knows of no Russian loans or investments flowing to the Trump Organization .)
⦁ Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He said in January, “Counterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the President himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the start.”
He told ABC News last July, “I certainly think he’s acting like someone who is compromised. And it may very well be that he is compromised or it may very well be that he believes that he’s compromised, that the Russians have information on him.”
⦁ Mr. Brennan. He has been the harshest critic among Mr. Obama’s team. He called Mr. Trump “treasonous” at one point and predicted multiple indictments for election conspiracy with Moscow . They never materialized.
“I think he is afraid of the president of Russia,” Mr. Brennan said in March 2018 on MSNBC, where he is a paid commentator.
“The Russians could have something on him personally that they could always roll out and make his life more difficult,” he said.
The Russians “have had long experience with Mr. Trump and may have things that they could expose and reveal,” he said.
⦁ Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. He is a paid analyst on CNN.
Mr. Clapper has implied repeatedly that Mr. Trump is a witting or unwitting “asset,” spy language for an agent.
“I’ve speculated in the past that the way Putin behaves is to treat President Trump as an asset,” he said this year.
⦁ Mr. McCabe . He was a go-between on dossier information from Fusion GPS, Mrs. Clinton’s opposition research firm, to FBI agent Peter Strzok, who opened the probe.
After Mr. Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey, Mr. McCabe opened a counterintelligence investigation targeting the president on suspicions he was a Russian agent.
Mr. McCabe ’s book “The Threat” made no mention of the dossier, Mr. Steele or his own role as a conduit.
He said in interviews last winter that “I think it’s possible” Mr. Trump is a Russian agent. He also said “we don’t know” if the Kremlin ordered Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Comey.
Again, there is no evidence of this in the Mueller report.
The Justice Department fired Mr. McCabe after a Justice Department inspector general report said he lied to investigators. Federal prosecutors are reviewing the charges.
The liberal news media, not just Clinton and Obama Democrats, have accused Mr. Trump of being a Russian agent.
Perhaps the most flamboyant was a long July 2018 article in New York Magazine that weaves a series of business contacts and a few trips to Moscow into a theory that Russian President Vladimir Putin is Mr. Trump ’s “handler.”
Part of the Trump suspicions are rooted in the Kremlin’s hacking of Democratic Party computers and releasing stolen emails to help the Republican and hurt Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The Trump Organization has had business contacts with several Russians. Mr. Trump and NBC Universal staged the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013 in Moscow in partnership with a Russian oligarch. Mr. Trump looked at building a Trump tower complex at that time. Later, during the campaign, then- Trump lawyer Cohen took the lead in trying to secure a deal to build a tower in Moscow .
Russians were hacking the Democrats during the failed 2015-16 negotiations. The Mueller report has no evidence that Trump aides knew of the computer intrusions until they became public that summer.
The Obama administration ’s official policy was to encourage Americans to do business in Russia. Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, personally urged such contacts. Relations with Mr. Putin soured in 2014 after his forces invaded Ukraine.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg chided fellow Justice Clarence Thomas Tuesday in her dissenting opinion, saying that he was wrong to call a woman who has an abortion a “mother.”
The court upheld an Indiana law that governs the way fetal material is disposed of after an abortion — but refused to hear an appeal to a judge’s injunction of Indiana’s ban on abortions because of the sex, race or disability of the fetus.
Justice Thomas wrote that the court will eventually have to tackle that issue — and in his opinion, he referred to pregnant women as “mothers.”
That irked Justice Ginsburg .
“(A) woman who exercises her constitutionally protected right to terminate a pregnancy is not a ‘mother,’ ” she wrote , saying Justice Thomas showed “more heat than light” in his opinion.
She agreed with the court ’s decision to refuse to hear the race and sex abortion ban ruling but said she would also have rejected hearing Indiana’s fetal material disposal law, calling it a “waste” of resources to have the justices weigh in at this point.

Democratic presidential candidates support gun regulations that disproportionately harm the poor - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,John R. Lott Jr.,05-27-2019,2019,5,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/27/democratic-presidential-candidates-support-regulat/?__twitter_impression=true,"My register 4' Illustration on gun ownership licencing’s expense and effects on the poor by Alexander Hunter/The Washington Times more > Short-sighted calls for gun control By John R. Lott Jr. - - Monday, May 27, 2019
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Every one of the 24 Democratic presidential candidates support more gun control. Front-runner Joe Biden not only oversaw the Obama administration’s gun control proposals, but took credit this month for the 1994 federal Assault Weapon Ban. Even Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, from as gun-friendly a state as there is, vetoed a bill that would have prohibited local governments from implementing various gun control ordinances. He did so just before announcing his presidential run.
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and California Sen. Kamala Harris came out in support of licensing gun owners, as well as a long list of other gun regulations. The regulations that they propose will prevent poor Americans — particularly poor blacks living in high-crime neighborhoods — from owning guns for protection.
Mr. Booker made a particularly long list of promises. He pledged to try to remove the NRA’s tax-exempt status, license and fingerprint gun owners, impose universal background checks on the private transfers of guns, microstamp firearms, as well as ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Mr. Booker would allow courts to confiscate firearms if it simply suspects that an individual is dangerous. He would also use your tax dollars to fund gun control research.
Mr. Booker believes that licensing gun owners will reduce crime, but licensing and registration hasn’t worked out that way in parts of the United States and other countries where it has been tried. In theory, if guns are left at a crime scene, they can be traced back to the criminal. In real life, crime guns are only left at the scene of incidents when criminals have been seriously injured or killed. Also, crime guns are very rarely registered. In the exceedingly rare instances that they are, they aren’t registered to the person who committed the crime.
That’s why police in Chicago, Hawaii, D.C., Pennsylvania and Canada can’t point to any crimes that have been solved as a result of registration. But there is a cost. In Honolulu, Hawaii, the licensing and registration operation took up 50,000 hours of police time each year to run.
Mr. Booker claims that Connecticut saw “a 40% drop in gun homicides” between 1995 and 2005, but he ignores that crime was falling nationally as well as across the Northeast.
New Jersey, Mr. Booker ’s home state, has just proposed increasing the cost of its mandatory Firearms Purchaser Identification Card to $100. On top of that, gun owners must obtain a permit, for which the proposed fee is $50.
All the Democrats argue that free voter IDs discriminate against minorities, so they ought to be cognizant of the impacts of such fees. Universal background checks also don’t come cheap. In Washington, D.C., and New York City, checks on private transfers of guns start at $125.
Democrats also claim that 3.5 million dangerous or prohibited people have been stopped from buying guns because of background checks, but virtually all of those denials are mistakes. Usually, someone is stopped from buying a gun just because his name is similar to that of a criminal.
Joe Biden and all the Democrats want to expand the current background checks to private transfers. But relying on birth dates and phonetic similarity of names just doesn’t allow for much accuracy. Incidentally, people are more likely to share names with other members of their racial groups. Hispanics often have names similar to other Hispanics, and certain names are relatively common among blacks. Law-abiding blacks and Hispanics are particularly likely to have their names confused with people whose criminal records preclude them from legally buying guns.
This problem of false positives requires only an easy fix. The government need only follow the same rules that it demands of private companies when they conduct criminal background checks on employees. But instead of fixing the system and requiring the use of basic identifying information, Democrats’ proposals will simply make it more difficult, unfair and inconvenient to buy a gun.
Mr. Booker says that he wants to close the so-called “Charleston Loophole,” but this betrays a lack of understanding of existing gun law. Charleston Church killer Dylann Roof was only charged with misdemeanor drug possession. Even if he’d been convicted, the federal background check system would not have red-flagged his gun purchase. So, there’s no loophole to be closed, unless Democrats are in favor of stripping people of their constitutional rights for misdemeanor drug possession.
Firearm microstamping involves a gun’s firing pin imprinting a microscopic set of characters on bullet cartridges. These characters identify the gun’s make, model and serial number. But this technology has yet to be developed, and such a regulation would effectively bring gun production to a halt.
Instead of adding more fees and inefficiencies, Democrats would be more honest with the American people if they simply tried to ban guns. And it wouldn’t so unfairly and disproportionately affect poor Americans, many of whom happen to be minorities.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz criticized a now-deleted tweet by Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar that many conservatives deemed racist.
In a now-deleted tweet posted Tuesday night, Ms. Omar claimed that a merit-based immigration policy like the one proposed by President Trump is “fueled by racism towards the Latinx community.”
“Our immigration policies shouldn’t be based on discrimination, fear, or bigotry,” the Minnesota congresswoman wrote. “We should welcome immigrants to our country and offer a simple way to citizenship.”
The tweet sparked a wave of backlash and allegations of racism from the right, including by Mr. Cruz, who said he’s “troubled” by the idea that Hispanic immigrants “can’t qualify” for merit-based immigration.
“As the son of a Cuban immigrant whose Dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, I’m troubled that Dems seem to believe Hispanic immigrants can’t qualify for skills-based legal immigration,” the senator wrote. “Bringing in more scientists, engineers & doctors is good for US jobs.”
Ms. Omar , a Somali immigrant who has faced multiple allegations of anti-Semitism since her election last year, appeared to respond to the criticism in a tweet late Tuesday referencing an May 22 analysis by The Washington Post, titled, “What’s behind the desire for ‘skilled’ immigrants? Racial prejudice.”
In her tweet, Ms. Omar quoted a line from the article that read, “Our research suggests that prejudice against Latinos is an important, if veiled, reason that some Americans advocate admitting primarily highly educated, highly skilled immigrants.”

Ohio jury awards $11 million to bakery owners targeted by Oberlin College student protests - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Valerie Richardson,06-07-2019,2019,6,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/7/ohio-jury-awards-11-million-to-bakery-owners-targe/?__twitter_impression=true,"Four generations of Gibsons after jury verdict. (Legal Insurrection Foundation] more > Ohio jury awards $11 million to bakery owners targeted by Oberlin College student protests Bakery sued for libel after student boycott, allegations of racism By Valerie Richardson - The Washington Times - Friday, June 7, 2019
The owners of an Ohio bakery who sued for libel after being targeted by student protests won Friday an $11 million verdict against Oberlin College.
A Lorain County jury ordered Oberlin to pay $11 million in compensatory damages to Gibson ’s Bakery, a local fixture since 1885 that was beset by protests and racism allegations after three black students were arrested for shoplifting the day after the 2016 presidential election.
“The jury saw that Oberlin College went out of their way to harm a good family and longtime business in their community for no real reason, and the jury said we aren’t going to tolerate that in our community anymore,” Owen Rarric , an attorney for the Gibsons, told Legal Insurrection.
The award, which could triple at Tuesday’s hearing on punitive damages, came as a warning to universities that encourage social-justice activism as student protests spill from the campus to the local community.
“The verdict sends a strong message that colleges and universities cannot simply wind up and set loose student social justice warriors and then wash their hands of the consequences,” said Cornell Law School professor William Jacobson, who runs the conservative Legal Insurrection website.
Bakery owners said they lost business after Oberlin students held protests accusing them of discrimination. The student Senate passed a resolution claiming Gibson ’s had “a long history of racial profiling,” and Dean of Students Meredith Raimondo was accused of passing out an anti- Gibson ’s flier.
Students boycotted the bakery, while the college cut off and then resumed its contract for baked goods.
Oberlin argued it was not responsible for the students’ actions. Meanwhile, the three students pleaded guilty to shoplifting and aggravated trespass while issuing statements absolving the bakery of racism.
In 2017, Gibson ’s sued the college for libel; tortious influence with business relationships and contracts, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, culminating in the nearly month-long trial in Elyria, Ohio.
“The students eventually pleaded guilty, but not before large protests and boycotts intended to destroy the bakery and defame the owners,” Mr. Jacobson said. “The jury appears to have accepted that Oberlin College facilitated the wrongful conduct against the bakery.”
In a Friday email to the college community, Oberlin general counsel Donica Thomas Varner said the college was “disappointed” with the verdict and would determine how to proceed.
She insisted that the college and Ms. Raimondo “worked to ensure that students’ freedom of speech was protected and that the student demonstrations were safe and lawful.”
“As we have stated, colleges cannot be held liable for the independent actions of their students,” Ms. Varner said. “Institutions of higher education are obligated to protect freedom of speech on their campuses and respect students’ decisions to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights. Oberlin College acted in accordance with these obligations.”
Mr. Rarric disagreed. “The College kept saying we don’t control our students,” he said. “But the jury told them we can tolerate some of this fro time to time, but not what you did this time.”
The jury’s award included $3 million for Allyn W. Gibson ; $5.8 million for his son David Gibson , and $2.3 million for Gibson Brothers.
David Gibson said afterward that the trial had taken a toll on the family and called the verdict “a relief,” as shown in video posted by the Elyria [Ohio] Chronicle-Telegram.

How Vietnam may curb China's ambitions - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,James Borton,06-06-2019,2019,6,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/6/how-vietnam-may-curb-chinas-ambitions/?__twitter_impression=true,"Vietnam Dragon Surveillance Illustration by Greg Groesch/The Washington Times more > How Vietnam may curb China's ambitions China and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the South China Sea and there's hope diplomacy will prevail By James Borton - - Thursday, June 6, 2019
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
At the U.N. Secretariat building, sheathed in shiny aluminum, glass and marble and overlooking New York’s East River, Vietnamese diplomats are soon to celebrate their nation’s selection as a non-permanent member in the U.N. Security Council. As a country that has experienced the tragedies of wars, including one drawn out and fierce conflict with America five decades ago, Hanoi ’s foreign policy role is now forged on peaceful cooperation, stability and independence.
While there are five permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, also known as the ‘Big Five’: China , France, Russia, United Kingdom and the United States, there are a total of 15 U.N. member states who serve on the UNSC, the remainder of which are elected. Only the five permanent members have the power of veto, which enables them to prevent the adoption of any substantive draft Council resolution.
Vietnam ’s importance in international security has risen sharply since the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, when it successfully hosted Presidents Donald Trump, China ’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin along with other regional leaders in Danang, a coastal city in central Vietnam . Despite the failure of Mr. Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un’s meeting held earlier in the year, the summit successfully placed host country Vietnam in the peacemaker role spotlight.
Despite the challenges of endemic corruption, human rights and recidivist communist tendencies, Hanoi has received global recognition as a member of the international community since it adopted a market liberalization trajectory that has led to an impressive economic performance, a high GDP, a reduction in poverty and more political openness.
“ Vietnam is proud to be a responsible member of the United Nations. Through the four decades that Vietnam has been a part of the UN, we have always been committed to the noble goal of the Organization — to build a world of peace, security and development,” says Pham Binh Minh, minister of Foreign Affairs.
Notably, Vietnam has leveraged greater integration with the international economic system, including through ascension to the World Trade Organization in 2007. In October 2007, Vietnam was also elected for the first time a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council by a positive vote of 183 out of 190 votes for the 2008-2009 term.
Vietnam ’s successful march to the U.N. was punctuated by remarkable strides made from 1995 to 1999, including the normalizing of diplomatic and trade relations with the United States. The country’s integration with the West opened up opportunities to work with the world’s developed and international organizations, including multilateral donors such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Also, Vietnam was one of the fastest-growing sources of American imports from Asia last quarter, a beneficiary of business shifts in response to increased American tariffs on Chinese goods.
Although not quite overnight, Hanoi has marched forward and become a member of ASEAN (1995), and APEC (1998). The U.S.- Vietnam bilateral trading agreement was signed in 2001 and accelerated the political will to speed up negotiations on Vietnam ’s ascension to the World Trade Organization (WTO.)
“During its first tenure in 2008-2009, Vietnam was praised by the United States for its positive contribution and the close voting alignment on key issues such as nuclear non-proliferation and counter-terrorism,” states Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales.
As a non-permanent member at the UNSC, Vietnam is poised to demonstrate its growing voice forged in ASEAN, to exercise its soft diplomacy skills and to extoll its embrace of international integration.
Now the global situation is more complicated and the relations among global powers, namely the United States and China and Russia has worsened. It’s now approaching three years since the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague issued its landmark ruling in the Philippines vs. China case, resulting in a nearly unanimous victory for Manila and a call for the role of international law in settling South China Sea disputes peacefully.
“ China and Vietnam have overlapping claims in the South China Sea and over the past decade or so Beijing has stepped up its pressure on Vietnam by reclaiming and militarizing islands and pressing Vietnam not to exploit oil and gas resources in areas near Vietnam ’s coast but where China also has claims. Hanoi hopes that building out its diplomatic ties will prompt Beijing to be more cautious in its dealings with Vietnam ,” claims Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.
While freedom of navigation operations has increased in the South China Sea, signaling America’s right of transit, Vietnam could be forced to show its hand if the Trump administration decides to assert itself further. This week’s somewhat muted announcement by the United Stats that it is selling unarmed surveillance drones to Vietnam , has placed China on notice. As a result, there may be questions about what’s the next diplomatic maneuver for Hanoi .

Hillary Clinton: Mueller report proves obstruction of justice - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,,06-09-2019,2019,6,http://amp.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/9/hillary-clinton-mueller-report-proves-obstruction-/,"Subscribe 2' Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton delivers Hunter College’s commencement address, Wednesday, May 29, 2019, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) more > Hillary Clinton: Mueller report proves obstruction of justice By
WELLESLEY , Mass. — Hillary Clinton says there are two inescapable conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.
The first is that Russia conducted a sweeping and systemic interference into the 2016 election and the second is that obstruction of justice occurred.
“You cannot read the report, chapter and verse, fact after fact, without reaching those conclusions.” Clinton said. She made the comments during an appearance with Madeleine Albright Saturday at their alma mater, Wellesley College.
“People just want to quit hearing about it and get back to their normal lives. There is nothing normal about undermining the rule of law. There is nothing normal about attacking the press. There is nothing normal about trying to undermine another branch of government,” she said.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly said the Mueller report shows no collusion between his campaign and the Russians.
Clinton said she was also worried that the speed of online communications could make the country vulnerable to the tactics of demagogues including what she called the clever use of symbols combined with verbal and physical intimidation.
“This is a classic pattern. There is nothing new about it,” she said. “I think given the rapidity with which information can be conveyed today because of the internet, it is an even more dangerous set of circumstances.”
The two former Democratic secretaries of state spoke on a range of topics, from their years at Wellesley to the state of women’s rights in the world.
Albright is a member of the class of 1959. Clinton is a member of the class of 1969.

Mexico ’s Ambassador to the U.S. Martha Barcena refuted Sunday a CBS News report saying that she contradicted President Trump during an interview on “Face the Nation,” prompting the network to backtrack on its claim.
In an interview, Ms. Barcena said purchases of U.S. goods would rise as a result of two events: Mr. Trump suspending his threat to impose tariffs as a result of Friday’s border-security deal, and pending ratification of the US- Mexico -Canada [USMCA] trade agreement.
“It is our understanding that without tariffs and with USMCA ratification, there will be an increased rate, both in agricultural products and manufactured products,” said Ms. Barcena on “Face the Nation.”
CBS posted an article headlined, “Mexican ambassador contradicts Trump claim of new agriculture deal,” but changed it to “Mexican ambassador won’t say whether Mexico agreed to new agricultural deal” after she pushed back.
A tweet reporting that she contradicted the president was also apparently deleted.
“I did not contradict the president of the USA @realDonaldTrump,” Ms. Barcena tweeted. “I just explained that with no tariffs and the USMCA ratification the trade in agricultural products will increase dramatically. Mexico is already a big buyer of USA agricultural products and this trend will continue.”
“Face the Nation” then posted a video on Twitter saying, “Here’s the clip, you decide,” and posted an editor’s note at the end of the story.
“Editor’s note: A previous version of this headline that said Bárcena Coqui contradicted the president has been updated to more accurately reflect the ambassador’s comments,” said the network.
“Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan quizzed Ms. Barcena on whether there was “any kind of agreement by your government to buy agricultural products,” an apparent reference to Mr. Trump ’s tweet Saturday that “ Mexico has agreed to immediately begin buying large quantities of agricultural product.”
“Is trade on agricultural products going to grow? Yes, it is going to grow, and it is going to grow without tariffs and with USMCA ratification,” said Ms. Barcena during the interview.
After CBS reported that she had contradicted the president, Jose Diaz-Bresno, correspondent for the Mexico City newspaper Reforma, tweeted, “True headline: MX Ambassador AVOIDS contradicting Trump ,” then posted the old and new tweets.
Ms. Barcena also said that more National Guard forces would be deployed Monday to stem the tide of Central American migrants moving through Mexico on their way to the U.S. border.
“The deployment throughout the country has been- has already begun and it will increase next Monday,” she said.
She took issue with the description of the National Guard members as “troops,” saying they have more in common with a police force or civil guard than the military.

VATICAN CITY — The Vatican issued an official document Monday rejecting the idea that people can choose or change their genders and insisting on the sexual “complementarity” of men and women to make babies.
The document, published during LGBT Pride Month, was immediately denounced by LGBT Catholics as contributing to bigotry and violence against gay and transgender people. Advocacy group New Ways Ministry said it would further confuse individuals questioning their gender identity or sexual orientation and at risk of self-harm.
The text, “Male and Female He Created Them,” was intended to help Catholic teachers, parents, students and clergy address what the Vatican’s Congregation for Catholic Education called an “educational crisis” in the field of sex education.
It called for a “path of dialogue” and listening on the issue of “gender theory” in education. But even priestly advocates for LGBT Catholics noted that the text appeared to have relied entirely on previous papal pronouncements, Vatican documents and philosophers and theologians.
“The real-life experiences of LGBT people seem entirely absent from this document,” said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest who wrote a book on improving Catholic Church outreach to the LGBT community, titled “Building a Bridge.” ”We should welcome the congregation’s call to dialogue and listening on gender, and I hope that conversation will now begin.”
Pope Francis has repeatedly argued the position that people cannot choose their genders. But the document represents the first attempt to put the Vatican’s position, first articulated fully by Pope Benedict XVI in a 2012 speech, into a comprehensive, official text.
The document called for a new alliance among families, schools and society to offer a “positive and prudent sexual education” in Catholic schools so children learn the “full original truth of masculinity and femininity.”
It called gender fluidity a symptom of the “confused concept of freedom” and “momentary desires” that characterize post-modern culture. It rejected terms such as “intersex” and “transgender” and said the purpose of the biological “complementarity” of the male and female sex organs was to ensure procreation.
Francis DeBernardo, head of New Ways Ministry, said such concepts are outdated, misinformed and ignore contemporary science on factors beyond visible genitalia that determine gender.
“Gender is also biologically determined by genetics, hormones and brain chemistry - things not visible at birth,” DeBernardo said in a statement. “People do not choose their gender, as the Vatican claims, they discover it through their lived experiences.”
He said the Catholic Church should encourage this process of discovery, saying it’s “a process by which individuals discover the wonderful way that God has created them.”

Officers handling legal immigration cases will now warn people that they are under an obligation to support themselves rather than end up on the public dole, under a new policy implemented Friday by acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli.
The warning will be issued both to the immigrant and his or her sponsor, who under the law has signed an agreement not to let the immigrant become a public charge.
In the new warning, UCSIS officers will “remind” sponsors that they can — and now will — be asked to pay back “every dollar” of welfare that the immigrants take.
“The president has made it a priority to ensure that every individual who seeks to come to the United States is self-sufficient, temporarily or permanently,” Mr. Cuccinelli said in a memo to agency employees.
It’s the first major public move by Mr. Cuccinelli, who became acting director this week.
It’s also one of the boldest steps by the agency, which gets less attention that the Border Patrol or deportation officers, but which is nonetheless central to Mr. Trump’s immigration plans.
That immigrants are supposed to be able to support themselves has long been a part of federal policy, dating back to the very first comprehensive immigration laws enacted in the 1800s.
But it’s been rarely enforced.
The Washington Times reported in 2016 that of five major countries for immigration to the U.S., just three people were cited for being public charges in the years from 2013 to 2015. Immigration judges sustained just one of those cases.
USCIS is also working on new regulations that would expand the cases where migrants could be denied immigration passes or new visas if they become a public burden.
Under Clinton-era rules, the government only looks at a narrow set of welfare programs when determining if an immigrant has become a public charge. The Trump plan, still a work in progress, would add food stamps, public housing and long-term institutionalized care to the list.
That plan would save the government nearly $20 billion over a decade, the government argued in its draft proposal.
Immigrant-rights activists have complained that the rules would make it tougher for poor migrants to gain a foothold in the U.S., effectively giving a leg up to more successful immigrants.

(AP ... more > Fatherhood changes men's brains and minds, studies show By Shen Wu Tan - The Washington Times - Saturday, June 15, 2019
Call it dad brain.
Studies show that becoming a father changes men’s brains in ways that help them tackle the complex tasks of being a parent, leading neuroscientists say.
“We know the brain is continually changing in life as a function of how we use it and what’s happening in our lives,” said Michael Merzenich , chief scientific officer of the Posit Science Corp. and professor emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco.
“Certainly, one of the most important things that could happen in the life of a man is fatherhood,” Mr. Merzenich said. “It’s something that’s very serious and life changing. And of course things that are very serious and life-changing amp up our brains in ways that promote substantial change and remodeling. And a lot of that’s required as we adopt these new sets of complex tasks that relate to being a dad.”
Research suggests that fatherhood could increase oxytocin (a hormone associated with social bonding) and decrease testosterone (a hormone associated with aggression) as it develops neurons and alters activity in the brain.
One study involving 160 parents living together with their first-born infants found higher oxytocin levels for fathers and mothers.
A different study involving 70 fathers and their children up to 2 years old revealed an inverse relationship between testosterone levels and caregiving.
Additionally, a study conducted on mice indicates new neurons could develop from interactions with offspring, while another study with male marmosets found larger dendritic spines of neurons in the prefrontal cortex (responsible for planning and decision making) in fathers compared to non-fathers.
There’s also evidence of similar parental brain activity tied to an infant’s crying that showed “greater activation in the amygdala,” which helps process emotional experiences, according to an article by Aaron Sathyanesan, a developmental neuroscientist.
“Many other studies suggest much similarity in the ways that the brains of mothers and fathers are activated in response to hearing their children cry or looking at pictures or movies of their children,” Mr. Sathyanesan wrote for CBE International. “While pregnancy hormones activate unique pathways in the brain for mothers, fathers tend to show activation in brain pathways based on experience and learning.”
Mr. Merzenich said it is difficult to measure changes in the brains of fathers because brains are always evolving. He added that researchers could do numerous experiments across the course of parenthood to measure how fathers’ brains change.
Interactions with children expand parents’ concepts of self reference, almost as if kids become a part of their fathers and mothers, Mr. Merzenich said, adding that parents are built to have longer attachments to their children.
As a dad of three daughters, he expressed how grateful he is for his children.
“What a privilege it is to be a father,” the neuroscientist said. “I know I’m a far richer person for it. It’s made me a more complete human being. It’s made me a more generous person.”
“Count your blessings and make a great day of it. And make the most of reconnecting with your children if you can do that,” Mr. Merzenich said as advice to fathers.

President Trump raised a record $24.8 million in less than 24 hours Tuesday as he officially kicked off his reelection campaign, officials said.
The president’s one-day total is more than any Democratic presidential candidate raised in the entire first quarter. It’s also more than the top five polling Democrats raised, combined, in the first 24 hours of their campaign launches.
“The enthusiasm across the country for this President is unmatched and unlike anything we’ve ever seen!” tweeted Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh called the one-day total “jaw dropping.”
“Do the math: that’s more than a million dollars an hour for an entire day,” Mr. Murtaugh tweeted. “On top of an electric rally in Orlando, this shows huge Trump enthusiasm.”
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden received glowing media reports for raising a “record-breaking” $500,000 on Monday night in an event at the Manhattan townhouse of billionaire hedge fund manager Jim Chanos.
As he gears up for the first Democratic debate, Mr. Biden told supporters that his fundraising to date has reached nearly $20 million. He launched his campaign in late April.
Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont led the Democratic field in first-quarter fundraising with about $20.7 million.
Mr. Biden raised about $6.3 million in the first 24 hours after his campaign kickoff. Mr. Sanders raised $5.9 million in his first 24 hours; Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California raised about $1.5 million.
Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas raised $6.1 million in the first day of his campaign but hasn’t been able to break into the top five in most polls.

SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said Wednesday she’s prepared to extend the legislative session and mobilize the state police force if Senate Republicans follow through with a threat to block a vote on a sweeping climate plan.
“I am prepared to use all resources and tools available to me as Governor to ensure that Oregonians are being served by their leaders,” she said in a statement. “I am in close communication with Oregon State Police and my office is making preparations for a special session.”
Her statement heightens tensions with Senate Republicans, who said earlier this week that they are “prepared to take action to stop” what could become the nation’s second statewide cap and trade program.
Truckers and loggers from around the state returned to the Capitol on Wednesday to protest cap and trade, a free market solution to lower industrial greenhouse gas emissions. Cap and trade opponents say the program would decimate jobs in rural areas.
Democrats in Oregon control both the House and the Senate . The GOP has used walkouts as a way to slow the legislative process.
Republicans walked out of the Senate earlier this session in protest of a school funding tax package, denying the chamber enough lawmakers to continue with a vote. The standoff lasted four days, until the governor struck a deal to table legislation on gun control and vaccine requirements.
As part of that deal, Republicans said they wouldn’t walk out again or delay votes through other legislative procedures. Although Brown could have deployed the Oregon State Police to physically bring members back to the chamber, she chose instead to strike a deal, saying at the time that she wanted to maintain decorum and have an “orderly session.”
But civility seems to be out the window as session nears its end, and Republicans have become increasingly agitated with a Democratic supermajority that plans to push through huge legislative priorities over the next two weeks addressing affordable housing and climate change.
Brown called the Republican threat of a walkout “a slap in the face,” saying they have turned “their back on respectful dialogue just because they don’t agree with others in the conversation.”
“I’m disappointed in the Senate Republicans’ indications of a walkout, which would silence their constituents while stifling democracy,” Brown said in a press release. “It’s not only dishonest, it violates the oaths they took to speak for their constituents as well as the word they gave to their colleagues and to me.”
Sen. Brian Boquist, a Republican from Dallas, pushed back against the governor’s threats to mobilize the state police if a second walkout occurs.
“If you send the state police after me,” he told Senate President Peter Courtney, “Hell’s coming to get you.”

SOLDOTNA, Alaska — A Satanic Temple member who won the right to open a regional Alaska government meeting declared “Hail Satan” during her first invocation, prompting about a dozen officials and attendees to walk out.
Tuesday’s invocation that started the meeting of the Kenai Peninsula Borough also spurred a protest outside the southern Alaska borough’s administration building that drew 40 people, The Peninsula Clarion newspaper reported .
Protesters held signs saying “reject Satan and his works” and “know Jesus and his love.”
QUIZ: Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?
During her invocation, Satanic Temple member Iris Fontana said, “That which will not bend, must break, and that which can be destroyed by truth should never be spared as demise. It is done, hail Satan,” Kenai radio station KSRM reported .
She was among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit litigated by the ACLU of Alaska against the borough after it approved a 2016 policy saying that people who wanted to give the invocations at the government body’s meetings had to belong to official organizations with an established presence on the Kenai Peninsula , which lies 75 miles (121 kilometers) south of Anchorage. Other plaintiffs who had been denied permission to give the invocations included an atheist and a Jewish woman.
The Alaska Supreme Court last October ruled that the borough policy was unconstitutional and the borough government changed it in November to allow anyone to offer invocations regardless of religion.
Assembly members Norm Blakeley and Paul Fischer and borough Mayor Charlie Pierce were among those who left the assembly chambers along with some audience members.
Assembly members are not required to attend the invocation to participate in meetings.
The protesters included William Siebenmorgen, who flew to Alaska from Pennsylvania for the event.
“God will be pleased with our public prayers of reparation. We want God’s blessings on America, not Satan’s curses. Lucifer is the eternal loser. Let’s keep him out,” he told KSRM .

Julian Assange indictment runs counter to the Supreme Court decision on Daniel Ellsberg - Washington Times,amp.washingtontimes.com,Andrew P.

Swedish prosecutors plan ... more > What happened to the freedom of speech? By Andrew P. Napolitano - - Wednesday, May 29, 2019
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
“Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press…” — First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
When James Madison agreed be the scrivener at the Constitutional Convention during the summer of 1787, he could not have known that just three years later he’d be the chair of the House of Representatives committee whose task it was to draft the Bill of Rights.
In doing so, he insisted that the word “the” precede the phrase “freedom of speech” in what was to become the First Amendment, so as to reflect its pre-existence; meaning, the freedom of speech pre-existed the United States. Madison believed that the pre-political rights, which he enumerated in the Bill of Rights, are natural to our humanity and he articulated as much in the Ninth Amendment, and in his speeches in support of the ratification of what would become the first 10 amendments.
Madison knew that when he wrote “Congress shall make no law abridging … the freedom of speech, or of the press,” he and the ratifiers meant no law. As direct and unambiguous as those words are — the U.S. Constitution as amended is the supreme law of the land — Congress and the courts have not always been faithful to them.
Thus, at the height of the anti-immigrant hysteria whipped up by President Woodrow Wilson and his supporters, Congress enacted the Espionage Act of 1917, which punished speech deemed harmful to America’s war efforts. Wilson was determined to win World War I at the price of the suppression of ideas that he hated or feared.
The Espionage Act was used aggressively and successfully (from Wilson’s vantage point) during the war and in the immediate years following. Then, a series of Supreme Court decisions instructed that the Act is probably unconstitutional as its sole purpose and effect is to suppress speech. These opinions harkened back to Madison, who believed that the only moral and constitutional remedy for hateful or harmful or even seditious speech was not suppression and punishment but rather more speech.
That attitude prevailed generally in the legal and judicial communities and at the Department of Justice for a few generations — even during World War II — until now. Now, the Trump DOJ has indicted a non-American whose alleged crimes took place in Europe for numerous violations of the Espionage Act, and it has done so in direct defiance of a Supreme Court decision that ruled against this during the Nixon years.
The non-American is Julian Assange, a radical and unorthodox publisher of truthful information that often exposes the hypocrisy of government. His entity for exposure is WikiLeaks — the website known for receiving stolen data and for posting true and accurate copies of them.
It was Assange and WikiLeaks that published the infamous Democratic National Committee emails in October 2016, which contained the “dirt” on Hillary Clinton once offered by Russian agents to Trump campaign officials, and for which then-candidate Trump lavished public praise on WikiLeaks.
Yet, back in 2010, Assange arranged to receive and publish stolen copies of top secret military materials that revealed American military personnel in Afghanistan at their worst. It showed them knowingly killing innocent civilians — and doing so gleefully. The data that Assange revealed had been stolen for him by an Army private then named Bradley Manning. Manning was tried and convicted of the theft and was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In January 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning’s sentence to time served.
If this sounds a bit like history repeating itself from the Nixon years, it is. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg, a civilian employee of the Nixon Department of Defense, revealed that he had stolen thousands of pages of top secret materials showing that former President Lyndon B. Johnson and some of his generals had serially lied to the American public and to Congress about the Vietnam War.
When he delivered the stolen materials to The New York Times and to The Washington Post for publication, and the Nixon DOJ got wind of the delivery, it persuaded two federal judges to enjoin the publication of the documents.
In a landmark decision, known as the Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court ruled that a publisher may reveal whatever materials come into the publisher’s possession, no matter how they got there, so long as the materials are themselves material to the public interest.
Stated differently, the thief — Ellsberg then, Manning today — can be tried for theft, but the publisher is absolutely protected by the “no law” language of the First Amendment. Ellsberg was indicted and prosecuted, but the charges were dismissed by a federal judge whose conscience was shocked when he learned that FBI agents broke into the office of Ellsberg’s psychiatrist to get “dirt” on him.
Assange is also protected by the values underlining that “no law” language. The whole purpose of the First Amendment, numerous courts have written, is to promote and provoke open, wide, robust political debate about the policies of the government. That simply cannot be done when government operates in secret. Even when publishers tell the possessors of state secrets how to deliver them — as Times and Post reporters surely did to Ellsberg — they cannot be silenced or punished.
Why was Assange indicted? Government killers are a mob, and mobs love anonymity. Assange assaulted their love by ending that anonymity. When the government kills and rejoices and lies about it in our names, we have a right to know of its behavior. Democracies spy on us all, yet they persist in punishing, to the ends of the earth, those who dare to shine a light upon them. Tyrannies do the same.
