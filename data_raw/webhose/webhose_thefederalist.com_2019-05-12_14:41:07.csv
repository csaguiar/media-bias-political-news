Why You Should Plan A Low-Screen Summer For Your Kids,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/plan-low-screen-summer-kids/,"By Joy Pullmann April 26, 2019
In the past decade there has been an explosion in research and anecdotes demonstrating that screen use has some highly negative effects that are worse for children. In response, a niche market has cropped up among people trying to use technology better, as represented by, for example, Cal Newport’s new book, “Digital Minimalism” and James Clear’s writings on productivity .
Yet it seems our society at large is still in the “early adopter” stage of questioning and limiting our tech addictions. Public schools continue to amp up screen-led learning despite myriad high-profile failures at giving all kids a device and the increasing amount of research questioning those decisions. While I ran errands last week, the majority of children I saw out with their parents or grandparents were staring at phones or tablets as they sat in their strollers or in restaurants.
T ime use studies still find Americans, including children, gobbling insane amounts of green-glow time. Kids ages 2 to 8 average 2.5-3 hours of daily screen time , or about 20 hours per week. Kids ages 8 to 12 average 4.5 hours of daily screen time , or more than 30 hours per week. Teens average more than six hours per day, or more than 40 hours per week. Teens could literally hold down a full-time job if they cut out the video games and YouTube. None of this is for school, either, as school-age kids average 16 minutes of daily school-related screentime.
We know deep inside that there’s something wrong with all this, and the proliferation of panicked online articles, including the replete genre of “I dumped my smartphone” articles, recently topped off by Charlotte Church, is evidence of that intuition. Sixty percent of American parents think their kids are addicted to screens (yet keep supplying the screens). One-third say they argue daily with their kids about screen use. Half of teens say they feel addicted to their devices. We’re definitely conflicted about our relationship with media, but often we just allow that conflict to ebb and flow as it will without taking proactive steps to intentionally direct it.
There’s a way out of this. It requires first getting over our inertia and deciding something must and will be done. Then once we’re convinced a change is necessary, we have to make that change wisely. Summer is the perfect time of year to plan and execute a reset of damaging family screen habits.
Future articles (I’ll link here after they’re published) will concern how to set yourself and your family up for success in replacing media addictions with more fulfilling and worthwhile pursuits. This one aims to convince you it’s necessary. No Child Needs a Screen. Period.
I’m going to be blunt: There is no real benefit to your children of using a cell phone, tablet, or computer before about age 12. They gain absolutely nothing of value that they could not get in a better way from some other activity. Zero . (Special-needs kids who use tablets for things like communication are obviously rare exceptions.) That includes entertainment, which we’ll talk about later, but right now just consider actual need .
Typing, or other computer use skills? Look, insofar as typing will be necessary in the decade or more from now when today’s kids presumably will be ready for a career — and we might all very well be using voice commands or even brain commands by then, making keyboards obsolete — it is a stupidly easy skill they can pick up in about two weeks of short lessons, tops.
Remember Mavis Beacon? It’s free now. If your kids are so typing-challenged at the time they actually need to produce a paper longer than 600 words — and it’s not a typical school that requires that until high school now, sad to say — you can help them solve that problem pronto. The same goes for all other pinch, swipe, and search skills, which kids pick up in about 90 seconds flat. Further, it’s actually better for their brains to write by hand instead of by computer.
Needing to contact you? How did parents ever parent before cell phones became ubiquitous in the last decade? They talked and made plans beforehand, that’s how. When kids really need their parents (i.e., medical emergency on the school playground, a spontaneous after-school playdate) another adult can call using his cell phone.
For safety reasons? Get the kid a walkie talkie, an electronic tracker, or a dumbphone if you’re anxious. But you really don’t need to. Again, ten years ago there were not mass murders of ten-year-olds who didn’t have cell phones. The safety concern is an illusion, a cover for our screen compulsions. Kids today are safer than kids have ever been in the history of mankind . They’re far more likely to be endangered by being fat because they stare at screens too much than they are to get injured, kidnapped, or any other hypothetical risk of being more active.
Kids get antsy in the doctor’s waiting room? Bring a book or some crayons and a coloring book, for Pete’s sake. It’s not that hard to not raise a zombie.
Just try to think of any reason your child truly needs a phone or tablet. There isn’t one. Screens Are For Parents Who Haven’t Learned Better Skills
Now that we’ve established your child does not need a screen, you are freer to consider its true value to your family. Most of them are actually benefits to parents, in the vein of buying a half hour (or, let’s be accurate: three to six hours a day) of kids sitting, glassy-eyed and not bickering or destroying your kitchen cabinets. It’s kid soma .
We all have had the days where every kid in the house is vacillating between puking all over you and screaming their feverish little brains out. That is a great day to pop some soma. But in reality, parenting days like those are extremely rare and not the typical reason for handing over the blue rectangle. We do it because it’s easier than genuine parenting, which requires actively cultivating our kids towards excellence.
Our job is to help our children learn how to be the best adults they can be, and we cannot help them do that if we’re not using media intentionally or teaching them how. We must stop being in denial about how addicted we and our kids are, and what we’re losing in the process. So it’s time to step up, ditch the denial, and prepare to lead. Screens Suck Your Family’s Growth Potential
Most parents are almost certainly not aware that when we hand our kids the Kindle again, we’re damaging our kids and our relationship. We’re developing the habit in ourselves and our children of addictively medicating and separating from each other when bored rather than using boredom as a personal and relational growth opportunity. It’s time to stop that, for the sake of our kids. They deserve much better, and we are capable of giving it to them.
Dennis Prager wrote recently about the erosion of hobbies, and how the most direct way to create the time for this kind of self-development is by limiting screens: “There is a world of difference between being active and being passive, between creating something and watching something, between doing something and being entertained… what will your child’s most important passion be after leaving school—in other words, for the next 70 years of his or her life?”
Prager referenced an article by younger writer Dan Scotti, “ Why Don’t Millennials Have Hobbies Anymore ?”“None of my friends have hobbies,” Scotti writes, and neither does he. “We’re not looking for the things that interest us or uniquely move us; we’re simply fixated on whatever is prepared for us on a silver platter by media outlets and trending topics.” Is that the kind of person you want to become, and want your children to become? If not, the time to prevent it is now.
My parents were screen Nazis when I was a kid. Our movie and Windows 95 “Oregon Trail” time were very limited. At the time it annoyed me, and I nagged them plenty about it, with the inevitable comparisons to all the other kids in town. But now as an adult, I have so many enjoyable modes of being thanks to my parents imposing self-control on me until I could control myself.
I paint (oils, walls, and acrylics), draw, crochet, sew, garden, and have even recently taken up woodworking and bike riding. I cook, bake, decorate, and am learning to landscape. I read like an addict. As a teen, I learned to ride and train horses, and wrote a book with the free time my parents secured by choking off the screens. Today, I have five kids, and when the babies wean I get bored and want another one. You can’t tell me another baby isn’t way better than having watched everything on Netflix . Not Just Opportunity Cost, But Active Harm to Kids
One of the worst things about screen-watching the equivalent of a part-time or full-time job’s worth of hours in a week is all the potential for creativity, learning, self-care and happiness it sucks out of a person’s life. It’s a major opportunity cost.
It’s also actively harmful to kids. For one, kids’ fitness levels today are at life-endangering low levels. Among kids ages 5 to 10, three-quarters spend less than one hour per day physically active, as a direct result of their screen use. I have kids in this age range. If they behaved that sedately I’d be sure they were sick. Not incidentally, they are also as fit as a fiddle.
Recent data from 28 advanced countries shows the kids are sick. Compared to kids 50 years ago, kids today “take 90 seconds longer to run a mile” and their “aerobic fitness has declined by 5 percent.” These are major risk factors for heart disease, a leading indicator of lifelong health problems.
Researcher Jean Twenge and many researchers have also exhaustively documented numerous psychological problems linked with increased screen use among children, as well as their higher susceptibility to related problems and an inability to control their use due to immature brains. Screen use is correlated with depression, ADHD, anxiety , and a host of other psychological problems.
“There’s many studies that look at MRI scans of the brain of kids who play a lot of video games, 20 hours or more of video games a week. And when they compare them to people who are addicted to, say, drugs or alcohol, their brains scans are similar,” Dr. Delaney Ruston told PBS about the documentary “Screenagers.”“So, something is really happening on a physiological level. It’s not just psychological.”
Add to this the negative effects on the life of the mind. In “The Wired Child,” Dr. Richard Freed writes, “research indicates that technologies our kids typically spend so much time with, including video games and social networks, hinder their success in school.” A recent survey from Common Sense Media found that kids are reading less than ever, partly due to staring at glowing boxes instead:
not only do reading rates decline as kids get older, but they’ve also dropped off significantly in the past 30 years. In 1984, 8% of 13-year-olds and 9% of 17-year-olds said they ‘never’ or ‘hardly ever’ read for pleasure. In 2014, that number had almost tripled, to 22% and 27%. Girls also tend to read more than boys, as 18% of boys say they read daily, while 30% of girls do.
Parents are also reading to their kids less than ever. In 1999, children ages 2 to 7 were read to for an average of 45 minutes per day. In 2013, that number had dropped to an average of just over 30 minutes per day.
It’s not merely because screentertainment displaces time kids could spend reading or thinking, although it definitely does that. It’s also because electronic media are less mentally “sticky”: people understand and remember more of what they read on paper.
One study found what others have also, that “students who read texts in print scored significantly better on the reading comprehension test than students who read the texts digitally.” Children and teens also prefer to read in print instead of on screens, and they read more when they do so in print. All You Have to Lose Are Poor Parenting Habits
Might you and your kids escape from all these terrible possibilities of screen overuse? Certainly. But you aren’t so far, are you? Be honest.
Also, why take all these risks with your kids for something that is not necessary, and when so many better opportunities to use their time exist? Literally playing in the mud with sticks would be better for kids than getting their grubs on a phone. It would help develop their imaginations, creativity, attention spans, curiosity, fine and gross motor skills, and relationships with the natural world and fellow mud-dabblers.
As a parent, my guess of the biggest barrier to change is not knowing how and not wanting to endure your kids’ withdrawal symptoms. I have some strategies for both that I’ll share next time.

Stop Complaining About Debt If You Spent 4 Years At College Instead Of 3,thefederalist.com,Liz Wolfe,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/26/stop-complaining-about-debt-if-you-spent-4-years-at-college-instead-of-3/,"By Liz Wolfe April 26, 2019
Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate and senator from Massachusetts, wants to cancel everyone’s student loan debt and make college free, she announced earlier this week.
Although she isn’t billing it as such, Warren’s plan will give handouts mostly to those who are wealthy already, or at least are on their way to upward mobility. Those people should not be priority candidates for government assistance. Inez Feltscher Stepman writes at The Federalist , “College debt is—paradoxically though it may seem—largely a problem of the upper classes, with the top income quarter of households holding close to half the debt, and the bottom quarter just 10 percent.”
Over at Reason, Peter Suderman identifies this same problem, saying, “the nature of college attendance and student loans means that Warren’s loan forgiveness plan is a massive giveaway to relatively well-off people.” He continues, “In the U.S., only about a third of people over 25 have a college degree, making them a comparatively elite group whose elite status is reinforced by, among other things, the connections they make while at college.”
I went to a decently fancy school, the College of William and Mary, and know many people struggling with the tab they had accrued upon graduating. For people from poorer families, who got no help from parents, I feel plenty of sympathy. For people from wealthier families, who got some amount of help from their parents yet are still stuck with a hefty chunk of student loan debt, I feel less sympathy. The hard truth is that if people were more strategic about reducing their debt burden, they could have graduated in three years instead of four.
I graduated in two and a half years while working 20-25 hours per week. I received a good bit of financial help from my parents, but it was not at all enough to cover four years of in-state tuition and living expenses. My plan from the start was to graduate in three years. After my first year, I realized I was going to run out of money before three years were over, so I sped it up. I entered school with roughly 40 credits through a combination of community college classes, Advanced Placement credits, and my high school’s dual enrollment program, where students could take classes at Virginia Commonwealth University, which counted toward most state school degrees.
Once I entered college, I had to petition do-nothing bureaucrats to let me take 19, 20, and 21 credit semesters to make it all work. I knew I didn’t want to go to grad school, so I got Cs and Ds in a lot of my classes, intentionally; I wanted to exert the minimal amount of effort because I was singleminded in my goal—to graduate with no debt and get the heck out the dismal swamp of Williamsburg, Virginia. I still wish I’d dropped out, but I’m at least glad to not be saddled with massive payments several years out.
Decently wealthy, decently high-performing students can and should do this. Administrators won’t make it easy or tell you this is a doable plan, because they have no incentive to. They want to suckle more money from you, your parents, and taxpayers, pretending it’s in service of your bright, bright future.
When I was in school, I asked for data on the number of students who had graduated in two and a half years over the past decade. The provost’s office identified about 15 (the number of three-year graduates was an order of magnitude higher).
This is a fundamental flaw in the way we’re messaging college. We’re telling people to prioritize the wrong things—the experience, not the shackles of debt; doing what’s normal, not doing what sets you up for happier adulthood; luxuriating in your four years, not thinking forward to the decades you might spend seemingly drowning in stress based on a decision you made at a very young age.
We’re failing students by not reminding them early graduation is an option, by not communicating what sort of dent loan payments will make in each and every paycheck for the next decade. We’re failing them when we put hurdles in their way, making it harder to take a creative path through college , acting like “good” and prestigious students would never dream of workarounds like mine.
Understandably, this is an area where people get defensive, regretful—perhaps defensive because they’re regretful—and self-righteous pretty quickly. People are convinced that their path was right, or that their circumstances dictated why they did college a certain way. People rarely self-identify an agency problem because that would require deeper reflection, and they might not like what they find.
To be sure, there are circumstances that make a route like mine harder. But specifically for this subset of students I described (one whose parents will not be footing the entire bill, but can chip in for a portion of it, who attend schools that have AP and dual-enrollment offerings), it shouldn’t be criminal to suggest that four years’ worth of college can reasonably be completed in three.
This route requires some sacrifice: you will drink less watery, garbage beer. Professors and administrators might try to instill doubt in you (remember, their incentives are not aligned with yours). You will feel overworked. Still, you always have the option of failure—and failure, in this case, means taking four years to graduate instead of three. At a highway robbery institution school like William and Mary, that would mean saving $23,400 .
Warren’s plan is foolish for many reasons, mostly because she’s attempting to provide handouts that help relatively affluent people get even wealthier. The government already botched their meddling in the higher education industry, and that’s a big reason we’re in this mess.
If you want to reduce your debt burden, don’t take other people’s money to do it. Attempt to get a little more creative and stop buying into the four-year college dream you’ve been peddled by scammers who don’t really care about your future at all.

Joe Biden On Anita Hill In 1998: 'She Was Lying',thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/28/joe-biden-on-anita-hill-in-1998-she-was-lying/,"By Mollie Hemingway April 28, 2019
Former vice president Joe Biden repeatedly said on The View on Friday that he believed Anita Hill from the moment he heard her tale of sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas. But he previously told Sen. Arlen Specter that it was clear her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee included lies.
“Not only didn’t I vote for Clarence Thomas, I believed her from the beginning. I was against Clarence Thomas, I did everything in my power to defeat Clarence Thomas and he won by the smallest margin anyone ever won going on the Supreme Court,” Biden told “The View’s” Joy Behar.
But in 1998, Biden admitted to Specter that “It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, [Hill] was lying” about a key part of her testimony. The exchange was published in Specter’s 2000 memoir , “Passion for Truth: From Finding JFK’s Single Bullet to Questioning Anita Hill to Impeaching Clinton.”
The issue is important, as the media and other partisans rewrite the historical record about Hill and her accusations. The widely watched hearings revealed inaccuracies in Hill’s various versions of events and ended with 58 percent of Americans believing Thomas and only 24 percent believing Hill . There was no gap between the sexes in the results. In the intervening years, activists have relentlessly attempted to change the narrative, writing fan fiction about Hill, bestowing honors on her, and asserting that her disputed allegations were credible.
On “The View,” Biden claimed, “If you go back and look at what I said and didn’t say, I don’t think I treated her badly. I took on her opposition. What I couldn’t figure out how to do — and we still haven’t figured it out – how do you stop people from asking inflammatory questions?”
Prominent media partisans attacked Specter for asking tough questions of Hill. Or really, just for asking simple questions she struggled to answer. He began by noting that many people had reported Hill had praised Thomas and his nomination to the Supreme Court. These included a former colleague at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where both Hill and Thomas had worked years prior. Another person corroborated the colleague’s claim.
Hill disputed their claims. She also disputed the former dean of her law school, who said she had praised Thomas as a “fine man and an excellent legal scholar.” Then she claimed she didn’t know a woman named Phyllis Barry, who had told The New York Times that Hill’s allegations “were the result of Ms. Hill’s disappointment and frustration that Mr. Thomas did not show any sexual interest in her.”
Under questioning from Specter, in which he mentioned that two colleagues had provided statements attesting that she knew Barry, Hill was forced to concede that she knew her and had worked with her at the EEOC.
Specter then asked about the major contradictions between her testimony to the Senate and her interviews with the FBI. Her testimony with the Senate was much more colorful and descriptive even though it took place just days after her FBI interviews.
Finally he asked Hill about a USA Today article that claimed, “Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that ‘quietly and behind the scenes’ would force him to withdraw his name.”
Specter read from the article: “Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate Judiciary Committee staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate staffers that her charge would be kept secret and her name kept from public scrutiny.” Later it said, “They would approach Judge Thomas with the information and he would withdraw and not turn this into a big story, Henderson says.”
Specter asked her if this was true, attempting to find out what Senate Democrats had arranged with Hill. Nine times she denied the claim, demurred, or otherwise attempted to get away from the question. She said she could vividly remember events related to Thomas from many years prior, but couldn’t quite remember this conversation from weeks prior. Specter described the scene in the book, and even interviewed Biden about it:
After this exchange Biden recessed the committee. Biden told me in November 1998, ‘It was clear to me from the way she was answering the questions, she was lying.’
‘At that point I truncated the hearing and recessed it early for lunch,’ Biden said. ‘I turned to my chief of staff and said, ‘Go down and tell her lawyers that if her recollection is not refreshed by the time she gets back, I will be compelled to pursue the same line of questioning the Senator [Specter] did. Because it seems to me, she did what he said.’
Biden, as the committee’s chairman and top Democrat, would have carried great sway if he had suggested publicly that Hill was lying when she repeatedly answered questions about Thomas’s potential withdrawal by saying she didn’t remember.
Now that he’s running for president again, Biden may be trying to avoid the reality of Hill’s weak testimony or his role in encouraging her to answer the question forthrightly. But in 1991, when Hill came back from lunch, her story had changed.
“There was some indication that the candidate — excuse me — the nominee might not wish to continue the process,” Hill admitted. Asked to clarify whether a particular staffer had told her that Thomas “might not wish to continue to go forward with his nomination, if you came forward?” Hill again admitted, “Yes.”
The exchange was just one example of why so many Americans outside of the liberal media thought Hill lacked credibility. Specter credited Biden’s warning to Hill about her lies as helping her with her eroding credibility: “Hill’s afternoon modification of her morning testimony, therefore, was not only deliberate but calculated to avoid greater erosion to her credibility.”
There were many problems with Hill’s claims, including that the record showed she had followed Thomas from a protected service job at the Education Department to one at the EEOC. The Yale Law graduate claimed she was confused about whether she could keep her job at the Education Department. She’d also voluntarily accompanied him to a speech, and had repeatedly called him with pleasantries. Thomas’ secretary had kept logs of Hill’s many calls. One message simply said she was calling to check in, for example.
Two FBI special agents swore out an affidavit after Hill’s testimony outlining “contradictions” between her interviews with them and her testimony. Special Agent Jolene Smith Jameson wrote, “Professor Hill made comments that were in contradiction with statements she had made to SAs Jameson and John B. Luton.” They also disputed her characterization of how honest they instructed her to be.
The media, who have defended Hill for decades despite inconsistencies and inaccuracies in her story, are upset that Biden didn’t apologize to Hill. “Biden Struggles to Apologize for Anita Hill’s Treatment, Reassure Women,” read the headline for Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein’s “news” story.
On “The View,” one interlocutor told Biden that people were upset he hadn’t allowed other women to testify against Thomas. He explained that he tried to get them to testify, but there were problems and that forcing them to testify may have been worse for Hill. He was understating wildly, referring to the last woman mentioned in this summary of problems with Hill’s alleged witnesses :
Hill’s four alleged corroborating witnesses provided very weak testimony. One witness told Committee staff that the alleged harassment happened before Hill ever worked for Thomas. Another witness claimed that Hill had no political motives to oppose Thomas because she was a conservative who fully supported the Reagan Administration’s civil rights policies. This representation was false. Angela Wright , who many claimed would provide similar testimony as Hill, declined to testify because of serious credibility issues related to her motives and her previous efforts to falsely accuse a supervisor of racism.
Much revisionist history has been drafted by partisans who oppose Thomas’s judicial philosophy. It’s true that Biden did his best to help Hill, including concealing witnesses who would have been a disaster under examination. But even he admitted to his colleague Specter that Hill was lying.
Hill’s allegations against Thomas were far from convincing when she made them, and the passage of time has done nothing to bolster the veracity of her accusations. But based on the uncritical acceptance of the revisionist history of the Clarence Thomas hearings, it’s crystal clear that journalists would do well to familiarize themselves with the actual facts of what happened and call Biden to account for his treatment of Thomas.

‘Avengers: Endgame’ Makes It Easier To Say Goodbye To An Era,thefederalist.com,John Cooper,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/avengers-endgame-makes-easier-say-goodbye-era/,"By John Cooper April 29, 2019
“It’s the end, the end of the path I started us on.” With the release of “Avengers: Endgame,” and after 11 years and 22 films, we are indeed at the end of the path Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man started us all on, and while that’s a somewhat bittersweet fact, “Endgame” is a fitting way to conclude that journey.
This is a unique moment in cinema. There will certainly be more Marvel Cinematic Universe films—Spiderman and Black Panther sequels are already on deck, as well as a third installment in the Guardians of the Galaxy series—but even before its release, it was widely accepted that “Endgame” represented the definitive end to this era of the MCU and the beginning of a transition to something new.
So, naturally, for this longtime fan of these films and these characters, the days leading up to the release of “Endgame” were a mix of emotions. Those included anticipation and excitement, certainly, but also a nervousness that perhaps the Russo brothers would uncharacteristically slip up and deliver a sub-par film.
More keenly, though, was a sense of sadness that this phase of the MCU is coming to a definitive close. Along with that was the understanding that, as with most things in life, there comes a time to move on. While doing so is never simple, this film makes taking that next step easier.
This film had a lot to accomplish. It had to drop us into a world shattered by a single snap of the Mad Titan’s fingers, reintroduce characters not present in “Infinity War,” and bring an epic series to a fitting and satisfying conclusion. By any objective measure, it does so.
It shows us a team ripped apart by the loss of their friends, and desperately searching, first for a solution to “the snap,” then for a way to move forward with their lives. It gives us engaging storylines for Ant-Man and Hawkeye, who play pivotal roles in the story. And if I told you that “Endgame” would contain time travel, a heist storyline, and a third-act set piece unlike any other put to the big screen, I would be understating it.
In fact, the sheer number of awe-inducing moments in this film separates it from even many of its peers in the MCU. The repeated, raucous cheers from the capacity crowd in my theater were just one proof. Also, of course, as with most MCU films, “Endgame” offers moments of genuine humor and profound emotion, consistently in a way faithful to the film’s broader tone.
What also makes “Endgame” so compelling is not simply that it accomplishes so much, but that it does so without undermining the foundation built by the films that came before it. The simple way out for any director would be to just “undo” the events of “Infinity War,” but in doing so, either undermine the impact of that film, or possibly undo events central to the previous 21 movies. Thankfully, Anthony and Joe Russo avoid both mistakes, and take the creative approach to tackling the problem of time travel in just about as compelling a way as possible.
The true heart of this film, however, as with so many others in the MCU, is the performance of the Avengers. Tony is guilty over his failure to stop Thanos, and embittered by what he perceives as Captain America’s abandonment of the fight. Captain America is struggling not only with losing the love of his life, but now also most of his remaining friends. Black Widow doesn’t know how to cope with life other than to throw herself into protecting the world from future threats.
These are just some of the dynamics we are introduced to in the film’s opening minutes, and the pace only picks up from there. Ultimately, this is a film not just about massive battles between good and evil, about flashy tech and iron suits, it is a look into the human soul, the challenges we face, and what we are willing to do to overcome them. It holds up a mirror to us and asks us to be honest about whether we are trying to get there in our own strength, or whether we will reach out and take the helping hand a friend is offering. Finally, it challenges us to be the friend who is willing to extend that hand.
This film succeeds because it is faithful to complete the journeys we have taken with these characters, especially those we’ve been with the longest, as they ask and answer those questions for themselves. All in all, “Endgame,” like its predecessors in the MCU, is a moving film about friendship, sacrifice, and perseverance. In no uncertain terms, it is a breath-taking spectacle that is a true pleasure to watch.
It may be the final chapter of that good book you don’t want to put down, but as The Vision points out in an earlier film, a thing isn’t beautiful because it lasts. Something similar is at work here. The Avengers, as we have come to know them, may no longer be on mission together, but they will last forever on film, and that is indeed a beautiful thing.

"Nationalism Is Not Our Biggest Threat, Technocracy Is",thefederalist.com,James Poulos,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/nationalism-not-biggest-threat-technocracy/,"By James Poulos April 29, 2019
Is nationalism right for America? With President Trump, an avowed nationalist, leading the Republican Party, it’s not surprising that the best commentary on nationalism—and the sharpest debate—is now found on the political right.
For proof, one need only have sat in on the National Review Institute’s recent Ideas Summit, where the grand debate saw Rich Lowry, National Review’s editor-in-chief, take the side of nationalism against Jonah Goldberg, the founder of National Review Online.
But why is nationalism such a hot topic today at all? While the president’s rhetoric is influential, and the ferment on the right has an attentive audience, something much more substantial accounts for the rise in nationalist sentiment at home and abroad.
Americans must realize that the solution to the puzzle is hiding in plain sight. Nationalism is back as a burning issue not because of modern demagoguery or ancient hatreds but because of the triumph of digital technology over everyday life. Dehumanization Versus Self-Rule
In the United States and around the world, the digital age is forcing a new choice between two types of governance—one nationalist, the other imperial. While both carry risks, only one is compatible with constitutional government and the central claims of the Declaration of Independence.
Americans shouldn’t fear that digital life is going to bring back the inhuman old days of twentieth-century-style nationalist extremism. The proper thing to fear is a dehumanizing new form of digital despotism.
The preeminent threat to American life is not the resurgence of the beasts within us, but the mastery of the bots above us. This is why the right’s new nationalists should command our attention.
The debate on the right frames the issue in exactly the right way. One side asserts that nationalism contains the paramount threat of the new age. These critics warn that all will be lost if we fail to head off a primitive backlash against the globalizing forces accelerated by the technocratic elite. They fear the beast within.
The other side warns that the West’s globalist technocrats have embraced a new imperial vision, one that promises uniform unfreedom on all, their worship of “diversity” notwithstanding. Their plan is increasingly out in the open.
In “The Big Nine,” New York University professor Amy Webb argues that artificial intelligence must be put not under American control but under that of a new international organization—a global diversity and inclusion agency. Otherwise, she warns, our robots will have white privilege—or even become white supremacists. Is Society the Problem Or Are Individuals?
So long as we learn to code our machines with the right secular religion, our imperialists believe, their robotic creations can and should order our lives better than we humans can order them ourselves. This is why today’s nationalists rightly conclude the bots above us, not the beasts within, are the proper object of our political fear.
This is an exercise of sound political judgment, not of dogma. As former national security advisor Michael Anton explained in a recent Princeton University address, in the totalitarian age, nationalism did pose a preeminent threat to America and the West. Only a globalized military and diplomatic response could destroy the threat and rebuild a legitimate order. But now, the order has mutated, and the context around it has changed. Nationalism our only political defense against the new imperialism.
Anton is hardly alone. The philosopher Yoram Hazony is now famous for persuasively advancing a similar argument. National Review’s Michael Brendan Dougherty, reviewing Goldberg’s latest book, stated the matter this way: “I’m less worried about foaming tribalists drunk on natural passion than I am of a generation of grass-eating males, who mute the natural passions and ambitions through drugs, pornography, and the flickering of the backlit screens. And so, in the immediate future, I don’t fear a return to the natural, I fear our continued flight from it.”
These insights arise from encounters with the reality of the digital age that established anti-nationalists strain to avoid. But their pedigree weaves back through philosophers from Montesquieu and Niccolo Machiavelli all the way to Aristotle. Intentionally or not, elites today who fear nationalism are working toward a much more alarming and damaging post-nationalist world of unfreedom and uniformity. Barreling Toward the Abolition of Man
With today’s progressives rushing to establish an automated imperium programmed with woke consciousness, the greatest peril today is not man’s barbaric inhumanity to man, which has always been with us, but a fresh horror without parallel: what Francis Fukuyama called “our posthuman future,” and C.S. Lewis called the “abolition of man.”
This is the new kind of evil empire Americans must stop today. To do so, we must travel down a path being cleared for now by President Trump, whose election forced our first big encounter with how dramatically digital life has disenchanted the one-world dream and made the “unthinkable” real. Trump’s administration will occupy only a handful of years, but his influence on the choice we must make might set us on a course of centuries.
Such a path delinks American finance, economics, and law from would-be automated imperialism. Trump’s skepticism of Silicon Valley, and his sense that government of the people and by the people must govern artificial intelligence, are essential instincts for securing the blessings of liberty and promoting the general welfare in a digital age.
Americanists should take heart in recalling how hard it is to force people to believe in obsolete dreams. But without clear and concerted action, that is precisely what the teched-up utopians will do.
Nationalism is back for one reason: awful as it is when men become as beasts, the more terrible threat of the new digital age is that the West’s progressive technocrats and woke seminarians will make us the slaves of their bots.

"No, It’s Not Bigoted For Lawmakers To Ban Child Drag Queens",thefederalist.com,Chad Felix Greene,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/no-not-bigoted-lawmakers-ban-child-drag-queens/,"By Chad Felix Greene April 29, 2019
Child exploitation should not be controversial, yet to the modern LGBT left it seems to be a subjective matter depending on what political or social narrative they want to pursue. Child drag queens appear to be a growing trend after the success of Desmond Napoles, who has been in the public eye since he was nine years old.
While many oppose the idea of minors performing drag at all, it shouldn’t be considered a “conservative” position to oppose them performing drag in adult bars. Drag is inherently sexual in nature. The origin and purpose of drag is to indulge adult humor through exaggerated female impersonation.
Some celebrate drag queens, and rightly so. They provide a unique sense of humor that is often playful, sassy, and so bluntly honest as to be enjoyable to many. But we should all agree it just isn’t for kids. It’s Not Just Dress-Up, It’s Also Sexual Dancing
LGBT advocates of child drag performers insist it’s just children playing dress-up, as the mother of a nine-year-old performer stated recently: “Jacob is just a guy who likes to dress up and dance and feel pretty… it’s kind of like Halloween every time he has the opportunity to do it.”
It can certainly be argued there is a fine line between a boy dressing-up to “feel pretty” and that same boy dressing in a way that mimics a highly sexualized adult entertainment style. Pretending that there is no distinction is simply avoiding the truth of what is actually being done, even if everyone involved has innocent intentions.
I have no doubt the adults encouraging these kids are doing so out of a sense of openness and a kind nature. I equally do not believe the vast majority of adults cheering inside a bar as the child performs have any malicious motivations. But the sexualized nature cannot be ignored.
Recently, the LGBT site Pink News published a fairly startling headline: “ Republican lawmakers want to make child drag shows illegal .” Strangely, this is portrayed as an act of anti-LGBT puritanism by ignorant and malicious Republicans. The article states, “Republican lawmakers in Ohio have filed a bill that would clamp down on drag performances by minors as ‘child exploitation.’”
The writer validates his suspicions by noting House Bill 180, “Prohibit performance in which child simulates sexual activity ,” is co-sponsored by other Republicans with a history of anti-LGBT positions. The specific bill language the writer and LGBT advocates oppose states an illegal performance would include one “that suggests a minor is participating or engaging in sexual activity, masturbation, or bestiality and that, taken as a whole by the average person applying contemporary community standards, appeals to prurient interest.”
Jacob’s mother insists she does not allow her son to dance to songs with sexual lyrics and that she attends and monitors his performances. But the photo included in the article portrays the boy dressed in clearly provocative clothing and dancing in a way that should raise an eyebrow for any reasonable person. Kids Can Be Exploited With Their Clothes On
Being far too literal, the writer argues the child was not specifically engaging in “sexual activity, masturbation or bestiality.” Shockingly, the mayor of Lancaster, Ohio stated in response to the concerns about the performance he had seen online that the boy “was fully clothed and was not touched by anyone in the audience.”
It should be clear to anyone objectively viewing this that the standard of concern should not be ruling out actual sexual activity or adults touching the child during the performance. The article quotes LGBT+ campaigner Kristen Angelo saying, “There is nothing wrong with what Jacob is doing. Nothing sexual, nothing inappropriate.”
The story first gained local attention when a video of a performance of the boy in a gay bar was shared on Facebook: “The story was then picked up by various religious and conservative websites. Critics of a video shared online objected to the boy’s costume, which included a leotard and wig, dance moves characterized as sexual in nature, and that the boy can be seen accepting money from bar patrons during the performance.”
Defending her choice to allow her son to perform in gay bars, Jacob’s mother said, “Where else is there right now for children who identify as being in the LGBT community to explore that interest? There’s not.” Young musicians often perform in bars at the same time of night, she said: “The difference is a lack of wig and heels.”
But that is the point here. Nine-year-old musicians are not performing to drunken audiences in adults-only bars. The difference is far more than just a “wig and heels.” LGBT Contingent Appears to See No Problem
City police found no violations of state law or city ordinances, and the mayor stated, “The owners and managers of JD Hendersons [bar in question] did not approve of or condone this activity. Upon learning of this performance, the owners quickly condemned the show and banned this troupe of performers from returning to the establishment.”
He continued, “There have been serious threats of violence resulting from this post. Let us hope and pray that no harm comes to person or property as a result of it.” Jacob’s mother claimed to have received death threats and visits from local child protective services.
In a positive direction, State Sen. Teresa Fedor (D.-Toledo), who supports the proposed bill, said of the issue, “When we’re trying to prevent human trafficking from happening, especially the commercial, sexual exploitation of children, I don’t see how this is not very closely related to that issue — that concept of a rape culture where we’re normalizing this type of activity.”
Fedor is correct. A drag performance involves the entertainer typically lip-syncing to a song, dancing as provocatively as possible, and accepting “tips” from the audience during the performance. Many incorporate adult humor into their acts, which audiences loudly celebrate. It is intended to be adult entertainment. Create Kid Spaces Instead of Exposing Adult Behavior
Jacob’s mother is correct in one area of this discussion, and that is young boys interested in dressing up, dancing, and singing to their favorite female performers and entertaining an audience should have a safe and child-friendly environment to do so. There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space to perform in front of other children, parents, and local supporters without incorporating the adult aspects of drag culture. There is no justifiable reason for a nine-year-old to dance on stage in front of drunk adults, accepting money, and being encouraged to mimic adult entertainers. There is no reason LGBT leaders cannot launch a child-friendly performance space.
The core of the issue is that anyone who views this from the outside clearly sees the problem. We do not see innocent dress-up dance parties, as portrayed by LGBT media. We see dark rooms, a stage surrounded by adult men, and a young boy dressed as a miniature adult woman parading around as the men toss money on stage. The only way LGBT activists can respond is to dismiss the concerns altogether or misrepresent what we can clearly see happening.
The exploitation of the child is in the environment and the portrayal. Adults who do prey on children have easy access to these venues, and normalizing this behavior allows young boys with less protective parents to be highly vulnerable. The very nature of the LGBT argument is to suggest the child should be able to freely indulge his or her gender expression and sexuality regardless of what other adults think is best for their safety.
LGBT advocacy does not benefit from stubbornly pretending there is nothing of concern with this activity. LGBT leadership has an opportunity to step up and advocate creative and free gender expression by providing a safe and transparent space for it to occur. While we can disagree on the appropriateness of parents allowing young boys to cross-dress in this fashion, we should all agree it should not be happening at night in a gay bar.
The sponsors of this bill recognize, as state Rep. Tim Schaffer (R-Lancaster) stated perfectly , “Given our heightened focus on human trafficking and the role money plays in trafficking children, I knew I had to take action to make sure this activity does not occur again. We can do better to protect innocent children and we must do better.”
I agree with him and it’s not the sole view of bigots or religious extremists. The average person would easily be able to distinguish why this is such an important and distressing concern. Unfortunately, LGBT activism, as it stands right now, refuses to do so. Chad Felix Greene is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Authorities To Arrest Father If He Refers To Trans Child As Her Real Sex,thefederalist.com,Jeremiah Keenan,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/authorities-arrest-canadian-father-refers-trans-child-real-sex/,"April 29, 2019 By Jeremiah Keenan
Last Wednesday, The Federalist reported that the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Canada, declared a father guilty of family violence for his polite refusal to refer to his daughter as a boy in private, and his repeated choice to affirm in media interviews that she is a girl.
At about the same time that story was published, the Supreme Court issued an additional, more heavy-handed “protection order” from the same ruling. The three-page document declares that the father, Clark*, will henceforth be subject to arrest, immediately and “without warrant” if any police officer has “reasonable” grounds to believe that he has in any way referred to his daughter as a girl in public or in private.
The new order further stipulated not only that Clark must not discuss his daughter’s sex or gender identity in public, but also that he cannot share court documents describing his own gag order. On the one hand, this demand may seem ironic, since it covers a publicly available court ruling. On the other hand, the injunction is so broad that it naturally includes the very document upon which it is written and that document –with its threats of immediate arrest without warrant–has not, as of yet, been made available on the court’s website.
As previously reported , the BC Supreme Court ordered in February that 14-year-old Maxine* receive testosterone injections without parental consent. Accordingly, Maxine began regular injections at the BC Children’s Hospital over the last two months.
Her father, Clark, strongly objects to this treatment and immediately sought to reverse the decision in the BC Court of Appeal. “[These injections] will completely disrupt her puberty,” he lamented to The Federalist several weeks ago . “Her bones will stop growing, her brain will stop developing… and she’s not gonna be a boy. She won’t even have the bone-strength left to be a girl anymore.”
Hoping to raise awareness, Clark answered multiple requests for interviews in which he shared his opinion that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones were not right for his daughter. Like an increasing number of parents these days, Clark argued that his child had been misled and brainwashed by online activists and school administrators, who began to treat Maxine as a transgender boy at school, without informing her parents, when she was only 12 years old.
While Clark sought (and received) anonymity in these previous interviews in order to protect his daughter’s identity, the court appears to have been deeply disturbed by the negative publicity and politically incorrect commentary surrounding its decisions. In a ruling last week , Justice Francesca Marzari convicted Clark of “family violence” for his “public denial of [Maxine’s] gender identity.”
At the same time, Marzari also issued an order expunging from the court record the names of two doctors who had been actively involved in pushing a gender transition for Maxine. One of these doctors, Dr. Wallace Wong, has recently come under fire for potentially diagnosing as much as 20 percent of the children in his local orphanage system with some form of gender dysphoria.
While Marzari presented this tamping down of information as a matter of strict necessity, some argue that the BC Supreme Court is showing a lack of concern for freedom of speech and the open court principle. Kari Simpson, the president of Canadian pro-family organization Culture Guard, complained that the “BC Court has become a Star Chamber,” using raw power to rewrite reality.
“This is extreme and dangerous,” she said, arguing that the court was forcing Clark to embrace a “delusion” about his daughter’s gender and her “abuse” at the hands of doctors, or else be arrested.
Clark’s appeal of the court’s original ruling regarding testosterone injections into his daughter is set to be heard on May 14.

Libertarians Party For Hate Speech In New York City,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/libertarians-party-for-hate-speech-in-new-york-city/,"April 29, 2019 By David Marcus
Last Thursday night down on Bleeker Street in Manhattan, the libertarian entertainment company We The Internet gathered to throw a bash celebrating its latest mini-documentary, and the launch of its “The Funny Thing About Hate Speech” tour. The 15-minute film, “5 Reasons We Need Hate Speech,” is a full-throated defense of free speech that is well-produced, very clever, and often quite funny. Both the documentary and the party were hosted by Lou Perez, We The Internet’s jocular impresario whose straightforward and aw shucks style cuts straight to the heart of the matter.
The party in a downtown club space was fun and festive, a gathering of free thinkers and iconoclasts. Reason magazine’s Nick Gillespie was there (yes, he wore a leather jacket), and former American Civil Liberties Union head Nadine Strossen and author Zachary Wood joined Perez for a panel discussion. Among the questioners from the audience was journalist Jesse Singal, who appears in the film.
The documentary is now airing on YouTube and is linked below. The reasons it discusses for why we need hate speech, or more specifically need to not ban hate speech, are not particularly new. They focus mostly on how such bans not only make hate speech stronger, but that defining hate speech always winds up as a slippery slope that captures at its bottom a much wider range of speech than was ever intended.
What makes the film special, and is true of much of We The Internet’s work, is how difficult it is to pin down politically. Indeed one of the central focuses is European and to a lesser extent American efforts to criminalize or ban criticism of Israel.
In one of the film’s more humorous moments, Perez is on his way to interview a pro-Palestinian group at Fordham University that had been denied the right to organize. Before he arrives, he receives an email from them, explaining that in light of his previous controversial work, they were declining the interview. The irony was amazing. Those demanding free speech were declining this opportunity to engage in free speech.
While We The Internet is not conservative, and Perez insists the group attacks all sides, in this case the libertarian value of free speech overlaps considerably with conservative attitudes on the issue. So, while conservatives can’t exactly claim We The Internet as their own, the troupe often, as in this film, presents conservative ideas in a fun, fresh, and funny way. In a media landscape so hegemonically controlled by leftist voices, this is a very welcome thing.
Conservatives have long sought to parry the power of progressive media with original content of their own, but have most usually failed at it. We The Internet provides a road map for doing better. A lot of it has to do with a refusal to come off as angry or mean-spirited. Their productions are warm, calm, reasonable, and produce an affability that conservatives sometimes struggle with.
Although best known for their well-produced libertarian sketch comedy, of late We The Internet has been delving into more straightforward documentary work. This has included an interview series with Dr. Deborah Soh on the science of the sexes as well as discussions with thinkers like Coleman Hughes on race. This is a welcome and praiseworthy expansion of their mission, and it’s producing some really excellent content.
“5 Reasons Why We Need Hate Speech” is well worth the 15 minutes it takes to watch. It can be especially valuable for young people who are navigating a new set of speech codes and a society less friendly to free speech than even 10 or 20 years ago.
One hopes that We The Internet can keep up the good work, promoting a free and honest exchange of ideas. Operating outside the maelstrom of partisan politics, they create wonderful resources for understanding the deep cultural debates in society. Today such efforts, especially successful ones, are few and far between, but We The Internet seems to have it figured out.

Don't Bail Colleges Out Of The Student Loan Mess They've Made,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/dont-bail-colleges-student-loan-mess-theyve-made/,"By Nathanael Blake April 29, 2019
The political left owns higher education, and has broken it. With rare exception, colleges and universities are dominated by leftists, who should be held accountable for the mess they have made. But if we hope to reform higher education, we need to understand the dynamics at play. In particular, we must realize how administrators have used social justice activism to seize power and to cover for their economic injustices.
It is true that the tuition is too damn high . Working one’s way through college has become difficult or even impossible at many schools, including many of the most prestigious universities. With tuition and expenses in excess of $50,000 a year at elite schools, graduates often graduate with the equivalent of a mortgage. Yet even as tuition costs have shot up, classes are increasingly taught by underpaid adjunct faculty and graduate assistants. Students are paying more to learn from instructors who are paid less, so where does the money go?
Some goes to building projects and campus amenities that cater to well-to-do students who want and can afford a cushy life on campus. Much of it goes to pay for administrative bloat , as exemplified by the University of Michigan and its horde of nearly 100 diversity administrators. It has become normal for a university to have more administrators than full-time faculty. Many of these administrators draw fat salaries and build bureaucratic empires on the backs of instructors who are paid almost nothing for doing the actual work of the university, and students who have taken out exorbitant loans.
Borrowing for education is borrowing for life, as the student loans that fund this exploitation cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. As Michael Brendan Dougherty put it , the government has “made this debt more sacred than marriage”: student loan debt really is “until death.” The schools pocket the money upfront while the feds, who run student loans these days, have ways of getting their money back that even credit card companies lack.
This exploitative system should not be bailed out by boondoggles such as Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s plans for free college and student loan bailouts. Her proposal is a naked effort to revive her failing presidential campaign by buying off middle-class voters with subsidies. It is a policy rife with moral hazard that rewards irresponsible lending and borrowing, and will further inflate tuition. It is regressive insofar as it will be deficit-funded—and it will be. The notion that it will be funded by a tax on the very rich is laughable.
Ostensibly, federal student loans enable access to higher education. Practically, they inflate tuition , add burdensome regulations (federal cash comes with federal strings attached), and make higher education into a grift. As Kevin Williamson of National Review put it : “If you make a few gazillion dollars available to finance tuition payments with underwriting standards a little bit lower than those of the average pawn shop, you create a lot of potential tuition inflation…if Uncle Stupid puts a trillion bucks on the table, there are enough smart people at Harvard to figure out a way to pick it up.”
The problem is not that there isn’t enough government money going to higher education; the problem is that there is too much. Warren’s plan of debt forgiveness and free college would only expand the trough of federal cash at which higher education is gorging. Therefore Williamson suggests that we shut off the supply. Without a guaranteed pile of federal money available for every student, colleges and universities would be pressured to cut costs and reduce tuition.
Hopefully the administrative deadwood will bear the brunt of the axe. Those on the right tend to focus their ire on especially egregious cases of professorial insanity or particularly stupid student activists, but these are not the real rot in higher education. Today’s problems are less about radical professors and idiot students than administrative careerists who have given colleges and universities a new spiritual mission in the form of social justice activism.
This reorientation provides administrators a justification for their expanding power, prestige, and privilege. They are no longer the bookkeepers assisting the educational and research missions of higher education. Rather, they are the (well-paid) chaplains of the imperative of social justice and inclusion, now as important to the campus as anything professors do. Mainstream university administrators speak of social justice, diversity, and inclusion in ways that resemble the language conservative Christian colleges use to describe their spiritual purpose.
Positioning social justice concerns at the center of higher education’s mission gives power to the administrators who instigate and evaluate such efforts. Forcing the likes of engineering professors to define and defend their teaching and research in terms of diversity and inclusion is a way to control them. This is why proposals such as abolishing tenure will not fix the problems of campus radicalism. Indeed, administrators would love to be able to more easily fire professors who don’t toe the social justice line. But good luck firing the bias response team.
Of course, many campus administrators do not really believe the social justice creed, but their careers depend on acting like they do. The social justice poses of campus administrators also provide cover for economic injustice, as the true believers excuse careerists for economic injustice in exchange for an alliance on issues of race, gender, and sexuality.
No one wants to be accused of being insensitive to social justice, or insufficiently committed to diversity and inclusion. It would be a career killer. This intimidation ensures that people go along with the campus witch-hunts and inquisitions, and tolerate an expanding apparatus of enforcement, lest they become the next target. The academic cathedrals of the social justice left are full of silent heretics and doubting inquisitors, too afraid to oppose the insanity.
Those who control higher education have built a system of fearful, enforced orthodoxy on top of economic injustice. This provides conservatives an opportunity to offer solutions that reform, rather that propping up, the current failed system. Conservatives can be the champions of economically exploited students and adjunct professors, and of free thought and speech. But we must first understand how social justice activism has become the new religion on campus, and how bloated campus bureaucracy uses it to distract from their parasitism.

Watch Ben Rhodes Squirm When Asked If Obama’s WH Was Involved In FBI Investigation Of Trump,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/watch-ben-rhodes-squirm-when-asked-if-obamas-wh-was-involved-in-fbi-investigation-of-trump/,"April 29, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
Ben Rhodes, former deputy of national security for President Obama, told journalist Nicholas Ballasy that the Obama administration was unaware and uninvolved in the FBI’s investigation into then-candidate Donald Trump.
“Literally, I learned about the investigation into Trump as a private citizen in the freaking Washington Post,” Rhodes said.
When asked about the dossier, Rhodes insisted he had nothing to do with.
“I saw it—I heard about it at the very end in 2017. We weren’t, like, involved in commissioning the dossier. We learned about it when it was in the report that was appended to the report that went to Congress at the end of the administration,” he said.
Watch the full interview here.
While Rhodes maintains the Obama administration’s innocence, unredacted copies of text messages suggest otherwise. Former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page served on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation when their anti-Trump text messages were leaked. “The White House is running this,” one text read.
Between 2016 and 2017, Obama For America (OFA), Obama’s official campaign organization, paid nearly a million dollars to the same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS , the firm behind the Steele dossier.
OFA, which managed Obama’s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president’s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.
Of course, this is not the first time Rhodes has been caught in a lie. Rhodes’ track record for fiction includes the Benghazi talking points characterizing the 9/11 terror attack as a response to a YouTube clip , lying about the U.S. vetting process of Syrian refugees , and the “echo chamber” he created to sell Obama’s failed Iran deal.

A Hatred Of Israel Is The One Thing All Anti-Semites Have In Common,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/its-a-hatred-of-israel-that-unites-all-anti-semites/,"By David Harsanyi April 29, 2019
“The past few days provide a useful case study,” The New York Times’ Bari Weiss wrote this weekend . “Thursday: an anti-Zionist cartoon is published in the Times. Saturday: a white nationalist guns down Jews in synagogue. Sunday: Javad Zarif appears on Fox. The three strands of modern anti-Semitism: far-left, far-right and Islamist.”
Although Weiss correctly identifies the three strands of contemporary Jew-hatred, none of them are truly modern. To various degrees, Islamic anti-Semitism has been prevalent for a long time . Left-wing anti-Semitism is old as Marx (and, really, even older .) And right-wing nationalist anti-Semitism has been with us since the concept was birthed in Europe.
The only truly modern component found in all three strands is Israel. Anti-Israel sentiment is already the predominant justification for violence, murder, and hatred against Jews in the Middle East and Europe. Now it’s coming here. Sometimes it’s merely a transparent excuse for animosity, other times it’s the spark for that hatred. But almost always a part of it.
The Passover shooting at the Poway Chabad synagogue in suburban San Diego was perpetrated by a 19-year-old gunman who seems to have acted alone. The man hadn’t cooked up his ugly ideas reading “Mein Kampf” in a cabin in the deep wilderness of Red America, but in a comfortable home in Southern California using the internet. The shooter wasn’t raised under the shadow of a Robert E. Lee statue or a Confederate flag, but in a substantially diverse area in a deeply liberal state.
As far as we know, he didn’t grow up in poverty, nor had any Jewish person done anything to personally undermine him. In fact, the shooter almost surely interacted with all types of races, ethnicities, and faiths on a daily basis. If reports are correct , the murderer of Lori Gilbert Kaye was from a churchgoing family and good student at Cal State University San Marcos, a university that earns an “A” in diversity.
The shooter’s manifesto makes clear that he didn’t kill because of Donald Trump or some alleged dog whistle or a New York Times cartoon or any concerted ideological cause other than hatred. Although we shouldn’t put too much thought into his vile rantings, the man was clearly a racist who detested Jews and “Zionists” because he saw them as the enemies of white people.
Now, we can “confront” these xenophobic murderers all day long, but they don’t really care about your emotional condemnations or your rallies or your PSAs. It’s unlikely that we can shame them. The shooter’s rhetoric, thankfully, is already unacceptable in mainstream American discourse.
The only anti-Semitism still widely used in public discourse is the kind masquerading as “anti-Zionism.” That is why there was warranted outrage when The New York Times’s international edition publishes a Der Sturmer-style cartoon and when members of Congress protect a woman who has persistently smeared Americans Jews as money-grubbing interlopers and when progressive activists march behind those who embrace the most noxious anti-Semitic notions imaginable.
Now, a Jew-baiting cartoon or an ugly tweet isn’t going to shoot you. But anti-Israel rhetoric doesn’t just hurt feelings, it leads to policy that puts people in danger. It is why, whatever the intentions were behind the Iran deal, many Jews were rightly disturbed when the antagonist Obama administration made a sweetheart agreement and sent pallets of cash to a Holocaust-denying terror state that openly threatens to throw six million Jews into an “inferno.” It’s a bit on-the-nose.
Since Israel is increasingly detested by the American left—often for the very same reasons the United States is detested—progressives have also been increasingly comfortable attacking Jews or defending those who do. And no, these people aren’t merely being “critical of Israel.” The New York Times cartoon depicting Trump as a blind man being led by the Star of David-bedecked Benjamin Netanyahu was a pictorial interpretation of a paranoid grievance that many anti-Israel progressives and paleocons have been peddling for years: that Jews control the U.S. government.
Claiming that Americans are dying to protect Jewish interests isn’t only a lie, it’s a fresh iteration of an old slur. Whereas once there were “bankers” and “money lenders,” today there are “Zionists.” I see this smear every day, and not merely from randos on Twitter.
Some progressives, in fact, argue that the concept of “Zionism” is itself a form of white supremacy . Liberal editors of major publications now contend that the democratically elected prime minister of this Jewish state is one of “global anti-semitism’s greatest allies.” Writers for major magazines breezily blame Jews who support Israel for their own massacres. Among them are a small number of progressives , who defraud the public by falsely using their abandoned Jewish heritage to promote their leftist ideology.
Like many left-wing publications, the Times has obsessively depicted the Jewish state—a nation that is not only the most liberal in the Middle East but perhaps the most liberal nation in all of Asia—as a national manifestation of bigotry. Not Hamas. Not the PLO. Not Iran. Not Qatar. Until recently, not even Saudi Arabia.
When outlets like The New York Times spend decades normalizing the idea that Zionism is tantamount to fascism and apartheid, it is just a matter of time before some hapless editor at the newspaper—if that’s really what happened—has trouble differentiating between the supposedly “anti-Israel” cartoon and demonstrably anti-Jewish one.
This position has driven them not only to embrace a decades-long bias but has opened them up to publishing all strands of ugly propaganda. Just one week before running the cartoon, the Times ran an Easter op-ed identifying Jesus as being “most likely a Palestinian man with dark skin.” Trying to strip a couple thousand years of Jewish (and Christian) history to promote a comforting fantasy for progressives is arguably more anti-Semitic than any dumb cartoon. “Palestine,” of course, was a name given to the land by Romans, who exiled most of the Jews from their homeland more than 600 years before the Arabs showed up.
The frustrating and tragic truth about this weekend’s shooting spree on Passover—a holiday that celebrates the miraculous escape from Egyptian slavery to freedom in Israel—is that there’s little we Jews can do about the presence of random far-right murderers other than continue to marginalize their ideas and defend ourselves. And nothing seems to aggravate all three varieties of anti-Semites more than the idea of Jews protecting themselves after 1,800 years of being at their mercy. The collective anger over Israel is proof. "
Protest Erupts Outside New York Times Offices Over Anti-Semitic Cartoon,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/29/protest-erupts-outside-the-new-york-times-offices-over-anti-semitic-cartoon/,"April 29, 2019 By David Marcus
Last week, in its international edition, The New York Times ran a blatantly anti-Semitic political cartoon that depicted a blind President Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was depicted as a dog wearing a collar with a star of David. This was not trading in tropes. This was old-school, nauseating bigotry that would not be out of place on neo-Nazi websites or the deepest, darkest corners of Reddit.
The Times has apologized (disclosure, I have written for the Times) but for many New Yorkers that just wasn’t good enough. Monday evening, they staged a protest outside the lavish offices of the Gray Lady and demanded the firing of those involved with publishing the offensive cartoon.
At a time when anti-Semitism is growing around the world, synagogues in the United States are the subject of terrorist shootings, and Jews in New York are being violently attacked at an alarming rate, the response from the Times to its outrageous decision to run the cartoon is underwhelming and unacceptable.
According to Hillary Barr, one of the organizers of the protest, who works with Mothers Against Terrorism, “whoever was involved with the decision to publish this cartoon must be fired immediately.” She went on to say that “if it were any other race or religion it would never have been published.”
Robert Rogoff, wearing Trump 2020 garb, went even further. He and his wife are planning to move this year to Israel, and for Rogoff, this cartoon was evidence that America is becoming increasingly hostile to Jews. Rogoff told me that “The Democratic Party makes us feel unwelcome as Jews.” He fears that if Trump loses the 2020 election, this situation will become even worse.
The first speaker, Jeffrey Weisenfeld, asked a fair question: “Would the New York Times run a caricature of any other race of people?” The answer is, almost certainly, no. So why did the paper feel comfortable portraying Jews as literal dogs? The speaker said this harkened back to the bigoted media representations of Jews in pre-Nazi Germany. He called for an independent investigation, arguing that the Times could not be trusted to police itself on this issue.
Former New York Assemblyman Dove Hikind rallied the crowd with the chant, “Shame on the New York Times.” He recalled the ways the paper denied the Holocaust as it was happening. He said that from 1939 to 1945, the Times ran 23,000 headlines. Of them, only 26 stories were about the Holocaust. This is not a fantastic record for a paper of record. Hikind said that he is a Democrat, but a very embarrassed one.
During Hikind’s remarks, the crowd began shouting, “Where is Schumer?” Well, the Senate minority leader, a Democrat from New York, wasn’t there today. What his reaction is to this controversy is not entirely clear. Schumer has had no press conference regarding the incident and might fairly be said to be hiding. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler also came under attack for his lack of outrage over the cartoon.
The next speaker was professor Alan Dershowitz, who described himself as a formerly strong supporter of The New York Times who does not understand how this could have happened: “The New York Times has been wrong so often when it comes to Israel and when it comes to the Jewish people.” He suggested that because The New York Times is owned by Jews, they bend over backwards to not be seen as pro-Jewish.
Dershowitz particularly called out the Times for editorializing in its reporting, calling their “news analysis” pieces little more than opinion posing as news. He’s absolutely right.
Ultimately, the biggest question is: How did open and offensive anti-Semitism become something that professional journalists are unable to recognize? Have Jews so completely become white people in the eyes of progressives that they may now be treated, like white people, as a problem in society that has to be fought? If so — and it increasingly seems to be so — can’t that be achieved without literally depicting Jews as dogs?
The New York Times has much to be ashamed about here, and their response has been extremely weak. The good news is that American Jews have taken notice and are prepared to respond.

How Electronic Health Records Became An Absolute Fiasco,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/electronic-health-records-became-absolute-fiasco/,"By Christopher Jacobs April 30, 2019
Recent surveys of doctors show a sharp rise in frustrated physicians. One study last year analyzed a nearly 10 percentage point increase in burnout from 2011 to 2014, and laid much of the blame for the increase on a single culprit: Electronic health records. Physicians now spend more time staring at computer screens than connecting with patients, and find the drudgery soul-crushing.
What prompted the rise in screen fatigue and physician burnout? Why, government, of course. A recent Fortune magazine expose , titled “Death by 1,000 Clicks,” analyzed the history behind federal involvement in electronic records. The article reveals how electronic health records not only have not met their promise, but have led to numerous unintended and harmful consequences for American’s physicians, and the whole health care market. Electronic Bridge to Nowhere
The Fortune story details all the ways health information technology doesn’t work: Error-prone and glitch-laden systems; Impromptu work-arounds created by individual physicians and hospitals make it tough to compare systems to each other; An inability for one hospital’s system to interact with another’s—let alone deliver data and records directly to patients; and A morass of information, presented in a non-user-friendly format, that users cannot easily access—potentially increasing errors.
The data behind the EHR debacle illustrate the problem vividly. Physicians spend nearly six hours per day on EHRs, compared to just over five hours of direct time with patients. A study concluding that emergency room physicians average 4,000 mouse clicks per shift, a number that virtually guarantees doctors will make data errors. Thousands of documented medication errors caused by EHRs, and at least one hundred deaths (likely more) from “alert fatigue” caused by electronic systems’ constant warnings.
Other anecdotes prove almost absurdly hysterical. The EHR that presents emergency room physicians 86 separate options to order Tylenol. The parody Twitter account that plays an EHR come to life: “I once saw a doctor make eye contact with a patient. This horror must stop.” The EHR system that warns physicians ordering painkillers for female patients about the dangers of prescribing ibuprofen to women while pregnant—even if the patient is 80 years old.
What caused all this chaos in the American health care market? One doctor explained his theory: “I have an iPhone and a computer and they work the way they’re supposed to work, and then we’re given these incredibly cumbersome and error-prone tools. This is something the government mandated ” (emphasis added). Therein lies the problem. Obama’s ‘Stimulus’ Spending Spree
In June 2011, when talking about infrastructure projects included in the 2009 “stimulus” legislation, President Obama famously admitted that “shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.” Electronic health records, another concept included in the “stimulus,” ran into a very similar problem. Farzad Mostashari, who worked on health IT for the Obama administration from 2009-11, admitted to Fortune that creating a useful national records system was “utterly infeasible to get to in a short time frame.”
At the time, however, the Obama administration billeted electronic health records as the “magic bullet” that would practically eliminate medical errors, while also reducing health costs. Every government agency had its own “wish list” of things to include in EHR systems. Mostashari admitted this dynamic led to the typical bureaucratic problem of trying to do too much, too fast: “We had all the right ideas that were discussed and hashed out by the committee, but they were all of the right ideas” (emphasis original).
Meanwhile, records vendors saw dollar signs, and leapt at the business opportunity. As Fortune notes, many systems weren’t ready for prime time, but vendors didn’t focus on solving those types of inconsequential details:
[The] vendor community, then a scrappy $2 billion industry, griped at the litany of requirements but stood to gain so much from the government’s $36 billion injection that it jumped in line. As Rusty Frantz, CEO of EHR vendor NextGen Healthcare, put it: ‘The industry was like, ‘I’ve got this check dangling in front of me, and I have to check these boxes to get there, and so I’m going to do that.’’
The end result: Hospitals and doctors spent billions of dollars—because the government paid them to do so, and threatened to reduce their Medicare and Medicaid payments if they didn’t—to buy records systems that didn’t work well. These providers then became stuck with the systems once they purchased them, because of the systems’ cost, and because providers could not easily switch from one system to another.
David Blumenthal, who served as national coordinator for health IT under Obama, summed up the debacle accurately when he admitted that electronic health records “have not fulfilled their potential. I think few would argue they have.”
Electronic health records therefore provide an illustrative cautionary tale in which a government-imposed scheme spends billions of dollars but fails to live up to its hype, and alienates physicians and providers in the process. When the same thing happens under Democrats’ next proposed big-government health scheme—whether single payer, or some “moderate compromise” that only takes away half of Americans’ existing health coverage—don’t say you weren’t warned.

"In Michigan, Obergefell's Next Domino Hits Christian Adoption Agencies",thefederalist.com,Auguste Meyrat,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/michigan-obergefells-next-domino-hits-christian-adoption-agencies/,"By Auguste Meyrat April 30, 2019
Sued by the American Civil Liberties Union and two homosexual couples for deciding not to place orphans with same-sex couples, Bethany Christian Services was forced to change its policy in a settlement . No longer will they refer these couples to other non-religious organizations, but they must comply with the state’s rules since they are under contract.
Like Michigan’s attorney general, a lesbian and former gay issues activist , most people will celebrate this as real progress. In their mind, Christian charities are only using their religion as a cover for bigotry . If they can compel these organizations to eliminate this supposed hate and continue offering social work, it’s a win-win: LGBT people and the state government are vindicated, and the charity will continue serving children instead of shutting down, as they did in Philadelphia when the city banned Catholic adoption agencies for declining to place children with gay and unmarried couples.
Those who see matters from the Christian perspective will rightly lament this development. Not only does it mark a major setback for religious freedom, but it further enables anti-Christian groups to go after other Christian charities.
Following the logic of the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges , they can claim that Christian sexual morality discriminates against LGBT couples, and any person, organization, or business who abides by this morality is violating the law of the land. If religious freedom exemptions exist, the government can still cancel their contracts and virtually ban Christian charities from working in local communities. A Sorry Loss of Assistance for the Most Vulnerable
Facing this hostility and loss of freedom, many Christian charities will stop providing services, leaving many people without assistance and reinforcing an American legal system that makes abortion far easier and cheaper than adoption . LGBT activists evidently see themselves as the real victims in this case, not the abused and neglected children in need of a home.
By forcing all charities to conform to their values, they bring about more harm than reform. One can only wonder how much more good could be done if these groups devoted their time, energy, and resources to offering services to those in need instead of trying to destroy religious organizations in court.
Those who don’t understand Christianity—which includes far too many on the left—like to maintain that Christians can just change their stance on sexuality without any problems. They think it’s only a matter of eliminating an irrational prejudice against a certain group of people. If Christianity is all about love, and gay people love one another, can Christians really argue against gay couples adopting children? Times have changed, and so should morality. This seems like an easy enough change to make.
Except that it isn’t. Christ makes it crystal clear that marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman , not a term for people who really love each other and seek legal recognition. Furthermore, God the Father makes it crystal clear that homosexual activity is a sin . What is also crystal clear is that God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—commands people to love sinners and those in need (in other words, everyone) and not to foster any kind of hate. Hence the preponderance of Christians in charitable projects. Which Teachings of Christ Can We Ignore? None of Them
When anyone asks Christians to tweak their theology to be more inclusive and ignore certain teachings, they are really asking them to change their whole faith. If God the Father or God the Son were wrong about marriage or homosexuality, what else are they wrong about?
If charity only means “being inclusive” instead of seeking the good of others, then maybe doing nothing and posting rainbow flags on social media is the most charitable thing a person can do. And if seeking the good is still important, is it really that good to give a child to a couple potentially unfit for parenthood? If loving one’s neighbors equates to letting them do whatever they want and refusing to judge, why does the Bible include so many judgments and rules?
If gay couples are essentially the same as straight couples in their relationship and capacity to care for children, why does God, who created the universe, not allow people of the same sex to create children naturally? Finally, is it wise to encourage Christians to define themselves by their sexuality rather than their relationship with God?
With so many issues raised by defining love and marriage differently, any Christian organization that compromises on this question necessarily forfeits its Christian identity. Bethany Christian Services now serves Michigan; it does not serve Christ. It has transformed from a Christian charity into another social service subsidized by the state and a dwindling pool of private donors.
Over time, Bethany Christian Services will go the way of other charities subverted by government and progressive activists—it will lose support among actual Christians, become thoroughly secularized, and end up perpetuating the problems it was originally designed to combat. Saturated with secular values, it will promote the behaviors and attitudes that lead to unparented children and abusive adults and discourage the virtues that empower family life.
Since it already compromised itself once, it will continue to do so, favoring fundraising and a public image over actually helping victims. Meanwhile, it will become less effective and more corrupt. This is how so many Catholic charities today end up distributing contraceptives , facilitating abortions , lobbying for open borders , endorsing anti-Christian ideologies like socialism , laundering money , and of course, embezzling countless millions of dollars .
These charities, thankfully, represent a minority among the many good charities that hold fast to Christian doctrine, but they harm Catholic culture as a whole. While there are many priests (and bishops) ready to denounce intolerance, lacking compassion, stressing over orthodoxy, or being miserly and uncharitable, there are very few priests (and almost no bishops) willing to preach against abortion, divorce, addiction, or respecting the laws and customs of a country. In all too many cases, they are accomplices or enablers of these sins.
One might attribute these scandals to the Catholic Church’s large charitable reach. Being by far the largest charitable organization in the world for so many centuries, mixing with bad actors is unavoidable. Nevertheless, many of these problems stem directly from the church’s collaboration with the government. As soon as the government becomes a customer, it will always impose its values on the provider, no matter what rights the Constitution guarantees.
Occasionally, Catholic organizations will push back—again, imagine what the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Obama administration could have done with the millions wasted in litigation—but many of them swallow the poison pill of government funding and hope no one finds out. A Certain Fate from Compromise
The consequence of a Christian charity changing its policies to match government-endorsed anti-religious views is not the possible outcome of a slippery slope; the decline is certain. When an organization compromises its values, it initiates a vicious sequence: without clear values or principles, the purpose becomes confused; a confused purpose then puts into question the identity of the organization; without an identity, the organization’s mission becomes incoherent and often counterproductive; and when this happens, those people who benefited from the organization are either neglected or actively harmed. This has been the fate of all too many liberal Christian churches that have adopted modern values prioritizing “inclusivity” and permissiveness over discipline and sacrifice.
The only way to prevent this sequence is for government and individuals to respect people’s beliefs and values in the first place. If someone wants to spread his values—Christian or not—through charity, he should do so by competing, not compelling. If the LGBT community wants to help gay couples adopt, they can start their own adoption agencies. If militant atheists want to indoctrinate kids with secular humanist values and hire liberal activists for teachers, they can build their own schools. If technocratic plutocrats want to provide contraceptives and iPads instead of food and medicine to starving families in the third world, they can do so without taxpayer or church assistance.
If any of these groups discriminate against Christians because serving them conflicts with their values or mission, they should be free to do so. And they should count on Christians to respond with their own charitable activity, and a limited, tolerant government to do nothing except uphold the law.
Not only would this reflect true social justice for all parties involved, but it would also lead to a healthy renewal of philanthropy in society and direct people’s efforts towards helping people in need. Charity starts with values, and safeguarding those values is the only way to safeguard charity. Auguste Meyrat is an English teacher in the Dallas area.

If there’s anything you don’t expect to see in the subject line of an email on Easter Sunday, it’s RIP. But Easter is when unexpected things happen. On this holiest day of days in 2019, Aaron D. Wolf sang with his family in the morning and the choir invisible in the evening.
Aaron was the executive editor of Chronicles magazine, published by the Charlemagne Institute . He was a man of insight, wit, kindness, humility, and integrity. He was 45 years old. Seeing his name attached to an RIP feels like watching the dwarfs shoot down the horses .
If you’re not familiar with Aaron’s writing, good things are in store for you. He is difficult to excerpt. Aaron did not boink doctrinaire slogans together like pop beads, knocking out bargain souvenirs for the day’s crisis. He was a rhetorician, weaving knowledge into wisdom on a loom of virtue. His essays on a screen resemble Beef Bourguignon on a paper plate. Alas, here we are.

When the ‘neo-evangelical’ movement began in the middle of the 20th century, and evangelical Americans set out to distinguish themselves from fundamentalists, their chief goal was to ‘engage the culture.’ One way of doing this was to imitate popular entertainment, and this resulted in the creation of ‘contemporary Christian music’ and many embarrassing films.
Mel Gibson’s The Passion of the Christ took this to a new level. Mel was cool and one of us—except for his staunch, almost fanatical Roman Catholicism, but this is about getting the Gospel out there, and we can overlook the nonbiblical portions of the script supplied by Anne Catherine Emmerich. (Some church groups at least wondered whether it was acceptable to eat popcorn while watching “Jesus” being crucified.) I remember the looks of shock I received when I suggested that a(nother) ‘Jesus movie’ will not save America, because film is a medium of entertainment, not particularly suitable for preaching the Gospel.
‘Nonsense!’ was the usual reply. ‘If just one person believes in Christ because of something he saw in this movie, it will be worth it!’ In that spirit, churches all over the country rented theaters, brought people by the busload, and produced mountains of Passion of the Christ promotional and study materials. And the product was deeply satisfying for the vast majority of those who purchased it: Of course, it was the most powerful movie ever made! Now I really know what Jesus did for me!
And what did this Technicolor Jesus do for you? For evangelicals, he provided all of us with an opportunity to ask him into our hearts. For Mel Gibson (according to the juxtapositions during the crucifixion scene), he provided the Mass. For Sean Hannity, he provided an example of what happens when you tell the truth to liberals. In short, this special-effects blood-and-gore pretend Jesus was whatever you wanted him to be. ‘Democracy and Infanticide’ (2019)

A base as massive as ours will always tend toward baseness—unless it has a profound religious sensibility to keep it in check. And Christianity, being the one true Faith, cannot be replaced by a mere civic religion, neopaganism, nationalism, racialism (white or nonwhite), or citizenism; God is not mocked. Yet Christianity does not know how to operate apart from those mediating institutions which it instinctively creates and inspires: The Church must create culture, for She seeks to cultivate saints.
Conversely, the death of America’s mediating institutions—of family, school, university, neighborhood, community, local government, arts and letters—is the direct result of the Church’s failure to uphold the natural order, to cultivate virtue, to create culture. Cultural Marxists cannot march through Christian institutions.
Today, ‘conservative’ Church leaders seek shelter under the wings of liberal democracy, repeating the bromides of the Enlightenment, touting abstract ‘religious freedom’ as if it were written by the finger of God on tablets of stone. Instead of saying ‘Thus saith the Lord,’ they apologize for the Church’s failure to defend human rights. They speak not as prophets but as Jacobins. ‘I Heart Big Brother’ (2015)

The real question—for the adulterers of Ashley Madison, and for the rest of us as well—is, would we make the same stupid choice again?

What if, instead of going to a library or purchasing a map at a gas station, you could simply look up information where you sit? What if you could turn in your homework with the touch of a button, instead of having to print it out or write on paper? Pay your bills! See pictures of old friends and even people you’ve never met! Vote! Play video games! Refill your meds! You’ll never have to get out of your chair again!

Link here .
‘Adopt a refugee,’ the church bulletin urges. This Protestant church is encouraging each of its members to donate money, clothing, and personal items to the ethnic Albanian of his choice. On a marquee in front of an ornate Catholic church outside O’Hare Airport are the words, ‘Father, protect the refugees, in Jesus’ name. Amen.’ An ad in the Rockford Register Star announces an evangelical rock band’s ‘Concert for the Kosovar Refugees.’ And church leaders—from local priests and pastors to heads of synods, traveling speakers, and televangelists—seem to agree with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair that Slobodan Milosevic is the latest incarnation of Hitler. American Christians, it seems, are ‘sending a message”‘ of their own to the people of Serbia.
It is a message not readily understood by Serbian Orthodox immigrants to America. ‘Don’t they know the KLA is an Islamic terrorist group?’ they ask. ‘Don’t they realize that the Serbs are their Christian brothers and sisters?’…
American believers who back NATO are not self-consciously ‘social-gospel’ liberals. Many are members of the Christian right. Indefatigable in their opposition to abortion and homosexuality, they continue to press for federally—now imperialistically—imposed morality, abstracted from any historical context, and derived largely from popular sentiment.
‘Adopt a refugee’ campaigns in churches across America are not about loving one’s enemy. They are a cathartic response to 24-hour-a-day CNN broadcasts of people huddled in tents in Albania and Macedonia. They carry with them the sentiments of Mather’s Magnalia Christi Americana, molded by two centuries of American evangelicalism. Articles reminding us that ethnic Albanians are responsible for the heroin trade in Europe and for teenage prostitution in Italy and have engaged in terrorist acts against the Serbian police simply cannot trump the sentiments that arise when evangelicals view footage of crying children.
We do not see footage of dead Serbian children or their crying mothers, and so the Serbs become a mere afterthought—collateral damage, a necessary evil, like the ravaging of Atlanta and Columbia in the mid-1860s. Nonetheless, the fact remains that 10,000 hours of Christiane Amanpour and Geraldo Rivera could not diminish the resolve nor confuse the loyalties of a people with an identity established not by cause or sentiment, but by the Nicene Creed. Save for a small remnant, that type of American Christian has long since perished from the earth. ‘Home Church’ (2008)

Daniel, as you may recall, was a eunuch—he was made ‘prince of the eunuchs,’ in fact, against his will. Most American Christian men, on the other hand, are neither slaves nor eunuchs—or at least they weren’t before the vasectomy. Like most men throughout time, they have families. Stretching back as far as the patriarch Job (before Moses and perhaps before Abraham), a man was priest of his household. The addition of the Tabernacle some years later, then the Temple, then the synagogue, and their transformation and fulfillment in Christ and His Church, did not mitigate the responsibility of the father. …
There is much to deplore in today’s churches—pap-filled psychobabble sermons, excruciating pop music, the silliness of dramas and dances—but the fact remains: Home is not church. We can set aside (for the briefest of moments) what this or that denomination may teach about ordination and the sacraments. There is no way to read the history of the early Church or the Pastoral Epistles and conclude that, when things go badly at church, you can start your own at home. What to do, then? …
American men prefer a quick and one-sided fix. Bariatric surgery beats diet and daily exercise. Voting will save babies. Eunuchs can better afford to send their kids to college. And yet the days and the seasons and the years continue to pass, the churches become increasingly decadent and irrelevant, and the kids’ mouths get smarter. What does this mean?
It means we have to go home. It means that we have to gather around the table. And it means that Dad must take up the mantle of Job as household priest. This might mean taking some things off our plates. At least here, in the Age of Antichrist, we’re still free to do that. ‘Manifest(o)’ (2019)

Buoyed by their anonymous online friends whose imaginations have been deformed by vile ‘ironic’ memes that make light of evil and depict Muslims as subhuman, a few [young men of the Alt-Right] will commit heinous crimes ‘IRL,’ purportedly in ‘defense’ of the West. What do I have to lose? they reason. Or in the words of [New Zealand mass shooter Brenton] Tarrant, ‘WHY DON’T I DO SOMETHING?’
That the ‘Caucasoid’ peoples are succumbing, one after another, to their own ‘replacement’ is a direct result not of genocide, nor even of suicide, but of apostasy. The will to endure hardship in the service of duty, to marry and rear children, to build cultural institutions that will outlast you, to resist falsely conceived characterizations of ‘hate’—Islamophobia included—comes not from racial consciousness but from a simple confidence in the divinely ordained goodness and inviolability of family, kin, the inherited civil order, and the unique cultural institutions by which we pass on this confidence to our children. To attribute these good gifts, even partly, to our own racial merit is as wicked as it is to deny that they are good gifts to begin with. God is not mocked.
Tolerance is not a virtue, and its enforcement predictably leads to resentment and inhumane cruelty. On the other hand, to be magnanimous means literally to have a large soul, one big enough to pursue the highest good in humility and in recognition of one’s estate in the Divine Order.

Why Is Ilhan Omar’s Collusion With Islamists Acceptable?,thefederalist.com,Ben Weingarten,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/ilhan-omars-collusion-islamists-acceptable/,"By Ben Weingarten April 30, 2019
Freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) has distinguished herself with often offensive, outrageous, and unpatriotic rhetoric. One week she invokes classic anti-Jewish tropes. The next she trivializes the September 11 jihadist attacks. Another it is unearthed that she espouses morally relativistic if not overtly anti-American views about U.S. soldiers , the very ones who fought to defend civilians in her native Somalia to boot.
Omar’s penchant for provoking millions of Americans with odious words has masked the related, equally if not more troubling, elements of her associations, ideology, and background. Consider Omar’s Meeting with Turkey’s President
Consider, for example, the revelation, largely unnoticed outside of conservative media, that as a Minnesota Assemblywoman Omar had a closed-press meeting in fall 2017 with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. According to a curiously now-deleted article from the local Somalian-language periodical in her district, the Tusmo Times , she and the Islamist authoritarian president met during his U.N. General Assembly visit to New York.
Per one account, they discussed : “issues involving Omar’s native Somalia and issues for Somalis in Minnesota. She [Omar] thanked Erdogan for Turkey’s support for the Rohingya people in Myanmar. The two also discussed investment and trade between Turkey and Somalia. The meeting ended with Erdogan asking Omar to voice her support for Turkey. The report concludes by adding that Omar not only met with Erdogan, but also with the Turkish prime minister and other senior Turkish officials.”
A political-media establishment frenzied over foreign influence might ask many questions about this meeting, such as: Why did a state lawmaker have it? Was it appropriate for her to be discussing Turkish-Somali relations as an American representative? On whose behalf was she speaking? Did anyone bless this meeting at the federal level, and on what grounds? Did Omar have any reservations about meeting with President Erdogan given the totalitarian , bellicose , and bigoted nature of his regime? What do Omar’s Democratic colleagues at the national level make of this meeting?
This last question would likely elicit some interesting answers, given what prominent Democrats have said about President Erdogan. Take Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, a critic of Erdogan and his repression of journalists. In April 2017, several months before the Omar-Erdogan meeting, a Turkish prosecutor announced he was investigating Schumer , among other Americans, for fomenting the supposed coup Erdogan crushed in 2016. Would Schumer have endorsed a meeting with a regime engaged in such an outlandish probe?
In May 2017, Schumer’s Senate colleague Ed Markey (D-MA) proffered a resolution “condemning the violence against peaceful protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence…and calling for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.” According to the resolution, Turkish officials had beaten, kicked, and choked unarmed protesters outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence in Washington, D.C., injuring at least 11 people.
In the House, chief collusion arbiter Adam Schiff (D-CA) issued a related statement in which he challenged the Erdogan regime, asserting: “Erdogan cannot export the violent repression he visits on his own citizens to our streets. The violence of May 16 can’t go unanswered or forgotten…I stand here today to affirm that we will not allow Turkey to beat innocent protesters on the streets of our Nation’s capital. We will continue to pursue justice and to make clear that America will always stand up for the right of peaceful and free expression.” See No Democratic Evil, Hear No Democratic Evil
Yet there’s no word from Markey or Schiff regarding the revelations about Omar’s meeting with Erdogan.
Nor has there been any comment from the man who oversees the most prominent committee on which Omar sits, House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY). In July 2018, Engel questioned “whether Turkey’s autocratic ruler, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is truly committed to his country’s relationship with the United States,” citing the Turkish regime’s holding of American pastor Andrew Brunson under house arrest, crackdown following the supposed coup, contemplated purchase of a Russian air defense system, and other offending acts.
Last but not least, there was nary a peep about Logan Act violations from Obama administration officials.
Democrats would likely contend that U.S. leaders routinely meet with President Erdogan. Turkey is ostensibly a North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally, albeit increasingly in name only . But a state assemblywoman is not a head of state or diplomat. Nor did Omar have any business speaking as a representative of the U.S. government, which was her de facto position in discussing international relations—and perhaps most strangely, international relations independent of the United States’. Worse Ties to Terrorist Front Groups
Perhaps the more troubling tie that binds President Erdogan and Omar is their shared affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood—the tip of the Sunni jihadist spear . Erdogan has publicly defended the Muslim Brotherhood , and vice versa , as he and the group share a common Sunni Islamic supremacist ideology. Erdogan’s Turkey has also been an ardent supporter of Hamas , one of the Muslim Brotherhood’s most notorious jihadist offshoots.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has effectively served as the public relations arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States, in part through its support of Hamas. CAIR’s coordination with Hamas was revealed when it was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest jihad financing case in U.S. history, the Holy Land Foundation trial , in which several individuals were prosecuted for a scheme that resulted in millions of dollars flowing to Hamas.
The longstanding links between the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, and CAIR have been detailed in proposed legislation that would designate the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization. The unpassed law notes:
Shortly after HAMAS was founded in 1987, as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood, the International Muslim Brotherhood ordered the Muslim Brotherhood chapters throughout the world to create Palestine Committees, who supported HAMAS with ‘media, money and men’. The U.S.-Muslim Brotherhood created the United States Palestine Committee, which documents reflect was initially comprised of 3 organizations: the Holy Land Foundation, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the United Association for Studies and Research. CAIR was later added to these organizations. The mandate of these organizations, per the International Muslim Brotherhood, was to support HAMAS, and the HLF’s [Holy Land Foundation] particular role was to raise money to support HAMAS’ organizations inside the Palestinian territories.
Following the Holy Land Foundation case, the FBI swore off contact with CAIR. On account of its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, the United Arab Emirates classified CAIR as a terrorist organization in 2014.
President Erdogan has met with senior members of CAIR on multiple occasions . Omar seems to share Erdogan’s affinity for the group. Her recent offending comments regarding the attacks of September 11, 2001 were made in front of CAIR’s Los Angeles chapter. Omar was previously an Advisory Board member for CAIR’s Minnesota branch . She has also received several thousand dollars’ worth of political contributions from CAIR’s California political action committee , as well as CAIR personnel in the 2018 fundraising cycle.
The congresswoman has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood in other ways, as illustrated multiple times in recent weeks. In February 2019, Omar headlined an event hosted by Islamic Relief USA , whose chairman has been identified as one of the most prominent representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States. Earlier this month, Omar publicly lobbied the Trump administration, via her Twitter account, to press for the release of an imprisoned leader of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood’s female affiliate. Using Her Position to Benefit Terrorists’ Interests
Consistent with Islamic supremacist groups like CAIR , Omar has taken—to put it charitably—a soft line on terrorists. In a 2016 letter to a judge in which Omar pled for leniency for nine Minnesota men charged with planning to join the Islamic State, the congresswoman went so far as to claim that in effect the United States is to blame for creating jihadists. She proffered the perverse argument, favored by sophistic Islamists and their apologists, that jihad represents blowback for perceived Western sins, including those of materialism and disenfranchisement. It must be read to be believed.
In the past, Omar has exhibited a flippant attitude towards jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and Hezbollah, seeming to mock those Americans concerned with the groups’ violence and barbarism.
Then there’s Omar’s support of issues and positions shared by many of her Islamist supporters , including: the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement; the thinly veiled anti-Semitic propaganda Omar parrots regarding Israel; her outright bigotry towards Jews, consistent with the pervasive anti-Semitism of her Islamist supporters; and, perhaps most chillingly, Omar and her allies’ attempts to stifle any criticism of her rhetoric, by casting herself as the victim of Islamophobic “hate speech” that incites violence. This paradigm, incidentally, has been applied to great effect in Europe by Islamists who seek to shut up their critics.
There is a clear nexus between Omar’s associations, words, and actions: She consorts—one might say colludes—with Islamists, parrots their propaganda, and has advocated for their positions as a member of Congress. The Odd Behavior Doesn’t End There
On top of these issues, consider two more troubling stories the media has been completely loathe to cover, save for a few intrepid conservative journalists, led by PJ Media’s David Steinberg: (i) Omar’s oddly substantial role in the 2016 presidential elections of the highly corrupt Somalian government, in which her support for the winning candidate was followed by an appointment of her brother-in-law to a senior position on the victor’s staff; and (ii) Omar’s seemingly pervasive web of fraudulent, felonious activity centering on the bizarre but substantiated claim that she married her brother.
Set aside the backdrop of the last two years of hysteria over foreign collusion. If Omar were to fill out standard paperwork for a national security position , which she certainly holds, the red flags raised by information in the public domain alone in terms of the congresswoman’s Islamist ties, links to a corrupt foreign government with which she may have engaged in a quid pro quo and potentially compromising criminality would inundate investigators.
These are material issues affecting American national security, especially given Omar’s seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. While her anti-Semitic bigotry ought to be condemned at every turn, we must also acknowledge the plethora of other problems surrounding her. And we should ask ourselves a related question: Why is the political-media establishment, which claims to care about foreign influence, mum? Maybe Collusion Is Okay If You’re a Democrat
Is it that Omar is colluding with the right kind of people? This seems plausible. After all, in spite of Turkey leading the world in journalists jailed over the last three years, President Erdogan gets to pen editorials in the Washington Post. That same newspaper of course provided a platform for the similarly Muslim Brotherhood-supporting, virulently anti-Zionist, and anti-Semitic Jamal Khashoggi . She can offend millions of Americans with her words, and the left will absolve her.
The Post is a good proxy for where the political-media establishment stands on political Islam, which is where the Obama administration stood: It is generally sympathetic , especially vis-à-vis challenging nominally anti-Islamist authoritarian regimes, especially those who stand against the Iranian regime. In a climate in which leading Democratic candidates believe convicted jihadists should retain the right to vote, certainly Omar’s associations and inclinations would seem to be acceptable.
Or perhaps it is not so much an issue of whom Omar is colluding with, but who Omar is, namely an avatar for the intersectionalist, America-loathing, progressive-Islamic supremacist set. Omar appears to be protected by an identity politics veil. As such, she can offend millions of Americans with her words, and the left will absolve her from blame by refusing to censure her by name, then diluting even general charges against her by condemning any and all offensive rhetoric.
In a post-Kavanaugh era in which it is clear that winning trumps all else for the left, if Omar can be used as a cudgel against Republicans, that is probably reason enough to ignore the serious concerns about her. Omar’s danger is not just in her bigotry, but in the company she keeps, and the ideology it is clear she has been bathed in and continues to espouse—all of which serve to the detriment of American national interest.
The truth is that if Omar were held up to a standard of scrutiny even remotely approximating that to which the president has been subjected, she would not just be thrown off the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but forced by her party to resign and never step foot in Washington D.C. again. That it will not happen is a travesty. Ben Weingarten is a senior contributor at The Federalist and senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.

DePaul Students Demand Professor's Censure For Supporting Israel,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/depaul-students-demand-professors-censure-as-racist-for-supporting-israel-in-the-federalist/,"— DePaul Democrats (@DePaulDems) April 24, 2019
“We weren’t calling for DePaul to fire him, we just wanted them to say that this was unacceptable,” student Hadyia Afzal told the campus newspaper , which labeled The Federalist a “right-wing” publication. “The administration hasn’t really learned how to take students seriously when it comes to these debates, which is disappointing.”
“I don’t feel safe as a Muslim student knowing that someone like this is on our campus,” Afzal said. “It’s ridiculous that my tuition is going to the salary of an Islamophobe, of a transphobe, of a very sexist man.”
Hill, a philosophy professor at DePaul, is gay and a naturalized immigrant to the United States from Jamaica. In the Federalist article, he wrote:
the [Palestinian Authority] has destroyed the freedom Palestinians enjoyed under Israeli rule and their economy through kleptocracy, corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian forms of governance subject to none of the checks and balances that characterize Israel’s Knesset. …
Not all cultures are indeed equal. Some are abysmally inferior and regressive based on their comprehensive philosophy and fundamental principles—or lack thereof—that guide or fail to protect the inalienable rights of their citizens.
Given the voting patterns of Palestinians—towards Islamicism and terrorist organizations for the most part—that openly advocate and work for Israeli and Jewish destruction and annihilation, a strong argument can and ought to be made to strip Palestinians of their right to vote—period. The regional hostilities towards Israel in the Middle East are such that Israel must take those threats seriously.

He has been called a purveyor of “hate speech” and “genocide” while explicitly in the article opposing genocide, affirming universal human rights, and endorsing the humanity of Palestinians and Islamists while forcefully rejecting their majority support for terrorism and genocide.

TED Talker Promotes Letting Doctors Mutilate Minors WO Parent Consent,thefederalist.com,Jane Robbins,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/ted-talker-promotes-laws-let-doctors-mutilate-minors-without-parent-consent/,"By Jane Robbins April 30, 2019
In the competition for the most hard-left doctor treating children who are confused about their sex (“transgender” kids), Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles has maintained a strong lead. Olson-Kennedy promotes medicalizing sex-confused children with puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery.
How radical is she? Radical enough to airily reject the idea that all such children should at least receive psychological counseling ( “I don’t send someone to a therapist when I’m going to start them on insulin”) and to minimize the seriousness of removing healthy but currently unwanted organs ( “if you want breasts at a later point in life, you can go and get them”). Olson-Kennedy is now using federal research dollars to administer sterility-inducing cross-sex hormones to children as young as eight years old to see what happens.
It doesn’t get more politicized at kids’ expense than that. Or does it?
Stanford pediatric endocrinologist Tandy Aye is determined to try. While Olson-Kennedy is injecting powerful hormones into physically healthy children, Aye isn’t satisfied with merely medical interventions. She wants to allow (and encourage) surgeons to perform mutilating surgery on children (“older adolescents,” she says) who are under 18 and therefore currently unable to agree to such permanent and life-altering procedures.
Aye’s recent TED talk on this issue is illuminating in several ways. One is her slavish adherence to the new grammatical mandates of the transgender orthodoxy. She consistently refers with female pronouns to a boy who identifies as a girl.
His parents realize they have “a daughter with a penis” (1:10). He was “assigned” a sex at birth (3:30). His treatment isn’t gender “reassignment” therapy but gender “affirmation” therapy (1:40). Similarly, surgery to remove healthy organs is gender-affirming surgery, or GAS. She smoothly strings together these misleading terms as though they are inarguably correct, thus suggesting that people should ignore the jarring dissonance between what they’re hearing and what they know to be true.
Aye also acknowledges but dismisses the obvious reason that states have set 18 as the age of consent: that minors are too immature to make life-altering medical decisions. Not to worry, Aye says, because all transgender minors know exactly what they’re doing: “The transgender patient may be one of the most well-informed patients. Who else has had years of psychological evaluation, months of medical therapy, and has thought of this one procedure for so long?” (7:00).
Perhaps Aye should have a chat with Olson-Kennedy, whose patients may very well have avoided “years of”—or any—psychological evaluation. Perhaps she should read the stories of frantic parents who helplessly watched their children get herded into medical treatment with little or no exploration of what might underlie that fixation on “this one procedure.”
The most noteworthy aspect of Aye’s discussion is her concession that the doctors who administer Gender Affirming Therapy (GAT) are sterilizing these children. The GAT crowd tends to shy away from this admission, preferring not to dwell on the fact they may be ruining lives.
Minor children clearly cannot grasp the full extent of problems caused by infertility. Adults who struggle with this condition suffer significant psychological distress, with affected women experiencing distress “comparable to the experience of a life threatening illness .” Rather than acknowledge this bleak future for their patients, GAT doctors typically downplay or ignore the physical and emotional ramifications of what they’re doing.
Aye is more forthcoming. Her argument in favor of GAS for minors is that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones have destroyed the child’s future reproductive capacity anyway, so why not remove the now useless organs? She explains (beginning at 6:10): “[A]s soon as puberty blockers were added and then estrogen was added to [the boy’s] therapy, [his] testes never developed. In fact, she [sic] does not make any sperm. And her [sic] reproductive capability to be a biological parent has been eliminated.” (Emphasis mine.)
Having blithely announced that she and her fellow practitioners have robbed this child of one of the most profound and meaningful experiences of human life, Aye concludes: “And in medicine, don’t we often recommend the removal of non-functional organs, like an appendix? So does it make sense for [the minor patient] to wait until she’s [sic] 18, or should older adolescents be allowed to have surgery before the age of 18?”
We’ve already destroyed the organ, Aye is saying, so we might as well lop it off. This is medical practice in the 21st century. Hippocrates indeed.
Following this perverse reasoning, Aye proposes that age of consent be replaced with the number of years the patient has lived in imitation of the opposite sex (although she doesn’t phrase it quite that honestly). If a young boy begins wearing dresses and is “affirmed” in this behavior by his family, his teachers, and his therapists, and so is not surprisingly still confused in adolescence, he should be allowed to undergo surgical sterilization and painful reconstructive procedures while still a minor.
Aye doesn’t specify how many years of charade would be required. We can only assume that whatever number is chosen will steadily fall as the GAS surgeons tap greater patient pools for greater insurance payments. She is seemingly insouciant about this outcome. Preparation for and recovery from this surgery is difficult, she concedes, so doesn’t it make sense to have the child undergo it while he or she is still at home under parental care? Win-win.
But what about the irreversibility of these procedures? Aye doesn’t mention that. What about the fact that thousands of patients who have endured surgical alteration, even as adults, have come to regret it? No mention of that either. What about the stubborn persistence of high suicide rates among people who have undergone the surgery? From Aye, crickets. What of the disturbing statistics showing the sudden and enormous increase in the number of children and adolescents claiming to be the opposite sex lately? Shouldn’t we at least investigate this phenomenon before putting children under the knife? Aye is apparently unconcerned.
That such reckless recommendations are coming from an apparently licensed physician at a formerly respected medical institution shows the depth of the rot that has infected the medical profession. Lives of children and their families are being destroyed, day by day, while the people and organizations who should be policing this are either asleep at the switch or simply craven cowards. But Aye and her fellow practitioners will make lots of money and get invited to present TED talks to the enlightened. That should go a long way toward easing the conscience.

You’re Not Following The Golden Rule If You’re Not Having Children,thefederalist.com,Matthew Cochran,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/youre-not-following-golden-rule-youre-not-children/,"By Matthew Cochran April 30, 2019
Christianity teaches many things that our culture finds controversial, but the Golden Rule generally isn’t one of them. That’s the statement, “Do to others as you would like them do to you.”
Whether Christian or not, the vast majority of people would accept this as a good rule of thumb when deciding how to live among others. So we ought to reflect on the fact that we in the West are deliberately failing to pursue the Golden Rule’s most fundamental expression: having children. Refusing to have a family is the Platonic ideal of selfishness.
Now, for those of you afflicted by “whataboutism,” I’m not addressing the barren, those called to celibacy, or those who’ve devoted their fertile years to starting a family but failed. None of those involve refusal.
But let’s be real here. Our falling birth rates aren’t explained by medical issues. And it couldn’t possibly be clearer that they aren’t falling because of celibacy. After all, the growing masses of people who refuse family are not being voluntarily celibate. They’re fornicating. They’re jerking off to porn plentifully. They’re constantly falling to sexual temptation—the precise situation for which the Apostle Paul actually commands marriage rather than celibacy. We are deciding to forgo children for our own sake.
People may try to portray that decision as some kind of noble service—to the world, to society, or even to the children they never have—but it is a love of self that refuses to sacrificially share with others. I make this charge as one of those very same selfish people. I deliberately avoided having children for many years. It didn’t feel selfish at the time, and I’m intimately familiar with how compelling various rationalizations and excuses can be because I’ve used my own fair share of them. But upon even brief reflection, the most common ones simply don’t hold up to scrutiny. All Your Excuses Are Just Excuses
Most frequently, of course, people make the excuse that there are already too many people in the world. It’s a surprisingly old claim. The earliest example I can think of is 500 years old. It came up at the Diet of Augsburg when Lutherans and papists were arguing about enforced celibacy for priests.
One of the things Rome contended was that God’s command to be fruitful and multiply no longer applied because the Earth was then full to the point of population pressure. Hindsight makes the claim pretty silly from a time in which fewer than half a billion people lived on the planet.
Both experience and foresight should make the claim just as silly for us today. For one thing, Western nations already have fertility well below replacement levels. If the earth were overpopulated, we aren’t the ones doing it.
For another, it has always been “impossible” for the world to support more people until we get more people and then figure out how to support them. The only thing Malthusianism has ever reliably produced is failed predictions. Modern abundance is the product of hope, perseverance, and ingenuity—not despair and surrender. Future abundance will be no different. No, Work Isn’t More Important than Children
Others will rationalize self-imposed barrenness by appealing to the immense value of their work, which society will miss if they devote their time to parenthood. Of course, more often than not, such evaluations are based on what they imagine they will accomplish someday rather than on what they actually have accomplished. But even if we ignore the personal arrogance that often accompanies this view, the reasoning is still faulty for two reasons.
First, parenthood is indeed an enormous time investment—particularly for mothers, as they are biologically best-equipped to nourish and nurture children in their youngest years. But children do grow up, and grow less constantly needy. There will still be time for parents to contribute their immense talents to the wider world after their kids are older and they are wiser. After all, the pressures of parenthood are great for teaching people to efficiently use their time and to understand what’s truly important in life.
Second, and more importantly, children are themselves a great way to contribute to the wider world. If you truly are blessed with exceptional ability, then that only makes it more important to pass that potential on to even more people in the next generation.
Even if either you or your spouse devote half the waking hours of your adult life to raising children, and every last one of your children does the same, then after a single child, you’ve already broken even because he’s ultimately going to supply that missing 50 percent. After the second, you’ve contributed far more to posterity than you ever could have alone. You Don’t Need Experience, Either
The other really common rationalization I hear is from those who contend that they are destined to be a bad parent and should not be trusted with a child. This one is extremely easy to believe because non-parents can envision just about any parental crisis under the sun and realize they have no idea what they would do.
This is particularly troubling when one is young. After being sequestered in schools for one’s entire life, classroom knowledge becomes a kind of security blanket—one can feel unequipped for any practical work for which one hasn’t first taken a course.
But the truth, as most college graduates quickly find out, is that while schooling can provide some helpful background knowledge, most practical job skills are acquired on the job. That’s no less true for parenthood. We don’t know what we’re doing, either, until we figure it out.
Before pregnancy, our society provides little incentive to acquire parenting skills. But make no mistake: actually having kids provides loads of incentive. You will learn because you have to. As that terrifyingly abstract idea of a baby becomes the flesh-and-blood reality of your son or daughter with his or her own feelings, character, and personality, you will also learn how to deal with the trials and obstacles that come along. The Truth Is, You’re Just Selfish (Like Me)
But enough about the rationalizations, because they’re just that. They aren’t the real reason so many of us refuse the challenge of family. Here’s the reality from a still-selfish person standing on the other side of parenthood: The real reason you don’t want to have children is that you find the prospect of raising them unpleasant. The real reason you don’t want to have children is that you find the prospect of raising them unpleasant.
It’s not as though you really, really wanted a family, but then heard an argument about overpopulation and consequently gave up your dream for the sake of the Earth. People in that situation adopt. If you’re anything like me, you didn’t really want a family in the first place and subsequently embraced various arguments because they resonated with what you had already decided.
The self-centered reality of that decision is precisely where we run afoul of the Golden Rule. Consider, for a moment, all the unattractive aspects of raising children that inspired your pious rationalizations in the first place. They’re loud, noisy, and needy. They’re always dribbling from one end or the other. They’ll interrupt your life goals.
You won’t have nearly as much time for your career, your causes, your hobbies, and your amusements. You’ll have less disposable income, go on fewer ideal vacations, wear less stylish clothes, eat at more mundane restaurants, and generally be much less free to do as thou wilt. Take all those reasons, and add whichever ones you want. Apart from rare circumstances like severe family trauma resulting in lasting and irreparable psychological damage, or the inability to care for other people due to severe disabilities, the specifics don’t really matter in the end. Your father and mother embraced everything you see as unpleasant, for you.
Now consider that your own parents went through pretty much that entire list of yours so that you could be here. Your father and mother embraced everything you see as unpleasant, for you—for the life that you so cherish that you don’t want to give up any of it to share with a family of your own.
Now consider that your grandparents made those very same sacrifices, as did their parents before them, all the way back to that day when God first said “Let us make man in our own image” and instructed his new creatures to be fruitful and multiply. Think of all those generations of selfless love that embraced every challenge on your list so that you could be here, reading this. So Go, Given Unto Others What Has Been Given You
What, then, does it mean to do unto others as you would have done unto you—as was done unto you? How do you treat others the way you yourself have been treated and have profoundly benefited from? The answer is quite clear, along with what that answer says about those of us who have refused to do so. If we refuse to be generous even to our own flesh and blood, then we haven’t even cleared level one.
Selfish people like us may talk a good game about generosity, but if we refuse to be generous even to our own flesh and blood, then we haven’t even cleared level one. Having children is the only way to make love a sustainable resource.
To be sure, parents will eventually find out that their children are a blessing and that everything they sacrificed was well worth what they’ve gained. Nevertheless, it’s hard to perceive the reward beforehand. It requires a leap of faith—a willingness to make the sacrifice without truly understanding the benefits. But the moral reality that we ought to make that sacrifice should be plain to us.
In light of the way we were loved by those who came before us, our long list of reasons comes to naught. Whether we admit it or not, the choice we face is this: Do we take the millennia of love that were poured out on us and consume every last drop until it’s gone? Or do we pay it forward by continuing to pass that love along to future generations?
Only one of those choices conforms to the Golden Rule. Choose wisely. Matthew’s writing may be found at The 96th Thesis . You can also follow him on Twitter @matt_e_cochran or subscribe to his YouTube Channel, Lutheran in a Strange Land ."
It’s Time To Ignore The People Who Shut Up Their Opponents By Shouting ‘Racist!’,thefederalist.com,Lawrence M. Mead,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/time-ignore-people-shut-opponents-shouting-racist/,"By Lawrence M. Mead April 30, 2019
Americans say that we have a multicultural society, but we do not allow discussion of group differences. An ideology of sameness insists that minorities and immigrants be seen as exactly the same as all other citizens, despite all our supposed celebration of diversity. Any suggestion to the contrary is deemed racist. One may mention the contributions each group has made to the nation, but not the social problems each has or the costs it imposes on others.
Even experts who study poverty, crime, or family breakdown are allowed to attribute these problems only to impersonal forces outside the groups most involved, such as lack of jobs, housing, or child care. Skeptics who point instead to the groups’ attitudes or lifestyle are forbidden to speak in leading venues (such as universities or think tanks) or to publish in leading outlets (major journals or newspapers).
They are silenced partly by academic political correctness, which endorses sameness, but also by fear of retribution from their employers. Cries of “racism” have become a trump card that bans all discussion of these issues. Institutions that allow debate scramble to disown any offending opinions.
Before communism collapsed, its defenders accused capitalist countries of false consciousness. Societies were dominated by class differences and were radically unequal, yet the culture denied that reality by refusing to talk about it. Today we are more open about economic inequality, even if it remains an issue, yet in denial about group differences. Supposedly, everyone is the same except for differences in their resources and opportunities. We refuse to discuss why some groups make much better use of their opportunities than others do.
One excuse for this silencing is defining “racism” to include any and all criticisms of the protected groups. Anyone saying anything negative about them is presumed to view them as inferior. But the dictionary confines “racism” to the beliefs that one race is superior to the others and that these differences are inherent, not subject to conditioning.
Outside of the alt-right, very few Americans believe such things today, let alone assert them. The vast majority accept that how people live reflects how they are raised, not racial or ethnic identity. So criticisms of any social groups that avoid racism should be heard, even if they are controversial. The proper response is not suppression but counter-argument. The Spirit of Free Speech
Another excuse is the common assumption that suppression is allowed by constitutional norms of free speech. That is, it is okay to block sensitive arguments about group differences provided that speech or publishing about them is not literally forbidden. Skeptics who question sameness have a right to free expression, but not to an audience. If they remain invisible, that is only because their arguments are unpersuasive.
But it violates the spirit of free speech to deny visibility to arguments not “on the merits” but simply because they are controversial. Nobody can deny that important group differences in behavior and lifestyle do exist; there is, however, much more dispute about how they arise. That is just the argument that should occur more openly. It should not be denied by elites seeking to avoid upset.
While freedom of speech is not directly violated, current sanctions resemble those that Russia or China use to protect their regimes. In these repressive countries, one can print or say most things publicly, but not in a place where many people will read or hear it. Only the broadcast media and the internet are tightly controlled. In America, a high-minded elite defends major venues and publications against perceived racial heresy. Tyranny of opinion does the work of censorship.
Another offense to free speech is to suppress challenging opinions because of the alleged motivation behind them. If one’s opponents are racists, then one need not respond to their arguments. But adversaries are entitled to a response on the merits of what they say, not on their purported intentions. Suppressing Ideas Doesn’t Work, Either
Suppression is ineffective as well as improper. The natural response when an opinion is silenced is that it must be true, not that it is false. Most Americans want to hear the facts and form their own opinions. Donald Trump’s election as president was driven in large part by popular resentment against the current thought control. His refusal to honor taboos is the most popular thing about him, even if much of what he says is false.
The general public demands a more honest discussion of minorities and immigrants. It refuses to do more to help them, as advocates demand, without greater candor about their difficulties. And to ask for openness is realistic, not racist.
Identity defenders think they are promoting integration and forestalling an American Holocaust, but the actual effect is to deepen our political division. Current politics pits the sameness ideology, entrenched in the public sector and academia, against the populist movement, which rejects the virtual silencing of the critics. Trump’s challenging manner, of course, does provoke fears that he or his followers are fascists who mean to end all immigration and attention to the needy.
But the danger the other way is greater. The thought controllers are entrenched inside the establishment, whereas Trump’s supporters are outsiders. Sameness leads the country toward Big Brother and “1984.” The nation would then be powerless to arrest the decay of work, families, and neighborhoods going on at the bottom of society. Our only response would be further income transfers. Absorbed in decline without hope, America would soon cease to be the world’s leading nation.
It is time for all Americans to respect differences of opinion and tolerate even the fiercest of debates. And it’s time for those who control leading venues and publications to stand up and be counted. Do not deny hearing the critics of social problems for fear of backlash. Do not permit cries of “racism” to remain the trump card it has become.
Instead, go with the evidence. Critics who have the facts right about problems and who make a good case should be heard, and those who don’t should not. Form your own view rather than siding with sameness.
No individual and no group can escape reality. Our nation must allow that debate to occur, rather than silencing it. A free society demands it. If the mere discussion of sensitive issues is racist, so be it. Lawrence M.

5 Major Heresies A Supposedly Christian Minister Preached To A Gullible New York Times Columnist,thefederalist.com,Robert Gagnon,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/5-major-heresies-supposedly-christian-minister-preached-gullible-new-york-times-columnist/,"By Robert Gagnon April 30, 2019
In an interview with Nicholas Kristoff of The New York Times just in time for Good Friday and Easter, Serene Jones, president of hard-left Union Theological Seminary in New York City, thought it would be an opportune moment to deliver a sweeping denial of the tenets of the Christian faith. In the course of her rant, Jones unintentionally gives a good indication of why “liberal Christianity” is a heretical cancer on Christian faith.
Her heresies should occasion no great surprise given Union’s long-standing opposition to orthodox Christianity and Jones’s Yale pedigree (M.Div., Ph.D., professor of theology and chair of “Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies”). Still, I am inclined to think that the general lay person in church would be shocked by the depth of her degradation of church teaching.
Apparently, Jones thinks that by broadcasting her heresies in the Times, she will increase donor giving and student enrollment to extricate Union from its cash-strapped situation. Let’s just say that I’m trying to do my part to test that delusion. Major Heresy 1: Christ’s Atoning Death
The creed that Christ died to atone for (i.e., make amends or restitution for) humanity’s sins is one of the two or three central confessions of the church. Arguably the earliest Christian creedal formulation is the tradition cited by Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 that he says he received from others and for which he could count on the agreement of the rest of the apostles.
It contained two main formulas, each tagged with the buttressing phrase “in accordance with the Scriptures”: namely, that “Christ died (to atone) for our sins” and that “he has been raised on the third day.” Paul called this formulation “the gospel . . . by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to [it]…unless you believed in vain” (15:1-2).
Jones denies both planks: Christ’s atoning death and his resurrection. Of his atoning death she says: “Crucifixion is not something that God is orchestrating from upstairs. The pervasive idea of an abusive God-father who sends his own kid to the cross so God could forgive people is nuts.”
The entire New Testament witness confirms this was God’s plan from eternity. What Jones deems to be “child abuse” and “nuts” is put forward by none other than Jesus himself at his Last Supper as the one creed that is to be remembered and celebrated regularly by the church in the Eucharist (“Thanksgiving”).
In connection with a Passover meal, Jesus redefined the bread served at the meal as “my body” and the wine as “my ‘blood of the covenant’ which [blood] is being poured out for many” (Mark 14:24; Matthew 26:28 adds: “… for [Gk. forgiveness of sins].” “Blood of the covenant” would have called to mind the same phrase Moses used at the covenant-ratifying ceremony at Mount Sinai, where death of bulls dashed both on the altar (symbolizing God) and the people (who had just heard the stipulations of the law) inaugurated a kinship agreement between God and Israel.
Jesus was signaling that by his atoning death, his life for ours, he was ratifying and inaugurating a new covenant in which God would write the law on our hearts and remember our sins no more (Jer 31:31-34). This explains Paul’s (and Luke’s) rephrasing of Jesus’ Eucharistic words for a Gentile audience: “This cup is the new covenant (ratified or inaugurated) by blood” (1 Cor. 11:25; Luke 22:20). Later the author of the letter “to the Hebrews” would write: “Not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood” (9:18) and “Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins” (9:22).
Jesus’ added words about his blood “being poured out for many” would have called to mind the words about a “Suffering Servant” in Isaiah 53: “He poured out his life to death … and bore the sin of many , and made intercession for the transgressors” (53:12). Jesus’s poured-out life and blood was the means by which he bore the sins of transgressors against God’s law.
Nor is this the only time that Jesus made such a claim. In another important saying of Jesus in Mark 10:45 (parallel in Matt 20:28), Jesus stated that he came “to give his life (or soul ) as a ransom (Gk. lútron , ‘price of release,’ ‘sum paid for manumission’ of slaves) for many.”
So what Jones calls “child abuse” and “nuts” is in fact a denial of what Jesus himself viewed as central to the mission given him by God, even as she claims to be not only a “Christian,” a disciple or learner of Jesus, but a “minister” of Christ’s.
The idea is not “nuts” but makes sense in the context of sacrificial rites and martyrdom theology. Jesus as God’s Son willingly lays down his life for the lives of sinners in a lost world. This is the crux of Christianity itself. What’s new in Jesus’ thinking is that his act of righteousness is not changing God’s wrath to love but rather is cooperating with God’s love for a lost world, where the greatest cost is incurred by God, who offers his Son only because it is necessary to save the world.
Jones does not accept this need for amends and restitution for sin accomplished in the Godhead. Yet Jesus required his followers to celebrate this as an act of love from God. To Jones, the crucifixion was just “a first-century lynching,” “an enactment of our human hatred.” Nothing could “be more pertinent to our world today,” she proclaims. Yet in her thinking the cross effects nothing in God’s plan of redemption, except to show where hatred leads. Major Heresy 2: Christ’s Resurrection
We noted above that the earliest church viewed Christ’s resurrection from the dead as the second great plank of the core gospel. By this the church meant not resurrection as a metaphor or even as merely a release of the soul from entombment in a body, but a genuine physical, bodily resurrection.
The Apostle Paul takes great pains to make this point in 1 Corinthians 15 against the church at Corinth (Greece) that appeared to ascribe little or no value to embodied existence. To be sure, Paul is not talking about a “flesh-and-blood” body (15:50), as though Christ’s resurrection was merely a resuscitated corpse. Yet he is talking about a new body for the Kingdom of God that clothes an otherwise “naked” spirit (2 Corinthians 5:2-4).
It is the resurrection appearances of Jesus that convinced his disciples that Jesus was alive again in a real (albeit higher) sense; further, that God had thereby confirmed the truth of Jesus’ message and mission. They also came to the conclusion that Christ’s resurrection was not an isolated event but the start of a new humanity, a “first fruits” of a much larger, future harvest of resurrected bodies culminating in a renewed heaven and earth where sin and death are vanquished forever (“O Death, where is your sting?”). This is the hope of Easter.
As important as this belief has been for Christianity from its inception, it plays little or no role in Jones’s belief system. She says, “Those who claim to know whether or not [Jesus’ resurrection] happened are kidding themselves. . . . For Christians for whom the physical resurrection becomes a sort of obsession, that seems to me to be a pretty wobbly faith.”
To the early Christians, however, Christ’s resurrection was an assurance given by God that those who risked their life for the faith would receive their life (with body) in an afterlife. In addition, they were convinced that God would not abandon his creation to sin and death forever.
Once again, Jones denies not only what the early followers of Jesus believed to be essential to the gospel, along with the evidence of the empty tomb and of the eyewitnesses to Christ’s resurrection (the apostles, Jesus’ brother James, and more than 500 people at one time, most of whom were still alive at the time Paul wrote his “first” epistle to the Corinthians; 15:5-7). She must also deny Jesus’ own teaching, for all the gospels record Jesus’ repeated predictions that after his suffering and death God would raise him bodily from the dead.
Right off the bat, then, Jones either denies (Christ’s atoning death) or fails to affirm (Christ’s bodily resurrection) what the early church treated as the two central planks of the faith, necessary to be believed to be saved. She is officially a pagan or heretic by the standards of historic Christian faith. Yet there’s more. Major Heresy 3: Heaven, Hell, and Afterlife
One sees only traces of a developed view of reward or recompenses in the afterlife in the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament (the relatively late text in Daniel 12:1-2 provides the clearest case). The great persecution of the nation of Israel by a Greek ruler of Syria in the 160s B.C., with its stories of intense martyrdom of faithful Jews, served as a catalyst for deeper reflection: There must be some post-mortem reward for those who suffer for the faith and recompense for those who make the faithful suffer.
By the time of Jesus, this concept was commonplace among Jews (although there were still holdouts like the aristocratic Sadducees). The resurrection appearances of Christ ensured that Christianity from its inception would have a robust view of an afterlife associated with either heaven or hell. Life after death in the Kingdom of God is something Jesus repeatedly affirms.
“Robust” would not be the appropriate adjective to describe Jones’s view of an afterlife. She is agnostic on the question of a positive post-mortem existence. In response to Kristoff’s question, “What happens when we die?” she states: “I don’t know! There may be something, there may be nothing. My faith is not tied to some divine promise about the afterlife.”
This uncertainty for Jones, however, does not extend to all facets of the Christian view of an afterlife: “I’m absolutely certain that when we die, there is not a group of designated bad people sent to burn in hell. That does not exist.” So she categorically rejects the idea that any bad people will suffer after death (which is certainly good news for Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, and Pol Pot).
This is extraordinary in view of her claim to be a “minister” of Jesus the Christ. Life after death in the Kingdom of God is something Jesus repeatedly affirms. This includes a place of destruction for those who do not repent and believe, which Jesus described as “outer darkness where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”
Indeed, more than 40 percent of all Jesus’ sayings in the Synoptic Gospels contain a warning regarding God’s judgment of those who do not receive Jesus and his message, including most of Jesus’ parables. The Lord’s Prayer is first and foremost a prayer that God would supernaturally break into the world to end all human rebellion against his will.
Of course, all these elements of Jesus’ teaching are repeatedly affirmed in the apostolic witness to Christ throughout the New Testament scriptures. There is no New Testament writer who thinks otherwise. If there is no afterlife, then not even Jesus in any non-metaphorical sense is alive. His memory lives on, but that is all.
Jones claims that belief in an afterlife is “faith driven by…selfish[ness]” from Christians. Jesus and the apostles who witnessed to him viewed it as incentive for doing what is right and a warning to those tempted to do wrong. Yet the apostle Paul wrote that if Christ has not been raised and there is no future resurrection from the dead for those who belong to him, then his proclamation is “empty” because he and his co-ministers have been “false testifiers about God.”
Moreover, in that case his converts’ faith would be “empty” because “you are still in your sins,” with sin through death having the last word. Clearly Christianity teaches in an afterlife. Major Heresy 4: God’s Omnipotence and Omniscience
Jesus and his apostles believed in an awesome God who created all there is with a mere thought and word, and who in the blink of an eye can destroy it all. They believed in a God who had a plan for his creation and who, though allowing for a significant degree of human choice, could work for good in all things.
Yes, God is sometimes viewed as bargaining and “changing his mind” in particular cases for particular people. Yet that God is, overall, both omnipotent and omniscient is not seriously doubted. So Jesus could exclaim, “With God all things are possible” (Mark 10:27). In the end God will triumph utterly and completely over sin and death, restore his creation, and save the maximum number of people possible to his greater honor and glory.
Jones takes a very different approach: “I don’t worship an all-powerful, all-controlling omnipotent, omniscient being. That is a fabrication of Roman juridical theory and Greek mythology.” She’s right there. She doesn’t worship an omnipotent and omniscient God. She worships a false god of her own making, a mere projection of her ideological prejudices. One wonders whether Jones has read the Book of Job recently when God reminds Job that he had no need for Job’s advice when he measured the cosmos. Major Heresy 5: The Virgin Birth
One could quibble whether this constitutes a “major” heresy. Arguably, it is not on the same level as denying Christ’s atoning death and resurrection or essential traits of God. Only two of the four gospels record it (nowhere else in the New Testament), and the author of one of these, Luke, doesn’t mention it among the conversion speeches in his second volume, Acts. The doctrine of the virgin birth does not arise out of some belief in the sinfulness of sex, nor from some felt need to oppress women.
It is strange that the NYT article should lead with a reference to this heresy (“Reverend, You Say the Virgin Birth Is ‘a Bizarre Claim’?”). Even so, Matthew and Luke do narrate that Jesus was born of a virgin. It is a part of Scripture.
Jones opines: “I find the virgin birth a bizarre claim. . . . The virgin birth only becomes important if you have a theology in which sexuality is considered sinful. It also promotes this notion that the pure, untouched female body is the best body, and that idea has led to centuries of oppressing women.”
The doctrine of the virgin birth does not arise out of some belief in the sinfulness of sex, nor from some felt need to oppress women. Mary sees it as a sign of God elevating the lowly and oppressed, as well as giving her great favor (so the Magnificat in Luke 1:46-55). The doctrine presents Jesus as having divine origin and as sinless, able thus to atone for the sins of others. It also demonstrates that Jesus is not merely human, as he could have otherwise not existed without his mother having had sex.
These heresies are just the heresies contained in the Kristoff interview. For example, she appears elsewhere (h/t Al Mohler) to dismiss the doctrine of the incarnation and to treat Jesus as God’s Son only in the sense that “in Jesus, divine love was fully present in a way that ordinary human beings rarely, if ever, experience and embody.” Does Jones Believe Anything?
Of course she does, you silly person. Can you guess what that is? You guessed it: Love. She says that the “empty tomb symbolizes that the ultimate love in our lives cannot be crucified and killed,” even though she has no confidence that Jesus was actually raised from the dead. It’s all a metaphor. “What happens on Easter is the triumph of love in the midst of suffering. Isn’t that reason for hope?” That and a couple of dollars will get you a good Hallmark card.
Well, no, not if Jesus deceived his disciples about his resurrection and the disciples remained deluded. “For me, the message of Easter is that love is stronger than life or death,” Jones says. “For me, living a life of love is driven by the simple fact that love is true.”
That and a couple of dollars will get you a good Hallmark card. Here’s another platitude: “After all, tomorrow is another day,” as one movie epic from generations past disappointingly concluded. Without dismissing the critical importance of love (and, more importantly, that God is love rather than that love is God), Christianity is based on something a bit more substantial.
Christianity is based on a belief that God intervenes in the act of creation, then in redemption of fallen creation, and finally in recreation of heaven and earth. God does so by concrete, world-encompassing acts in history and beyond, through his Son. That is what Jesus and the entire apostolic witness to him believed. Yet Jones knows better.
In the course of the interview Kristoff asks Jones, “Am I a Christian?” Jones’s response is ironic: “Well, you sound an awful lot like me, and I’m a Christian minister.” Now how in God’s holy name can you claim to be a Christian, let alone a Christian minister, while denying one essential element after another of Jesus’ own life and teaching? Either Jesus is a liar or she is.

"For All Jews, The Shooting At Poway Chabad Hits Too Close To Home",thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/jews-shooting-poway-chabad-hits-close-home/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein April 30, 2019
There’s nothing quite like logging onto Twitter on a Saturday night after spending the day with family and learning that there’s been another synagogue shooting. Momentarily, you forget to breathe. Then you find yourself thinking about the dead and the injured with a knot in your stomach.
Sixty-year-old Lori Gilbert Kaye should still be here. Her 22-year-old daughter should still have her mother, who was in synagogue honoring the memory of her own deceased mother. And Lori Gilbert Kaye’s husband should not be a widower. I can’t even imagine him realizing that he’d been called to perform CPR on his own wife. What a horror.
In a six-month period, American Jews have sustained two deadly attacks. This time it was a gunman at a San Diego-area synagogue, Chabad of Poway. He injured three exactly six months after the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Wanting to connect with members of their religious community and the Almighty, Jews have gathered in their local houses of worship to pray after these attacks. What should have been standard outings on two Saturday mornings have instead become historical moments of mourning. And the Jewish community does mourn, even though we may never have met any of the 12 victims in Pittsburgh and Poway, because they’re members of our extended Jewish family.
The shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, which took the lives of 11 American Jews, was shocking. That another deadly attack happened on the six-month anniversary of that attack is almost unbelievable.
Growing up in New York in the 1980s and ‘90s, I was proud to be Jewish and felt totally at home. I heard stories about anti-Semitism my family had experienced, but it all felt like ancient history. My grandfather and his brother applied to work at the local power company for kicks, knowing that institutional anti-Semitism would automatically disqualify them.
As a child, my father was chased home in his Brooklyn neighborhood by boys shouting he was a Christ-killer. When it came time to apply to college, my father didn’t bother applying to schools like Princeton and Yale, which were still known to be limiting their Jewish student populations.
It wasn’t until high school that I started encountering anti-Semitism myself. A non-Jewish classmate confused me by tossing a quarter on the floor. When I asked why, he said he was testing whether I’d dive for it. So me sitting still apparently confused him right back.
More widely contentious was the reaction of my classmates during a discussion of the Crown Heights riots, which caused fraught divisions among Jewish and African-American friends. And then I’ll never forget the Californian from a summer program who asked me to tell him about the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, promising to hold all juicy details in confidence. That was the end of that crush.
All of those things felt fairly fleeting, though. I never felt like I had to hide my Jewish identity. And while we had police at our synagogue for every High Holiday, it was about making sure that the surge of attendees was able to safely cross busy streets by our suburban synagogue.
I wish I could say that my children will know that same safe, philo-Semitic America. Increasingly, though, I don’t believe they will. For starters, security became de rigeur at so many Jewish institutions after 9/11. It became normal to have security that Americans who attend churches or use preschools affiliated with other religions would likely find foreign. Sadly, that security is necessary, as these attacks have shown.
Parenting is many things, including the art of managing many worries about one’s children. New ones are rapidly being added to that existing list. I was already grappling with how to best raise children who are knowledgeable and proud of their Judaism in a nation where we are a tiny minority. Now, I also worry about my children’s safety, while they pray and learn about the religion of our ancestors. What am I supposed to tell my young children about this turn of events without terrifying them?
This is not a way to raise a family. Or rather, it’s not a way I ever anticipated and definitely not one that I prefer. Of course, even as I write this, I imagine that if my grandparents and great-grandparents were still here, they’d nod knowingly. They might tell me the outlier has been my American experience, and that realistically, Jews have always raised children amidst the fear and uncertainty of deadly anti-Semitism.

"Yes, Teachers Are Raising Many People’s Kids, But They Shouldn’t Be",thefederalist.com,Anna Zeigler,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/30/yes-teachers-raising-many-peoples-kids-shouldnt/,"By Anna Zeigler April 30, 2019
Democratic Presidential hopeful Kamala Harris recently tweeted about a plan to raise teacher pay from the federal level: “ I often get asked ‘how can we afford this’ — but my question is: how can we afford NOT to give our teachers a raise? They’re raising our children. Don’t they deserve our respect? Don’t they deserve to get paid their value?”
We should all shiver when a U.S. senator proclaims that teachers are raising our children. This should profoundly bother us, yet her words were just a blip in the news. Unfortunately, in far too many instances teachers are raising America’s children, or they are at least attempting to do so. Teachers should not be faulted for their efforts, and in fact a desire to nurture leads many to the teaching profession, but there are significant reasons to ensure the line between teacher and parent remains distinct.
While I am not usually one to harp on pronoun usage, Harris’s use of the collective pronoun our for children ought to be a red flag. Children are not collective property to be raised by an unfeeling state. The God-designed family ought to be honored and supported by all who hope for a better America.
No matter how caring the teachers they hire are, government-funded schools cannot and should not attempt to pick up the slack for mom and dad. It not only costs too much, it is an impossible task. It will cost us tremendously in the many ways it will tear at the fabric of this nation.
In all the education-focused dialogue exchanged in this country, too few are willing to state the obvious: Some of educators’ top complaints are situations that are unlikely to improve unless and until mom and dad become more involved with their kids. Too many parents are allowing the state to step in and do their job, and this happens at least in part because the state is a willing enabler.
Understandably frustrated teachers turn to the government for help when the source of at least some of their frustration is a lack of support from home, and disinterested parents are not a recent trend . Common teacher complaints include students with poor hygiene , students who get no help with their homework, students who only eat when they are at school , and students whose behavior needs to be addressed either with medication they do not take regularly or with discipline that parents withhold.
Family psychologist John Rosemond summarizes the perfect storm raging in America’s public schools : “The problem consists of equal parts irresponsible parenting (not confined to any given demographic), parents who make excuses for brats they send to school (just another form of irresponsible parenting), teacher unions that have been given legal power to game the system, federal aid to education (long outlived its usefulness), and administrators who strip teachers of permission to discipline and then discipline teachers who have the temerity to do so.”
“Feeding a child is the fundamental duty of a parent,” notes Teresa Mull . Ronald Reagan once said, “All great change in America begins at the dinner table.” There is a great deal to consider when contemplating shifting the burden of providing a child’s sustenance from parents to the government.
Mull discusses some of the long-term emotional benefits of a government that encourages parents to meet their responsibilities rather than assuming another government program is the answer: “Parents would also be reminded of the pride and joy that comes from providing for one’s family, and they need to know that bonding with a child at the grocery store and the dinner table is a thousand times better for his or her development than any government-subsidized meal could ever be.”
It is one thing to need a few more textbooks or some extra paper. It is another matter when you seek money to feed children who are not fed at home, to assist children whose parents haven’t addressed their basic hygene, or to employ an army of counselors and therapists in an attempt to meet the psychological needs of students whose parents are physically or emotionally AWOL.
Are these things taxpayers should be supporting via the money budgeted for education? Are we not encouraging a dereliction of parental duty by spending more money and creating more programs that have little to do with education and everything to do with the government happily inserting itself into what ought to be private family matters?
Many teachers cannot teach as effectively as they otherwise might because they are physically and emotionally being drained attempting to fulfill their dual roles as mother and teacher. It is an untenable situation, a cycle fostered by a handful of parents who either cannot or will not fulfill their duties coupled with the pervasive but erroneous idea that it is normal, healthy, and fiscally possible for a child’s every need to be met by a publicly funded school system.
I believe a nation can withstand and possibly turn the tide against an intrusive government if its families remain strong and intact. There are reasons power-hungry regimes seek to destroy the family, to loosen the natural familial bonds and find government substitutes for mothers and fathers.
We are not yet at the stage George Orwell described in “1984”: “The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.” But we continue to take unwise steps toward a future in which the government is involved in child-rearing in unprecedented ways.
The individual family unit is the source from which any strong and functional nation derives its leaders and its stability. Continuing to unthinkingly funnel money into programs that allow for and even encourage parental absenteeism is undermining both the families and education for all school children, for even those students with attentive parents are certainly hurt by the strain placed on teachers attempting to not only teach but to simultaneously meet the physical, nutritional, and emotional needs of some students.
Teachers should be teaching. We can debate teacher pay, but the notion that we need to give teachers a raise because they are “raising our children” ought to raise eyebrows. Raising children is not an endeavor on which you could ever put a price, nor is it an endeavor schools ought to be undertaking at the taxpayers’ expense.

It’s hard not to laugh reading The New York Times coverage of the Trump administration’s efforts to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. The three-person-bylined article kicks off by describing the group as a “storied and influential Islamist political movement with millions of members across the Middle East.”
Sounds like a global social club! Just some folks batting around ideas. The authors didn’t even have the decency to throw in a superficial adjective like “controversial” to create a veneer of balance.
Whether the Muslim Brotherhood’s many disparate groups and organizations meet the criteria of a single terror organization under U.S. law is debatable, but what isn’t debatable is that a large faction of the Muslim Brotherhood leads a Sunni movement that aims to implement sharia law under a global caliphate. Its deep network of “charitable” institutions and political parties form an infrastructure for extremist causes.
One could, if not a New York Times writer, describe its philosophy as dogmatic, illiberal, theocratic, and violent; and its “storied” history a long-term threat to secularism, Muslim reformers, liberalism, Christians, and Jews in the Middle East. These days, members of the Muslim Brotherhood advocate for child suicide bombings , political assassinations , mass murder of minorities , violent mobs —basically the entire deadly menu of jihadist activities.
This is context that Times readers would not learn. Nor would they learn that the Muslim Brotherhood helped birth modern Islamic extremism, first to undermine nationalistic Arabic governments, but later moving onto bigger goals. Readers would not learn that Muslim Brotherhood’s spurred the creation of al-Qaeda or that its intellectual founder, Sayyid Qutb, was an inspiration to Osama bin Laden.
Zachary Laub of the Council on Foreign Relations once noted that Qutb’s writings “provided the intellectual and theological underpinnings for many militant Sunni Islamist groups, including al-Qaeda and Hamas.” It would have been easy to include such a quote.
Also not mentioned in the Times’s article is that in 2001, the U.S. government designated the Muslim Brotherhood’s Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, then the largest Muslim charity in the country, a “Global Terrorist” group, whose employees would later be found guilty of funneling millions to terrorists groups . We have already treated Muslim Brotherhood affiliates as terrorists.
Also, one of the Muslim Brotherhood’s most successful offshoots, Hamas— designated a terror group by the State Department in 1997— still runs a mini-terror state in Gaza that not only undercuts any chance of the peace in the region, and not only oppresses its own people with theocratic strictures and fascistic rule , but is also responsible for the murder of American citizens .
Those meanies in the Trump administration, though.
“American humanitarian organizations with links to the group,” the Times informs us, are concerned that Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who deposed Mohamed Morsi, “Egypt’s first democratically elected president,” will expand his power. It’s a popular, but absurd, notion that elected leaders can’t be illiberal. Morsi was a disaster for Egypt and the Middle East and freedom. And, no doubt, it’s an ugly, ethically precarious scene in the Middle East. But the fact is, we deal with plenty of bad guys to fight even worse ones.
The irony of all this is that The New York Times has a deeply ingrained antagonism towards one of the good guys. And it’s when the Times turns to the administration’s morally unambiguous designation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization that we get a true taste of its hostility.
This “novel” move by the Trump administration, we’re told, “prompted alarm among American military, intelligence and diplomatic professionals.” After eight years of institutional coddling the Islamic Republic—and cheerleading from the Times opinion and news pages—the Trump administration moved to designate the Revolutionary Guard, which runs the nation’s ballistic missile program, military aspects of its (supposedly nonexistent) nuclear program, and large parts of its statist economy, to make it easier to implement more sanctions. Yet here’s what the Times deems the problem with this arrangement:
The potential problems included creating a need to grant huge numbers of visa waivers for Iraqi officials who interact with the Iranian military agency; raising the question of whether American officials should start denying visas to members of other countries’ intelligence services that use violence , including Israel, Pakistan and Russia; and risking retaliation against American troops and intelligence officials.
(Incredulous bolding mine.)
Who raised these questions? They don’t say. One wonders what kind of “American official” would make a moral equivalence between Israeli intelligence, an American ally who has engaged in a war against terrorism and existential threats for 70 years, with a military dictatorship and quasi-authoritarian—“democratically elected”!—foe of the United States?
For that matter, what kind of American official would liken the work of Israeli intelligence to that of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a group that has helped carry out terror attacks against civilians on every continent, funded and trained terrorist proxies that destabilize entire regions, and acted as the Stasi against its own people? (Well, like the Stasi if the Stasi had been run by a fanatical religious Mafia family.)
Does anyone in the State Department really believe that handing out visas to those associated with the Revolutionary Guard, which was involved in killing 608 American troops in Iraq between 2003-2011, is in any way analogous to working with a close ally?
Journalists often speak through proxies who “raise” convenient questions. In addition to the entrenched bias at most major media outlets, Washington now teems with Qatari money and allies, who flood cable news and think tanks and op-ed pages. Their alleged expertise is used to run interference for the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran, and to smear Israel.
Now, on the latter issue, The New York Times hasn’t needed much prodding over the decades. These days, though, it’s getting increasingly difficult to tell the difference between the newspaper of record and Qatari-state-run al Jazeera."
Lawyers Say They’d Report A Client For Legally Owning A Gun,thefederalist.com,Rebecca Kathryn Jude,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/ethics-seminar-lawyers-say-theyd-report-client-legally-owning-gun/,"By Rebecca Kathryn Jude and Chauncey M. DePree, Jr. May 2, 2019
If your lawyer believes that having a firearm license defines you as dangerous, you may be at risk of losing your Second Amendment rights and even your freedom. You may not know about his belief or recognize the risk until it is too late.
I can almost hear you saying, “My attorney is my advocate. What are you talking about? That could never happen!” You are wrong.
Lawyers are required to attend continuing legal education. During a recent ethics seminar, “The ‘Perfect’ Match: Selecting Clients for Successful Representation (Ethics),” Adam Kilgore, general counsel for the Mississippi Bar, offered the following hypothetical to a group of experienced civil and criminal lawyers.
A man has been fired from his job. He is upset. He hires you as his attorney. You are of the opinion he has an excellent case and file a complaint on his behalf. You later discover he possesses a permit to carry a firearm. He also has a so-called enhanced carry license. While his case is wending through the courts, your client goes to a public area outside his former workplace. He displays signs that say he has been wrongfully fired. The man has no history of criminal activity, violence, or threatening anyone.
The instructor asked the class what actions, if any, a lawyer should take. It seemed obvious to me there was no reason to do anything except proceed with the client’s case. I (Jude) would also advise my client to avoid confrontations with anyone who worked for his former employer and what he might consider saying if approached by the media.
While I was forming an answer, many lawyers immediately said they would terminate the attorney-client relationship and contact law enforcement to report their client was potentially dangerous. The only reason offered was his firearm permits.
I have to admit, I was flabbergasted, for several reasons. First, I live in Mississippi, which is among the reddest of the red states. Second, the attorneys—let me call them gun-phobic — were proposing to violate the attorney-client privilege, which establishes one of the most sacrosanct confidential relationships. (American Bar Association “Rule of Professional Conduct” 1.6). As with most things, there are exceptions. They generally pertain to a client who is about to commit a criminal act or engage in fraudulent behavior.
The lawyers who proposed to call the police cited ABA Rule 1.6 (b)(1). It states “[a] lawyer may reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary: … to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.”
I have no problem with the rule, if there is reliable evidence to believe a client is about to kill or injure someone. The question is whether there is sufficient reliable evidence to justify firing a client and reporting him to the police—a serious decision with significant consequences.
Evidence is facts, not conjecture, speculation, or supposition. The only fact addressed by attorneys who advocated reporting the client to police was the lawfully issued gun permits. It did not matter that he lawfully owned a firearm, or had a firearm permit, including an enhanced carry permit. He had met significant background and training criteria. He does not have anything in his background that would prevent him from owning a firearm or possessing a permit, including a history of criminal activity, violence, or mental illness.
Gun-phobic attorneys focused on the fact the client owned a gun and had firearm permits. In their opinion, that was enough to label him as reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm and report him to the police.
No one claimed there was anything legally improper about being upset with a former employer. Hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit is a pretty good indicator of being upset. It is what you would expect from a law-abiding citizen, not a dangerous person. The gun-phobic attorneys acknowledged, in response to a question by the instructor, that displaying non-threatening signs in a public area is lawful, and is likely protected by the First Amendment.
Here’s what I found truly amazing. We are attorneys! We take evidence seriously. We study evidence in law school. Knowledge of evidence is tested on bar examinations. We would be appalled at the thought that a judge might permit our clients to be jailed based on conjecture.
If gun-phobic attorneys like this have their way, there may be truly terrifying consequences. They would punish an American citizen who had done absolutely nothing wrong. Because the lawyer claims his client is reasonably certain to cause death or serious bodily harm, the police would have little choice but to take action, up to and including arrest.
A lawyer’s claim that his client is dangerous is substantially identical to the judicial standard for psychiatric detention. Under these circumstances, the client might be held for a mental evaluation. Even if ultimately cleared, this citizen would be publicly (and permanently on the internet) labeled as “dangerous.”
The adverse consequences have just begun. After being fired by an attorney, reported to the police as likely to injure or kill, arrested and held for psychiatric evaluation, what would happen to the client’s lawsuit? He would face the almost insurmountable burden of finding a new lawyer. How many attorneys would accept a case where a client has been fired by his previous attorney and arrested based on his attorney’s opinion that he is dangerous?
Congress may pass laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. Courts may interpret existing laws to limit our ability to possess firearms. They are obvious threats. What we don’t expect is the insidious, hidden threat from an attorney who does not believe in our Second Amendment rights and who takes action on the belief that he needs to protect the public from us.

"Investigation Time Is Over, Democrats. Impeach Or Shut Up",thefederalist.com,Adam Mill,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/investigation-time-democrats-impeach-shut/,"By Adam Mill May 2, 2019
Elizabeth Drew, a journalist who covered Watergate, recently wrote a sleep-inducing New York Times lecture on her moral superiority over a president too boorish to be allowed to complete his constitutional term. It’s representative of what we’ve heard for two years from those who couldn’t abide the results of the 2016 election.
“The president and his allies argue that the country is ‘tired’ of investigations,” Drew sniffed, dismissing those arguments as “sounding very much like Nixon…as if that were the definitive criterion for deciding whether to proceed with a constitutional responsibility” and “Some Democrats continue to fear Mr. Trump…that his skill at…assigning humiliating nicknames…could end in their failure to win an impeachment fight. Some also doubt, with reason, their party’s capacity for handling the matter skillfully.”
Just in case you missed it, Drew placed scare quotes around “tired” to reinforce her disdain for anyone claiming fatigue from two years of fruitless investigations into the president. For a Trump administration that has attempted to prove the president’s innocence by producing more than 1 million pages of documents and partially waiving executive privilege to allow the special counsel broad access to the president’s most privileged conversations, enough is enough.
The president’s openness was rewarded by a steady drip, drip, drip of leaks of information entrusted to the special counsel ending up twisted into the mainstream media’s relentless public relations assault on the president. This is made worse by the fact that Robert Mueller team promptly contradicted a few of the most outrageous lies against the president, leaving an implied endorsement of all the rest.
For nearly two years, we’ve suffered elitist fools cheerleading Mueller’s lawless assault on the rule of law . And for so many months, the president was cautioned that he must endure the unendurable lest the Democrats impeach him ( here , here , here , here , here , and here ).
As reported by Newsweek, the White House counsel’s decision to allow the special counsel unprecedented access to privileged communication “came with the approval of Trump, whose legal team advised him to go with ‘an open-book strategy’ as the president insisted he had nothing to hide. They reportedly believed this would be the fastest way to wrap up the investigation.”
Only a guilty man would object to an investigation, right ? Tell that to Roger Stone , George Papadopoulos , and Michael Flynn , men guilty of nothing until the Mueller process crime machine caught them in its gears.
One commentator claimed that the Trump legal team negotiated a conditional waiver of executive privilege in exchange for giving Mueller access to White House counsel Don McGahn. The deal was that Mueller could talk to McGahn, but the contents would never leave the executive branch, meaning it would not be introduced into Mueller’s final report.
If true, Mueller violated the agreement by including the testimony in the report. But it wouldn’t have mattered, because people familiar with McGahn’s testimony destroyed any chance of preserving any promised confidentiality back in January 2018 by leaking to The New York Times.
Something happened after Mueller report. Warnings of impeachment have lost their power. The president said what millions of Americans were thinking: “ Enough !” Cue thunderous applause of Americans in living rooms across America.
“It’s enough…we’re fighting all the subpoenas,” of House Democrats in their investigations, Trump said. “Look, these aren’t like impartial people…They’re trying to win 2020 and the only way they think they can luck-out is by relentlessly attacking me.” But, but, Mr. President, the Democrats might impeach you!
The Democrats have the House. Passing articles of impeachment requires a simple majority, which Democrats can easily muster without a single Republican vote. There’s no burden of proof, and they can do so with a nakedly partisan show of force.
We can be spared further debate in the media whether the Mueller report shows obstruction of justice (it doesn’t). Democrats have the support of 66 percent of their electorate, who ferociously demand that the president be impeached.
So do it. Impeach or shut up. Investigation time is over. We’ve heard all of that talk about the president “obstructing justice,” emoluments, refusing to turn over his tax returns, and now an outright refusal to cooperate in future investigations. There’s no need for further investigation.
Drew said as much, amazingly telling Democrats not to worry about the absence of proof of actual crimes, writing, “It’s of course politically easier to go after a president for having committed a crime — for example, perjury, for which President Bill Clinton was ostensibly impeached.” As I’ve written so frequently before , we’ve all learned the only rule of Trump-era law is that if it helps get Trump, then it must be legal.
Well, Drew, better tell the House Democrats to hurry. Primary season starts in January. After that, voters will have the opportunity to decide whether to first nominate Donald Trump, and then whether to reelect him. If Democrats don’t impeach before then, he will have a mandate to mock and block these investigations.
But there won’t be a trial in the Senate. The Get Trump crowd can’t win a fair fight. They can’t put up the goods when called upon to do so. Proof: how many criminal trials resulted from the army of prosecutors and investigators Mueller deployed? Answer: Just one, for Paul Manafort. And it wasn’t pretty.
Line federal prosecutors who do their talking in the courtroom convict at about a 90 percent rate in trials before a jury. In contrast, the Mueller political hit squad fumbled their only evidentiary trial in front of a sympathetic DC-area jury.
The jury was confused . The prosecutors had a chart that kept track of how their hundreds of exhibits matched to the charges. But the bumbling political hacks forgot to introduce this essential tool to the jury during the trial. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 charges prosecutors piled onto Manafort.
By the way, none of the charges had anything to do with President Trump. Unlimited budgets and unlimited manpower cannot overcome the incompetence that attends unlimited ego.
Democrats won’t impeach Trump because then the president would get his day in court in the form of a trial in the Senate, and he would easily win it. So when they threaten to impeach, call the bluff. Here is what you say to anyone berating, bemoaning, or rehashing all of that monotonous carping about why he should be impeached: “Fine, do it. Put up or shut up.” Adam Mill is a pen name.

Democratic Socialists And Communists Rally On International Workers’ Day,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/02/democratic-socialists-communists-rally-international-workers-day/,"May 2, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
May 1st, also known as May Day or International Workers’ Day, brings the labor movement—socialists, communists, union people, and others—together in solidarity for the plight of workers everywhere. This informal and unrecognized international celebration has something for everyone on the Left. In South Carolina on Wednesday, 10,000 public educators marched on the state’s capital on Wednesday, while in Washington D.C., about 50 activists gathered at a local park.
May Day’s origins harken back to the 1886 Haymarket riots in Chicago, where police officers and civilians were killed during a labor rally. Decades later, European socialists and communists adopted May 1st as the day for workers’ struggle, but also as a propaganda tool to prop up their totalitarian rule.
Now, every year, demonstrations are held around the world to advocate for various workers’ rights, which can include anything from raising the minimum wage to calling for a radical overhaul of the economy and means of production. While teachers in South Carolina were demanding smaller class sizes and higher pay, D.C. organizations at plastic tables in Meridian Hill Park discussed abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) and Marxism.

Michael Golash, May Day festival attendee, said he has been a May Day organizer in D.C. for decades, and noted the evolution of impetus behind the informal holiday over time.
“In the 1930s, May Day protests focused on the fight over the Scottsboro Boys … and later focused on the fight against fascism,” he said. “Some of the largest May Day marches in the 1980s were in South Africa where people took to the streets to end apartheid.”
2020 Democratic candidates also got in on the May Day action, tweeting out their support of the teacher protests and International Workers’ Day. I stand with South Carolina teachers who are walking out for fairer pay, smaller classroom sizes, duty-free break time and full funding of the state’s promises to students. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity. #AllOutMay1 https://t.co/K8RpgUarw9

But on the same day that organizers gathered in the capital of the wealthiest and freest nation in the world to celebrate socialism, Venezuelans protested food shortages, electricity cuts, and political violence under their socialist leader President Nicolás Maduro. When I asked attendees of the International Workers’ Day festival in D.C. how they reconciled their beliefs with the crisis in Venezuela, the focus always shifted away from the country’s failed socialist policies to the issue of U.S. intervention.
Members of a local chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America (who asked not to be named) concluded that socialism is “always a work in progress,” and that most of the opposition to policies in Venezuela is stemming from Venezuelan-Americans who fled the country.
Golash, 76, suggested that the failure in Venezuela is due to falling oil prices. “The socialist experiment in Venezuela was to try to figure out a way to collaborate with capitalists. So Chevez—as along as the price of oil is very high, they were able to get a lot of revenue.”
Other groups in attendance included Iranian-Americans with posters displaying the faces of political prisoners in Iran, and Sanctuary DMV , a volunteer group that works with migrants and illegal immigrants.
While communist and socialist regimes continue to oppress workers and entire nations to this day in places like China, Russia, North Korea, and Venezuela, free nations share May Day as a politically expedient day of protest for any cause on the Left. Whether you’re a socialist, communist, unionized teacher, totalitarian dictator, or running for president of the United States, International Workers’ Day has evolved over time into a holiday available for the popular political issue of the day.

Netflix’s ‘Knock Down The House’ Is A Campaign Contribution To AOC,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/netflixs-knock-down-the-house-is-a-campaign-contribution-to-aoc/,"By David Marcus May 3, 2019
This year streaming giant Netflix purchased the rights to the documentary “Knock Down the House,” conceived and created by Rachel Lears, for $10 million. The film follows four women running outsider far-left campaigns for Congress in the 2018 cycle.
The most notable of these women is current New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has become a household name and one of the most prominent Democrat members of the House. Netflix is now streaming a documentary that feels like a love letter to AOC. In fact, what it feels like even more is a political ad.
But you don’t have to take my word for it, just look at this tweet from Justice Democrats, the progressive PAC that was behind Ocasio-Cortez’s shocking underdog victory. If you were inspired by @knockdownmovie make sure to chip in a few bucks to support the work that goes on behind-the-scenes to support grassroots candidates like AOC.
We’re a small-dollar funded organization and are grateful for the support! https://t.co/ygOeBfmZaw
— Justice Democrats (@justicedems) May 2, 2019
Clearly Justice Democrats think the documentary is complimentary and glowing enough that they can use it to raise money for AOC and other far-left candidates. This makes a lot of sense since, according to a Vanity Fair profile of Lears last year, Justice Democrats was one of the organizations she went to in order to find the women candidates she would follow to speak truth to Donald Trump’s power.
Lears is quite candid that the film was conceived as a reaction to Trump’s election and as a way to highlight those who oppose him. This is not an objective examination of interesting subjects, but a product meant to promote these politicians and their messages. In this sense, both Lears, who raised $28,000 to fund the project, and Netflix, which paid $10 million for it, are contributing to the political fortunes of both Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats.
To be clear, this kind of contribution to a candidate is perfectly legal. The Supreme Court has been clear on this point, most recently in its Citizens United decision. An unkind movie about Hillary Clinton violated the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, caused that Supreme Court case in the first place. The court rightfully found that the government has no place stopping corporate entities from airing movies about political candidates.
The Supreme Court made the right decision, but of course that isn’t exactly how far-left Democrats look at it. No, they like to tell us, as often as possible, that corporate influence in our politics is a great scourge on our nation. However, the last time I checked, Netflix is itself a big ol’ corporation. Besides “Knock Down the House” Netflix is producing a series curated by Barack and Michelle Obama. So what gives?
Media and entertainment have always been a carve-out progressives use to approve of political corporate messaging they deem acceptable. Presumably, this is because it so often mirrors their own political ideologies and priorities. But if Netflix is and should be free to spend $10 million on “Knock Down the House” and offer it to millions of subscribers, why shouldn’t Citizens United be allowed to spend money to air a movie about Hillary Clinton?
It might be argued that Netflix is making these programming decisions based purely upon a profit motive and without a political purpose. This is almost impossible to really know, just as we don’t know exactly why social media companies disproportionately punish conservative accounts for supposedly violating their rules. But even if clicks were all Netflix cared about, it doesn’t matter. All kinds of corporate money in political messaging is spent based on a profit motive. A corporation might want lower taxes, or less regulation, or more regulation on competitors, so they support candidates and parties that align with their interest.
If Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats really believe corporations spending millions of dollars to push political ideas is a bad thing, they should condemn Netflix’s contribution to their political efforts, not use it to raise more coins for their coffers. But they don’t really believe that. They don’t really believe that corporations don’t have speech rights because they aren’t persons. They know that theater companies, universities, and Planned Parenthood, which are all corporations, have First Amendment rights. They just don’t like it when conservatives exercise those rights.
Netflix is every bit as much a corporation as any other corporation. And in streaming “Knock Down the House” it is clearly and decidedly benefiting the Justice Democrats’ political ambitions. That’s fine. They can do what they please. But the next time a conservative corporation wants to air a political ad or engage in political messaging, let’s not hear that big, moneyed interests should stay out of politics.

Do Androids Dream Of Humanity And Empathy?,thefederalist.com,Clay Waters,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/do-androids-dream-of-humanity-and-empathy/,"By Clay Waters May 3, 2019
Today I Am Carey is the debut novel of Martin L. Shoemaker, an expansion of his award-winning science-fiction short story “Today I Am Paul,” a warm tale about an android that mysteriously gains self-awareness as he assists a family dealing with an elderly grandmother suffering Alzheimer’s.
In the short story set in the near future, the family employs an android outfitted with new technologies of empathy and emulation, which enables it to play along with Mildred’s shifting, unpredictable memories. The android is able to change its features to emulate any members of the family that Mildred imagines she sees. It emulates her son Paul for most of the story, which explains the title.
After a tragedy, the android is accepted as part of the family and keeps the bonds of family memory alive by emulating the deceased Mildred, for the benefit of the granddaughter Millie. The optimistic, un-dystopian feel is refreshing, and the last line is lovely.
Unfortunately, the concept is stretched to novel length—65 chapters, all a variation of “Today I Am…”— and the results lean toward the sappy.
The “soft” science fiction of Today I Am Carey marks a change of pace for Baen Books, which tends toward military sci-fi (and is shunned by left-wing fandom for being the home of authors like John Ringo and Larry Correia). Carey is a hopeful domestic drama in the wistful, if sometimes overripe, tradition of Ray Bradbury.
The novel is delivered in the form of an internal journal, a literal day in the life from the caretaker android’s point of view, who early on is named “Carey” by Millie. Carey spends the novel puzzling out what has made him (Carey comes off as male) break his programming and display genuine sensitivity and kindness and above all, self-awareness.
As he tells Dr. Zinta Jansons, a.k.a. “Mom,” at the android lab, “somewhere in the interaction of those nets, ‘I’ engaged.” The science of Carey’s emergence as a personality of his own involves something about quantum entanglement that author Shoemaker perhaps wisely keeps vague, so Carey remains a mostly unexplained anomaly.
Family members grow up, get married, get old, and die, while Carey gets upgraded and becomes mildly obsolete, making for poignant asymmetry. The ravages of Alzheimer’s are portrayed honestly, with one character haunted by the genetic markers that show she will likely inherit the disease. Along the way, Carey performs a heroic rescue, makes sock monkeys for Millie, and puts on a juggling act.
Questions crop up about what makes us human: Can an android truly be kind, or is it just emulating kindness, and is there a difference in the end?
But the story doesn’t delve deeper. Potentially touchy subjects (do androids have souls? can they be “human” in a legal sense?) are not broached, as Carey’s journey to humanity is safely buffeted by well-meaning humans—too well-meaning to generate dramatic tension. And too obvious. When Carey befriends a former circus performer at an assisted living community, he comes out and tells Carey: “You care, I can tell.”
One problem is that Carey isn’t becoming fully human. To participate in the human condition comes with all the attendant weaknesses and besetting sins of envy and sloth and lust and greed; all the crooked timber of humanity. Save a brief bout of justified anger during a trip to Belize, Carey remains a perfect angel throughout.
Every garden needs a snake to keep readers on their toes. But there are no snakes, and only a few mild muffled rattles (like the trip to Belize) serve as threats. Shoemaker’s style is overly soft and spongy, making Carey’s thoughts seem bland. My dark heart longed for a little bloody-mindedness.
In robotics there is an “uncanny valley” hypothesis, which argues that in the range between “Robbie the Robot” unrealism on one end, and a robot indistinguishable from a human on the other, people feel the most disquiet toward a robot who looks and move almost, but not quite like, humans do. Android Carey falls into his own uncanny valley: He’s too bland and generic to be a compelling character, but not sufficiently utilitarian and rational to convincingly convey android behavior.
As generations age and pass on, mostly off-screen, Carey remains the faithful family caretaker. It’s nice to know that the future elderly (i.e., people like me) will be treated with dignity and respect, and perhaps not mocked for being Fox News’ main demographic. Sincerity is evident in Shoemaker’s self-described labor of “love,” which the novel’s acknowledgment page reveals is based on heart-wrenching personal experience.
But Shoemaker is vague about what this near-future looks like and how it works, besides noting that cars aren’t driven by humans much anymore. I would have liked to learn more about this world and watch how it evolves through Carey’s eyes, which would ground the reader more firmly in Carey’s reality.
Then, out of nowhere, in the very last chapter, as Carey himself ages, Shoemaker pulls a rabbit out of the hat, as all the character strands come together almost magically, and the book suddenly achieves the poignancy it had been struggling to capture.

Trump Should Stick To His Original Foreign Policy Instincts On Venezuela,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/trump-stick-original-foreign-policy-instincts-venezuela/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 3, 2019
When the bugle calls, Peter Hitchens once wrote, the conservative instinct is to rally around the tattered banner. Nowhere was it truer than the last few days, with Venezuela teetering on the brink of civil war. For all practical purposes, Juan Guaido, the suave Macronist liberal whom the West recognizes as the legitimate president of the oil-rich republic, was on the way to topple the Maduro dictatorship, flanked by dissident military men. But that didn’t work out.
What transpired since then is dodgy, but it appears the dissident military leaders and bureaucrats chickened out. In what looked like a replay of the failed coup attempt against Turkish despot Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the forces loyal to Maduro started to attack protesters. Foreign Policy reported that “the lack of any major military figures publicly casting their lot with the opposition should worry the opposition leader. He [Guaido] says he has military support behind the scenes, which could be critical to a democratic transition, but he has not produced solid evidence of it.”
The Atlantic confirmed the chaos, saying that “despite administration officials’ ominous mantra that ‘all options are on the table’ in Venezuela, they appear to have little appetite for taking military action,” adding that the Pentagon was not ordered to prepare for any military intervention. One Wrong Move Would Spell Chaos for Venezuela
This is by far the closest to an actual foreign policy crisis that Trump administration has faced yet. It is also the one for which a single misstep could cause total chaos. Naturally, there were prominent (and predictable) voices calling for an intervention. While Maduro is indeed a despotic ruler, we need to think hard before suggesting any further misadventure. Consider the questions one needs to ask before another military intervention, which will inevitably result in a regime change and a civil war.
First, what strategic interests are there for the United States in Venezuela? Venezuela is an oil-rich country, but it is also an economic basket case. There’s no unity in the political class, the military is pretty solidly behind Maduro, and no large-scale defections or popular uprisings are spontaneously happening that look likely to topple Maduro anytime soon. In fact, the regime is propped up by Cuban forces.
Consider the similarity to Iraq immediately post-intervention, and the entire Baathist military and bureaucracy disbanded and pushed underground, fueling insurgency with the support of Iran. In other words, a regime change is a recipe for insurgency and civil war.
Second, what are the intervention plans, and what about mission creep? Would we have an exit strategy and timeframe? There is, so far, no clear coherent plan adopted by the administration, nor is it even possible, because of the reasons mentioned above. Dictators often leave the country and retire with their millions, but that is when they see the situation is hopeless . In this case, the situation isn’t.
The same reason Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gadhafi chose to fight ’til the bitter end is the same reason Maduro would also not quit, and instead go down fighting a long civil war. He has no incentive to quit, and nowhere to retire with his millions. For good or for bad, he enjoys the support of almost half his country and most of his military forces, who would also go down with him but not before bogging Americans in another quagmire. There is naturally no short-term military solution to this conundrum. What Would We Do After Toppling Maduro?
The American military is, of course, fully capable of toppling Maduro and installing Guaido. But then what? At this point, there are no signs of large-scale military defection. Nor are there signs that the local powers, like Brazil and Colombia, are planning military action. This means toppling Maduro would require American armor and boots, a long civil war, and subsequent stabilization mission.
Our experience in regime change and nation-building in the last 15 years should give us pause. The only place where anti-Americanism is traditionally higher than the Middle East but remains dormant is in Latin America. As the entire continent organically and slowly moves right-wing, any heavy-handed approach would turn the clock back to its default Marxist radicalism.
The Monroe Doctrine is still active, and America is well within her rights to intervene if any other great power approaches and forms a base that can change the balance of power of the region. But 100 Russian military advisors don’t change the balance of power. It is not the Cuban missile crisis redux, and neither Russia nor China currently has any cross-continental power projection will or capability.
As Dan DePetris wrote recently , “The propensity in Washington on both sides of the aisle to take ownership of the Venezuela problem and fix it with an American-imposed solution must be tamped down in favor of the prudence and restraint so often thrown by the wayside. Emotion should not dictate policy.”
Venezuela is a humanitarian concern, not a strategic concern, a key difference that needs to be considered. It’s easy to sympathize and offer diplomatic support, aid, food, and even weapons. It’s entirely another thing to intervene militarily, and force regime change.
As I wrote before , the two local powers of Brazil and Colombia are the two most allied to the United States, and have conservative governments who oppose a Cuban satellite in Venezuela, and growing migration that is flooding their countries. If American diplomacy were really prudent and capable, they would buck-pass the intervention and security burden to local allies, and provide diplomatic and material support, but without any U.S. troop involvement. Let Brazil and Colombia topple Maduro and stabilize Venezuela, with America’s blessing—but without American guns.
John Quincy Adams said, “America is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will commend the general cause by the countenance of her voice, and the benignant sympathy of her example.” President Trump would do well to remember that.
He stands within the cusp of history, of being the first American president in more than a quarter-century to not have started an open-ended and costly so-called humanitarian intervention. He should trust his original electoral instincts and aspire to make that his legacy. There are genuine areas of threats to focus on instead, especially in Europe and Asia. Venezuela, behind the buffers of Colombia and Brazil, is not an existential threat to the United States.​ Sumantra Maitra is a doctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK, and a writer for The Federalist.

State Democrats Revolt Against National Leaders' Abortion Extremism,thefederalist.com,Marjorie Dannenfelser,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/state-level-democrats-revolt-national-leaders-abortion-extremism/,"By Marjorie Dannenfelser May 3, 2019
National Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to embrace radical positions on life issues. But grassroots Democrats are resisting the national party’s platform where the voters live: the states.
In 2019, prominent Democratic figures have gone to extremes to embrace fringe life-issue positions such as late-term abortions and infanticide. In January, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D–NY) signed a bill to cement the central holdings of Roe v. Wade as state law. In lockstep with other Democratic leaders, Cuomo deployed “health” as an undefined, catch-all term to open the door for abortion at any stage of pregnancy. Moreover, he repealed protections for infants born alive that formerly entitled them to all life-sustaining efforts.
Eight days later, Gov. Ralph Northam (D–VA) endorsed the removal of third-trimester abortion restrictions through labor and delivery. Northam argued that physicians should deliver the infant alive when the mother is in labor, then keep the infant comfortable, he said. Then, if the mother desires, physicians should resuscitate the child, or leave the child to die. He said at that point the physician and the mother should discuss how to proceed—i.e., whether to kill or care for the infant.
Merely 13 percent of Americans support national Democratic leaders’ position on third-trimester abortion. Nevertheless, Democratic presidential candidates Beto O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg favor third-trimester abortion. They aren’t alone on this in the Democratic presidential field.
On January 31, 2019, Sen. Ben Sasse (R–NE) introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Under the bill, infants born alive after surviving an attempted abortion are legal persons under American law and entitled to all legal protections thereunder. Moreover, the bill would entitle infants to the same level of care as any other patient.
However, Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate voted against the bill. Sens. Cory Booker (D–NJ), Kirsten Gillibrand (D–NY), Kamala Harris (D–CA), Amy Klobuchar (D–MN), Bernie Sanders (I–VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D–MA) voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Yet, 87 percent of Americans reject third-trimester abortions. Seventy-seven percent of voters support born-alive infant protections. Now grassroots Democrats are taking notice. Some Democrats, At the State Level, Have the Right Idea
In Ohio, all Democratic state senators approved a bipartisan resolution to urge the U.S. Congress to adopt Sasse’s Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. In New Mexico, legislators attempted to enact third-trimester abortion legislation similar to the proposals advanced in New York and Virginia. However, New Mexico’s Democrat-led Senate delivered a blow to the national party by voting against the measure.
North Carolina’s General Assembly passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on April 16, 2019. Four House and two Senate Democrats voted in favor of the bill. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed the measure. Republicans and supportive Democrats must seek additional support from other Democratic lawmakers to build a veto-proof super-majority.
Arkansas saw three Democrats join Republicans to pass the Cherish Act, which banned abortion after 18 weeks except in cases of rape and incest. Moreover, the Cherish Act required abortion providers to determine the unborn child’s probable gestational age prior to inducing or performing an abortion. Previously, Arkansas banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation in a mother’s womb.
Florida Democrat Kim Daniels voted to advance HB 1335 from the Judiciary Committee. HB 1335 requires minors to obtain parental or legal guardian consent prior to the abortion procedure. Minors may petition the corresponding circuit court and obtain court-appointed counsel to request that the court waive the consent requirement. HB 1335 has passed the Florida House and is pending in the state’s Senate.
In 2018, 27 percent of West Virginia Democratic lawmakers voted to place Amendment 1 on the ballot. Amendment 1 establishes that “nothing in the [West Virginia] Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of abortion.” West Virginians, a narrow majority of whom are registered Democrats, approved the amendment.
Rhode Island lawmakers are deliberating over H5125, which would codify Roe v. Wade ’s central holdings of abortion on request as state law. The bill advanced to the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee by a 44-30 margin. However, 22 Democratic state representatives voted against the bill, which faces another test in the Rhode Island Senate.
In Tennessee, Democratic state Reps. Joe Towns, John Windle, and John DeBerry voted in favor of HB 0077. Under HB 0077, abortion is prohibited once the unborn child’s heartbeat is detected, except in certain medical emergencies. The Tennessee Senate deferred the bill for a study. Towns’s vote irked Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Towns sought and received Planned Parenthood’s endorsement. Planned Parenthood revoked its endorsement of Towns and is pursuing a challenger to his seat.
Louisiana state Rep. Katrina Jackson, a Democrat, continues to challenge the national Democratic Party’s status quo. Jackson joined U.S. Rep. Daniel Lipinski (D–IL) as one of two elected, pro-life Democratic speakers at the 2019 March for Life.
Jackson sponsored Louisiana Act 620 in 2014. Under Act 620, Louisiana abortion providers must have admitting privileges at hospitals within 30 miles of their clinic. In February, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked Act 620 from going into effect, by a 5-4 vote. On April 17, 2019, the pro-abortion group Center for Reproductive Rights petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari. Jackson laid the groundwork for what may be the first major pro-life case heard by the new court. A Democratic Party Divided
Grassroots Democrats must come to terms with the national Democratic Party’s radical positions on life issues. Democratic leaders and presidential candidates continue to double down on late-term abortion on demand.
Infanticide is alarmingly close to becoming Democratic Party orthodoxy, if it has not already. But many grassroots Democrats continue to listen to their consciences and their constituents. More than three-quarters of voters support born-alive abortion protections. Meanwhile, 62 percent of voters oppose legislation that authorizes late-term abortions. And Americans increasingly identify as pro-life.
Life issues are not a Democrat or Republican issue. They are a bipartisan issue, and both sides are welcome to the right side of history. The gap between the extremism of the national leadership of the Democratic Party and the votes of the party grassroots across the country offers persuasive proof. Marjorie Dannenfelser is president of Susan B. Anthony List, a national pro-life organization dedicating to advancing leaders and pursuing policies to reduce and ultimately end abortion."
What Happens When An Artist Is Mugged By Identity Politics,thefederalist.com,Tony Daniel,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/what-happens-when-an-artist-is-mugged-by-identity-politics/,"By Tony Daniel May 3, 2019
Satirical novelist and sometime cultural geographer Bret Easton Ellis produced a podcast from 2014 to 2017 (and has continued it sporadically as a paid product ) in which he interviewed people in the Hollywood entertainment industry, where he now mostly makes his living. He has some excellent discussions with aging scriptwriters and movie directors such as Paul Schrader, Walter Hill, and Peter Bogdanovich. Ellis’s new book titled White is, for the most part, a compendium of the essay-length introductory pieces with which Ellis opens his podcast episodes, revised and topically arranged.
The theme is Ellis’s awakening awareness of, and growing repulsion to, woke culture. The perceptive reader will chuckle a bit (or perhaps experience a shudder of schadenfreude) at his seeming naivete, but for the most part, Ellis delivers a heartfelt defense of the good old days when free speech meant free speech, and people didn’t excuse atrocities like the murder of the Charlie Hebdo staffers with clouds of critical theory blather.
Because Ellis is mainly a creature of Hollywood now, there’s a great deal of movie discussion and analysis in White , along with reflection on the entertainment industry’s political antics in the past few years. There is also a big chunk of deadening material on what makes a good “gay” film, a discussion for which Ellis himself might be the only audience.
But the book gets good when Ellis opines on “Generation Wuss,” his term for so-called millennials, who simultaneously amuse and disgust him, and when he reflects on his own deracinated childhood in Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley, and the circumstances surrounding the writing of his novels Less Than Zero and American Psycho , among others . There’s also a nice bit on his influences, and I was not surprised to see Joan Didion as chief among them. The Identity Politics Trap
Ellis despises identity politics. “Across the board, identity politics endorse the concept that people are essentially tribal, and our differences are irreconcilable,” he says, “which of course makes diversity and inclusion impossible. . . it’s a trap.” And there seems to be no way out, even for a good old-fashioned liberal, “not even vehement liberalism could save you anymore, not in a tyrannical and oppressive Hollywood culture that was now dictating how we expressed ourselves as comedians, filmmakers, artists. Freedom of expression had become, it seemed, an aesthetic death wish, effectively suicidal.”
Ah, the pain of the liberal mugged by reality. Or, in this case, by Identity. How could the lefty book tribe, which celebrated the empty hedonism, sex, and drugs of Less Than Zero as a fun satire on the early 1980s and, let’s face it, a how-to manual for Gen X literary hipsters, turn so viciously on Ellis when he produced the far creepier and more prescient American Psycho ? Then, two decades later, Twitter, which seems ephemeral at first blush, turns out to be a version of eternal damnation for Ellis.
I have often been at odds with the notion that anyone could really, deeply care about a tweet in the first place. You tweeted, people screamed, people laughed, you shrugged, everyone moved on—that’s how I initially saw Twitter. But after a while I realized that Twitter actually encourages anger and despair—from the overly sincere, the virtue signaler, the ignorant, the literal-minded, the humorless.
The minor muggings continued in Ellis’s Hollywood hothouse. The first brouhaha Ellis chronicles in the book is his shunning by the organization GLAAD for not being a woke enough gay guy. The second is the reaction to Ellis tweeting in December 2012 that Kathryn Bigelow, director of The Hurt Locker , “would be considered a mildly interesting filmmaker if she was a man but since she’s a very hot woman she’s really overrated.”
Ellis later apologized to Bigelow in the pages of Vanity Fair for the mistaken perception (among the usual suspects) that the tweet was sexist. It is not, of course. It is what used to be called an “opinion.” Or, to put it the way we used to, “merely an opinion.” It’s not even an effective smart-aleck remark.
His point is that he thinks she is a mediocre talent who has been overvalued because she is good-looking. So what? Does that make her a mediocre talent? No, Bigelow does that well enough without the help of Ellis. It is the “good-looking woman” part of the tweet that offends, one imagines. Yet Bigelow cannot be called ugly by any standard, except maybe that of the creators of Dove soap commercials. It has ever been the case that good-looking people have an easier time in the world, at least before they make Strange Days or write Undertow . This most certainly applies to men, too.
It isn’t sexist to say so. It’s just — well, you know. Merely an opinion. The real point of the tweet is that Ellis didn’t think “The Hurt Locker” was particularly great, and that Quentin Tarantino, whom Ellis admires, should have won best director for “Inglorious Basterds” instead. (If Bigelow ever should have won, it ought to have been for wrangling Gary Busey in Point Break .) Lecturing the Enfant Terrible
Then there was the tweet from April 2011 stating that, although he liked “the idea of ‘Glee,’” watching an episode of the television show was like “stepping in a puddle of HIV.” That is an effective smart aleck critique. And fairly funny.
Ellis doesn’t necessarily label himself, but he has been in gay relationships for the past 30 years. He’s a gay guy. With an opinion. Because of this tweet, and others objecting to the stereotyping of gay men as “magic elves,” the organization GLAAD disinvited him from a dinner honoring, of all people, Bill Clinton.
To top it off, GLAAD asked him not to speak or write about the disinvite, but instead to sit down so they could explain to him what he’d done wrong. Did they not realize they were saying this to a man whose foundational artistic persona is the enfant terrible ? Ellis was never going to be lectured by the likes of them.
What GLAAD reinforces is the notion that gay men are oversensitive babies who need to be coddled and protected—not from the hideous anti-gay assaults in Russia, the Muslim world, China, or India, to name a few, but within domestic cultural sentiments. GLAAD was at the red-hot center for the creation of the magical elf as an absurdly high-minded and cutesy role model—hopefully a victim with great pecs—and had often applauded the stereotypes we saw paraded around in embarrassing queer movies and degrading retro sitcoms as ‘positive’ simply because they were, um, gay . All the while they conveniently disregarded the truth, that a silent majority of gay men actively loathed and resisted the caricatures on display.
In the past decade, particularly after the presidential election, Ellis has been on a journey from generally not caring about Hollywood political ranting to being forced to choose sides, to becoming an active rebel against conformity. For those of us outside the bubble, he provides a great deal of amusement at his self-congratulating discovery of the blindingly obvious. In the end, however, he is a real artist with good instincts who has the proper reaction to the totalitarian mindset that has taken hold of the entertainment and news industry in America: disdain.
Ellis claims to never have really been in the bubble himself. He says he had a presentiment President Trump would be elected because he had acquaintances who were planning to vote for Trump. He puts the split in his circle at about 55 percent Clinton to 45 percent Trump, which may seem remarkable for Hollywood, but not so remarkable when you factor in that Ellis, who is trying to get his own projects made, moves among not just performing artists and creative types, but also producers and film financiers—in other words, people who put the money in and stand to lose their shirts and more if a movie doesn’t turn a buck.
On the downside, Ellis often speaks in generational clichés and hypes up unexceptional truisms enough to make one cringe. Gen X. Boomers. Millennials. These categories are frequent placeholders for thought throughout White .
. . . they’d never really been loved by their own selfish narcissistic true-boomer parents, and who as a result were smothering their kids and not teaching them how to deal with life’s hardships about how things actually work: people might not like you, this person will not love you back, kids are really cruel, work sucks, it’s hard to be good at something, your days will be made up of failure and disappointment, you’re not talented, people suffer, people grow old, people die. And the response from Generation Wuss was to collapse into sentimentality and create victim narratives, instead of grappling with the cold realities by struggling and processing them and then moving on, better prepared to navigate an often hostile or indifferent world that doesn’t care if you exist. Victimization as a Drug
Much of White is melodramatic and overwritten. As an artist, Ellis does not seem to know when to shut up. He tells us that a boyfriend once referred to him as “Overdramatic Chipmunk,” after the meme making the rounds in 2006. One can see it in his prose. Yet he can surely turn a phrase, and his heart is in the right place: “I have to believe in free speech no matter what—that’s as simple and true as it gets.”
Also, in the spirit of Ellis’s confessional style of essay in which literally anything anybody says to him—whether in confidence or not—seems to be fair game for an anecdote, I would add that I had a good friend who was peripherally a part of Ellis’s Bennington clique during college, a group that included writers Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem. My friend had traveled a difficult road by the time I knew him in the ’90s and was sometimes a bit erratic to say the least, but Ellis was always kind to him and invited him to get-togethers. He impressed me with this loyalty and decency.
Ellis is certainly not a progressive. He most definitely has the woke mob’s number.
If you feel you’re experiencing ‘micro-aggressions’ when someone asks you where you are from or ‘Can you help me with my math?’ or offers a ‘God bless you’ after you sneeze, or a drunken guy tries to grope you at a Christmas party, or some douche purposefully brushes against you at a valet stand in order to cop a feel, or someone merely insulted you, or the candidate you voted for wasn’t elected, or someone correctly identifies you by your gender, and you consider this a massive societal dis, and it’s triggering you and you need a safe space, then you need to seek professional help. If you’re afflicted by these traumas that occurred years ago, and that is still a part of you years later, then you probably are still sick and in need of treatment. But victimizing oneself is like a drug—it feels so delicious, you get so much attention from people, it does in fact define you, making you feel alive and even important while showing off your supposed wounds, no matter how minor, so people can lick them. Don’t they taste so good?
Ellis claims not to be a conservative or libertarian, but a sort of apolitical artist type who has some conservative and some liberal beliefs. Most importantly, he is a proponent of freedom of speech as the foundation for a free society and for all artistic expression.
Nowadays, this, of course, makes him a conservative by dint of occupying the same beleaguered patch of ground as the rest of us in the sane remnant. Sorry about that, Bret.

The CBO Report On Single Payer Isn’t The One We Deserve To See,thefederalist.com,Christopher Jacobs,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/03/cbo-report-single-payer-isnt-one-deserve-see/,"By Christopher Jacobs May 3, 2019
On Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a 30-page report analyzing a single-payer health insurance plan. While the publication explained some policy considerations behind such a massive change to America’s health care market, it included precious few specifics about such a change—like what it would cost.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), perhaps single payer’s biggest supporter, serves as the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. If he asked the budget scorekeepers to analyze his legislation in full to determine what it would cost, and how to go about paying for the spending, CBO would give it high-priority treatment.
But to the best of this observer’s knowledge, that hasn’t happened. Might that be because the senator does not want to know—or, more specifically, does not want the public to know—the dirty secrets behind his proposed health-care takeover? Hypothetical Scenarios
The CBO report examined single payer as an academic policy exercise, running through various options for establishing and operating such a mechanism. In the span of roughly thirty pages, the report used the word “would” 245 times and “could” 209 times, outlining various hypothetical scenarios.
That said, CBO did highlight several potential implications of a single-payer system for both the demand and supply of care. For instance, “free” health care could lead to major increases in demand that the government system could not meet:
An expansion of insurance coverage under a single-payer system would increase the demand for care and put pressure on the available supply of care. People who are currently uninsured would receive coverage, and some people who are currently insured could receive additional benefits under the single-payer system, depending on its design. Whether the supply of providers would be adequate to meet the greater demand would depend on various components of the system, such as provider payment rates. If the number of providers was not sufficient to meet demand, patients might face increased wait times and reduced access to care.
The report noted that in the United Kingdom, a system of global budgets—a concept included in the House’s single-payer legislation—has led to massive strains on the health-care system. Because payments to hospitals have not kept up with inflation, hospitals have had to reduce the available supply of care, leading to annual “ winter crises ” within the National Health Service:
In England, the global budget is allocated to approximately 200 local organizations that are responsible for paying for health care. Since 2010, the global budget in England has grown by about 1 percent annually in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, compared with an average real growth of about 4 percent previously. The relatively slow growth in the global budget since 2010 has created severe financial strains on the health care system. Provider payment rates have been reduced, many providers have incurred financial deficits, and wait times for receiving care have increased.
While cutting payments to hospitals could cause pain in the short term, CBO noted that reducing reimbursement levels could also have consequences in the long term, dissuading people from taking up medicine to permanently reduce the capacity of America’s health-care market:
Changes in provider payment rates under the single-payer system could have longer-term effects on the supply of providers. If the average provider payment rate under a single-payer system was significantly lower than it currently is, fewer people might decide to enter the medical profession in the future. The number of hospitals and other health care facilities might also decline as a result of closures, and there might be less investment in new and existing facilities. That decline could lead to a shortage of providers, longer wait times, and changes in the quality of care, especially if patient demand increased substantially because many previously uninsured people received coverage and if previously insured people received more generous benefits.
That said, because the report did not analyze a specific legislative proposal, its proverbial “On the one hand, on the other hand” approach generates a distinctly muted tone. Tax Increases Ahead
To give some perspective, the report spent a whopping two pages discussing “How Would a Single Payer System Be Financed?” (Seriously.) This raises the obvious question: If single-payer advocates think their bill would improve the lives of ordinary Americans, because the middle class would save so much money by not having to pay insurance premiums, wouldn’t they want the Congressional Budget Office to fully analyze how much money people would save?
During his Fox News town hall debate last month, Sanders claimed a large show of support from blue-collar residents of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania for single payer. The ostensible support might have something to do with Sanders’ claim during the town hall that “the overwhelming majority of people are going to end up paying less for health care because they’re not paying premiums, co-payments, and deductibles.”
Where have we heard that kind of rhetoric before? Oh yeah—I remember:
At least one analysis has already discounted the accuracy of Sanders’ claims about people paying less. In scrutinizing Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign plan, Emory University economist Kenneth Thorpe concluded that the plan had a $10 trillion—yes, that’s $10 trillion —hole in its financing mechanism.
Filling that hole with tax increases meant that 71 percent of households would pay more under single payer than under the status quo, because taxes would have to go up by an average of 20 percentage points. Worse yet, 85 percent of Medicaid households—that is, people with the lowest incomes—would pay more, because a single-payer system would have to rely on regressive payroll taxes, which hit the poor hardest, to fund socialized medicine. Put Up or Shut Up, Bernie
If Sanders really wants to prove the accuracy of his statement at the Fox News town hall, he should 1) ask CBO to score his bill, 2) release specific tax increases to pay for the spending in the bill, and 3) ask CBO to analyze the number of households that would pay more, and pay less, under the bill and all its funding mechanisms.
That said, I’m not holding my breath. A full, public, and honest accounting of single payer, and how to pay for it, would expose the game of three-card monty that underpins Sanders’ rhetoric. But conservatives should keep pushing for Sanders to request that score from CBO—better yet, they should request it themselves.

Creative Project Brings Real-Life Holocaust Stories To Instagram,thefederalist.com,Daniella Greenbaum Davis,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/creative-project-brings-real-life-holocaust-stories-to-instagram/,"May 6, 2019 By Daniella Greenbaum Davis
If we held a moment of silence for every Jew brutally murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust, we would be silent for more than 11 years. That would be powerful, but it is, of course, entirely impractical.
As the survivor generation dies out, we have a special obligation to keep sharing their stories. On that, most decent people agree. But what is far from clear is the best mechanism by which to do that.
On Yom Hashoah in Israel, a particular way of honoring the murdered is incredibly poignant. A siren rings and life simply ceases. Traffic comes to a halt on streets and even on highways, and people get out of their cars, stand up, and pay their respects in silence. It’s chilling to watch.
But what about the international community? What new and creative ways can we use to educate a generation of people that is increasingly ignorant about the atrocities of the Holocaust? How can we educate people who will have never met a survivor? How do we keep things feeling personal and immediately relevant as time continues to pass?
The answer this year came from two people: Mati and Maya Kochavi. The father and daughter duo has taken the diary of Eva Heyman, a Jewish teenager who, not unlike Anne Frank, documented her experience in a journal, and transformed it into a series of Instagram stories. Kochavi told CNN they “were looking for a way to deal with Holocaust memory and manage this memory in a way that is going to be relevant for a younger generation today.”
The content of the stories are based on Eva’s diary pages. But the way they have been filmed and posted feels exactly like what you might expect had a teenage girl in the Holocaust somehow had access to an iPhone. The stories are not disappearing.

Critics have charged that the project dumbs down the Holocaust and belittles the most serious incident of genocide the world has ever seen. They’ve questioned the wisdom of making Instagram the vehicle to deliver this kind of powerful, haunting story.
But tech platforms like Instagram and Twitter are not inherently good or bad. They’re not inherently anything at all. Ultimately, it’s all about the content. And content can be anything; shallow and vapid or purposeful and important. This was the latter.
More importantly: Eva’s stories were already circulated through more traditional means. Her journal was published long ago. It never made anything close to the kind of impact this Instagram account has had in an incredibly short time. Younger Americans who are less likely to have ever met a survivor are incredibly likely to be on Instagram. There’s nothing gained by ignoring that sort of reality.
There’s incredible value in creative educational materials that reach audiences whom typical mediums might not otherwise reach. People seeking long historical reads about the horrors of the camps will always be able to find them. What’s important is that we create a kind of content that seeks out those unlikely to search out Holocaust materials themselves. And with rising anti-Semitism on both the left and the right, we shouldn’t be ruling out a single potential vehicle for education.

Report Omission Shows Mueller Was A Political Or Professional Hack,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/major-report-omission-shows-mueller-either-incompetent-political-hack/,"By Margot Cleveland May 6, 2019
Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s March “Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election” contains a glaring omission: Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.
But Mueller also did not charge Steele with lying to the FBI, or refer a criminal case against Steele to federal prosecutors, as he did when the special counsel uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct unrelated to the 2016 election. Given Mueller’s conclusion that no one connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election, one of those two scenarios must be true—either Russia fed Steele disinformation or Steele lied to the FBI about his Russian sources. Steele Openly Said He Got Info from Russians
The Steele dossier, which consisted of a series of memorandum authored by the former MI6 spy, detailed intel purportedly provided by a variety of Vladimir Putin-connected sources. For instance, Steele identified Source A as “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure” who “confided that the Kremlin had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.”
Other supposed sources identified in the dossier included: Source B, identified as “a former top-level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin”; Source C, a “Senior Russian Financial Officer”; and Source G, “a Senior Kremlin Official.” Steele also described a smattering of unlettered sources as a FSB Cyber Operative; a former Senior Intelligence Officer; a Senior Government Figure; “well-placed and established Kremlin source 1”; “well-placed and established Kremlin source 2”; a Kremlin official involved in U.S. relations; a Senior Russian leadership figure; and a Kremlin insider with direct access to leadership.
Steele first provided a summary of the Kremlin-supplied “intel” on Trump to the FBI in June or July 2016, when he met with his reputed handler, Rome-based FBI agent Mike Gaeta. In September 2016, Gaeta provided the dossier to agents working on the Russia collusion investigation at the FBI headquarters in Washington D.C.
The following month, the U.S. Department of Justice included details from the dossier in an application submitted to the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court and obtained a court order to surveil former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page. That FISA court order gave the Obama administration and career DOJ and FBI agents access to Page’s communications with Trump campaign officials prior to Page’s departure. Using Leaks to Seed News Stories
Leaks propelled the claimed collusion into the news. Steele shared details from the dossier with Michael Isikoff. Citing a “Western intelligence source,” Isikoff reported at Yahoo! News that “Page met with Igor Sechin, a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister,” and discussed the lifting of sanctions.
Government sources told Isikoff that Page’s activities in Russia had “been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election.” “After one of those briefings,” Isikoff wrote, “Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey, citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and ‘high ranking sanctioned individuals’ in Moscow over the summer as evidence of ‘significant and disturbing ties’ between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau.”
The DOJ later cited Isikoff’s article to support its FISA application to surveil Page. The application also detailed some of the impact this news story had on the Trump campaign: “Based on statements in the September 23, [Yahoo!] News Article, as well as in other recent articles published by identified news organizations, Trump’s campaign repeatedly has made public statements in an attempt to create the appearance of distance between Page and [Trump’s] campaign.”
Mueller’s report also acknowledged that the Steele dossier, and leaks about it, affected the Trump campaign. For instance, Mueller noted that “on October 11, 2016, Podesta stated publicly that the FBI was investigating Russia’s hacking and said that candidate Trump might have known in advance that the hacked emails were going to be released.” Additionally, Mueller highlighted the media’s questioning of vice presidential candidate Mike Pence concerning “whether the Trump Campaign was ‘in cahoots’ with WikiLeaks in releasing damaging Clinton-related information.”
Although Pence shot down the suggestion, responding, “nothing could be further from the truth,” the narrative dragged the Trump campaign up to election day—and a rabid portion of the populace continues to believe and peddle the Russian hoax. Yet Trump still solidly defeated Hillary Clinton. It Appears Russia Used Steele to Meddle in U.S. Elections
But Trump’s victory does not negate the reality that, assuming Steele truthfully relayed to the FBI and the media the intel his Russian sources provided, Russia interfered in the election by feeding Steele false intel about Trump.
Yet in the special counsel report, Mueller identified only two principal ways Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election: “First, a Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents.”
Surely, a plot by Kremlin-connected individuals to feed a known FBI source—Steele had helped the FBI uncover an international soccer bribery scandal—false claims that the Trump campaign was colluding with Russia would qualify as a “principal way” in which Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The Russia social media campaign to disparage Hillary Clinton wasn’t a patch on the plot the Kremlin launched to destroy Trump: It resulted not only in bad press, but also an investigation into the Trump campaign and the use of court-approved surveillance exposing campaign communiques.
Even though Mueller was authorized, as he put it in the special counsel report, to investigate “the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,” the report is silent of efforts to investigate Russia’s role in feeding Steele misinformation. Only the Senate Has Raised This Possibility
Little notice was made of Mueller’s apparent failure to investigate whether Russia interfered in the election by peddling phony intel to Steele that Steele relayed to the FBI, until Sen. Chuck Grassley raised the issue with Attorney General William Barr last week. During questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley pitched the issue as follows:
The Clinton campaign and the Democrat National Committee hired Fusion GPS to do opposition research against candidate Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, former British intelligence officer, to compile what we all know as the Steele dossier, that reportedly used Russian government sources for information. The Steele dossier was central to the now-debunked collusion narrative.
Now here’s the irony: The Mueller report spent millions investigating and found no collusion between Trump campaign and Russia but the Democrats paid for a document created by a foreign national with reported foreign government sources. Not Trump, but the Democrats. That’s the definition of collusion. Despite the central status of the Steele dossier to the collusion narrative, the Mueller report failed to analyze whether the dossier was filled with disinformation to mislead U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI.
“My question,” Grassley continued: “Mueller spent over two years and 30 million dollars investigating Russia interference in the election. In order for a full accounting of Russia interference attempts, shouldn’t the special counsel have considered whether the Steele dossier was part of a Russian disinformation and interfere campaign?”
Barr responded that he had “not yet had anyone go through the full scope of [Mueller’s] investigation to determine whether he did address or look at all into those issues,” before adding, “one of the things I’m doing in my review is to try to assemble all the existing information out there about it, not only for the Hill investigations and the OIG, but also to see what the Special Counsel looked into. So I really couldn’t say what he looked into.”
Later during the four-hour hearing, Sen. John Cornyn asked the attorney general, “how do we know that the Steele dossier is not evidence of a Russian disinformation campaign? Knowing what we know now that the allegations are unverified? Can we state with confidence that the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign?” Barr responded: “No, I can’t state that with confidence, and that is one of the areas that I’m reviewing. I’m concerned about it, and I don’t think it is entirely speculative.”
If Barr is concerned about it, why wasn’t Mueller? Any competent prosecutor would have investigated whether Russia peddled false intel to Steele. Or Maybe Mueller Investigated and Omitted the Results
Or did Mueller investigate this question? It’s possible, maybe even likely, given this acknowledgement in the special counsel report: “From its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI’s broader national security mission.” “During the Special Counsel investigation,” Mueller then explained, the FBI had embedded personnel “whose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send-in writing-summaries of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices.” Not all of the intelligence and counterintelligence information derived from the special counsel investigation was included in the report.
Here’s the clincher: Not all of the intelligence and counterintelligence information derived from the special counsel investigation was included in the report. Rather, as Mueller explained, the report contains only the “information necessary to account for the Special Counsel’s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation’s main factual results.”
This assertion is laughable given the special counsel’s report unnecessarily opined on whether Trump obstructed justice, but then failed to reach a “prosecution or declination decision,” as required by regulation. The more likely answer? Political expedience. After all, evidence that Russia interfered in the election by feeding the false collusion narrative to Steele would vindicate Trump, who has been screaming “Witch hunt” from day one.
Of course, there is another possibility: Steele could have invented his Russian sources and the “intel” they supposedly provided him. If so, Steele should have been charged with lying to the FBI. Yet Steele remains a free man, showing either Mueller is incompetent or a political hack. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Donald Trump’s Biggest Crime Was Winning The 2016 Election,thefederalist.com,Saritha Prabhu,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/donald-trumps-biggest-crime-winning-2016-election/,"By Saritha Prabhu May 6, 2019
Donald Trump’s biggest crime was winning the 2016 election. For our political and media elite in the Beltway, that was the catastrophic, unforgivable crime, from which all the other (imaginary) crimes they now pursue him for originated.
How dare he win that election? Didn’t he know the election belonged to Hillary Clinton, who’d been building up to this very moment for three decades, courting every relevant constituency, remembering every useful politician’s birthday, and being as banal as possible to check everyone’s “lesser political evil” box?
How dare he win the election on his very first try? If you scratch the surface, jealousy is one of the driving emotions among Washington’s elite against Trump and his electoral success. He achieved what many career politicians would die and sell their souls multiple times for. And Trump did it seemingly casually, almost effortlessly. How dare he? He must have stolen the election!
How dare he win that election with a shoestring budget and a ramshackle campaign apparatus? How dare he win without an army of consultants, strategists, advisers, pollsters, and fancy data interpreters? Didn’t he understand that our elections are an excellent jobs program for thousands of political operatives and media types?
How dare he win the old-fashioned way: you know, by having a simple, direct message; recognizing heartland voters’ economic woes; and campaigning in that retail-politics way of his? Didn’t he know that 21st-century elections are now won with Big Data, microtargeting of voters, and media-hyped candidates?
How dare he lie and exaggerate in that crude, undisciplined way of his? Doesn’t he know that Washington likes their liars to be polished prevaricators who know how to couch their fabrications in think-tankese?
To add insult to injury, how dare he win by just saying what he (and millions of ordinary voters) thinks? That’s just not done. Didn’t he appreciate that Presidential Campaign-Speak is an art unto itself—something that has been focus-grouped, poll-tested, script-driven, platitude-filled, that’ll give no offense whatsoever to any identity group in America, and bores listeners to tears. How dare Trump riff offhand and entertain voters? The gall of the man!
How dare he say obvious, common-sense things like spending blood and treasure on Middle Eastern quagmires isn’t okay anymore, that America can’t afford to be the world’s security underwriter anymore, that our global trade deals have shafted American workers for too long? Who does he think he is?
Doesn’t he know that on the issues of the day, he needs to consult our over-credentialed, corrupt, and inefficient elites before he says anything? And doesn’t he know that the solution to every issue in our politics is counter-intuitive now: Up is down, war is peace, more illegal immigration is good, and having a wall on our southern border is bad.
How dare he care about ordinary American workers in the Rust Belt? Doesn’t he know that we live in a global economy now, and those Americans are toast? Dang Trump for forcing us to pretend we care about those white working-class voters Democrats had snookered for so long. Thanks to Orange Man, we now have to cater to the very people we despise and who cling bitterly to their God, guns, and religion.
And for God’s sake, doesn’t he know that caring about one’s nation and its citizens is passé? It’s all global now! Pretend-caring in a vague, generalized, feel-good way about global citizens while getting richer off their cheap labor is the fashion now.
For all his flaws, Trump is the best thing to have happened to our ossified, corrupt national politics. He ripped the mask off our political and media establishments. His election victory exposed the empty-souled hypocrites in the establishments of both parties and the national media who shill for them. He is the much-needed human defibrillator to the American political system.
What our ruling elites used to have (and lost) after the 2016 election was a powerful sense of control over our politics. Like millions of voters who are outside the hardcore Democratic base, I’ve been enjoying the primal scream emanating from the ruling and media elite. I may not like or agree with everything Trump does, but the spectacle of jittery, grasping-at-anything-and-everything elites has been enjoyable to watch.
With his unpredictable, heterodox ways of policy-making and communicating to the masses, Trump has, in some ways, neutered the media elite. What we have been seeing for the last two-and-a-half years is nothing but revenge on steroids: For the crime of winning the 2016 election, the elites have pinned all manner of crimes on Trump, hoping something will stick.

Media Lies About Trump To Cover Up Brutality Of Late-Term Abortion,thefederalist.com,Rebecca Downs,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/media-lies-trump-cover-brutal-reality-late-term-abortion/,"The Cut’s “ Trump’s Lies About Abortion Keep Getting More Disturbing ,” by Hannah Gold
Many of these articles repeat the same falsehoods. Vesoulis’ article for Time is particularly bad, since 9 percent of abortions are committed during or after the second trimester, when the baby is between 14 and 27 weeks old and can sometimes be born as a preemie. Vesoulis instead focuses on the 1.2 percent of abortions committed during the third trimester, which is the point at which most unborn babies can be saved through a C-section or induced labor. Going by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures , Vesoulis is really talking about 56,797 abortions, which suddenly doesn’t seem so rare.
Vesoulis also claims that late-term abortions “mostly happen because of a serious fetal anomaly or for the health of the woman.” It is an oft-repeated claim and also a misleading one. The Guttmacher Institute and a study conducted from 2008-2010 found that most late-term abortions are performed on healthy women with healthy fetuses.
Women who sought these procedures were more likely to be young, minority women with limited financial resources. Reasons given were more logistical than medical. They may have aborted because they didn’t know they were pregnant until later in their pregnancy, had trouble deciding, or had trouble making arrangements.
The claim that many late-term abortions are performed on women who face medical problems is also turned on its head when medical professionals, including former abortionists , acknowledge that abortion is never medically necessary. In cases of medical emergencies, a child may be delivered by a C-section.
But these mainstream media outlets should not even need to discuss abortion numbers because legislation that has been considered at the state and federal levels, as emphasized by the bill’s sponsor, U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, does not seek to regulate or restrict abortion. It merely requires that babies born alive from abortion attempts receive the same medical care as those born at that gestation for whom parents will take responsibility. Once a child is born, no distinction is made between whether the child is wanted or unwanted.
Another claim from the media is that babies are rarely born alive from an abortion procedure. So? Proper care should still be given even if it is just one baby who is born alive. An Associated Press article writes that “ Wisconsin health officials lack data on abortion survivals .” By that admittance, shouldn’t doctors err on the side of protecting babies who are born alive?
The article even acknowledges that “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded 143 instances nationwide in which live births were caused by an attempted abortion between 2003 and 2014,” which means some of those live births could have resulted in babies being left to die. States aren’t even required to report their abortion numbers to the CDC, so it stands to reason that failed abortion attempts would be even more so covered-up.
It’s not merely the CDC that has evidence of babies born alive from abortion attempts. If congressional findings , personal testimonies , and stories shared by abortion survivors aren’t proof that babies are born alive, it’s worth wondering what would be.
That the mainstream media sees such a need to supposedly correct the record makes it all the more important for those of us who know better to speak up about the truth. The mainstream media is complicit in failing to protect the truly most innocent, vulnerable, and defenseless among us.

The Dark Power Of Anthony Jeselnik's 15-Minute Abortion Joke,thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/06/the-dark-power-of-anthony-jeselniks-new-abortion-bit/,"May 6, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
The last bit in Anthony Jeselnik’s new Netflix special, his grand finale, could never have been about removing a mole. That it was actually a decadent, 15-minute joke about abortion is something of a statement on both Jeselnik’s deadpan act and the issue itself.
The joke is a story. Jeselnik regales viewers with a tale of his trip to an abortion facility, escorting a friend to her procedure (which actually happened ). “Don’t worry guys—wasn’t my baby, wasn’t important,” he assures the audience.
That follows some 40 minutes of quick hits like, “When I was a kid, my family used to move around a lot. But now they’re all fat as f-ck,” which was immediately preceded by, “I think, like a lot of guys, I’ll never forget the one time I saw my dad’s penis. I said, ‘Dad, don’t text me sh-t like that.’”
Jeselnik’s delivery is sadistically slow, and the stream of disjointed jokes pulled from one template gets exhausting. Even so, the comedian’s unwavering commitment to his bad-guy act feels refreshing amid a sea of stand-ups confusing themselves for superheroes. He never breaks character, even when he breaks the fourth wall. (Jeselnik looks directly into the camera more than once.)
This is solidified somewhere in the middle of his set, when Jeselnik savagely mocks the trend of stand-ups breaking for a Very Serious political interlude mid-special (a tactic frustratingly espoused by his ex-girlfriend Amy Schumer). After a long build-up about the importance of comedians “speaking truth to power,” he says, “My biggest pet peeve in America today is people will see all this horrible stuff going on and yet they still overreact to sh-t that just does not matter.”
“For example,” says Jeselnik, “have you ever dropped a baby?”
He never drops the persona. And the persona is a terrible human. Actually that’s his punchline, engaging the audience in an escalating game of “How bad can this guy get?”
Apparently bad enough to spend a long 15 minutes making light of abortion, which wouldn’t actually be funny if everyone agreed abortion were totally casual. Like a bit earlier in the set that saw Jeselnik rank different forms of suicide, this one is predicated on the callousness of the narrator. But what’s there to be callous about if it’s just a clump of cells?
The story’s darkness mirrors the darkness of the issue. Describing the abortion facility, Jeselnik jokes, “The whole place is filled with kids for some reason. I mean, I thought they were kids. Turns out they were just ghosts.” When informed by a Google search that a succulent is the best gift to give someone after an abortion, he demurs. “I would never be like, ‘Oh, here you go, Jessica. Here’s something else you never have to take care of.”
It’s grim. And it could never have been about a mole removal. The joke works because Jeselnik’s lack of sensitivity is laughably inhuman. (“For Jessica, With Love,” a dedication screen reads after the set.)
What’s so inhuman about having some fun with a harmless medical procedure? The bit isn’t exactly pro-life, yet it relies on the notion that abortion is difficult. But why should it be if there’s no value in what’s being extinguished?
Jeselnik’s willingness to go there with his act, rather than clumsily chase wokeness points for whatever vain reason, preserves the important tradition of stand-ups debasing themselves for the sake of comedy, not posturing as moral champions. That’s an important tradition because it creates the contrast that helps us more clearly distinguish good from bad. It’s also much funnier.
“Fire in the Maternity Ward,” as the special is titled, ends with Jeselnik recalling an interaction with a woman who stood up at a recent show to say, “Excuse me, Anthony, but what the f-ck is so funny about abortion?”
“Lady, I just told you,” was his response. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."
Rep. Ilhan Omar Supports Group That Produced Child Beheading Skit,thefederalist.com,Patrick Poole,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/rep-ilhan-omar-supports-group-that-produced-child-beheading-skit/,"By Patrick Poole May 7, 2019
Shocking footage uncovered by the Investigative Project last week shows a skit produced by the Muslim American Society (MAS) in Philadelphia showing children calling for martyrdom as soldiers in the “army of Allah” and threatening to behead their enemies and subject them to “eternal torture” to wrest Jerusalem from Jewish control.
The horrific MAS-Philly children’s skit was posted to their Facebook page and shows a choreographed production as part of the group’s April 17th “Ummah Day” pageant dedicated to supporting jihad to control Palestine. A MAS statement on Friday said the songs and poems the children recited exhorting violence and terrorism were an “unintended mistake” and attributed the incident to a vetting error.
MAS has 42 chapters across the United States. A 1997 FBI file obtained by Judicial Watch identifies MAS as the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States controlled by Hamas sympathizers “known to conduct firearms and other military type training.” A Justice Department filing (p. 58, fn. 13) in a terrorism-related case states that “MAS was founded as the overt arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in America.” A September 2004 Chicago Tribune investigative report revealed that MAS had been founded by Muslim Brotherhood leaders, adopted the group’s strict code for secrecy, and promoted Islamic supremacy.
The article interviewed one former MAS member who explained the group’s vision for Islamic rule in America: “It would convert Americans to Islam and elect like-minded Muslims to political office.” Even more shocking is that freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar (D–MN), of other recent controversies , has openly supported MAS.
In fact, Omar’s support for MAS goes back years. Her deep ties to the group were on display when she had the MAS-Minnesota chapter Oresident Asad Zaman stand with her as she was ceremonially sworn into the Minnesota House of Representatives in January 2017 with her hand on an enormous Quran. MAS held a reception in honor of her inauguration.
Just a few months later, Omar spoke at the 2017 MAS “Muslim Day” at the state capitol, acknowledging that she had previously participated in the group’s annual event before. Omar was subsequently elected to Congress in November 2018, succeeding former representative and now Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who had his own ties to MAS.
In fact, Ellison was the subject of a House Ethics investigation after MAS-Minnesota paid for his 16-day trip to Mecca in 2008. At first, Ellison had attempted to conceal the sponsors of the trip, and a senior MAS official had initially denied the group’s involvement.
The MAS-Minnesota chapter both Omar and Ellison have supported has a long history of controversy. The group gained national attention in 2007 when they issued a fatwa authorizing Muslim taxi cab drivers at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to deny service to non-Muslim passengers with seeing-eye dogs or who were carrying alcohol.
As I reported in May 2009, the MAS-Minnesota’s Vice President Hassan Mohamud had published a YouTube fundraising video decrying the “hell of living in America,” and had defended Palestinian suicide attacks. When questioned by the local Minneapolis Fox News affiliate about his remarks, Mohamud claimed that he didn’t mean anything anti-American by describing the United States as “hell.” When asked about his statements in support of suicide bombings, he had to stop the interview on three separate occasions and consult with his attorney.
That incident was shortly after a local Somali reporter had identified Mohamud and his mosque as radicalization incubators following the disappearance of dozens of young Somali men, who left the country for Somalia to join the Al-Shabaab terrorist group. In an interview with USA Today, Mohamud denied any radical preaching or that any of the terror recruits had been involved in his mosque.
Yet Mohamud was again tied to a terror recruiting case after five men from the Twin Cities were arrested attempting to fly to Turkey to join the Islamic State in Syria. In March 2016, Justice Department prosecutors asked the court to disqualify Mohamud from the defense team of one of the men, telling the judge that they intended to introduce testimony during the trial of a witness claiming Mohamud had been preaching jihad and making other extremist statements. This disclosure prompted another member of the defense team to move to withdraw from the case.
This raises questions about why Omar has openly supported an organization with a long reported record of supporting terrorism and violence, as exhibited most recently by the shocking children’s pageant in Philadelphia last month. When she previously accused American Jews of dual loyalties, drawing accusations of anti-Semitism by leading Democrats, why would she have willingly associated herself with an organization that the FBI has identified for at least two decades as a front for the Muslim Brotherhood?

Pennsylvania state Rep. Brian Sims is best known for responding to a visit from Vice President Mike Pence to his city by raising his middle finger and saying , “To be clear, we’re a City of soaring diversity…So keep that in mind while you’re here raising money to attack more families, spread more lies, blaspheme with your bible, and maybe even talk to a woman without your wife in the room.” He ended his post declaring, “So…get bent, then get out!”
LGBT media cheered on the display of “resistance” during gay pride month. Then, just a few days ago, Sims filmed himself berating an elderly woman who stood in front of Philadelphia’s Planned Parenthood quietly praying. In a tweet posting his video he said , “Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame. They’re racist, classist, bigots who NEED & DESERVE our righteous opposition. Push back, please! #YouAreStrongEnough.”
He then began recording the woman while asking his followers to donate $100 to Planned Parenthood for every hour she stood praying. He approached her and asked, “How many children have you clothed today? How many shoes have you put on children today? How many have you fed? Or have you spent all day standing outside Planned Parenthood shaming people for what they have a constitutional right to do?” The woman ignored him and continued praying.
For nine minutes Sims berated the woman with growing aggressiveness, calling her a “racist,” “disgusting,” and referring to her as an “old white lady” who is telling people what they can do with their bodies. As of this writing, the video has nearly 600,000 views. Push back against Planned Parenthood protestors, PLEASE! They prey on young women, they use white privilege, & shame.

Writing for a local Philadelphia paper in response, Christine Flowers argues correctly , “I am extremely troubled by the fact that a man who is paid by our tax dollars feels it is appropriate to publicly shame one of those taxpayers just because he disagrees with her.”
In a previous video Sims approached four women praying outside the Planned Parenthood and told his followers he would give anyone who could identify them $100. He then berated the peaceful protesters as not being real Christians. They tried to explain their purpose, but he ignored them. Pennsylvania REPRESENTATIVE @BrianSimsPA chooses to REPRESENT the 182nd district by targeting MINORS. Offering $100 to anyone who doxes them.

The pro-life organization Live Action posted the video to their followers saying , “WATCH: Pennsylvania State Representative @BrianSimsPA harasses an elderly woman who is peacefully advocating for the lives of preborn human beings and women who are considering abortion. This is shameful.” Sims responded , “Bring it, Bible Bullies! You are bigots, sexists, and misogynists and I see right through your fake morals and your broken values. #BeReal.”
After a great deal of backlash he defiantly posted , “‘Don’t discriminate against our discrimination. Don’t bully our bullies. Don’t hate our haters.’ – [P-ssy] Grabbers and Baby Cagers.” This has become a common response to overt bigotry from the left, especially within LGBT circles. They view any response to “bad” people as justified. This angry, aggressive, and abusive mindset drives much of LGBT advocacy today.
In an interview in April, Sims ironically said , “In my six years in government as a civil rights attorney, LGBTQ advocate, and activist, I learned one thing that I think makes for good government: it’s empathy. It sounds kind and sweet to hear a cis white man say that, but what I mean is the more the substance of empathy. Empathy is about putting yourself in somebody else’s shoes. And being a good legislator is about having the ability to do that.”
From those with Sim’s perspective, the world is divided into good and bad people and it is the responsibility of the good people to shame and shun the bad ones. When he sees an elderly lady praying quietly to herself, he sees what he believes to be an oppressive movement designed to harm others. He feels justified in hostility because he believes her very existence is hostile to others. He genuinely believes he is fighting for the right cause in the strongest way possible for people he views as vulnerable and attacked. He simply cannot imagine empathy for anyone he determines is a “bad” person. This Will Obviously Backfire on Gay People
In 2018 after Sims won re-election, LGBTQ Nation gushed, “Sims, a liberal firebrand, is known for his nonstop advocacy for LGBTQ rights and his unique take on politics. He’s popular on social media and in queer media.” In another LGBT media profile, Queerty began an interview with the author musing , “Brian Sims reminds me of that older next-door neighbor gay kids might have had crushes on in elementary school: sexy and smart, and so friendly we almost didn’t feel like outcasts when we were in his presence. And like those guys, our imaginations would run to the impossible dream: If only a man like that could be gay.”
Sims’s aggressive and hostile interactions with anyone who challenges him, or whom he views as a “bigot,” is reminiscent of the early days of the gay rights movement. For many gay people, this in-your-face, open rage, and bullying is a sign of strength and progress.
While Sims may believe he is fighting for what is right and may indeed be helping a great many people, he does not realize, or possibly care, the damage he is doing to the movement. Unfortunately, none of the current generation of LGBT activists does.
Despite the glory of movies and historical revisionism of a heroic, rebellious LGBT movement, to most people these kinds of tactics come off as arrogant bullying. Angry protestors screaming insults and shouting profanity is not appealing to anyone outside of the movement. It is not a show of strength, and it is certainly not effective in winning people over. In truth, it is more likely to energize an otherwise tolerant population into opposition. This Is Not How to Advocate for Gay Rights
What does it mean to be an LGBT rights advocate today? From what we see most often, it appears to require a great deal of anger, hostility, and self-righteous intolerance. This is not merely a biased opinion of political opponents, it just seems to be the way the left chooses to promote LGBT people in media.
It also appears to be a narrow generational mentality in current LGBT leadership. Last-generation LGBT advocates like Ellen DeGeneres and RuPaul embraced society’s curiosity and discomfort. They used humor, empathy, and personality to allow the broader population to wade in gently and get a good look around at what gay mainstream culture had to offer. Instead, today’s LGBT leaders are harsh, full of rage and indignation, and eager to start a fight and demonize their opponents.
LGBT advocacy today comes from a place of rage and hatred. It is built on the assumption that to achieve equality, advocates must break through the doors, intimidate the naysayers, and take over the loudspeakers. It is a movement of obnoxious lecturing, silencing, intimidation, bullying, and bitter rage that does little more than validate their prejudices.
It is undermining, with dynamite, the foundation Ellen and RuPaul built carefully just a few decades ago, and it is creating animosity in otherwise polite people. No one should praise an adult man for harassing an elderly woman or attempting to publicly humiliate and intimidate several women peacefully praying on the sidewalk, no matter how passionately he opposes their beliefs.
More importantly, our elected leaders should be held to a higher standard and should not harass citizens practicing their civil rights. If Sims’s driving goal is empathy, he needs to genuinely address his own deeply held bigotry and speak to those he disagrees with, not shout at and shame them on camera. If LGBT people want to keep the social acceptance they’ve fought so long for, they need to stop promoting such hateful voices as their leaders as well.

"Kicking People Off Online Platforms Is About Control, Not Free Speech",thefederalist.com,Warren Henry,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/kicking-people-off-online-platforms-control-not-free-speech/,"By Warren Henry May 7, 2019
Last week, Facebook banned Alex Jones, InfoWars, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer, Paul Nehlen, and Louis Farrakhan, setting off further discussion about the scope of free speech on the internet. Yet the debate over de-platforming is much more about control than freedom of speech.
After all, many on the right are ambivalent, caught between the free speech ethos and the “leave private businesses alone” ethos. Moreover, most of the pro-speech people would not argue for pornography to return to Twitter or YouTube, or that disrupting Islamic State recruitment on Facebook is a bad thing.
Instead, de-platforming is the high-tech version of an older complaint on the right: Big Media, run by the establishment, invariably seeks to marginalize and curate conservatism on their platforms. This debate used to be about broadcast TV; now it is about social media.
Similarly, de-platforming supporters may say they are solely concerned with removing only the most toxic actors from the public discourse to prevent harassment and harm to others. If this were true, they would care more about solutions targeting the platforms in the darker corners of the internet, where radicalization and incitement to violence are at their worst.
Furthermore, the establishment’s standards for toxic speakers are as slippery and selectively applied as always, whether on social or traditional media. Granted, Farrakhan is not actively platformed by legacy media companies. He is also sufficiently toxic that Democrats and progressives have tried to keep their relationships with him very hush-hush.
But The Atlantic published an apologia for these relationships, only to label Farrakhan as a “ far-right ” extremist after the Facebook ban. The Washington Post tried the same stunt before getting shamed into a correction . Media Matters omitted Farrakhan from their coverage like he was Leon Trotsky (they were also shamed into a stealth edit ).
The establishment media promotes Farrakhan’s progressive supporters, like Women’s March leaders Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour (the latter ultimately rejected Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic statements — while defending the anti-Semitic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement). For a long time, the establishment media was uninterested in reporting on these relationships.
Conservative media and Jewish media helped put the story on the public radar, but it was probably people at establishment outlets—notably Bari Weiss at The New York Times and Meghan McCain on “The View”—who made it impossible to ignore. The left grumbles about Weiss and McCain having access to establishment platforms (and tries to stop people like Kevin Williamson and Sarah Isgur Flores from similar access), a measure of how much the center-left wants to assert its old exclusionary function.
The establishment also provides a platform to the Rev. Al Sharpton , whose public notoriety was built on a hate crime hoax, incitement to racial violence and anti-Semitism. And he offered no apologies when The New York Times undertook to give him a media makeover. Yet MSNBC puts him on the air to shamelessly lecture on, among other subjects, hate crimes in the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting . Democratic presidential candidates breakfast with him and kiss his ring, and the establishment thinks nothing of it.
When MSNBC is not presenting an infamous race-hustler as a moral exemplar, the channel spends time pushing various conspiracy theories, usually involving President Trump and Russia. For example, Lawrence O’Donnell floated the theory that Russia had orchestrated a chemical attack in Syria so Trump could appear to distance himself from Vladmir Putin. Their premiere personality, Rachel Maddow , continues to air wild-eyed conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia, even after Special Counsel Robert Mueller failed to find evidence that would support a charge of conspiracy or coordination.
More generally, the establishment that condemned candidate Trump for suggesting the 2016 election might get rigged continues to platform Hillary Clinton , Rev. Jesse Jackson , Sen. Sherrod Brown , former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams , and a host of others who claim without evidence that elections were stolen from Democrats.
When Rep. Steve King (R-IA) defended the terms “white supremacist” and “white nationalist” during a New York Times interview (he claims his words were deceptively edited), the House GOP caucus stripped him of committee assignments and supported a resolution of disapproval naming him. When. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) engaged in a series of anti-Semitic slurs, House Democrats decided to treat her as a martyr and pass a resolution condemning bigotry in general without naming her. Omar retained her seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee and continues to support the Hamas-led government in Gaza .
Speaking of Omar, she can quite fairly complain that American Muslims should not be required to ritually denounce acts of terror by radical Islamic groups around the world. Yet Omar and a broad swath of the establishment insinuates the right is generally guilty by association with the alt-right, even explicitly smearing people like Ben Shapiro as such. They also want to blame the right generally by extension for threats and violence by white nationalists and those adopting far-right conspiracy theories, in the hope of tightening the circle of what is considered permissible public debate.
Graeme Wood recently observed that this focus on far-right ideological extremism comes after years of the establishment downplaying or ignoring the role of radical Islamic theologies in motivating terror attacks here and abroad. Likewise, the establishment did not work themselves into an illiberal lather demanding the suppression of speech when left-wing activist James Hodgkinson shot U.S. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, U.S. Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner, congressional aide Zack Barth, and lobbyist Matt Mika at a congressional baseball practice.
As columnist Megan McArdle observed as long ago as 2010: “It’s obviously no surprise that the lunatic BS of our own side doesn’t strike us nearly as forcefully as the absolutely appallingly unforgiveable wingnuttery of the opposition.”
Those criticized here may dismiss the critique as “whataboutism.” But no one need defend any of the people recently de-platformed by Facebook or Twitter to understand that the debate is really about an establishment desperate to regain the gatekeeping power they believed they lost as a result of satellite technology and the internet.
That is ultimately an illusion: de-platform enough mainstream righties and (a) social media companies risk losing the network effect at the heart of their dominance; and (b) some corporation like Fox would fill the market niche with another social network. But it is a fiction too pleasant for the establishment to let go of it. Warren Henry is the nom de plume of an attorney practicing in the State of Illinois. "
"If Hong Kong Passes Extradition Bill, The Freest City In Asia Will Slowly Die",thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/hong-kong-passes-extradition-bill-freest-city-asia-will-slowly-die/,"By Helen Raleigh May 7, 2019
Lam Wing-Kee, a well-known book seller, recently moved to Taiwan because he no longer feels safe in Hong Kong, a city he loved and where he spent most of his life. He fears that if Hong Kong’s new extradition bill becomes law, Beijing would want him extradited to the mainland because of the kind of books he sells. Hong Kong and mainland China don’t currently have an extradition treaty, but a new bill seeks to change that.
Lam isn’t being paranoid. He is known to sell gossip books full of unverified details of the corruption and abuse of power by top mainland Communist leaders, including China’s President Xi Jinping. In 2015, he suddenly disappeared, along with several Hong Kong publishers. Clueless families and friends only learned later that Lam was detained by mainland police while crossing the mainland-Hong Kong border. Lam was never officially charged and was released after eight months of what he described as “mental torture” in a mainland detention facility. You can’t blame him for not wanting to go through this ordeal again.
The fact that a long-time Hong Kong resident doesn’t feel his rights to freedom of expression and due process are protected in Hong Kong anymore says a lot about Hong Kong’s decline from once being the freest city in Asia. Right before the United Kingdom’s government officially handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997, the Hong Kong legislature passed an extradition law, which prohibits the city from surrendering criminal suspects to “any parts of China.” According to the “one country, two systems” agreement between Great Britain and Beijing, Hong Kong is supposed to maintain its independent judicial system for 50 years.
Hong Kong’s independent judicial system enables it to establish extradition treaties with more than 20 countries, including the United States. Most of these countries do not have extradition treaties with mainland China because they are concerned that suspects, especially those Beijing deems political troublemakers, will not receive due process or a fair trial on the mainland. These countries were assured by Hong Kong authorities that criminal suspects extradited to Hong Kong will not be passed on to mainland China.
Hong Kong’s independent judicial system also ensures that Hongkongers enjoy a level of political freedom that is beyond reach for mainland Chinese. This is a political oasis for dissenting Chinese. Since 1997, it has been the only place in China where certain political activities deemed “criminal” by mainland authorities are still legal and permissible, including pro-democracy protests and the annual candlelight vigil commemorating victims of 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre . Such activities have annoyed Beijing to no end. Beijing Will Have Hong Kong in the End
As mainland China becomes rich and powerful, Beijing has become less tolerant about Hong Kong’s “differences” compared to the rest of China and has sought to exert a greater degree of control. In recent years under the assertive President Xi, Beijing has felt emboldened to send mainland Chinese police to Hong Kong to arrest Hong Kong booksellers and a Chinese tycoon , bypassing Hong Kong’s own judicial system.
Hongkongers are deeply unhappy about both incidents because they think Beijing is breaking its promise to respect Hong Kong’s judicial independence. They are disappointed in Hong Kong authorities’ inability to protect their residents’ legal rights and due process.
Yet Beijing isn’t backing down. This April, the Hong Kong legislature, which is stacked mostly with pro-Beijing legislators, proposed a new extradition bill, which will allow Hong Kong to extradite wanted criminals to mainland China, Macau, and Taiwan as well as other countries not covered by Hong Kong’s existing extradition treaties.
On the surface, this new proposal was prompted by a murder case. A Hongkonger who resided in Taiwan ran back to Hong Kong after Taiwanese authorities charged him with murdering his Taiwanese girlfriend. Hong Kong and Taiwan don’t have an extradition treaty because Hong Kong authorities adopted Beijing’s stance that Taiwan is part of China. So pro-Beijing legislators said the change in Hong Kong’s extradition law is needed to send the alleged criminal back to Taiwan.
But legal scholars pointed out that “there had long been a case-by-case arrangement under the existing ordinance, to allow Hong Kong to transfer fugitives to places it lacked an extradition deal with.” Therefore Hong Kong doesn’t need a new extradition bill if it wants to send the murder suspect back to Taiwan.
Many Hongkongers are concerned that if the new extradition bill becomes law, Hong Kong authorities, under Beijing’s pressure, will also surrender anyone wanted by Beijing based on trumped-up charges. Critics of Beijing, pro-democracy activists, and human rights activists would be at risk. Extradition Would Eradicate Hong Kongers’ Freedoms
Their concerns are valid. Hong Kong’s political environment has become more restrictive in recent years. Four pro-democracy legislators were disqualified for modifying their oaths of allegiance to China during their swearing-in ceremony. Hong Kong authorities refused to issue visas to several human rights activists and foreign journalists, including Victor Mallet of the Financial Times.
Nine leaders of the 2014 Umbrella movement that demanded universal suffrage in Hong Kong were sentenced to prison . Even Hong Kong’s once-cherished academic freedom is under constant interference from Beijing, whose overarching goal is to “rein in criticism and silence unrest.” Professors who supported the pro-democracy movement suddenly couldn’t get their papers published or receive the next appointment or promotion they deserve.
Like frogs in slowly boiling water, Hongkongers have been uneasy with the gradual erosion of their freedom but their responses since the 2014 Umbrella movement have been somewhat muted. The extradition bill seems to have become the last draw. Opposition to this bill is widespread, from a faction of legislators, legal scholars , and business people to ordinary citizens. It has rejuvenated the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
In last month alone, Hongkongers staged multiple protests and the most recent one drew more than 100,000 attendees. Even some pro-Beijing legislators have asked Carrie Lam, the Beijing-appointed chief executive of Hong Kong, to scrap the bill and “accept a counterproposal to give the city’s courts the authority to hear cases involving Hong Kong suspects abroad.”
But there is little sign that Lam will back down. Political insiders said this bill is Beijing’s political loyalty test. When facing opposition, Beijing’s only strategy is to crack down, not back down. If Lam can’t deliver it, her political career will be over and Beijing will simply find someone else who can.
Hong Kong used to be the freest city in Asia and one of the freest in the world. Its independent judiciary, protection of freedom of expression and thought, plus low taxes and light regulations, transformed a sleepy fishing village into a modern symbol of prosperity and freedom. Dr. Milton Friedman used scenes from Hong Kong to open his popular PBS series, “ Free to Choose .”
Should the extradition bill become law, however, it will ultimately spell the death of the freest city we have known. It’s truly a tragedy of our times that a great city is slowly dying in front of us. Helen Raleigh is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Why Women Can Never Have A Constitutional Right To An Abortion,thefederalist.com,Timothy M. Jackson,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/women-can-never-constitutional-right-abortion/,"By Timothy M. Jackson May 7, 2019
The Kansas Supreme Court recently ruled that women have a state constitutional right to abortion. This means, in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion would still be legal in Kansas.
What were the grounds for this ruling? Nothing less than an appeal to the inalienable rights of human beings. To quote the majority opinion:
All men are possessed of equal and inalienable natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” We are now asked: Is this declaration of rights more than an idealized aspiration? And, if so, do the substantive rights include a woman’s right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy? We answer these questions, “Yes.” We conclude that, through the language in section 1, the state’s founders acknowledged that the people had rights that preexisted the formation of the Kansas government. There they listed several of these natural, inalienable rights—deliberately choosing language of the Declaration of Independence by a vote of 42 to 6.
What is curious about the reasoning of this ruling is that it rejects the logical conclusions of the stated premises. If rights are inalienable, they exist prior to birth, they are harmonious, and they cannot rightly be revoked by counterfeit claims of rights. Inalienable Rights Begin When You Do
The claim that human beings have inalienable rights is an affirmation that all human beings by nature have rights as human beings, independent of any government ruling. This is what the Kansas Supreme Court explicitly acknowledged in their reasoning.
However, what necessarily follows from this reasoning is that a human being has rights from the moment she begins to exist. This, by the way, would include any claimed right to bodily autonomy.
If human beings have the right to bodily autonomy, you cannot consistently claim this is an inalienable right that is intrinsic to every human being and claim a human being only acquires this right at birth. It is hard to imagine a more acute violation of bodily autonomy than the intentional and forcible poisoning or dismemberment of their body to the point of death.
Yet what right did the court acknowledge of the live human beings who have not been born? If human beings are only conferred rights at birth, this not what the word “inalienable” means. This is the expression of the opposite, in fact. All Inalienable Rights Can Exist in Harmony
Second, if rights are inalienable, they cannot contradict each other. Others have an obligation to respect each particular right at every moment. You cannot pick and choose which rights to ignore. If inalienable rights could truly be in conflict with each other, this would result in an endless number of scenarios in which it is logically impossible to carry out your obligations to other human beings. This is absurd.
There cannot be a moral obligation to carry out the logically impossible. It is logically possible for all human beings to coexist in a society in which all their inalienable rights are protected under the law. This is the ideal the founders encouraged us to strive for and approximated in the Declaration of Independence. This ideal would lead to the recognition that both a pregnant woman and her unborn child can have all their inalienable rights consistently protected. Rejecting Counterfeit Claims to a Right
If there is an apparent conflict between two rights, it is important to recognize that it cannot be an actual conflict. One of the two “rights” is only masquerading as a genuine right. It must be a counterfeit. The real work is in identifying the imposter. This is where the debate on abortion must be waged.
For example, a right we can now all agree was counterfeit was the “right” to own slave. It was the false application of our inalienable right to property. Why? Although an inalienable right to property exists, another human being cannot be reduced to someone else’s property.
This also created an apparent conflict between to competing rights where none actually existed: namely, a right to property of one class of human beings versus the right to liberty of another class of human beings. But a right to property for some that inherently denied liberty to others, without due process, showed quite clearly it was not a valid claim to property. Two Competing Rights
With abortion, we have a similar apparent conflict between two or more competing rights: a right to bodily autonomy for one class of human beings versus the right to life (and bodily autonomy) for another class of human beings.
One understanding of a bodily autonomy claim also seems to reduce another class of human beings to someone else’s property, as it presumes a pregnant woman has a right to choose what she will do with that which belongs to her, and the human being in her womb is included in “that which belongs to her.” But as we have seen in the case of slavery, another human being cannot be reduced to another human being’s property.
Another way of framing the bodily autonomy claim is as a claim to liberty rather than property. One might argue the right to bodily autonomy does not reduce the unborn to property but protects a woman’s liberty to abstain from sustaining her child’s life in pregnancy. In this apparent conflict of liberty versus life, which is the imposter?
This is a false application of our natural right to liberty. There is no such thing as liberty to intentionally kill an innocent human being. A right to liberty that denies life without due process only reveals it is not a valid claim to liberty.
Whichever way you frame this, a ruling of this sort fails to acknowledge the right to life, liberty, or the bodily autonomy of the unborn, all of which would exist if human beings possess inalienable rights, as the Kansas Supreme Court claimed. Kansas failed to uphold the purpose of government: to protect life, liberty, and property with any internal coherence.

The Me Too Era Is Time To Revisit ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’s’ Defense Of Due Process,thefederalist.com,Daniel Buck,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/era-time-revisit-kill-mockingbirds-defense-due-process/,"By Daniel Buck May 7, 2019
When my class of freshmen students watched the trial scene in the film version of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” where the protagonist Atticus Finch defends black man Tom Robinson in court against a false allegation of raping a white woman, a student asked why so many people attended the hearing. In both the movie and book, local individuals flock to the trial. My freshmen students had never experienced a prominent court case, so they struggled to understand why anyone would want to watch.
I paused the movie. The image of Brett Kavanaugh with his right hand raised had loomed in my subconscious throughout the unit this year, and I finally had a moment to work the parallel into my lesson. A few students knew his name but none knew the details of the public controversy. I had expected it to be so. I summarized the events of the preceding year and continued the movie.
I’m sure that some would label the parallel I drew between Brett Kavanaugh and Tom Robinson problematic. Robinson is a man of color and we, as readers, are certain of his innocence while there remains the possibility that Kavanaugh is culpable.
Yet the facts of the cases show otherwise. In both, political implications extended beyond the courtroom. In both, it was a matter of two conflicting testimonies with little other evidence. In both, one party relied on conflicting accounts to discredit the defendant’s reputation, and the other provided evidence—inconclusive evidence, yes, but more than the accusers could procure.
Atticus would be problematized as well. While always polite and fair, he imposes a blitzkrieg of rhetorical questions upon Mayella Ewell, Robinson’s accuser, none of which she can answer. Instead, she suffers in silence as Atticus exposes her lie to the onlookers. If it took place today, his questioning would be scorned. People would claim he made her relive her traumas and placed her credibility into doubt. Does the Truth Matter or Not?
I let the movie run to the pronouncement of a guilty verdict. The same student who had asked me about attendance at the trial now asked how they could find him guilty when he wasn’t. It was an injustice, he declared.
Such a declaration is scarce in today’s media in the wake of the Me Too movement. Instead, one feminist author, Emily Linden, tweeted about her lack of concern for falsely accused men, saying, “If some innocent men’s reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy, that is a price I am absolutely willing to pay.” Even if it were an injustice, it’s negligible, say some.
I want Linden to watch “To Kill a Mockingbird” and stand by her words. When Robinson says through tears “I did not,” after Atticus asks him if he raped Mayella, beat Mayella, or committed any crime, is he not a victim?
False allegations are rare, yes. One study aligns with others in placing the rate somewhere between 2 and 10 percent. However, they happen. Quillette recently ran an article that detailed one of these accusations. A woman accused her ex-boyfriend of rape, placing his career and other personal relationships into jeopardy.
In “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Atticus rightly says Mayella Ewell is to be pitied, but that his “pity does not extend so far as to her putting a man’s life at stake.” Robinson has a wife, children, and daily habits like work and assisting neighbors that give meaning to his life. His tears are valid. We view his condemnation and subsequent extra-judicial execution as a supreme injustice.
Any man sent to jail for a crime he didn’t commit is an injustice. If he’s black or white, any man facing life behind bars while his family must support themselves absent a father is a victim. Those who suffer the atrocity of sexual abuse are victims and they must be protected, but so, too, must the men whose lives are at stake when accused. Consider the Consequences for Vulnerable People
At the time of the book’ s publication, sexual assault was not the prominent societal discussion that it is today. The book instead focused on the issue at the forefront of public consciousness in the 1950s and ’60s: civil rights. Unfortunately, the victims in Lee’s time may be the same as those Me Too creates today.
Long before Michelle Alexander decried the unjust sentencing of black men to life in prison, Harper Lee wrote a bestselling novel to bring awareness to the masses. The story shows how racism can corrupt even ideal institutions like the courts. Contemporary movements like Black Lives Matter are rekindling that question and may soon come into conflict with the Me Too movement.
According to the National Registry of Exonerations , a joint project of University of Michigan School of Law and Michigan State University School of Law, almost half of false criminal accusations fall upon black men, who make up only 14 percent of the American populace. Thus, “To Kill a Mockingbird” reveals an unaddressed potential consequence of the Me Too movement.
As both parties seek to ameliorate former racial injustices perpetrated by unjust courts and the war on drugs, the Me Too movement may create a new target criminal. To be sure, men guilty of rape deserve the harshest of punishments, but to believe all women puts black men at enormous risk for false imprisonment. Don’t Forget Tom Robinson
Expressed in Linden’s tweet is almost a progressive utilitarianism: the destruction of a few men justifies the liberation of hundreds of women. At face value, it may be hard to argue with, yet in the face of Robinson, the assertion crumbles.
Throughout the novel, Atticus can become a bit of a drag, a verbose moralizer. He stands as the novel’s moral center, though, and is the character from whom we, as readers, draw the final theme. He knows that to place Robinson behind bars not only perpetuates the plight of racism but is itself an instance of grave injustice.
I commend Western society for its push to bring a ubiquitous crime, sexual assault, into the light that it may be struck down, but, as with Atticus’ pity, this commendation ends when it puts an innocent man’s life in jeopardy. That all men must be punished or else the guilty will go free is a false dichotomy and misdirection. We cannot replace one injustice with another."
Google Ban On Claremont Institute Ad Is Another Black Eye For Big Tech,thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/google-ban-claremont-institute-ad-another-black-eye-big-tech/,"May 7, 2019 By David Marcus
Last month, Ryan Williams, the president of the Claremont Institute, published an essay in The American Mind that argued multiculturalism is undermining traditional American values. I published a response here in The Federalist criticizing his thoughtful, well-written argument on a few significant points. My colleague, John Daniel Davidson, ran another article in The Federalist respectfully criticizing my objections. This is how discourse is supposed to work. But it seems Google is not aware of this.
Instead this week Google responded to the Williams article by denying the Claremont Institute the ability to purchase advertising for its 40th anniversary gala. This was the result of the American Mind bizarrely being labeled a racially or ethnically motivated publication, which the tech giant’s terms of service bar from running ads.
Yesterday Google’s acting director of political and stakeholder outreach told Claremont the label and refusal to sell advertising was a mistake, but only after several conservative outlets and half of conservative Twitter expressed outrage over the suppression of Claremont’s speech. That frankly just isn’t good enough. If this is happening to Claremont, then it is almost certainly happening to individuals and groups that cannot muster the support Claremont could to address the situation.
The real question here is how could such a mistake have been made in the first place? Was this the result of an algorithm? Or did some person or persons tag the American Mind for this treatment? Last year, the heads of both Twitter and Facebook testified before Congress about, among other things, political censorship on their platforms, Google was also invited to testify but declined the invitation.
Congress learned from the social media companies that they haven’t figured out how to police the content of millions of users without bias against conservatives. Twitter head Jack Dorsey was clearest in saying this bias against conservatives exists, but he offered no solution to the problem.
There are two basic ways that Internet companies flag content that supposedly violates their terms of service. First is reporting. It is possible that Google received complaints regarding Williams’ original essay, but in all likelihood Claremont was flagged using the second method, which is basically algorithms searching content for terms or phrases that make it more likely to be in violation.
In this case the term that most likely triggered the action was “multicultural,” which is interesting because the use of that word, or in my opinion the misuse of it, was at the core of my criticism of Williams’s essay. But whether one agrees with me or Williams on that issue, what all should be able to agree on is that there was nothing offensive or racialized about the way Williams uses that term. While historically “multicultural” has been used to describe societies becoming more racially diverse, Williams was clear that was not at the root of his usage. He was talking about something much closer to the idea of cultural relativism, in which traditional values are thrown overboard.
But why might a word like multicultural trigger a review in the first place? It might be a word that does appear in legitimately racist or offensive content, which is therefore captured by the algorithm. But the vast majority of the time the content Internet companies punish is right of center. So is the bias of typically progressive software employees driving the algorithm? Is Google, perhaps without even knowing it, importing or uploading a political worldview into its massive systems?
That would be bad, and seems likely to be the case. But it is not the worst part of this incident. The worst part is the American Mind was punished for engaging in exactly the kind of respectful discourse that our society needs to build greater understanding. If merely mentioning controversial words or subjects triggers a clampdown, how on earth is anyone supposed to even talk about those subjects? The result is not just a chilling of speech, it is to set barriers to the kind of discourse America so badly needs today.
I believe it was Ludwig Wittgenstein who said that language is not merely the vessel of our thought, it is also the driver. This is perhaps even more true for Internet companies, whose algorithms now make daily decisions about what materials we are and are not exposed to. Any kind of political bias in those systems can have dramatic effects, as Claremont found out.
Although Google’s reaction to Claremont is a particularly outrageous example of anti-conservative bias, it is far from an outlier. This is something conservatives have become accustomed to, but which we must not accept. Our outlets, our leadership, and our politicians must continue to keep tech companies’ feet to the fire on this issue. Conservatives have as much right to speak and make their case as the left does. As the Internet takes over more and more of our lives, we must work to ensure it is a place for lively and important debate, not a database of rightthink and wrongthink.

Trans Competitors In Women’s Sports Destroy What Women Have Won,thefederalist.com,Amelia Koehn,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/trans-competitors-womens-sports-destroy-women-won/,"May 7, 2019 By Amelia Koehn
Competing on the University of Iowa Women’s Rowing Team was one of the greatest experiences imaginable. I look back on those four years with a thankful heart for not only representing my state on the national stage but also developing a lasting sisterhood with the women I rowed with.
I can speak for the majority of female athletes when saying that sports have given women an outlet to better ourselves. Yet Democrats’ proposed Equality Act in the House of Representatives will completely alter women’s sports. The most poignant fact of H.R.5. is that if a biological man chooses so, even without receiving opposite-sex hormones, he can compete against a biological woman.
To think that a biological man who identifies as a woman can compete with us as if our bodies can be cheapened like this is not only insulting but also a direct assault on our selves as female athletes. We’re athletes who have trained to become the best versions of ourselves, and what we’ve achieved is being stolen by the hands of one whose feelings are deemed more worthy, according to a select few on the left. Under progressivism, a transgender individual’s desires must dominate women’s freedoms.
Men are indeed built differently than women. Males have larger internal organs than females, meaning they can pump more oxygen into their bodies, which yields higher athletic performance. And no, opposite-sex hormones do not hinder men’s physical advantage.
Men are also able to develop greater muscle mass while maintaining it more quickly. In fact, men have an average of 72.75 pounds of skeletal muscle mass while women have an average of 46.29 pounds . This larger amount of naturally occurring muscle mass not only provides an unfair advantage in a non-contact sport, but it can inflict injury on a woman in the heat of face-to-face competition.
These two scientifically proven facts confirm that men are more efficient and powerful in sports. This does not mean that women are not powerful and strong in their sports. Rather, we perform at a different level. These undeniable truths are the clearest unfair advantages that women must endure.
As these men move into transgenderism, they pump hormones into their bodies. Meanwhile, every other athlete must adhere to the NCAA rules and guidelines that clearly ban several different types of substances. Women who want to live as if they are men also take testosterone and other drugs to become larger, similar to that of a man’s body.
This puts the majority of non-hormone-using females at a disadvantage because the women who are using male hormones are able to perform at a higher degree with the assistance of drugs. Athletes are required to not consume certain over-the-counter vitamins and supplements in fear of being suspended from the team and not ever competing on the collegiate level again. Yet apparently they can take powerful hormones and still compete. The juxtaposition is absurd.
Many feminists oppose the Equality Bill. One outspoken critic of this bill, Julia Beck, a producer for Women’s Liberation Radio News, stated, “ Many well-intentioned people think that this concept of gender identity is the next frontier of social justice, but in reality it is regressive .” Beck continued, “Gender is based on rigid sex roles that legitimize male dominance and female subordination. The idea of a female or male brain only justifies treating women as subhuman.”
Many biological female athletes disapprove of biological males competing against women. Ana Paula Henkel, a former Brazilian Olympic volleyball player, argued against transgender men competing with women: “It represses, embarrasses, humiliates and excludes women.”
Believe it or not, there was a time women’s sports teams did not exist. Women had to strive and earn the right to have leagues of their own. They had the desire to compete, and they wanted to be treated fairly.
Today, we’ve won that right, only to have it threatened by men who think they can manipulate their bodies to appear female. If passed, the Equality Act will open the door for assaults on women, especially in athletics.
Now, the goal that women have worked for years to achieve—to compete in a collegiate sport—could result in their potential positions being stolen by a man who calls himself a woman. This could mean a loss in a scholarship and a pathway to college for a woman who was once a little girl shooting basketball hoops outside on her driveway or the little girl who ran on her gravel roads to get ready for her very first track meet.
Where are her rights? Where is her exclusive league? Where is her sisterhood? Female athletes still have these opportunities, but they are eroding and under further threat.

‘The Intruder’ Can’t Even Be Saved By Dennis Quaid’s Good Acting,thefederalist.com,Ron Capshaw,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/intruder-cant-even-saved-dennis-quaids-good-acting/,"May 7, 2019 By Ron Capshaw
Spoilers ahead.
Most actors have a bag of expressions they use to put an individual stamp on their roles. For Humphrey Bogart, it was a significant puff on a cigarette followed by rapid-fire dialogue. For Clark Gable, it was a tomcat smile, with eyebrows raised. For Errol Flynn, it was a “roguish grin.”
Closer to today, Tom Cruise routinely grips the shoulders of his leading ladies to express intensity. Clint Eastwood scowls and then delivers a tight-lipped hiss to show boiling anger.
In “The Intruder,” Dennis Quaid dispenses with his “good ol’ boy” grin, which he played on for quite a long time. It was first established when he was cast as rocket ace Gordo Cooper in the chest-thumping “The Right Stuff.” At its best, this grin could express supreme self-confidence as well as a cocky put-down of his competitors.
As the psychopathic stalker Charlie in “The Intruder,” Quaid instead uses his aging, craggy features to convey menace. Quaid never goes over the top. It is a controlled performance. He is as menacing when mowing the yard of the home he had to give up due to financial mismanagement as he is when hugging the shadows of this home, now occupied by an affluent African-America couple.
Unfortunately, Quaid is the only good part of the movie. As the yuppie couple, Scott Ealy and Megan Good do the best they can. The filmmakers do not use this racial role reversal (African-American yuppies in contrast to Quaid’s working class financial failure) for dramatic effect. The only concession to our current zeitgeist is by featuring Megan Good’s character as a writer focusing on “injustice and empowerment” for a women’s magazine. But the filmmakers are clearly bored with this idea, as they don’t show Good tapping as much as one laptop key.
It is a requirement for horror/slasher films that the characters exhibit a certain amount of stupidity. If they were smart they would never open the creaky door or go down the darkened stairs, thus depriving viewers of the horror.
But this movie has taken stupidity to new depths. Good is amazingly oblivious to Quaid’s growing sexual obsession with her. Not even his frequent uninvited appearances, usually coinciding with her businessman husband being out of town, cause her unease. She invites the clearly certifiable Quaid in for a pizza.
In “Pacific Heights,” Melanie Griffith did have trademark spacey moments, but she got villain Michael Keaton’s number from the start and began turning his conman games against him. Good has no alarm bells until pretty late in the film, even though Quaid, a much better actor than Keaton in displaying menace, has all but screamed he is going to shred her and her husband. She doesn’t have the wit to realize that the strange bumps in the night are because Quaid is living in their basement.
Ealy and Good do the best they can, but the lackluster script defeats them at every turn. This is unforgivable given that the screenwriter (David Loughery) was capable of complexity over cliché as in a much better film, “Lakeview Terrace .” Here he didn’t traffic in one-dimensional menace but gave the audience both sides of the characters.
Samuel Jackson, a much better actor than Ealy, was undoubtedly racist toward his new interracial neighbors in “Lakeview Terrace,” but the couple, Luke Wilson and Kerry Washington, complicated things by having sex in their pool within full view of Jackson, a single father valiantly trying to raise his daughter.
Quaid is an interesting and accomplished actor, not afraid to play against type. And it is clear he is having a ball playing a homicidal nut. Unfortunately, this is not enough to save a film that would have been derided even in the heyday of this genre—the ’90s."
Medical Research Finds A Way To Treat Babies With Spina Bifida In The Womb,thefederalist.com,Moira Gaul,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/medical-research-finds-way-treat-babies-spina-bifida-womb/,"By Moira Gaul May 7, 2019
Diagnosed during pregnancy with spina bifida, chromosomal abnormalities, and hydrocephalus, young Noah Wall has defied predictions from the British medical community.
Roughly midway through pregnancy, during a 20-week scan, Shelly and Rob Wall of Cumbria, England, were told that their son Noah had spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord doesn’t fully close. Damage to the spinal cord and nerves can result. While health outcomes vary depending on the type and severity of the condition, physical and intellectual disabilities can vary from mild to severe and include paralysis of the legs.
Noah’s parents were later informed that he had hydrocephalus, a condition involving an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. On five separate occasions during the pregnancy, doctors advised Shelly and Rob to terminate their son, Noah. The Walls say their doctors projected that their son would be severely disabled both mentally and physically and potentially unable to see, hear, and speak.
When Shelly went in for Noah’s birth, the hospital placed a non-resuscitation order on him. She says it “was an amazing day” and “we waited with bated breath.” Noah gave a loud and strong cry announcing his birth. An initial scan showed Noah’s brain was at 2 percent of a newborn’s brain. His latest scan at age three astoundingly reflects 80 percent of a child’s brain.
Celebrating his seventh birthday this March, Noah continues to spread hope with his effusive joy. He visits and takes gifts to children in the hospital where he stayed and updates his former doctors. His parents share their story of enduring love and perseverance against pressures to end Noah’s life.
Although paralyzed from the waist down at birth, Noah has been learning to move his legs. He hopes one day to both walk and even surf. His care has led the family to an Australian clinic where Noah had an assessment in the emerging field of neurophysics.
Noah’s mom, Shelly, now also advocates for increased awareness about the importance of early folic acid intake for pregnant moms and women hoping to conceive. Folic acid, a form of vitamin B, aids in proper neural tube development as a baby grows. The neural tube in an embryo develops into the baby’s brain and spinal cord and tissues enclosing them.
Since spina bifida is a birth defect where the spinal cord doesn’t fully close, maternal folic acid intake during (and before) pregnancy has been shown to reduce the risk of spina bifida as well as the defect anencephaly—also caused by a neural tube defect. Encouraging folic acid intake through both prenatal and preconception education is a critically important prevention initiative.
Innovative prenatal surgeries also show incredible promise for babies diagnosed in utero with spina bifida and other birth defects. As a new paper entitled “The Perinatal Revolution,” co-authored by two Charlotte Lozier Institute scholars and a colleague, highlights a major reason more parents should be hopeful from a recent study.
Myelomeningocele is spina bifida in its most severe form. Not only did the research demonstrate the effectiveness of prenatal surgery, but it also found that when performed earlier in pregnancy (before 26 weeks) babies fared better. The outcomes were so positive, they interrupted the study so treatment wouldn’t be denied to babies who were to receive standard postnatal surgery. Their findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 1,645 babies are born with spina bifida each year in the United States According to EUROCAT data, in the United Kingdom in 2016, a total of 53 babies were born with this condition, another 90 were lost to induced abortion, and four more babies died naturally.
Officials with the British National Health Service (NHS) announced in late 2018 that in utero spinal surgery for some unborn babies diagnosed with spina bifida will be made available in England for the first time in April 2019. It is surmised that the NHS will determine which babies may undergo the surgery and receive care. In-Utero Surgery Helped Elouise Simpson
Elouise Simpson, a baby girl who received one of the pioneering spina bifida surgeries in the womb at University College Hospital in London in February, was born on April 1 , and has now gone home with her parents. Bethan Simpson, Elouise’s mom and a mental health nurse, said she and her husband were advised to terminate their daughter following the spina bifida diagnosis.
But “I couldn’t justify terminating a child I could feel kicking,” she said. Little Elouise has shown no signs of spina bifida since birth and the in utero surgery has been deemed a success.
Stories like Noah Wall’s indicate that medical projections following a serious diagnosis during pregnancy are not always correct. The courage and love Noah’s parents demonstrated to fight to give their little boy a chance at life, despite the odds and contrary to the medical advice provided seven years ago, should encourage parents who receive such a serious diagnosis. The family interview on “Good Morning Britain” recounting their journey has endeared Noah and his parents to the public as an inspiration for hope and life.

Free The Students. Sink The Colleges,thefederalist.com,Daniel Oliver,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/free-students-sink-colleges/,"By Daniel Oliver May 7, 2019
Senator Elizabeth “Feathers” Warren has called for forgiving student loans, a proposal first made here back in 2014. But Warren would eliminate only $50,000 of student debt, and only for students whose income was less than $100,000, approximately 42 million people.
Of course, being Sen. Warren, she has also proposed that the government cover all tuition at all two-year and four-year colleges, and—well it goes on and on, essentially socializing the cost of everything, probably including toothpaste, chewing gum, and wampum belts.
The cost of the debt-forgiveness part of her proposal is said to be $640 billion. (Total student debt is estimated at $1.56 trillion.)
Just because Warren has latched onto the idea doesn’t make it kooky—though we are right to suspect anything that the first faculty member of color at Harvard Law School says.
Donald Trump should steal this idea, feathers and all, for the 2020 campaign.
Part Two of the original proposal (at, to repeat, here ) was that the federal government would pay for the loan cancellations by eliminating most of its grants to higher education institutions. Today total federal support of education is about $102.5 billion a year.
People who are skeptical of Part Two need to understand something about “higher” education: for most people it is worthless, as education. Completely worthless . And actually, worse than worthless because it corals young people into institutions for two or four of their most formative years where they learn absolutely nothing ! And wind up in debt up to their keisters.
In his book, The Case Against Education , Bryan Caplan makes, inter alia, two important points. The first is that students learn nothing: “Barely half of American adults,” he writes, “know the Earth goes around the sun.” Read that again, slowly, and contemplate the usefulness of a college education.
We should not be surprised. Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa in their book, Academically Adrift , agree with Caplan (“American education is characterized by limited or no learning for a large proportion of students”) and suggest why. “On average, [students] report spending only 12 hours per week studying.” Arum and Roksa also tell us that “fifty percent of the students in our sample reported that they had not taken a single course during the prior semester that required more than twenty pages of writing, and one third had not taken one that required even forty pages of reading per week.”
Bryan Caplan’s second point is that education is all about credentialing. “The labor market doesn’t pay you for the useless subjects you master;” he writes, “it pays you for the preexisting traits you reveal by mastering them.”
The education racket is all about the “sheepskin” effect. Graduates of the twelfth grade in high school earn more than graduates of only the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades combined . In college the sheepskin effect is even more pronounced: graduates earn more than twice as much as students who complete only one, two, or three years combined !
One theory—only a congressman could believe it—is that the teachers or professors save all the really important information for the last year. Horse feathers!
If college is all about credentialing, why not find another way to credential the nation’s young people? Why not make tasks available that would allow Johnny to show that he has the grit to stick with a difficult job?
Why not create service opportunities for young people to engage in, in addition to military service? They could work at senior citizen institutions, hospitals, high schools, or any number of other charitable institutions that serve the public. The work could be demanding: show up on time; learn specific skills; take responsibility. “Undergraduates in Service to America—USA all the way.” William F. Buckley Jr. wrote a whole book about it in 1990 called Gratitude .
Service would not be mandatory, of course—no indentured servitude. It would simply be an opportunity for young people to show what four years of college shows prospective employers now: that the “student” has the fortitude to persevere.
The feds could even “subsidize” part of the program by not taxing the income of people under the age of twenty-two in such a program.
Young people with good jobs and without huge loans could move out of their parents’ basements (or teepees), get married, have children, and lead normal, productive lives—the way Americans used to.
If a few big corporations started accepting as evidence of maturity and perseverance a work substitute for a sheepskin, the change could happen like a California wildfire.
By stopping support to higher education, the federal government could pay for the debt cancellation in less than a decade—much, much less if the government forgave only the first $10,000 of debt, which would eliminated the debt of about a third of borrowers.
But note that a key part of the proposal is stopping payments to the nation’s colleges. Those institutions, bloated with high-paid administrators, diversity deans, and grievance counselors, are the fever swamps of the Left, inculcating young people in big government, socialist, and often anti-American nostrums. Stopping that is worth twice the price.
This is a win-win-win proposition for Republicans: Get the students to vote Republican; save a generation or several generations of young people from wasting four important years in colleges where they will learn almost nothing; and defund the Left’s higher ed propaganda machine.

CNN Contributor Insanely Claims Unborn Babies Aren't Human,thefederalist.com,Madeline Osburn,05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/07/pro-abortion-cnn-contributor-insanely-claims-unborn-babies-arent-even-human/,"May 7, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
On CNN’s “Primetime with Chris Cuomo” on Monday night, a segment on the legality of state-level fetal heartbeat bills quickly spiraled into a chaotic debate about whether unborn children should be considered human beings. CNN contributor and erstwhile New York City Democratic politician Christine Quinn said, “When a woman is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her.”
When guest Rick Santorum asked CNN Host Chris Cuomo if he disagreed “that at the moment of conception that a child is human and alive?” Cumono replied that means it’s “viable.” When Santorum asked, “Is it biologically a human life?” Quinn shouted, “No!”
Cuomo and Quinn teamed up in pushing back on Santorum as he articulated what science tells us about unborn humans. At every stage of human life — as an embryo, a fetus, or after five weeks of age when his or her heartbeat can be detected by an ultrasound — an unborn child has his or her own unique DNA.
He or she has a unique genetic code, blood type, sex, and race, all which can differ from his or her mother and father’s. This unique individual is developed inside a women’s body, but is not part of a women’s body, and cannot be regulated as the mother’s property, Santorum argued.
“Her body is always her property,” Cuomo said, missing the point entirely.
“When a women is pregnant, that is not a human being inside of her. It is part of her body,” Quinn said. “This is about a women having full agency and control of her body…and making decisions about what is part of her body with medical professionals.”
The right to abortion is just that — the right to kill unborn humans. But pro-abortionists like Quinn and Cuomo find it easier to argue that they are fighting for “reproductive rights” (even though pro-lifers are not objecting to any woman’s right to reproduce) or that fetuses are not humans but “clumps of cells.” Just as with slave owners and eugenicists before them, it’s easier for pro-abortionists to advocate for murder after they’ve dehumanized the lives they want to end.

How Overemphasizing Individualism Made Liberalism Morally Bankrupt,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/overemphasizing-individualism-made-liberalism-morally-bankrupt/,"By Nathanael Blake May 8, 2019
Only liberals can save liberalism. They do not seem up to the task, and their failure leaves liberalism languishing in decadence.
Political liberalism — broadly understood in terms of representative government, individual rights, and personal autonomy — should be an easy sell in an era of prosperity, technological marvels, and comparative peace, especially after the totalitarian horrors of the last century. But, from the ballot box to academia, liberals are struggling to respond to rivals and critics who contend that liberalism has not lived up to its promises.
For example, consider writer Gabriel Schoenfeld’s recent essay in The American Interest attacking critics of liberalism, particularly Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen and his book “ Why Liberalism Failed .” Schoenfeld makes two significant critiques of Deneen and his fellow travelers. The first is that their condemnations of modern liberalism do not account for historical context—today has flaws, but yesterday did, too, often worse. The second is that Deneen and his allies do not offer reasonable alternatives to liberalism; they tend to either dodge the question or else indulge in flights of fancy, such as theories of Catholic integralism .
These criticisms have some merit, and Schoenfeld avoids conflating technological progress with moral progress, making his one of the better responses to Deneen. He also deserves credit for recognizing the illiberalism of many on the left, including President Obama’s efforts to force nuns to fund and facilitate the distribution of birth control and the obsession with compelling nonconformist, devoutly religious wedding vendors to celebrate same-sex marriage ceremonies.
But Schoenfeld does not address the fundamental failures of modern liberalism because he believes there are none. He believes that although everything may not be awesome yet, overall life is better than it used to be. He is right that many current complainers are ignorant of the past and its problems, but he falls into the opposite error and seems oblivious to the worst evils of modern liberalism. What in today’s liberalism might compare with the atrocities of earlier eras? In his view: nothing. Our Age Embraces Atrocities, Too
He thus ignores the tens of millions dismembered in utero to secure the personal sexual autonomy that today’s liberalism cherishes above all else. Abortion is a veiled brutality that enables the modern liberal way of life. It gives the lie to Schoenfeld’s conclusion that “even if a gap persists between our ideals and practices, in any fair appraisal it has narrowed significantly from 100 or 200 years ago.”
In modern liberal regimes, the mother who marvels at an ultrasound revealing the movements of her child in the eighth week of pregnancy also has an absolute sovereign right to order that child’s death. But Schoenfeld declares ours to be “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.” If human persons in utero have moral worth, then these paeans to liberalism’s moral progress are sung from the hymnbooks of Hell.
Just as a liberalism that endorsed slavery could not endure, so too a degenerate liberalism that embraces abortion deserves to be consigned to the ash heap of history. Abortion illuminates this moral blind spot in modern liberalism, but the problem extends throughout liberal theorizing about family and community, which has denigrated and dissolved familial and community bonds since at least John Locke. The Problem with Children and Family
Children and family have always been a problem for liberal political theory, which is centered on autonomous adults. Children are not born free and rational, but dependent and irrational, and liberal political theory has long struggled to address human development and dependence.
In particular, the developing human person’s specific dependence on the mother is an insoluble problem for modern liberalism. Human life in the womb can only exist and develop by imposing upon the mother’s body, regardless of her consent. Modern liberalism will not accept this loss of bodily autonomy (even if it usually arises as a natural and predictable result of consensual sex) and has chosen to secure the mother’s rights under the liberal regime by negating the child’s right to life.
Liberalism cannot keep all of its promises. Thus, a political philosophy that began by claiming to defend rights and liberty for all ends, has started denying the rights of the most vulnerable, in an ironic twist. As a political theory for rational, autonomous adults, liberalism has no place for the dependent and disabled, against whom Western liberal nations are engaged in a quiet genocide .
The failure to adequately address human dependence and vulnerability has left liberalism in a moral morass. Liberal apologists on both the left and the right may not care. Many of them even approve. GOP elites, for instance, are more socially liberal than the rank-and-file, hence their constant efforts to marginalize social conservatives. But they should not be mystified that those who value nascent human life doubt that today’s abortion-dependent liberalism is “the most humane socio-political order ever to grace the face of the earth.”
Liberalism’s disdain for the dependent is the inevitable product of its contempt for all constraints on adult autonomy. Liberalism sees the ties of family, community, and church as bonds to be overcome (often by state intervention) in the cause of autonomous individualism. In practice, as well as in philosophy, it has become decadent because it scorned obligations to its progeny and dissolved the sources from which it could be renewed.
This civilizational exhaustion is exemplified by the liberal West facing demographic disaster. In a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity, many people refuse to have children. Decadence is evident throughout the cultural and political elites of Western liberal nations. Examples of ineptitude, arrogance, insularity, and self-indulgence abound, and they are increasingly illiberal in their efforts to defend a desiccated and exhausted liberalism. Populists Sense the Decadence of Liberalism
The populist backlash throughout the West is a symptom of this decadence, not its cause. Although populists often lack the theoretical acumen of a scholar like Deneen or the moral clarity of pro-life activists, they sense the decadence permeating the liberal order. They see it in the dissolution of national, as well as familial, bonds. It is evident in the casual acceptance, even celebration, of the destruction of local economies and communities in the service of globalization.
This is why criticism of the follies and rough edges of populist leaders rarely dissuade their supporters. If the status quo and those perpetuating it are unacceptable, then many traits of the alternatives may be forgiven. Emphasizing President Trump’s many flaws will not persuade those who are convinced of the general decadence of our political and cultural order.
Although there are sycophants, fools, and hacks who, for example, burble about how “godly” Trump is, many who acknowledge the president’s sins still have come to support him as the best available option . This support is reinforced every time that those with platforms and power refuse to hold themselves and their class accountable, and instead berate ordinary voters who have little political power or cultural cache. It is amusing to watch politicians and pundits who are veterans of a hundred moral compromises declare themselves the last principled men in Washington.
Scolding and shaming populist outbursts against the liberal order will not save liberalism. Scholarly critics of liberalism will not be lectured into submission. Liberalism will survive and prosper only if liberals are able to address the critiques of philosophers and the concerns of populists.
There may be hope for revitalized liberalism. There are strands of liberal theory and practice that can be rewoven to account for human dependence and the non-voluntary ties at the heart of human existence. But this cultural and political renewal will only arise if liberalism’s current defenders take its critics seriously and (harder still) repent of their wrongs. If they try to hold their positions and defend decadent liberalism, they will either lose or, worse still, become illiberal and despotic in their victory.

Mueller's 10 Most Egregious Missteps During Anti-Trump Russia Probe,thefederalist.com,Margot Cleveland,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/robert-muellers-10-egregious-missteps-anti-trump-russia-investigation/,"By Margot Cleveland May 8, 2019
The release of the special counsel’s report in April exposed several significant missteps Robert Mueller made over the last two years. Last week’s testimony by Attorney General William Barr before the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmed these blunders and bared additional concerns with Mueller’s handling of the probe into Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and President Trump’s supposed collusion and obstruction of justice.
Here are ten. 1. Mueller Spent $30 Million But Didn’t Do His Job
The special counsel probe reportedly cost more than $30 million, yet Mueller failed to do his job. Federal regulations expressly provide that at the conclusion of the special counsel’s work he must “provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.”
But in Volume 2 of the special counsel report, which addressed whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” of whether “to initiate or decline a prosecution.” Instead, Mueller passed the prosecutorial buck and spent some 200 pages sliming Trump.
During an earlier press conference, Barr stressed that Mueller had flouted his prosecutorial responsibilities by rendering a non-decision: “The very prosecutorial function and all our powers as prosecutors, including the power to convene grand juries and compulsory process that’s involved there, is for one purpose only. It’s to determine yes or no, was alleged conduct criminal or not criminal. That is our responsibility and that’s why we have the tools we have. And we don’t go through this process just to collect information and throw it out to the public.”
Barr reiterated this point during last week’s hearing, again stressing that the special counsel “was appointed to carry out the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Department.” The attorney general noted that both he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were “surprised” when they first learned Mueller would not make a decision about obstruction, and he called it “irresponsible” to release Mueller’s report without providing such a decision.
The attorney general continued: “The function of the Department of Justice in this arena is to determine whether or not there has been criminal conduct. It’s a binary decision. Is there enough evidence to show a crime and do we believe a crime has been committed? We don’t conduct criminal investigations just to collect information and put it out to the public. We do so to make a decision.” 2. Mueller’s Non-Decision Rationale Was Incomprehensible
Not only did Mueller violate the controlling special counsel regulation by issuing a non-decision decision, he couldn’t coherently explain his rationale for doing so. During the recent hearing, Barr made this point in responding to Sen. Chuck Grassley’s question of whether Barr agreed with Mueller’s reasons for not deciding on obstruction of justice.
“I’m not really sure of his reasoning,” Barr replied. “I really could not recapitulate his analysis.”
Later, when Sen. John Kennedy asked the attorney general to explain again why Mueller said he couldn’t make up his mind on obstruction, Barr repeated, “I really couldn’t recapitulate it.”
“It was unclear to us when we first discussed it on March 5—the deputy was with me—and we didn’t really get a clear understanding of the reasoning,” Barr told the Judiciary Committee. And even after reading the final special counsel report, Barr noted, he still wasn’t “sure exactly what the full line of reasoning is” for not rendering a prosecutorial decision. 3. Mueller Continued to Investigate Obstruction Knowing No Prosecutorial Decision Would Be Forthcoming
During the Judiciary Committee hearing, Barr added a third criticism of Mueller’s non-decision decision, testifying: “The other thing that was confusing to me was that the investigation carried out for a while as additional episodes were looked into, episodes involving the president. So my question is or was ‘Why were those investigated if at the end of the day you weren’t going to reach a decision on them?’”
Barr reiterated this point in a later exchange with Grassley, stating that if Mueller “felt that he should not go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, then he should have investigated. That was the time to pull up.”
But he didn’t. Instead, Mueller continued the investigation through the midterm elections and crafted a 200-page screed painting Trump’s conduct as consistent with criminal obstruction of justice. 4. Mueller Applied the Wrong Standard
Barr highlighted another Mueller mistake in an exchange with Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Blumenthal began it by quoting Mueller’s claim that “if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” The Democrat senator then confronted Barr with his decision to “in effect clear [] the president on both so-called collusion and obstruction of justice.”
Barr’s counter was devastating, both to Blumenthal and Mueller: “The difference is I used the proper standard,” he retorted. Barr went on to explain that Mueller’s statement “is actually a very strange statement.”
“The report says that they could not be sure they could clearly say that [Trump] did not violate the law,” Barr continued, before stressing, “as you know that’s not the standard, we use in the criminal justice system.” Rather, “it’s presumed that someone is innocent, and the government has to prove that they clearly violated the law. We’re not in the business of exoneration, not in the business of proving they’d didn’t violate the law—I found that whole passage very bizarre.”
Sen. Thom Tillis later returned to this point, first noting that the special counsel concluded it could not exonerate the president on obstruction. “When is a special counsel in the business of exonerating a subject on an investigation?” Tillis queried Barr. “They are not,” the attorney general replied. 5. Mueller Got Obstruction Law Wrong Too
One of the problems with Mueller’s approach to the question of obstruction of justice, Barr explained during the hearing, was the special counsel “trying to determine the subjective intent of a facially lawful act.” That approach “permits a lot of selectivity on the part of the prosecutors, and it’s been shot down in a number of other contexts.”
While Barr did not further expand during the hearing on Mueller’s misinterpretation of the law, he had previously destroyed the idea that Trump’s conduct could constitute criminal obstruction of justice. 6. Mueller Sent His Boss a ‘Snitty’ Letter
Mueller submitted his special counsel report to Barr on March 22, but that report could not be made public until necessary redactions were made. Pending the redactions, Barr released a letter on March 24, announcing Mueller’s conclusion: no collusion, and no decision on obstruction of justice.
Mueller didn’t like the way Barr’s letter was playing in the press, so he sent a letter on March 27, complaining to his boss that Barr’s March 24 letter “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office’s work and conclusions,” and asking Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report. ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’
The public did not learn of Mueller’s March 27 letter until the day before Barr hit the Hill to discuss the special counsel’s findings, when the Washington Post published a leaked copy of Mueller’s letter. The timing proved politically expedient: Mueller’s criticism of Barr dominated the news cycle in the lead up to the hearing, and Democrats hammered Barr throughout the hearing for his supposed misrepresentation of the special counsel’s report.
While this tactic may have pleased some partisans, Barr’s response resonated with the open-minded. When asked his reaction to the letter, Barr testified that he called Mueller, “I said, ‘Bob, what is with the letter? Why don’t you just pick up the phone and call me if there is an issue?’” The attorney general added that “the letter is a bit snitty and it was probably written by one of his staff people.”
On the merit of Mueller’s complaint, Barr explained during the hearing that he asked the special counsel if “he was suggesting that the March 24th letter was inaccurate and he said no, but that the press reporting had been inaccurate and that the press was reading too much into it.”
In short, Mueller wanted Barr to counter the media’s coverage by issuing the executive summaries from the special counsel report. But Barr told Mueller he “was not interested in putting out summaries and wasn’t going to put out the report piecemeal.” “I wanted to get the whole report out,” Barr explained, which he did on April 18.
In a head-to-head contest, Barr came off the bigger man, with the leak of Mueller’s letter harming the special counsel’s reputation much more than that of the attorney general.
Further, while sending a snitty letter to the attorney general was a dumb move, even dumber was putting pen to paper to complain that Barr’s letter announcing the conclusion of the special counsel “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the report. This complaint was a tacit acknowledgement that the special counsel’s 200-page discussion of obstruction of justice served solely to show one thing: orange man bad. 7. Mueller Made Some Horrendous Staffing Choices
The letter incident proved yet another problem with Mueller’s handling of the probe: his horrendous staffing choices. That Mueller would pick a team of “professionals” who would think it wise to draft the snitty letter, then convince Mueller to send it to his boss—or lacked the good sense to counsel against the move—speaks poorly of the man charged with investigating the president. 8. Mueller Could Have Previewed Barr’s Letter But Didn’t
While Mueller had no problem criticizing Barr’s March 24 letter after the fact, the special counsel demurred when Barr sought his input before he released the letter to Congress and the American people.
“I offered Bob Mueller the opportunity to review that letter before it went out, and he declined,” Barr explained in his opening statement. It takes some chutzpah to refuse to review a letter before it is dispatched, only to criticize it after the fact! 9. Mueller’s Team Was Responsible for Report Delay
In his March 27 complaint letter to Barr, Mueller bemoaned the media’s narrative and asked Barr to release the executive summaries of the special counsel report while the attorney general went through the necessary redaction process. As noted above, Barr refused because he wanted to get the full report out as soon as possible, which he did on April 18. Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job.
However, had Mueller done his job, the special counsel report could have been issued much earlier, thereby truncating the media spin of which Mueller complained. Barr made this point in his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee, explaining that when he met with Mueller in early March “I reiterated to Special Counsel Mueller that in order to have the shortest possible time before I was in a position to release the report, I asked that they identify 6E materials,” which are grand jury materials that statute prohibits from release.
Barr had asked that Mueller identity the 6E material “so we could redact the material and prepare the report for public release as quickly as we could.” But as Barr explained to the committee, “Unfortunately it did not come in that form . . . so there was necessarily going to be a gap between the receipt of the report and getting the full report out publicly.”
By failing to identify the grand jury material in the special counsel report—as his boss had requested—Mueller delayed the report release much beyond what would have been needed had he just done his job. “The problem we had,” as Barr explained, was “we could not identify the 6E material when the report came over. We needed the help of Mueller’s team.” 10. Mueller Didn’t Investigate (Or Report On) All Russian Interference
Mueller’s final misstep was the step not taken. Even though he was charged with investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, Mueller’s report omitted any discussion of whether the Kremlin fed dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation about Donald Trump. As I wrote on Monday:
Not once in the 448-page tome does Mueller mention an investigation into whether Russia interfered with the U.S. presidential election by feeding dossier author Christopher Steele misinformation.
But Mueller also did not charge Steele with lying to the FBI, or refer a criminal case against Steele to federal prosecutors, as he did when the special counsel uncovered evidence of criminal misconduct unrelated to the 2016 election. Given Mueller’s conclusion that no one connected to the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the election, one of those two scenarios must be true—either Russia fed Steele disinformation or Steele lied to the FBI about his Russian sources.
These ten missteps make clear that Mueller wasn’t the right man for the job. But Barr is. Margot Cleveland is a senior contributor to The Federalist.

Chris Cuomo Says Pro-Life More About 'Faith And Feeling Than Fact',thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/apple-banana-chris-cuomo-says-pro-life-movement-faith-feeling-fact/,"May 8, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
Chris Cuomo is an “anchor” at CNN. On Tuesday, with all the casualness of a lunch order he revealed a significant personal bias about one of today’s most contentious political issues.
Defending his performance in this absurd Monday segment with Christine Quinn, Cuomo fired off a tweet worth bookmarking. Although conservatives had been circulating the Quinn clip critically for hours, the critique to which he was responding actually came from the left. Disingenuous? No. There is certainly a need to explain the medical realities of the procedures and the risks to women of losing access to care but this is about politics mostly – and the pro- life position is more about faith and feeling than fact. But I pursue both avenues https://t.co/iTO2VQZwhh
— Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) May 7, 2019
And there it is: “the pro-life position is more about faith and feeling than fact.” That’s obviously fine as the banal dorm room musings of a college freshman. As a prime-time news anchor’s stated position on abortion, it’s bananas ( horrible pun intended ).
The beauty of Twitter is that its immediacy tempts journalists like Cuomo into exposing these biases. If he insists on covering abortion, I’d rather know about his misguided condescension for the pro-life movement than wonder about it. Indeed, tweets like these help us understand why segments like the one that precipitated this debate happen the first place. It’s also perfectly fine for journalists to share their personal opinions—when they identify as opinion journalists.
Cuomo does not. His title at CNN is “anchor.” His bio on the network’s website reads, “Chris Cuomo anchors CNN’s Cuomo Prime Time, a 9pm nightly news program where Cuomo tests power with newsmakers and politicians from both sides of the aisle, and reports on the latest breaking news from Washington and around the world.”
He is not Rachel Maddow; he is not Sean Hannity. In fact, he openly distinguishes himself from both of them. “Maddow’s a professor, Hannity’s a preacher. … I was built for the battle,” he recently told The Hollywood Reporter. “You are rarely hearing my opinion on television,” Cuomo asserted to Rolling Stone last year, lamenting that “Politics was easier to cover when people weren’t so blatantly abusive of facts.”
Whatever your position, abortion, of course, is no minor issue. It’s one of the most important policy questions to both parties. Now we know an “anchor” at the “Facts First” network is completely biased against one side.
If you’re one of CNN’s few remaining viewers , remember Cuomo’s take on abortion next time he covers it. The conversation will probably make a lot more sense. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist. You can follow her on Twitter @emilyjashinsky ."

Everything Seth Meyers Said About Ilhan Omar Is Wrong,thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/08/everything-seth-meyers-said-about-ilhan-omar-is-wrong/,"By David Harsanyi May 8, 2019
During Meghan McCain’s appearance on Seth Meyers’“Late Night” this week, the two got into a bit of an argument over the former’s criticism of Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitism.
“I do think it’s fairly dangerous and you brought it up after Congresswoman Omar had some death threats against her,” Meyers lectured McCain, who held her own in the back and forth. “Do you think, you know, she has obviously now stated that she needs to be more careful with her language, don’t you think other people who talk about her need to be more thoughtful as well? Or do you stand by those comments of tying her to this, her rhetoric to this synagogue shooting?”
The first part of this rhetorical question is setting up a destructive standard to undermine debate. For one thing, a public figure—an elected official, no less—has no dispensation from criticism merely because some nut sends her a death threat. Nor is there any indulgence for being a Muslim woman or black women or white middle-aged man, or anyone else. Omar is a 37-year-old educated woman who was elected to the U.S. Congress, not a middle schooler playacting in the Model U.N.
McCain condemned Omar’s words. She didn’t concoct a smear.
For another, we know Meyers’s standard is a transparent tactic to chill speech because of its selective deployment. Progressives didn’t stop arguing that Republicans were really just a bunch of fascists trying steal health care from the poor minority babies after a leftist shooter tried to assassinate the entire Republican leadership on a softball field in Alexandria, Virginia. Neither did Meyers, nor anyone else, stop perpetuating the fantastical notion that Trump conspired with Russia to steal the election just because the president receives death threats every day.
“Trump is a Traitor,” the shooter, James Hodgkinson, wrote on Facebook before the shooting. “Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” This sounds like any number of Twitter feeds from liberal columnists. No one feels the slightest bit inhibited.
Furthermore, Omar never really apologized. And even if she did, so what? Would Meyers care if Steve King was really, really sorry for his previous statements, or would he care more about the congressman’s policy positions?
Sure, Democratic House leadership pressured Omar to put together the words “unequivocally” and “apologize,” but those words were a precursor to a textbook “I’m-sorry-you-were-offended” non-apology. Listening to Omar and her defenders, you might be under the impression that her allegedly unintentional use of “tropes,” not the ugly ideas that gird her worldview, was what triggered many American Jews.
If you doubt this is true, listen to her own explanation. When Qatari mouthpiece Mehdi Hasan asked her if she had apologized for being either knowingly or unknowingly anti-Semitic, Omar responded: “Absolutely not. I apologized for the way that my words made people feel.”
Omar’s words make me feel like we have a congresswoman who peddles policy ideas that will get Jews killed. Her words make me feel like I’m listening to the kind of ideas about America that had long been relegated to college campuses.
Meyers also asked a misleading rhetorical question about whether people could be “critical” of Israel without being called anti-Semitic. Virtually every member of the Barack Obama administration was critical of Israel. Tons of people are critical of Israel all the time. Omar wasn’t merely critical of Israel—and by critical of Israel, it is true that she doesn’t believe it should exist—but she smeared American Jews as seditious activists.
So I’m sorry, but your condolences over the synagogue shooting in Poway, California, don’t really hold sway when the next week you defend terrorists who fire more than 700 rockets into Israel, killing at least four people for no other reason than that they were Jews.
Yet it’s not just the Jews. And it’s not merely that Omar dismissed the al-Qaida mass murderers as “some people” who “did something.” (Meyers claims that her comments were taken out of context, which is true. They are worse in context .) It’s not only that she referred to the dozen dead U.S. soldiers and 73 wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu as participants in the “worst terrorist attack in Somalia history” and the murderer of thousands (false). It’s not that Omar blames the United States rather than authoritarianism and socialism for the devastation in Venezuela. It’s all these things. Omar dislikes America and liberalism for the same reasons she dislikes Israel.
“I’m just someone who cares about the fact that there’s someone out there who is in a minority, who has had death threats against her, and I think that we should all use the same language,” Myers said. “You’re asking her to be careful about her language, and I would ask everyone to be careful about theirs.”
What makes people think Omar isn’t careful? Maybe she’s just being honest about what she thinks of Jews. And why should her critics have trepidation about calling her out? Democrats, including nearly every presidential candidate, have defended her. They have celebrated her. They have appeared on magazine covers with her. The idea that McCain put her in danger, as Meyers suggested , is just a way to try and shut people up."
"Ladies, Stop Trying to Have Sex Like Men",thefederalist.com,Suzanne Venker,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/ladies-stop-trying-to-have-sex-like-men/,"May 9, 2019 By Suzanne Venker
In her book “Unprotected,” former campus psychiatrist Dr. Miriam Grossman introduces readers to Olivia, a college student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) who had been valedictorian of her high school class and was planning to go to medical school. After she arrived on campus, Olivia had a short-term relationship with a young man. When it ended, she had bouts of bingeing and vomiting and ended up at the campus health center, where she met Dr. Grossman.
It turns out Olivia had had her first sexual experience with the young man, and she told Grossman she couldn’t stop thinking about him. She especially couldn’t handle seeing him in class. “Why,” Olivia asked her, “do they tell you how to protect your body from herpes and pregnancy, but they don’t tell you what it does to your heart?”
Kerry Cohen, author of the memoir “Loose Girl,” can relate. In her book, Cohen examines her promiscuous past, which included sleeping with almost 40 boys and men. “Loose Girl” analyzes in great detail all of the emotions that accompanied Cohen’s sexual experiences. She reviewed the reasons why she had sex, why she chose the boys and men she did, how she felt leading up to each encounter, how she felt afterward, and what she expected to happen compared to what actually did happen. At the end of the day, what Cohen wanted was for guys to like her. “I let these men inside me, wanting to make me matter to them.”
It’s difficult to imagine the young man Olivia slept with having bouts of bingeing and vomiting and winding up at the campus health center as a result of his time with Olivia, just as it’s difficult to imagine a young man authoring a book like Cohen’s. The average guy who engages in commitment-free sex doesn’t ruminate over who he had sex with or why he did it—he knows why he did it.
Nor will he typically have sex with a woman because he wants her to like him. Many men have sex for no other reason than it’s available. “For a man, this might be a peasant trip down memory lane, counting up one’s conquests,” wrote Cohen. “But for a girl, it’s a whole other story.” A whole other story indeed.
Where did the idea that women could and should have indiscriminate sex with men originate? And when? The perfect storm for this still relatively new behavior was the sexual revolution, which proudly promoted commitment-free sex, and the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the pill—both of which occurred in the 1960s.
Prior to that time, there was both a spoken and an unspoken narrative about sex: that it is meant for marriage—or, at the very least, for a committed adult relationship. It’s true people didn’t always agree on the marriage point, but they agreed that commitment was crucial. The idea that a person would go to bed with someone she just met or didn’t know well was absurd (and taboo as well).
No more. With a magic pill that would change literally everything, and the “free sex” mentality that swept the nation, a new idea was born: women can be just like men. With pregnancy off the table, women could be free to sow their wild oats, too. Problem is, most women don’t want to. And those who do quickly learn that their bodies won’t cooperate.
Indeed, contraception may prevent pregnancy, but it can’t do a thing about female nature. It can’t make a woman a man’s sexual “equal.” Yet we operate under the delusion that it does. From college campuses to our nation’s boardrooms, women try to pursue sex the way men often do: no commitment necessary. And they’re getting burned.
I wrote an article to this effect recently entitled “ Why one-night stands don’t work for women .” It was not an argument for why one-night stands are “fine” for men but not for women. I don’t believe anyone should engage in casual sex. I agree 100 percent with Jordan Peterson’s assessment, whom I quoted at the end of my article:
People treat sex like it’s casual. It’s not. Sex is unbelievably complicated. It’s dangerous. It involves emotions. It involves pregnancy. It involves illness. It involves betrayal. It reaches right down into the roots of someone. You don’t play with something like that casually. Well, you can, but you’ll pay for it.
Peterson made this observation during one of his countless interviews, and it was unfortunately quickly forgotten. I believe it to be a truism that should be repeated over and over again, for it has never before been acknowledged by anyone in power. Instead, the assumption is that when it comes to sex, the birth control pill—in effect—turned women into men.
It didn’t. In a qualitative exploration of college hookups, the authors of the journal article “The Casualties of Casual Sex,” concluded (among other things) that women’s response to casual sex is very different from men’s:
The dominant notion of regret for females to center around shame and self-blame for engaging in sexual behaviors in the context of a hookup. Not knowing their partner and the lack of further contact with the partner seemed to compound their regrets and anger at themselves. The dominant notion of regret for males [emphasis mine] centered on disappointment over a bad choice of hookup partner. One female participant expressed this view: ‘During a hookup, females feel special, desirable, pretty; men feel hot and in control. Afterwards, females wonder if he’s going to call, what it means, did she do the right thing. Males feel nothing. Males don’t care, just as long as they get laid.
So many women today learn the hard way what their mothers or grandmothers have always known: sex for women is not the same as sex for men. Most men can have sex with a woman to whom they are not emotionally attached and not lose sleep over it. That is not the case for most women. Even the most sexually liberal woman is surprised to learn she cannot detach the way men can. She might appear indifferent toward casual sex, but her own reaction will often surprise her.
Take Alissa, 20, who has had six one-night stands and, within the past year, two different sex partners. When asked whether she thought she should be emotionally involved with someone before having sex with a guy, her contradictory views speak volumes:
No, sex is not that big of a deal. When you first have sex, it is a big deal, but once you’ve lost your virginity, it gradually becomes less important to be in love with the guy. The more you have sex, the less of a big deal it becomes … I get attached to guys I have sex with very easily because I’m very emotional; I think this is natural for all girls. If the guy is really a jerk, though, and I have nothing in common with him, then it’s a lot easier not to get emotionally involved than if I like the guy. Once I sleep with a guy, I feel that there is a bond between the two of us because we’ve shared our bodies and left ourselves vulnerable to each other. I think of the guy as being mine in a way, even though I know we don’t have a relationship.
Jessica, 21, has had six different sex partners within the past year and characterizes herself as strong feminist who “doesn’t need men in any way.” In speaking with Jessica, she gave the impression she found casual sex acceptable. But elsewhere in the interview, she admits she doesn’t engage in casual sex often because she doesn’t want to get hurt.
When I first go to bed with a guy, I wonder whether sex was all he was after and how he’ll treat me in the morning. If I like the guy, I worry about whether he cares about me; otherwise, I don’t care what he thinks. I’m not especially bothered by a one-night stand. I think of it as opening up; if it’s only for one night, that’s okay … I have to have control of myself. I can’t get so wrapped up in [my boyfriend] that I forget about myself.
That women tend to become attached after sex isn’t just limited to college women. In one of the sexual assault claims against disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, lawyers unearthed emails between Weinstein and his accuser that confirmed the relationship was consensual. The most significant exchange was this one: “I love you, always do,” the woman wrote after the alleged attack. “But I hate feeling like a booty call.” Her message was followed up with a smiling-face emoji.
With uncommitted sex, women are playing a game they can’t win. Feeling “used,” or like a “booty call,” is the most common experience of women who engage in casual sex, or “hookups,” whether they’re teenagers or grown women. That just isn’t the case for most men.
It is true more women than ever are engaging in commitment-free sex—Lord knows they’re trying!—but this behavior does not in any way alter the unique sexual psychologies of women and men. In other words, women can try to act like men all they want. But the results will be drastically different for most of them.

Colorado Students Walk Out Of School Shooting Vigil After It Turns Political,thefederalist.com,Mollie Hemingway,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/colorado-students-walk-out-of-school-shooting-vigil-after-it-turns-political/,"May 9, 2019 By Mollie Hemingway
Colorado students walked out of an event billed as a vigil for Kendrick Castillo, an 18-year-old killed in a shooting at his school on Tuesday, when prominent speakers attempted to turn it into a rally for gun control. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colorado) each took a turn calling for gun control at the Douglas County event before students streamed out in protest.
Two students at STEM Highlands Ranch , a K-12 charter school focused on science, technology, engineering, and math, shot nine students , one fatally. The accused students, who were arrested, are an adult male and a juvenile female who identifies as male. The accused male had written anti-Christian social media messages. He drove a car with a pentagram spray-painted on the hood, as well as other graffiti:
In response to the shooting, a public vigil was announced at another local public high school: Highlands Ranch High School. It was sponsored by the gun control groups Brady’s Team Enough and March for Our Lives and featured Democratic politicians who seek limits on Second Amendment gun rights, but was billed instead as an event to remember and honor Castillo and other victims. As the politicians called for gun control, students left in protest over the politicization of the deaths and injuries.
Bennet, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president and is pictured in the tweet below, said , “We live in a great country, but we need to fix these broken gun laws.” Students from the #STEMshooting in Colorado stormed out of a rally organized by gun-control advocates Wednesday night after growing angry about the politicization of their trauma. pic.twitter.com/uCLEqt89VY

Students then returned to the gymnasium, taking over the event, complaining about adults politicizing what they hoped would be a remembrance of their friend Castillo, a young man with an interest in robotics who had heroically rushed a shooter. Students also gave Bennet a piece of their mind, telling him to focus on “ mental health ” issues. Students from Highlands Ranch HS hosted a community vigil in support of STEM students. A group of STEM students and other walked out of the event after a few voiced concerns about not being listed as speakers for the vigil program. #9News pic.twitter.com/3kA7bbnjAS

Following a terrible school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last year, CNN hosted an anti-gun rally that whitewashed Sheriff Scott Israel’s fatal errors, blamed Second Amendment supporter Dana Loesch as a culprit , allowed Sen. Marco Rubio to be equated to the school shooter, and lifted up Democratic politicians such as Ted Deutsch as heroes. Mollie Ziegler Hemingway is a senior editor at The Federalist.

Not Getting Your First-Choice Gay Wedding Cake Is Nothing Like Getting The Measles,thefederalist.com,Nathanael Blake,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/not-getting-first-choice-gay-wedding-cake-nothing-like-getting-measles/,"By Nathanael Blake May 9, 2019
Cake is rarely a matter of life or death, although British comedian Eddie Izzard once suggested that the Church of England is so squishy that an Anglican Inquisition would offer a choice between cake or death . This bit of absurdist humor was recently one-upped by The New York Times, which published a rambling column by Margaret Renkl that concluded: “It’s time to stop giving believers a pass just because their beliefs happen to run counter to the laws of the nation they live in. Human lives may depend on it.”
Among these hazards of religious liberty are bakers whose “religious convictions prevent [them] from baking a wedding cake for a gay couple.” Other dangers include school prayer and employers offering workers health insurance that does not cover some contraceptives. Also, measles.
One of these things is not like the others. Not Getting Your First-Choice Cake Isn’t Life-Threatening
Measles can be a life-threatening disease. Not getting a custom ceremonial pastry from one’s first-choice bakery is less so, as is listening to school prayer and buying birth control for oneself. Furthermore, although there are religious communities that oppose vaccination to varying degrees (Renkl singles out “ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities”), the movement against vaccines has been driven by bad science and fearmongering frauds like disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, not by religious doctrine.
So why is the Times publishing pieces conflating life-threatening diseases with difficulties in decorative cake acquisition? If Renkl and her editors are concerned about religious exemptions to measles vaccinations, they could have written and published an article focused on that and saved the cake wars and school-prayer fights for another time. Rather, they mostly seem to care about measles outbreaks as a means to attack religious liberty claims by conservative Christians.
Their theory seems to be that allowing any religious liberty claims opens the door to spurious and dangerous claims of religious liberty. But this is a non sequitur. There are well-established legal doctrines that do not allow religious liberty claims to be an unquestioned “get out of jail free” card.
However, this jurisprudence does put the burden of proof on the government when it seeks to restrict the free exercise of religion. That the government may have a compelling interest in restricting religious liberty with regard to vaccinations for potentially deadly diseases does not mean that the government also has a compelling interest in forcing people to produce customized ceremonial pastries.
This should be obvious, but Renkl seems to reject all religious liberty claims that might hinder government action. If arbitrary power is the goal, all limiting factors on government authority are rejected as a matter of principle. This inverts the American principle that the government bears the burden of proof when it seeks restrictions on fundamental liberties, and it will not be confined to squashing religious liberty claims. The Never-ending Desire for Government Control
Leftists want to control pretty much everything. They desire a world in which the government controls education and health care and regulates commerce. Nothing is too inconsequential for them to dictate, so they believe the federal government must tell employers what contraceptive coverage to include in health insurance plans. The government must require bakers and other wedding vendors to create custom products for ceremonies they abhor.
Thus, despite all of their talk about multiculturalism, progressivism is incompatible with pluralism. The more government regulates, the less opportunity there is for diverse communities and ways of life to develop and flourish. As government expands, the space for belief and action that do not comport with government opinion shrinks. Pluralism requires the government to back off and leave room for diverse communities, beliefs, and ways of life, intervening only when necessary.
This genuine pluralism would not resolve all difficult questions, but it would restrict conflict to them, instead of bringing the force of government down on a few recalcitrant crafters of wedding accessories and foodstuffs. It would not casually use the coercive force of government.
Renkl probably does not consider herself a violent person, but she is an enthusiast for an expanding system of state violence. Behind every government rule and regulation is the barrel of a gun. This is often cloaked, but those who ignore or defy the government long enough will find men with guns (and a willingness to use them) coming for them. Sometimes the cloak is barely there—many of the laws being deployed against nonconformist wedding vendors include jail time among the penalties.
Government edicts always have an “or else” to ensure compliance. Little old white liberal ladies do not personally enforce the laws they lobby for, but someone does and even minor interactions with law enforcement can turn deadly. A writer for The New York Times should remember the death of Eric Garner, killed by the police arresting him for allegedly selling single cigarettes. In an egregious case in Maryland, cops working security murdered a man with Down syndrome over a movie theater ticket.
This is the system of state-sanctioned violence Renkl will rely on in to punish religious nonconformists in disputes over ceremonial pastries. Cake or death, indeed. Nathanael Blake is a Senior Contributor at The Federalist. He has a PhD in political theory. He lives in Missouri. Photo"
Why Anita Hill’s Grudge Against Joe Biden Could Be His Achilles’ Heel,thefederalist.com,Jonathan S. Tobin,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/anita-hills-grudge-against-joe-biden-could-be-his-achilles-heel/,"By Jonathan S. Tobin May 9, 2019
The rollout of Joe Biden’s third presidential campaign went about as well as he could have hoped. Despite his lackluster performances in the campaign debut video and some of his first speeches since declaring his candidacy, Biden raised impressive amounts of money and saw his already strong poll numbers go up once he entered the ranks of the already swollen Democratic presidential field.
With the current RealClearPolitics average of polls showing him with a 39 to 15.5 percent lead over Bernie Sanders and with the rest of the field only in single digits, Biden deserves the title of early Democratic frontrunner. Unfortunately for him, Biden has a problem named Anita Hill.
Biden carries an enormous amount of political baggage after almost a half-century in Washington politics. His opposition to forced busing for desegregation in the 1970s is heresy in today’s intersectional Democratic Party, where identity politics is the coin of the realm. His championing of the 1994 crime bill that is credited with massively increasing the number of African-Americans who have been incarcerated is just as much of a problem for the same reason.
But unlike those issues, Biden’s Anita Hill problem is embodied in a person rather than a talking point. Since, as Hill recently told The New York Times, she has not been mollified by his recent expression of “regret” (but not an apology) for his conduct toward her in 1991 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, that could create the kind of obstacle that might be enough to outweigh electability in the eyes of a critical mass of Democratic primary voters.
The Biden lead is built on three elements. One is his near-universal name recognition after eight years as vice president and 36 years in the Senate. The other is his reputation as President Barack Obama’s loyal foot soldier, a real asset in a party where the 44th president is still political royalty. Last and perhaps most important is the belief that he is the most electable Democrat running, something members of the anti-Trump “resistance” value perhaps even more than ideology. Can Biden Beat Trump?
To Democrats, including many who count themselves as staunch liberals, beating Trump and making the bad dream of 2016 finally go away is all they care about.
Seen in the light of their desperate desire to oust Trump, nominating a woman, a minority, or a gay man who better represents the beliefs of the party base doesn’t seem so important. If Biden can manage to spend the next year campaigning in a manner that will give Democrats the impression that he can stand up to Trump and avoid sounding like the “crazy old Joe” stereotype that the president will pound away at (such as his recent statement in which he said “Margaret Thatcher” rather than “Theresa May” when referring to the current British prime minister), then he might coast to the nomination despite the competition.
Many Democratic voters came of age long after the epic and divisive battles over busing and aren’t likely to judge Biden too harshly because of what he said during the Nixon, Ford, or Carter administrations. The same is largely true for the crime bill that was passed a quarter-century ago.
Those issues also have less power because Biden is not running as a moderate Democrat but as one who is very interested in portraying himself as just as much of a supporter of radical causes like the Green New Deal and a vast expansion of federal entitlements. Although it dates back to events that took place nearly 28 years ago, his Anita Hill problem poses a much greater danger to his prospects. When Me Too and Anita Hill Join Forces
That is partly due to the enormous importance of the Me Too movement that began to dominate conversations about sexual harassment and assault in late 2017. It was lost on no one that the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last fall was something of a rerun of the circus surrounding the Thomas hearings Biden presided over. The treatment of Hill must now be viewed as a contemporary concern rather than one rooted primarily in history, as is the case with Biden’s other past stands.
Hill also looms as a threat to his candidacy because Biden is too afraid of the left to defend himself. Although the notion of his cruelty to Hill is now part of the liberal catechism, the truth is that Biden doesn’t owe her any regrets, let alone an apology.
Biden didn’t merely vote against Thomas. The justice and his defenders rightly held Biden responsible for the circus atmosphere in which Democrats brought forward a last-minute accusation to derail his confirmation.
Thomas was looking directly at Biden when he famously said that he was being subjected to “a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks” in which unsubstantiated “sleaze” was being publicly hurled at him. Thomas’s impassioned defense of his character and reputation convinced the majority of Americans at the time, and that convinced the Senate to narrowly confirm him.
But over time, as Thomas maintained a dignified silence about his ordeal, his detractors in popular culture and the media seized control of the narrative. In that retelling, the judge’s guilt was assumed. That’s how Hill acquired the reputation as a secular saint who had been sacrificed by men like Biden on the altar of male privilege.
Although the collective memory of the hearings is now one in which Hill was scorned and disbelieved, the senators did not treat Hill discourteously. They did question her closely about her charges; they asked for details. They probed for inconsistencies and asked reasonable questions about her dealings with Thomas and how and why she had stepped forward to accuse him.
That was enough to raise doubts about her testimony in the minds of the public as well as the admittedly, all-male committee. Moreover, as the late senator Arlen Specter (who was Hill’s most persistent questioner on the committee) noted later in his memoirs, Biden admitted to him that he believed Hill was lying. Is Biden to Blame for Hill’s Poor Showing?
The idea that Biden should have conducted the hearings differently only makes sense if those accused of sexual misconduct must be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. Biden’s committee didn’t prevent Hill from making explicit and detailed accusations about what she said Thomas had said and done. And the accusation that he denied her right to bring in corroborating witnesses is another myth that collapses upon closer examination . But in the Me Too era, asking an accuser to substantiate or corroborate her allegations is considered to be a form of unconscionable abuse.
That’s why, when Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse Kavanaugh of teenage misbehavior that could neither be conclusively proved nor disproved, none of the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee dared pose a single question to her. Even their designated counsel refrained from doing anything more than gently asking about details with nary a question about any inconsistencies or discrepancies in her story.
The reckoning for a culture in which sexual harassment and even assault was not treated as serious crimes was long overdue when the Me Too movement emerged. But the idea that those who make such accusations should not be challenged or that the accused has no right to defend themselves against what they allege to be false charges are parodies of American justice.
The problem for Biden is not just the way the public now views the Thomas hearings, but also the fact that Hill seems to be still burning with resentment at him. Hill is a living, breathing symbol of Me Too who could, if she chooses, act as a personal scourge of Biden that could be greatly destructive of his presidential hopes.
Should Hill be willing to keep speaking out about Biden’s alleged offenses, it will be a far more telling blow than any references to the Thomas hearings, either direct or oblique, from the other Democratic challengers. As her New York Times interview indicated, Hill intends to judge Biden’s performance in the upcoming campaign. That leaves open the possibility that she may choose to personally intervene to make further demands upon Biden, to claim that his responses are unsatisfactory or to give a boost to one of his competitors that could demolish his lead.
In a very real sense, Anita Hill holds Biden’s presidential future in her hands. Jonathan S. Tobin is editor in chief of JNS.org and a contributing writer for National Review. Follow him on Twitter . Photo"
"Stumping In NYC, Dan Crenshaw Says AOC Knows ‘How To Be Famous’",thefederalist.com,David Marcus,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/stumping-nyc-dan-crenshaw-says-aoc-knows-famous/,"By David Marcus May 9, 2019
Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw was in Brooklyn and Staten Island last week, stumping for Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis in her bid to win New York’s 11th congressional district. Even though we are well more than a year away from the 2020 election, the visit from the Texas congressman may hold some clues about how House Republicans plan to reverse their 2018 losses and perhaps even take back the chamber.
Three things at work here deserve some notice. First is Crenshaw himself, who has emerged as leading young voice in the GOP. Second is Malliotakis, a prototype of a young, diverse, female candidate in a swing suburbanish district. Finally, looming in the background are Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the far-left socialist wing of the House Democratic caucus.
Through a combination of charisma, social media savvy, and a turn on “Saturday Night Live,” Crenshaw has become a big voice in the Republican Party whom we can expect to see stumping for candidates all over the country. Malliotakis told me in an interview, “He’s a rising star in the party. A Navy SEAL war hero and congressman. He’s unique.”
I asked Crenshaw about his newfound fame and how he plans to use that opportunity, and while he told me he doesn’t plan to be involved in many primaries, in some cases like Malliotakis’s he sees a “clear-cut opportunity to support somebody and get them out [of the primary] quickly and unscathed.” It is clear that he sees a role for himself in helping to prime the pump for GOP victories and will be not just an asset to candidates, but someone thinking about a broader strategy that can win.
Malliotakis appears to be exactly the kind of candidate that Republicans need to compete in the districts, like NY11, that they lost in 2018. Crenshaw emphasized that, “We need more young smart, experienced women in the GOP to get out our message.” Malliotakis, who took on Bill de Blasio in the 2017 New York mayor’s race, fits that bill to a T.
Her brand of politics is focused on good government, urging that “Government should be utilizing tax dollars properly and putting resources where they should be, keep us safe, make sure the public school system is a good one, focus on infrastructure, roads, and transit.” Her approach is more about making government work for the people and less about the government being the problem.
But while both Crenshaw and Malliotakis want to focus on what Republicans can achieve if they take back the House, especially with a Trump economy going like gangbusters, there is an unavoidable and indelible force to fight against in front of them too. Ocasio-Cortez, whose district is a mere three miles from NY11, and her cadre of committed socialists will be an important and obvious target for all GOP candidates looking to recapture purple districts. This is something Democratic leadership understands too, and it explains their flailing and failing efforts to tamp the radical flames.
For Malliotakis this is personal. Her family had to flee Cuba after the Communist revolution there, all except her grandfather who stayed behind to try to protect gas stations and a home that he owned from state seizure. Her mother never saw her father again. “Socialism is Communism lite,” Malliotakis told me. She went on to say that people who have experienced it take a very different and dimmer view of it than people who have only learned about it in a classroom.
On paper, Malliotakis’ opponent is Rep. Max Rose, a war veteran and a Democrat desperate to cast himself as a moderate. But in some sense the real opponent is AOC and far-left New Progressives. In that fight, Malliotakis presents a convex mirror image of Ocasio-Cortez, and is a candidate who cannot be brushed off with quips about race or sex.
When I asked Crenshaw about Ocasio-Cortez, he was a bit more demure when I suggested he was the GOP’s version. “We operate on very different wavelengths,” he told me, but went on to say, “we utilize social media, we try to connect with voters in a way that’s not only about politics. Letting people into your lives.” He discussed how he and his team are meticulous in how they approach social media and branding in general.
In a moment that felt almost like admiration Crenshaw said, “AOC understands how to be famous. It’s got to be natural. It’s genuine.” That is, of course, something that Crenshaw has in his back pocket, too. It is very easy to see why candidates like Malliotakis want him in their districts and why the national Republican Party will want to put him front and center.
After either party gains huge victories in the House there is generally a correction. Some of those close wins go back the other way, especially in a presidential election cycle. Rose won NY11 by a comfortable margin against a fairly lackluster opponent in 2018, but Malliotakis is anything but lackluster.
If the GOP can field candidates like her, in districts like that, and let Crenshaw be a leading figure and voice, they may have something. And based on Crenshaw already stumping for 2020, it seems like they know it.

Dear Wives: Publicly Criticizing Your Husband Makes You Look Horrible,thefederalist.com,Melissa Langsam Braunstein,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/dear-wives-publicly-criticizing-husband-makes-look-horrible/,"By Melissa Langsam Braunstein May 9, 2019
As a 22-year-old, I didn’t know who I would end up dating or marrying, but I felt sure there would be no fellow writer, especially not a fiction writer. There was something intrinsically off-putting about the thought of getting close to someone who might use my life and quirks to tell my story their way. And what if things soured? I assumed I really wouldn’t like what I read.
So I can only imagine what it’s like to read about yourself in a non-fictional account, particularly when your spouse is putting you on blast in a major national newspaper. If this were a one-time thing, I might shake my head. But after reading the latest installment in the “my husband disappoints me” genre in The New York Times last weekend — this one penned by a clinical psychologist — I’d say we have a trend. And America, we need to talk.
Darcy Lockman, whose editors sneeringly titled her opinion article, “What ‘Good’ Dads Get Away With,” opens by telling us, “When my husband and I became parents a decade ago, we were not prepared for the ways in which sexism was about to express itself in our relationship.” She proceeds to describe her husband’s cluelessness and lack of engagement, as well as their disagreement about whether she frequently noted his (perceived) failings.
As I read this, I suspected I was supposed to identify with the writer and cackle about what a jerk her husband is. Yet my sympathies were with him. How did he feel reading about himself in The Times and having countless people read this unflattering account? Did his wife bother to run a draft of this article by him before publication? And would there be more unfortunate details in his wife’s forthcoming book, entitled “All the Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership?”
I know the answers to none of those questions. However, I do know that if someone wants me to change the way I’m doing something, the most effective strategy is to speak directly to me. Not starting from the assumption that I’m doing things a certain way to be annoying, or that I’m driven by malice, laziness, or sexism. Not attacking me, and definitely not savaging me in front of a crowd.
I presume this describes most people, including most men. So, why are a growing number of women publicly criticizing their husbands ?
Women have probably vented about marital frustrations since men and women started pairing off. Yet it’s one thing to confide in a trusted friend or relative who knows both players and supports the continued existence of the marriage. It’s an entirely different kettle of fish to gripe publicly or commit those complaints to print, where they can be read by friends, relatives, colleagues, and endless strangers.
It’s hard to pinpoint when this trend erupted, although looking at the widely admired Michelle Obama might be a worthwhile starting point. In 2007, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote about wincing “when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal.” In Michelle’s words, “‘For some reason this guy still can’t manage to put the butter up when he makes toast, secure the bread so that it doesn’t get stale, and his 5-year-old is still better at making the bed than he is.’” Oh, and Barack didn’t put his dirty socks in the laundry.
Now, I shared Michelle’s distaste for the messianic tone some of her husband’s supporters used when discussing him. I still don’t know that I would have said the above about him. But we were all able to evaluate Barack Obama on his own. We knew both halves of the couple (from a distance), and the American people had an independent relationship with each spouse.
That can’t be said about most other men in America. Most husbands are not public figures, nor are their wives. When one half of a couple takes to print and chides the other for personal failings, it’s like being asked to play back-up in a stranger’s marital squabble. One or both parties may be justified in their dissatisfaction with the status quo, but the public can’t judge fairly, because we typically hear only one side.
Nor should we necessarily hear both sides. These disagreements are inherently about private matters. The question is whether it’s appropriate to take a spouse to task publicly. The spouse doing the writing may find the experience cathartic and delight in the subsequent online affirmation, but does the silent spouse ever appreciate facing a digital mob?
Did Victoria Bissell Brown ’s “husband of 50 years” appreciate her “30 minutes of from-the-gut yelling” when she decided she “hate[d] all men and wish[ed] all men were dead” last October? Was it even better to relive when all of America read about it in The Washington Post ?
When Gemma Hartley wrote in Harper’s Bazaar about her husband’s messing up her Mother’s Day gift, because he cleaned their bathroom himself rather than hiring a maid service, she earned a book deal. But did her husband gain anything from the world’s hearing his wife’s exasperated internal monologue?
Now, I get it. The clean bathroom wasn’t really the gift in Hartley’s mind; she wanted her husband to vet and manage such a company’s visit (and is fortunate they can afford that). I also understand full well how unpleasant it can be to do housework. But let’s note that we’re not the first generation to notice that. Comedic actress Carol Channing had a whole spoken ode to sharing housework on “Free to Be You and Me” almost 50 years ago.
There is wisdom is dividing household chores, because it is largely a parade of drudgery. And in homes where wives do the lion’s share of these unglamorous but highly necessary tasks, sage husbands will appreciate and acknowledge that effort year-round, but perhaps especially this Mother’s Day weekend.
By contrast, there is no obvious wisdom in publicly shaming your husband. What does that win you at home? What does that do to your marriage?
One of the best bits of advice I ever read was in a parenting book: “What’s obvious to you is obvious to you.” In other words, ladies, if you’re unhappy with your situation, speak to your husband about it. He loves you and cares about your happiness. You’re more likely to resolve whatever’s troubling you if you’re clear about what you’d like to change. But please, for the sake of your marriage and any children, do it privately.

Why College Professors And Administrators Are A Greater Threat Than Crazy Students,thefederalist.com,Sumantra Maitra,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/college-professors-administrators-greater-threat-crazy-students/,"By Sumantra Maitra May 9, 2019
Tom Nichols writes in The Atlantic about how student totalitarianism is destroying campuses and higher education in the West. The idea is so obvious that it barely needs mentioning. The Western higher education system has been in a death spiral for at least a decade now, and it is only recently that non-conservative academic elites seem to have noticed.
What apparently broke the camel’s back was some activists’ attempt to replace University of the Arts professor Camille Paglia, a well-known genderqueer feminist, with a queer professor who is non-Caucasian. Nichols writes, “this is the kind of demand that sounds like it could have come out of China during the Cultural Revolution—if Maoists had been as obsessed with race and sexuality as they were with class.”
He blames it on student mobs, and writes that this “is not activism so much as it is preening would-be totalitarianism. If college is to become something more than a collection of trade schools on one end and a group of overpriced coffeehouses on the other, Americans have to think about how we got here and how to restore some sanity to the crucial enterprise of higher education.”
His suggestion to solve this is for faculty and administrators to “recognize a shameless dereliction of duty” and to “pull students back from the precipice of moral purity and work with them to acquire the skills and values that not only imbue tolerance, but provide for the rational discussion of opposing, and even hateful, views.”
I hesitate to accuse Nichols of being half right. I also teach at a university and therefore observe the rot from within. It is increasingly a fashion to harrumph against the students for everything. It gives older academics and public intellectuals a moral glow without them having to face the real and uncomfortable beast.
It is not the students who are the cause. It is a certain section of professors, academics, and departments that act as Soviet political commissars within campuses. Put simply, this all is an intra-academic war, where students are simply pawns in a greater power play.
Let’s test a simple hypothesis, shall we, as the “Death of Expertise” professor would surely agree to: How many of the recent publicized illiberal campus incidents were instigated organically by the students, and how many were instigated by academics? Consider the recent evidence.
The “decolonize” movements in Cambridge , Oxford , and Yale are led by ideologues posing as professors . Another group of university professors came together to cancel a play that was critical of intersectionality, identity politics, and Black Lives Matter, arguing that it was done for the emotional well-being of their students.
Likewise, an essay in Heritage by a Boise State University professor questioning gender studies was shut down by the university officials after an outcry that the article “represented the root of genocide.” In Cambridge, a decolonize movement was started by a group of activist students inspired by “support” from the Marxist, post-colonial academic Priyamvada Gopal, who was also the mastermind behind the plot to stop the colonial legacy project at Oxford .
The violent protests against Charles Murray at Middlebury College was fueled by academics who wrote open letters against inviting him. Most of these academics are of course, needless to mention, not from Murray’s field of studies, and therefore not qualified to judge his work.
In Berkeley, a section of academics wrote an open letter against Milo Yiannopoulis calling for no-platforming him. Twelve out of 13 academics who signed the original letter were from critical theory, gender studies, and post-modernist/Marxist backgrounds. At Yale University, a movement against teaching Shakespeare in English courses was spearheaded by postmodernist academics . Everyone of course remembers Melissa Click .
All this took me just an hour to Google. If someone pays me a grant to investigate, I am fairly certain I can find, behind every single case of student activism, the hands of activist professors.
The latest and ongoing travesty is the mobbing and firing of Dr. Noah Carl from Cambridge University, once again after an open letter by, well, academics. As Claire Lehmann, the editor of Quillette , wrote in an editorial about the incident, “To judge the quality of Dr Noah Carl’s work authoritatively, one would have to be an expert in at least one of the following fields: psychology, intelligence research (a sub-field of psychology), and/or economics. The campaign against him began with an ‘open letter’ that was signed by hundreds of academics, but they did not have expertise in these areas. (For the most part, they had qualifications in fields like anthropology, gender studies and critical race studies).”
She added, “The administrators at St Edmund’s College who determined that Dr Noah Carl should be fired did not have qualifications in these areas, either. The Master of St. Edmunds is a former banker, and the administrator who led the investigation that decided Dr Carl is guilty of ‘poor scholarship’ is a veterinary scientist.”
There’s a certain complacency among a section of intellectuals who still mentally live in the heady days of the early ‘90s. They appear to think that the biggest threat to the Western way of life is a couple of privileged middle-class brats wearing balaclavas and pretending to be Trotsky.
They are not. They are exactly what it looks like: middle-class brats who are so privileged that they seek cheap thrills and a purpose in life, while breaking glass windows of closed apparel shops and waving a rainbow flag with Che Guevara’s face on it, the irony completely lost on them.
They have never seen an actual street fight. Most of them have never even faced any actual physical hardship in any way comparable to what their forefathers faced, and are live-action role players of the worst kind, because they have also never faced a concerted kick back, from either their parents, or university faculties, or increasingly impotent law enforcement officials. At the first sign of real violent backlash, these kids will simply flock back to their parents’ basements.
No, the real threat is activist and academic departments, the children of the 1960s revolution who are now in charge, who have realized since the 1990s that the hope for an actual social revolution within the West lies through the long march through the Institutions . Churning out activist students to act as pawns and flooding media and academia with them is a much smarter way to change society from within.
But to accept this would require addressing the bigger, uncomfortable question: What to do with these activist departments that are openly trying to take over academia, and be the arbiters of morality and intellectual debates? It would require brutal policy answers, instead of empty harrumphing. These are answers that I suspect Nichols and his kind might not like to ponder. It’s much easier to blame a bunch of gullible students and feel mighty happy about it. Sumantra Maitra is a doctoral researcher at the University of Nottingham, UK, and a writer for The Federalist.

5 Things We Learned From Amy Klobuchar’s Town Hall On Fox,thefederalist.com,Kyle Sammin,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/5-things-learned-amy-klobuchars-town-hall-fox/,"By Kyle Sammin May 9, 2019
On Wednesday night, Amy Klobuchar became the second Democratic presidential candidate to appear in a Fox News Town hall event, following Bernie Sanders’s appearance last month .
Sanders has always marched to the beat of his own drummer, but Klobuchar’s appearance on the network marks the first break in the boycott by establishment Democrats. It’s a smart strategy for a candidate who has struggled to make her voice heard amid the growing horde of candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020.
Here’s what we learned. 1. Heartland Amy
The senior senator from Minnesota, Klobuchar is a Midwesterner and her focus on that region came up again and again in the town hall. The event was in Milwaukee, so this tactic went over well with the Midwestern crowd, but it also addresses a problem Democrats have been puzzling over since 2016.
The vaunted “blue wall” of the Electoral College ran from New England to Pennsylvania and through the upper Midwest, plus the Pacific Coast. However attached the Democratic Party got to the neoliberal consensus the Clintons practiced, they thought they could never lose that blue wall.
They were trading on a legacy put in place by Franklin Roosevelt, in which they were the party of the worker, the miner, the famer. Indeed, the Minnesota branch of the Democratic Party still calls itself the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, a relic of the fusion politics of those days.
But FDR has not been on the ticket since 1944, and Donald Trump made a hash of the Democrats’ claim to be the workingman’s party—a claim that has had increasingly less evidence to support it over the past few decades. Hillary Clinton’s loss of Ohio, Michigan, and above all Wisconsin signaled how deep the Midwest’s disillusionment with national Democrats has gotten.
Klobuchar sees, rightly, that a Republican Party that gets the votes of the South, the Plains, and the Midwest is almost impossible to defeat. As a Midwesterner, one of the few in the race, she sees herself as the best spokesperson for the region.
How does that play out in policy terms? That’s where it gets a little fuzzy. She talks about prosperity being shared unequally, a common complaint of Trump voters. The idea that much of our economic success is being accumulated on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley is one that resounds with a lot of Americans. Klobuchar nodded at that sentiment, but offered nothing different from the Clinton campaign in actually addressing it. 2. Moderate or Progressive?
One audience question from a grad student and podcaster probed Klobuchar’s progressive bona fides. There are now nearly two dozen Democratic candidates, each leapfrogging the others for the title of Wokest of the Woke.
Klobuchar stands somewhat outside the pack. From a state that almost went for Trump in 2016, she has never had the political leeway to be a liberal firebrand, even if she were so inclined. Yet the Democratic primary electorate expects Full Socialism at all times.
Klobuchar tries to square the circle by calling herself “a proven progressive.” It’s quite similar to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 promise to be “a progressive president who gets results,” and for the same reasons.
Klobuchar is a realist. She knows that even with the supermajorities the Democrats had in the first two years of the Obama administration, not every socialist dream could come true. America, even when it swings left, has a conservative temperament. We don’t like utopian schemes.
As someone from a swing state, Klobuchar knows that. Most of the more openly progressive candidates know it, too; they’re just morally flexible enough to play along with the radical’s make-believe. 3. The Victim Game
Klobuchar does not like to play the victim game. An audience member asked if early coverage of her campaign was sexist, and she brushed aside the idea pretty quickly. That alone makes her stand out among politicians.
Taking offense, being the victim, and whining about life’s vicissitudes are the bread and butter of the modern pol, no less on the right than the left. It may have begun among the Democrats, but Republicans also now love to cry outrage whenever anyone slights them or treats them unfairly.
Klobuchar has no real need to appear tough—if anything, the rumors of her treatment of her office staff make her look too tough—but not indulging in self-pity over news coverage was a welcome change. 4. Bomb Iran
The only foreign policy question of the night involved the current movement of a carrier group to the Persian Gulf in response to Iranian nuclear provocations. World affairs have not been Klobuchar’s focus in the Senate, but she acquitted herself well. Her answer to Bret Baier’s question—what we she do about Iran if she were president right now—was Clintonian.
First saying that she never would have left the Iran Deal, as Trump did, she acknowledged that it had flaws, without specifying what those flaws were. She then said that Iran must never be allowed a nuclear weapon, mentioning the threat to global peace and to Israel specifically, a contrast with progressives’ increasing distaste for the Jewish state.
But she also said that war must be avoided. Her answer was more about style of foreign policy than substance, but style has a substance all its own. It was a decent, if vague, response to a question that has stymied many people before her. 5. Some Things Are Different On Fox
Fox is known as a conservative network, but the questions from the crowd contained their share of softballs. An audience member asked Klobuchar a question about the rights of women “pursuing reproductive health-care services” and how Klobuchar would increase access to such rights.
The questioner, whom the network identified as “student” but whom could also have been identified just as truthfully as “former intern to two Democratic Congresswomen,” elicited a response from Klobuchar along much the same lines, a lengthy dialogue on these mysterious services that never once called them by name.
Martha MacCallum’s follow-up question shattered the illusion, asking Klobuchar how she could endorse unlimited access to abortion when 80 percent of Americans think third-trimester abortions should be banned. Klobuchar handled it well: her answer was assuredly pro-abortion, but she did not get tripped up by having to actually name the thing she supports. She also dared to say what used to be common parlance in the Democratic Party: that we should reduce the number of abortions (although not by banning it or restricting it in any way.)
It’s a minor difference from the other networks, but an important one. On MSNBC or CNN, the audience plants, the anchors, and the candidate would all have been on the same page about social issues like abortion. Not only would Klobuchar have not been challenged on her position, she likely wouldn’t have even had to say the word.
For Democratic candidates from deep blue states, having to defend themselves on this and other hot-button issues is unknown. Their biggest fights are to win the Democratic nomination, with the general election being just a walkover.
Klobuchar has had to defend her views to the voters before, and seemed comfortable with the process. The other Democratic candidates would be wise to follow her over to Fox for an hour to sharpen their skills. If not, they might well get an unpleasant surprise in the general election.

Parents Who Lost A Child Need A Day Of Remembrance Like Mother’s And Father’s Day,thefederalist.com,Helen Raleigh,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/parents-lost-child-need-day-remembrance-like-mothers-fathers-day/,"By Helen Raleigh May 9, 2019
Mother’s Day is right around the corner, and the Father’s Day isn’t too far behind. These are great holidays for our society to celebrate parenthood, and for children to show their appreciation for their parents. Yet these holidays can be extremely difficult times for angel parents—parents who have lost their children.
Angel parents won’t be woken up by kisses planted on their faces by their children. They won’t receive a handmade card with big hearts and words like, “I love you, Mommy,” or “Happy Father’s Day, Daddy.” There won’t be a breakfast in bed and flowers delivered to the door. All the things parents with living children take for granted aren’t an option for these angel parents. These holidays serve as especially painful reminders to angel parents of the tremendous loss they endure.
One mom tells me that she wants to find a place to hide from the rest of the world on Mother’s Day. She doesn’t want to be triggered, nor does she want to feel like an unwelcome intrusion to a world in a celebratory mood. She finds acquaintances sometimes avoid her on these special occasions, too, probably because they don’t know what to say.
Since child loss affects many American parents, maybe we should have a special day for them—a national day for angel parents. Having such a day will help break the cultural stigma to talk about losing a child, increase societal understanding of grief and how to address it better, and maybe even help us strive to find ways to reduce certain type of losses. Help Break the Cultural Stigma
Parents lose children for a variety of reasons: pregnancy losses, infant deaths, traffic accidents, drug overdoses, suicides, and more. Such losses happen more often than most people realize. For example, 24,000 infants die in stillbirths in the United States every year. That is equivalent to a school bus full of babies lost every day. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the United States lost 10,812 young people aged 15 to 19 in 2016. The top three leading causes of adolescent death are accidents, suicide, and homicide.
Whatever the cause of death, the loss of a child violates the natural order we understand—that we should be buried by our children, not the other way around. American culture is so obsessed with looking, feeling, and acting like a young person that the death of someone young is unthinkable.
We are generally uncomfortable talking about it or even going out of our way to avoid talking about it. We often don’t know what to say to parents who lost a child. Yet unwillingness to talk about it doesn’t make the loss disappear. Silence on this subject not only leaves many parents ill-prepared when such tragedy happens. It also leaves their support network struggling with how to help.
Most angel parents I speak to say they want to talk about the children they lost as long as anyone is willing to listen. Talking is healing and talking is one of the few options left for these parents to keep their children’s memories alive.
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will help breakdown the social stigma surrounding talking about the death of a child. It’s a way for the rest of society to let angel parents know we recognize your loss. You are not alone, and we are here to listen. Our Society Can Get Better at Handling Grief
Our culture has a limited understanding of grief and has done a poor job of addressing it thus far. We live in a fast-paced internet age. Everyone has a short attention span.
For people who haven’t experienced the loss of a loved one yet, it’s easy to think losing a loved one is a momentary thing. After you lose someone, people around you may come to visit you, bring food and flowers, or send cards in the first weeks. They assume you will be sad for a while—maybe a few months or a few years. But sooner or later, you are expected to move on.
But there is no “moving on” from a loss, especially when you lose a child. Like all parents, angel parents had planned and envisioned a future with their child being the most important part of it. Now that their child is gone, such loss leaves a big hole in the parent’s future. Every day and every possible moment, the angel parent is walking into this new future, a broken one. How could they move on?
One angel dad who lost his infant daughter 20 years ago recently told me that he and his wife have been visiting his daughter’s grave on her birthday and putting up a special Christmas tree for her at home for 20 years. He expects they will continue doing these things to keep their daughter’s memory alive for as long as they live. When he uttered her daughter’s name to me, he broke down in tears. After 20 years, he’s learned to manage his pain, but the pain never goes away.
A short poem by W.S. Mervin describes how angel parents feel: “Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle. Everything I do is stitched with its color.”
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will give us a chance to better understand bereavement after loss. Knowing the pain of losing a child never goes away may enable us to become better family members, friends, or neighbors to those angel parents we know, love, and cherish.
For example, one of many angel parents’ biggest worries is that their children would be forgotten. So please make sure you ask an angel parent the birthday of their beloved child. Every year on that special day, contact the angel parent (can be as simple as a text message) and let him or her know you remember his or her angel and are thinking and praying for them. Something as simple as that could mean the world to an angel parent. Reduce Preventable Deaths
Having a national Angel Parents’ Day will raise the awareness of many different causes of losing children. With awareness, even though we won’t eliminate all causes, some causes of death are preventable or at least the number of deaths can be reduced.
One of the leading causes of infant deaths is stillbirth, but about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable . A study shows the stillbirth risk doubles when a pregnant woman sleeps on her back during the third trimester. Another study shows that monitoring a baby’s movement during pregnancy may help save babies from stillbirth too.
Many countries including Australia and the United Kingdom have public awareness campaigns to educate women about the right sleeping positions, and how to monitor their babies’ movement, which goes beyond counting kicks. While these countries have made tremendous progress in cutting their stillbirth rates, the stillbirth rate in the United States has budged very little.
The Star Legacy Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization focusing on stillbirth prevention, provides a free informational brochure on monitoring a baby’s movement during pregnancy. Anyone can either download it from its website or order copies for free. One thing we can do to reduce stillbirth in America is to spread the word so that every pregnant American woman has a copy of the brochure and learns about the danger of sleeping her back and the importance of monitoring her baby’s movement during their pregnancy. Such knowledge may prevent some stillbirths and save lives.
Losing a child is one of the most painful, life-changing experiences for many Americans. They have endured the pain in silence and searched for answers. Having a national Angel Parents’ Day would help break the cultural stigma, raise awareness, and hopefully identify some ways to reduce certain causes of child deaths so fewer families will have to suffer.

The 10 Tunes On This Playlist Will Make Your Mother’s Day Sing,thefederalist.com,Barry Lenser,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/10-songs-for-mothers-day-from-bruce-springsteen-to-dolly-parton/,"May 9, 2019 By Barry Lenser
When making a Mother’s Day mix, it can be tempting to prioritize sentiment over quality, as if any old song will suffice as long as it imparts the right feelings about mama. It doesn’t have to be that way.
Below you’ll find a playlist that combines conventional Mother’s Day tunes with others that might not tug at the heartstrings but are still germane to the topic. The selections range from uplifting to heavy, poignant to oblique. Most importantly, all are good-to-great songs, in my opinion.
Happy Mother’s Day! ‘Coat of Many Colors,’ Dolly Parton (1971)
Dolly Parton’s beloved “Coat of Many Colors” is one of those songs so irresistibly sweet and touching that it makes you want to hug the next person you see, call your parents to apologize for anything and everything, and say a prayer of thanksgiving for life’s countless blessings. We the people can’t agree on much these days, but at least we can agree on Dolly. ‘Sylvia’s Mother,’ Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show (1971)
Written by Shel Silverstein, “Sylvia’s Mother” is a solid brick of weepy, over-the-top, melodramatic cheese, but I defy you not to feel something when the song’s booming chorus hits your ears. “Please, Mrs. Avery, I just gotta talk to her!” sings that impenetrable wall of voices. Sometimes schmaltz can simply overwhelm you into happy submission. ‘Mama Couldn’t Be Persuaded,’ Warren Zevon (1976)
If you’re familiar with Warren Zevon’s family background (especially as recounted in the bruising oral history “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead” ), you know it probably would’ve been best had “mama” not married “that gamblin’ man.” But then Zevon never would’ve existed and we wouldn’t have this funny, spirited, and absurdly catchy little rock tune to enjoy again and again. ‘Mother,’ Pink Floyd (1979)
“Mother” hopefully does not resonate with you on a personal level. Hopefully, your mom didn’t wrap you in zealous overprotection or promise that she would “always find out where you’ve been.” Almost every one of David Gilmour’s lines here as “mother” to Roger Waters’ “Pink” character is unsettling. His soaring guitar solo, on the other hand, is pure catharsis. ‘Night Comes On,’ Leonard Cohen (1984)
Nothing says, “Let’s celebrate moms!” like a mystical and meditative Leonard Cohen song, right? Joking aside, “Night Comes On” provides a welcome contrast to “Mother,” as it features a maternal figure who, from beyond the grave, encourages her son to “go back to the world” rather than heed the call of isolation (or worse). In Cohen’s own words , “the mother represents an authentic sense of protection, the life that strengthens.” ‘Promise to Try,’ Madonna (1989)
“Promise to Try” is a reminder that even someone as iconic and world-conquering as Madonna is still just flesh and blood. On this lovely ballad, the Queen of Pop goes to a very vulnerable place as she confronts the anguish of losing her mother to cancer more than two decades prior.
It’s a moving song, due in part to the vocal performance. All of the pomp and circumstance that often surrounds Madonna can easily distract from what a marvelous singer she is. ‘Lemon,’ U2 (1993)
On the one hand, “Lemon” is a gleaming disco ball of a song with odd detours and a louche falsetto from Bono. On the other, it’s a deeply personal reflection on “memory and loss.”
When Bono sings, “She wore lemon,” he’s referring to a Super 8 video of his mother dancing at a wedding while wearing a yellow dress. She’s right there in front of him but permanently beyond his reach (she died in the ‘70s).
Herein lies the brilliance of U2’s large-scale reinvention in the ‘90s: the trappings were thrillingly different, even ironic, but the emotions were still straight from the heart. ‘For Martha,’ The Smashing Pumpkins (1998)
It’s not at all surprising that Billy Corgan would make an epic rock song out of a eulogy for his mother. “For Martha” starts off small, intimate, and piano-based, before swelling and later blasting sky-high on the back of a big, buzzing guitar solo.
By the time the song’s eight-plus minutes are through, it feels like real healing has occurred. Say what you want about Corgan, but the guy can vividly convey emotion both as a singer and a guitarist. ‘The Wish,’ Bruce Springsteen (1998)
How many songs by “the Boss” can accurately be described as “adorable”? “The Wish” qualifies resoundingly. In fact, it’s one of the most heartwarming “mom tributes” in pop music history (on top of being just a fantastic song).
Among several moments I could highlight, the best is when Bruce says that, instead of flowers, a phone call, or any other predictable gesture of affection, he’s going to find “a little rock ‘n’ roll bar” and take his mom out dancing . It’s almost too precious for words. ‘Hey Mama,’ Kanye West (2005)
“Hey Mama” is the old Kanye in all of his joyous, soulful, resplendent glory. Just watch when he debuted the song on “Oprah” with Donda, his mother, in attendance. Or watch when he sang it as a duet with her in this home video . The song and the performances overflow with deeply-felt affection and sincerity.
It’s obvious that Donda was Kanye’s foundation. When she passed away in 2007, it was a shattering experience for him. Some even point to it as the event that eventually spawned the new Kanye, the one who is a frequent target these days of online haters and cancel-culture commissars.
But let’s set aside all the controversy for a moment and focus on the best aspect of 2019 Ye: he’s a devout husband and a doting father of three (going on four). I have to think his mother would be exceedingly proud. Barry Lenser lives and works in the Upper Midwest. He loves the Lord, his family, and the Packers."
Paper: Professor Bias May Deflate Conservative College Students’ Grades,thefederalist.com,Joy Pullmann,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/working-paper-professor-bias-may-deflate-conservative-college-students-grades/,"By Joy Pullmann May 9, 2019
Conservative students enter college with higher SAT scores and GPAs than liberal students, but by the fourth year of college have lower GPAs than liberal peers, which may be a consequence of institutional bias, finds a new working paper from the University of Arkansas.
Self-identified conservative students saw the biggest grade dip when studying in the humanities and social sciences, none when studying in professional fields, and an extra grade advantage when studying in hard-science fields. The bias was more pronounced at higher-ranked colleges and universities.
“Notwithstanding the GPA advantages held by conservative students in high school, students who support banning racist/sexist speech, and who endorse dissent as critical to the political process (positions typically associated with liberalism) enjoy a relative advantage over their peers,” the paper finds.
The authors controlled for students’ family income, SAT scores, and demographics, and repeatedly caution that the GPA effect is comparatively small, although statistically significant, and may have explanations other than professor bias. For example, since other social science has found conservatives tend to follow rules better and score lower on spontaneity and creativity, perhaps those characteristics make them a poorer fit for college or humanities programs.
Statistical analysis on a large database often used by researchers shows that “by the fourth year of college, liberal students tend to have higher grades than conservative peers: ideological self-placement is the only variable in the model changing direction from high school to college ” (emphasis original), write paper authors Matthew Woessner of Penn State, Robert Maranto of U-Arkansas, and Amanda Thompson of the University of Georgia. The working paper from U-Arkansas’s Department of Education Reform has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in an academic journal, but has been released to generate academic input pre-publication, it states.
The paper includes the graph below, showing that conservative students have the highest overall grades in high school, although lower writing and verbal SAT scores than liberal students. This also could reflect conservatives’ higher compliance levels, political biases in the verbal (less objective) portions of tests, neither, or both. Other research has found that high schools highly value compliance and that K-12 teachers award higher grades to more agreeable students and students more similar to them , which lowers boy’s grades compared to girls.
“Rather than political bias, conservatives might earn lower grades if colleges play to the strengths of liberal students,” the paper says. “Prior work shows that liberals more deeply value independence and the creation of original works, while conservatives more deeply value family life, community, and loyalty (Kelly-Woessner and Woessner 2009; Haidt 2012). In short, one could interpret findings here as suggesting that as institutions, high schools fit the strengths of conservatives while colleges fit the strengths of liberals.”
Or perhaps college culture tends to be anti-conservative. The paper notes later that, in the authors’ field experience, students from rich, secular, liberal families adapted better to campus life than did students from conservative, middle-class homes. It suggests that’s because “students from conservative or religious household might face difficulties in the transition to college, losing the structure and community they enjoyed in high school.”
But it also could be that campus cultures can be actively hostile to family, faith, community, and a well-ordered life. A further indication of this comes later, when the paper discusses how students who support same-sex marriage “tend to feel more valued, and believe that faculty see their potential, show concern, and take an interest in their success” when rating their college experience. Students on the opposite side of the issue tend to say the opposite. This, the paper suggests, “opens the possibility that directly or indirectly, opposition to same sex-marriage contributes to alienation among some students.”
If this is just one indicator of the well-known reality that campuses have a culturally leftist bent, it’s no wonder that conservatives would feel less comfortable and have more difficulty adapting. Since conservatives tend to have better self-organization and perform better in the academically more difficult science fields, perhaps a politically leftist culture is a major hindrance to their adjustment to college life.
If we saw these difficulties among liberal students or minorities, we’d no doubt see op-eds in major newspapers and websites about how campus climates are “chilly” and “hostile” to such young people. Don’t expect that to happen when the difficulties apply more to conservative kids.
While all kids’ GPAs dropped in college compared to high school, the conservative students’ grades dropped more than the liberal students’ did. Other research has found that high school GPAs are the best predictor of college achievement , even better than SAT and ACT scores. Conservative students’ high GPAs also dropped more dramatically for some measures of political conservatism than others, as the graph below from the paper shows.
“[H]olding all else constant, the most liberal student would enjoy a 0.16 point advantage over the most conservative student on a 7 point scale. Given our large sample size [of more than 7,000 students], this difference is statistically significant,” says the paper.
Students’ views on abortion had the strongest relationship with conservatives’ high school to college grade drop, partly because pro-life students had the highest average high school GPAs. At medium to low-prestige higher education institutions, pro-life students’ academic achievement actually increased, but at high-prestige schools their advantage was erased. The reverse happened with students who opposed free speech: they saw higher grades in college than their high school performance would have projected.
“Whereas the advantage enjoyed by pro-life students declines, the advantage of those who would ban racist/sexist speech or who value dissent grows,” the paper notes.
Another factor here is that while college professors massively more leftist than the general American population, K-12 teachers are also significantly farther left than most Americans. Fifty percent of K-12 teachers voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, compared to 29 percent voting for Donald Trump. Forty-one percent of teachers identify as Democrats, and only 27 percent as Republicans, according to a 2017 poll by the trade publication Education Week. That’s a 12-point higher percentage of Democrats among K-12 teachers than among the general American public.
By comparison, a recent study found that high-ranked liberal arts colleges employ ten self-described Democrat professors for every one Republican. So if bias unfairly deflates conservative students’ achievements in college, it probably has an effect in high school, also, especially since these biased colleges train K-12 teachers. Bias just may not affect K-12 students as much as it does college students.
This may be one reason that public schools are the top choice for only one-third of American parents , even though eight in ten of those same parents have their kids enrolled in public schools. A recent poll in Wisconsin found that two-thirds of Republican voters are worried about politics in their kids’ public schools, and it’s certain they’re not alone. The question is: Are conservative parents and GOP politicians going to do anything serious about a system stacked against their kids?

"Impeach Trump Or Go Home, Democrats",thefederalist.com,David Harsanyi,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/impeach-trump-home-democrats/,"By David Harsanyi May 9, 2019
When House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Speaker Nancy Pelosi claimed that the United States had been plunged into a “constitutional crisis” this week, a large swath of the media took to plying this fantasy for them.
“Ever wonder what a constitutional crisis looks like? Well, open your eyes,” CNN’s Don Lemon explained to his viewers. “The president of the United States is just blowing right through our system of checks and balances, the very thing that is supposed to keep our Congress, the judiciary, and the executive branch working, which means our country working. He is engaging in an ongoing cover-up by defying at every turn the representatives of you, the American people, the very people who are supposed to be investigating fact-finding on our behalf.”
None of this is remotely true. Our checks and balances are working exactly as they should. Congress is free to make perpetual demands for information and testimony, and threaten the White House with contempt charges and impeachment when it doesn’t get its way. The White House, in turn, is free to assert executive privilege and decline to hand over that information or give testimony.
Both the legislature and the executive branches have the option of asking the judiciary to weigh in on the matter. It’s not as if Donald Trump is blatantly ignoring the courts , as his predecessor often did. If voters disagree, they have the option of punishing elected officials by voting against them. If the legislature disagrees, it has an even more forceful solution available, and that’s impeachment.
History didn’t begin in 2016. Every modern president has asserted executive privilege. Attorneys general have been cited for contempt on much firmer grounds . Former attorney general Janet Reno was found in contempt in 1998 for refusing to turn over memos about Bill Clinton’s campaign finances.
In 2012, Eric Holder became the first U.S. attorney general in history to be held in both criminal and civil contempt after refusing to hand over memos detailing his knowledge about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’s disastrous and bloody gunrunning scheme. Nadler knows this, because he joined a Democratic Party walkout protesting the Holder vote.
Yet no Obama administration official was arrested . There were no impeachments. TV anchors didn’t unsheathe melodramatic monologues about the corrosion of law and the end of democracy.
Moreover, contra Lemon, there’s no cover-up . After accurately describing the bottom line of the Mueller report, Barr released it, and now every American can read the results of a two-year, open-ended, independent investigation that, despite its best efforts, eviscerated the panic-stricken Russia collusion conspiracies of the left and political media.
The attorney general, in fact, has given Democrats access to all but two full and seven partial lines of Volume II (the op-ed section of the report)—or, as the Department of Justice put it , more than 98 percent of the entire 448-page report. Not one Democrat as of this writing thought it important enough to review the minimally redacted version of the report. It’s one of the surest signs that this is all political spectacle.
For two-plus years, Democrats and their allies took advantage of a cooked-up conspiracy theory, and used the subsequent investigation as cover to disparage their opponents as traitors and spineless enablers—not only crowding out useful debate of the Trump presidency but fueling an emotionalist argument that confuses “attacks on democracy” with “not getting my way.” Now, they’ve merely transferred those hysterics to another manufactured drama.
The same people who never met a constitutional amendment they didn’t want to weaken or destroy will now act as if a middling procedural showdown is the next Watergate. Mainstream media stories about Nadler’s fishing expeditions have already framed Democrats as stewards of law and order, forced into impeachment by inflexible Republicans.
It will never be enough. If Trump is a criminal who flirts with treason and threatens the very existence of the Constitution, don’t Democrats have a duty to impeach the president? When Lemon asked Nadler about this, the congressman answered, “[i]t may come to that if the president keeps up with this conduct, but we’ll see.” Why wait?
The intelligence committee’s Rep. Adam Schiff (D-California) has maintained for years that he has incontrovertible evidence of the administration colluding with Russia. Pelosi has claimed on numerous occasions that Trump engaged in criminal behavior. It’s so bad, she recently argued , that the president is “self-impeachable,” whatever that means.
It’s one thing for Congress to run forever investigations, which have become the norm in Washington. It’s another to spend two years—and possibly six, if Trump wins in 2020—using congressional power to create bogus “constitutional crises” that continue to corrode genuine checks and balances.
It’s difficult to believe anyone really thinks impeachment is a good idea after an independent investigation blew up the Russiagate conspiracy. But Democrats run the House. They have the votes to get it done. According to their own rhetoric, they have duty to impeach no matter what the Senate does. An impeachment proceeding that compels Democrats to lay out their case would be far preferable to this show trial—what the Wall Street Journal editorial page dubbed “The Pseudo-Impeachment.” Let’s do it already."
Did Robert Mueller Tap Fusion GPS And Christopher Steele To Assist His Anti-Trump Investigation?,thefederalist.com,Paul Sperry,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/robert-mueller-tap-fusion-gps-christopher-steele-assist-anti-trump-investigation/,"By Paul Sperry May 9, 2019
Special Counsel Robert Mueller spent more than $732,000 on outside contractors, including private investigators and researchers, records show, but his office refuses to say who they were. While it’s not unusual for special government offices to outsource for services such as computer support, Mueller also hired contractors to compile “investigative reports” and other “information.”
The arrangement has led congressional investigators, government watchdog groups and others to speculate that the private investigators and researchers who worked for the special counsel’s office might have included Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, the private research firm that hired Steele to produce the Russia collusion dossier for the Clinton campaign.
They suspect the dossier creators may have been involved in Mueller’s operation, and even had a hand in his final report, because the special counsel sent his team to London to meet with Steele within a few months of taking over the Russia collusion investigation in 2017. Also, Mueller’s lead prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, had shared information he received from Fusion with the media.
Raising additional suspicions, Mueller’s report recycles the general allegations leveled in the dossier. And taking a page from earlier surveillance-warrant applications in the Russia investigation, it cites as supporting evidence several articles—including one by Yahoo! News—that used Steele and Fusion as sources.
Mueller even kept alive one of the dossier’s most obscene accusations—that Moscow had “compromising tapes” of Trump with Russian hookers—by slipping into a footnote an October 2016 text Trump lawyer Michael Cohen received from a “Russian businessman,” who cryptically intimated, “Stopped flow of tapes from Russia.”
Lawyers for the businessman, Giorgi Rtskhiladze (who is actually a Georgian American), are demanding a retraction of the footnote, arguing Mueller omitted the part of his text where he said he did not believe the rumor about the tapes, for which no evidence has ever surfaced.
Mueller’s reliance on the Steele dossier is raising questions because it occurred long after FBI Director James B. Comey described the dossier as “salacious and unverified.” U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said the report should be renamed “The Mueller Dossier,” because he says it contains a lot of similar innuendo.
Even though Mueller failed to corroborate key allegations leveled in the dossier, Nunes said his report twists key facts to put a collusion gloss on events. He also asserted that it selectively quotes from Trump campaign emails and omits exculpatory information in ways that cast the campaign’s activities in the most sinister light.
Steele’s 17-memo dossier alleged that the Trump campaign was involved in “a well-developed conspiracy of cooperation” with the Russian government to rig the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor. It claimed this conspiracy “was managed on the Trump side by Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort, who was using foreign policy adviser Carter Page and others as intermediaries.”
Specifically, the dossier accused Page of secretly meeting with Kremlin officials in July 2016 to hatch a plot to release dirt on Hillary Clinton. And it accused Manafort of being corrupted by Russian President Vladimir Putin through his puppets in the Ukraine.
Likewise, Mueller’s report focuses on Manafort and Page and whether they “committed crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” Though the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government, the Mueller report implies there may be a kernel of truth to the dossier’s charges.
“In July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity to Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School,” according to the section on him. “Page had lived and worked in Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted with at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia.”
“Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his advocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention,” Mueller’s narrative continued. “July 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU [Russian intelligence] from the DNC.” “Page acknowledged that he understood that the individuals he has associated with were members of the Russian intelligence services,” the report added, implying that Page in the 2015 case (referenced above) knowingly cavorted with Russian spies, which echoes charges Steele made in his dossier.
But federal court records make it clear that Page did not know that those men were Russian agents. Mueller also left out of his report a detail RealClearInvestigations has previously reported: that Page was a cooperating witness in the case in question, helping the FBI eventually put a Russian agent behind bars in 2016.
Nor did Mueller see fit to include in his report another exculpatory detail revealed in agent Gregory Mohaghan’s complaint and reported earlier by RCI—namely, that the Russians privately referred to Page as “an idiot” who was unworthy of recruitment. Excluding such details is curious, given that the Mueller report quotes from the same FBI complaint and cites it in its footnotes. Similarly, in its section dealing with Manafort, the Mueller report echoes the dossier’s claims that the Trump campaign chairman was in cahoots with the Kremlin, even though Mueller never charged him with conspiring to collude with Russia
The special prosecutor’s report indicated that one of Manafort’s Kremlin handlers was Konstantin Kilimnik. “Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the state of the Trump Campaign and Manafort’s plan to win the election,” it said. “That briefing encompassed the Campaign’s messaging and its internal polling data. It also included discussion of ‘battleground’ states, which Manafort identified as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Minnesota.”
Except that this wouldn’t have been an unusual conversation: Kilimnik was a longtime Manafort employee who ran the Ukraine office of his lobbying firm. Footnotes in Mueller’s report show that Manafort shared campaign information to impress a former business partner, Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who was suing him over financial losses. Mueller failed to tie the information exchange to Russian espionage. He also failed to mention that Deripaska is an FBI informant.
Mueller’s team worked closely with dossier author Steele, a long-retired British intelligence officer who worked for the Clinton campaign. Mueller’s investigators went to London to consult with Steele for at least two days in September 2017 while apparently using his dossier as an investigative road map and central theory to his collusion case. Steele now runs a private research and consulting firm in London, Orbis Business Intelligence.
It’s not clear if Mueller’s office paid Steele, but recently released FBI records show the bureau previously made a number of payments to him, and at one point during the 2016 campaign offered him $50,000 to continue his dossier research. Steele was also paid through the Clinton campaign, earning $168,000 for his work on the dossier.
Expenditure statements show that the Special Counsel’s Office outsourced “investigative reports” and “information” to third-party contractors during Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian “collusion” during the 2016 presidential election. Over the past few months, Mueller’s office has rejected several formal requests from RealClearInvestigations for contract details, including who was hired and how much they were paid.
Washington-based Judicial Watch suspects Mueller’s office may have farmed out work to the private Washington research firm Fusion GPS or its subcontractor Steele, both of whom were paid by the Clinton camp during the 2016 presidential election. Several law enforcement and Hill sources who spoke with RCI also believe Steele and Fusion GPS were deputized in the investigation.
The government watchdog group has requested that the Justice Department turn over the contracting records, along with all budget requests Mueller submitted to the attorney general during his nearly two-year investigation. It’s also requested all communications between the Special Counsel’s Office and the private contractors it used. A Judicial Watch spokesman said its Freedom of Information Act request is pending.
Special counsel spokesman Peter Carr declined comment when asked specifically if Mueller’s team hired or collaborated with Fusion GPS or any of its subcontractors. Mueller took over the FBI’s Russia probe in May 2017, whereupon he hired many of the agents who handled Steele and pored over his dossier.
For the first reporting period ending Sept. 30, 2017, and covering just four months, the Special Counsel’s Office reported paying $867 to unnamed contractors for “investigative reports/information,” along with $3,554 in “miscellaneous” payments to contractors. In the next reporting period ending March 31, 2018, the office stopped breaking out investigative reports and information as a separate line item, lumping such contractual services under the category “Other,” which accounted for a total of $10,812, or more than 4% of the total spending on outside contracts.
For the six months ending Sept. 30, 2018—the latest reporting period for which there is data—Mueller’s office showed a total of $310,732 in payments to outside contractors. For the first time, it did not break out such expenses into subcategories, though it noted that the lion’s share of the $310,000 was spent on “IT services.”
Mueller concluded his investigation and delivered his final report in March. The next expenditure report, for the period October 2018-March 2019, will cover contract work directly tied to compiling the report. Asked if the contracting details were classified, Carr demurred. If the information is not deemed classified, it must be made public, Judicial Watch maintains.
Republican critics on the Hill say Mueller’s written narrative was slanted to give the impression there still might be something to the dossier’s most salacious allegations, even though Mueller found no evidence corroborating them or establishing that Trump or his campaign coordinated or cooperated with Russian meddling in the election.
“Whoever wrote the report leaves you with the idea there’s still something to all the allegations of collusion that were first promoted by the dossier,” said a witness who was interviewed by Mueller’s investigators late in the probe and is referenced in the report.
In a section on Donald Trump Jr., moreover, the report gives the misimpression that the president’s oldest son was collaborating with WikiLeaks on the release of the Clinton campaign emails. “Donald Trump Jr. had direct electronic communications with WikiLeaks during the campaign period,” it stated.
In fact, Trump got an unsolicited message through his Twitter account from WikiLeaks. He described the outreach as “weird” in an email to senior Trump campaign staff at the time. Other contemporaneous messages make it clear he had no advance knowledge about any Clinton emails released by WikiLeaks.
The FBI first began receiving memos from Steele’s dossier in early July 2016 and used the documents as the foundation for its October 2016 application for a warrant to wiretap the private communications of Page. These milestones are missing from the Mueller report’s chronology of events. In fact, neither Steele nor his dossier is mentioned by name anywhere in the first half of the report dealing with collusion, though their allegations are hashed out.
Some Mueller critics are focused on the role played by his top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter with longstanding ties to Steele and Fusion GPS.
“Weissman had a lot to do with the way the report was written,” said author Jerome Corsi, who, as a friend of Trump confidant Roger Stone, was targeted by Mueller. “That’s why it’s basically a political document.” Corsi said he spent more than 40 hours with Mueller’s prosecutors and investigators, who grilled him about possible ties to WikiLeaks but never charged him with a crime.
Formerly a top Justice Department official under Obama, Weissmann not only donated to Clinton’s presidential campaign but also attended her election-night party in New York City in November 2016. Three months earlier, he was briefed on Steele’s dossier and other dirt provided by the Clinton contractor and paid FBI informant.
In early 2017, Weissmann helped advance the Russia collusion narrative by personally sharing Steele’s and Fusion’s dirt on Trump and his advisers with Washington reporters. In an April 2017 meeting he arranged at his office, Weissmann gave guidance to four Associated Press reporters who were investigating Manafort, according to internal FBI documents.
Among other things, they discussed rumors that Manafort used “some of the money from shell companies to buy expensive suits.” A month later, Weissmann became the lead prosecutor handling the Manafort case for Mueller. His February 2018 indictment of Manafort highlights, among other things, the Trump adviser’s taste for expensive suits. Attempts to reach Weissmann for comment were unsuccessful.
Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said there are signs Mueller may have hired “researchers” like Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who worked with Steele on the dossier, along with Edward Baumgartner and Nellie Ohr, who have worked for Fusion GPS, which originally hired Steele in June 2016 after contracting with the Clinton campaign.
“I ran into Glenn at the 2017 Aspen Security [Forum], and I distinctly remember him leaning in and claiming he was working for the government,” said one associate, who wished to remain anonymous. Congressional investigators say Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, has been feeding Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate investigative tips regarding Trump and his associates, including Manafort. In 2017, for instance, he urged Democrats specifically to look into the bank records of Deutsche Bank, which has financed some of Trump’s businesses, because he suspected some of the funding may have been laundered through Russia.
Around the time Simpson began coordinating with Democratic investigators looking into Trump’s bank records, Mueller subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for financial records for Manafort and other individuals affiliated with Trump. Simpson did not return calls and emails seeking comment.
Founded by the journalist-turned-opposition researcher, Fusion has rehired Steele to continue his anti-Trump work with millions of dollars in left-wing funding from The Democracy Integrity Project, a Washington-based nonprofit started in 2017 by former FBI analyst Daniel Jones, who also worked for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
In March 2017, Jones met with FBI agents to provide them data he collected from IT specialists he hired to analyze web traffic between servers maintained by the Trump Organization and a Russian bank mentioned in the dossier. The traffic turned out to be innocuous marketing emails, or spam.

"No One Likes You, Eric Swalwell ~ Full Magazine",thefederalist.com,,05-09-2019,2019,5,https://thefederalist.com/2019/05/09/no-one-likes-you-eric-swalwell/,"May 9, 2019 By Madeline Osburn
When 2018 midterm voters were polled on the issues most important to them, the Russia investigation ranked dead last. That might explain why Democratic presidential candidate Eric Swalwell, who has branded himself as the “Guns and Russia” candidate, is polling at 0 percent among all 2020 Democratic hopefuls.
In fact, a majority of polls don’t even include Swalwell in the top 17 candidates. In an April CNN poll, 66 percent of respondents had never heard of him. Despite the dismal numbers, Swalwell has clung to his two favorite issues.
The 38-year-old often leverages his position on the House Intelligence Committee to make frequent cable news appearances discussing Russia and the Mueller report. On CBS’s “Face The Nation” this Sunday, Swalwell said impeachment “may be the only road to save the country.” On Wednesday, the Democratic congressman from California was widely mocked after comparing the Mueller report to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and Pearl Harbor on Twitter. Remember that time Pearl Harbor was bombed and FDR called the Emperor of Japan? Or the time the Twin Towers were struck and Bush ringed Osama Bin Laden? No? I don’t either. So why’d @realDonaldTrump call Putin after the Mueller Report was released? #CommanderInCheat

But his real passion issue remains gun-grabbing. In a San Francisco Chronicle essay laying out his reasons for running for president, Swalwell’s number-one reason was that the single greatest threat to young Americans’ lives is gun violence. At a time in which child mortality rates have dropped by half over the last two decades, this claim is just categorically untrue.
At a Wednesday night vigil for a student who died in a Colorado school shooting, angry students stormed out after politicians speaking at the event began calling for gun control instead of honoring their late classmate. One student told The Daily Wire they were angry when the event became “highly politicized.”
Nevertheless, Swalwell continues to pen op-eds calling for $15 million gun buybacks, banning “military-style semiautomatic assault weapons,” and jailing people who resist giving up their weapons. At the height of his passion, he has even threatened to nuke his own gun-owning constituents should they not surrender their firearms to the government. And it would be a short war my friend. The government has nukes. Too many of them. But they’re legit. I’m sure if we talked we could find common ground to protect our families and communities.

Even if Swalwell were to adjust his unpopular campaign platform, as a straight, white, cisgender, male, his intersectionality score is working against him in the diverse Democratic field. His solution? Not to step aside and make room for a woman president, but to vow to select a woman as his vice president. SPOILER ALERT: I'm a white man.
I know where I can't speak to someone else's experience and I pledge to:1️⃣ Pass the mic

Perhaps the biggest hurdle Swalwell’s campaign faces is not what he is — a white man who hates guns and Russia — but what he isn’t. Swalwell is not a business owner, a veteran, a community organizer, or anything remotely interesting. He is essentially a professional politician who smoothly transitioned from college frat boy interning on Capitol Hill to running for city council and eventually the U.S. House of Representatives.
In an attempt to find something interesting about his background, a campaign video exhausts the fact that his parents are both Republicans. After his official candidacy announcement, Swalwell was widely mocked for his bland slogan, “Let’s go big, be bold, and do good!” Even Democratic strategist Donna Brazile noted his milquetoast presence. Welcome candidate #101 https://t.co/ovrkIkcKM2

Unfortunately for Swalwell, he might just be the perfect cocktail of things that don’t poll well: Russia-gate, gun-grabbing, and boring. Madeline is a staff writer at the Federalist and the producer of The Federalist Radio Hour. Follow her on Twitter ."
