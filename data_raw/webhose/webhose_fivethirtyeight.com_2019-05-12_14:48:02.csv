Are Americans More Divided On #MeToo Issues? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Meredith Conroy,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-americans-more-divided-on-metoo-issues/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
In the fall of 2017, the publishing of sexual harassment and assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein fueled the rise of the #MeToo movement, inspiring women across industries to speak out against abuse and inappropriate behavior that they said they had experienced for years, sometimes at the hands of high-profile men. 1
The world of politics has not been immune. Perhaps most notably, Brett Kavanaugh faced multiple allegations of sexual misconduct before and during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings last year. And now several women have come forward to describe “ awkward ” and “ uncomfortable ” interactions with likely 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. 2
So how has the public’s perspective on the #MeToo movement changed? According to a May 2018 poll by Morning Consult, there was a wide partisan gap in support for the movement — 81 percent of Democrats said they backed the movement, compared with 54 percent of Republicans. And in October 2018 , Morning Consult found that the gap between the parties had grown — support for the movement had increased by 2 points among Democrats since May and decreased by 7 points among Republicans. Some of what drove this may have been related to Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing — prominent Republicans waged an anti-#MeToo campaign , drawing attention to the possible negative consequences of the movement for men, and public opinion on Kavanaugh’s confirmation was largely split along party lines . But we were interested in getting a broader view on how voters’ opinions on the issue of sexual harassment and the role of women in society have changed from before the #MeToo movement to now.
So we looked at 2016 and 2018 data from The Democracy Fund Voter Study Group , which polls large segments of the U.S. electorate to track changes in attitudes and beliefs, including what Americans think about issues of sexual harassment and misconduct. 3 And what we found is that on the whole, since 2016, Republicans have grown more skeptical of women who report harassment and the motivation behind their claims. However, members of both parties were more likely to acknowledge that sexual harassment of women in the workplace is a problem in the U.S. in 2018, compared with 2016 — so there is some evidence that more people from both parties view sexual harassment as a problem today than did before.
First, let’s take a look at two questions in the survey on which Republicans and Democrats moved further apart in 2018. In 2016, 61 percent of Republicans and 18 percent of Democrats surveyed said they agreed that “ when women demand equality these days, they are actually seeking special favors ” — that was a whopping 43-point gap. In 2018, that gap hit 48 points, with 65 percent of Republicans agreeing with that statement, compared with 17 percent of Democrats. And on the question of whether “ women who complain about harassment often cause more problems than they solve ,” 54 percent of Republicans said in 2018 that they agreed with that statement, up 4 points from 2016. Among Democrats, the change was again in the opposite direction, down to 17 percent in 2018 from 19 percent in 2016.
One explanation for the widening partisan gap could be that attitudes about gender equality are increasingly correlated with partisan identity. Indeed, several studies have found that hostile attitudes toward women predicted support for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election , along with views on racial discrimination , as some conservatives backed Trump because they feared losing their status in society . The underlying idea is that Trump’s candidacy “ primed sexist attitudes, which might have otherwise lain dormant ,” and, therefore, these attitudes were more salient when voters cast their ballot in 2016. And there is reason to believe that what we saw in 2016 marked a real shift between the two parties. In elections held between 2004 and 2012 , attitudes toward women did not predict support for presidential candidates. So it would make sense that the Kavanaugh hearings, which took place just before the midterm elections in 2018 , continued to elevate a discussion about changing cultural norms and offered an opportunity for elite partisans, like the president , to signal how they felt about issues of sexual harassment, which, in turn, may have shaped how rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats said they viewed the issue.
On two other questions, the parties also moved in opposite directions. When asked whether “ women should return to their traditional roles in society ,” the percentage of Republicans who agreed with that statement rose by 6 points, while the percentage of Democrats who agreed declined by 1 point. But this gap may not be all that surprising. A Pew Research Center study from 2017 found that Democrats generally see changing gender roles as beneficial to society and that Republicans don’t. And when asked whether “ women often miss out on good jobs because of discrimination ,” the share of Republicans who agreed declined from 39 percent to 36 percent, while the agreement among Democrats increased by 1 point, from 85 percent to 86 percent. Arguably, the #MeToo movement has encouraged more women to call out inequality in the workplace , so among Democrats, this change may be more welcome than among Republicans.
There was however, one question in the survey related to women in the workplace that did not reflect increased polarization. Both Democrats and Republicans in 2018 were less likely to agree with the statement that “ sexual harassment against women in the workplace is no longer a problem in the United States .” Democratic agreement declined by 4 points, and Republican agreement declined by 5 points. This suggests that despite increased polarization on some issues of sexual harassment, the #MeToo movement may have made Democrats and Republicans more aware of the prevalence of sexual harassment at work.
Overall, the data shows that Republicans and Democrats haven’t changed their minds all that much on questions about sexual harassment. However, the change we did find reflects a growing partisan divide, which is consistent across other issues like race, religion and immigration . And this partisan divide will probably continue to widen as we head into the 2020 presidential election. Trump’s re-election campaign will likely continue to elevate cultural and social issues that tap into divisive beliefs about gender and race in an attempt to maintain the coalition of voters who turned out for him in 2016.

How The Warriors Blew A 31-Point Lead | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-warriors-blew-a-31-point-lead/,"How The Warriors Blew A 31-Point Lead They also lost DeMarcus Cousins, but they’re still heavy favorites to win it all.

We could talk all day long about the everlasting debate over competitive balance in the NBA, but perhaps the biggest challenge the Golden State Warriors pose for many die-hard NBA fans is the issue of sleep.
Because they play on the West Coast, the two-time defending champions are often playing late at night, leaving East Coasters and even Midwesterners with a choice of whether to stay up and watch the action or to get some shut eye before work the next morning. Some play it by ear and call it a night only if and when Golden State builds a commanding, early second-half lead.
This was basically the scenario on Monday night: The Warriors went up by 31, 94-63, at home on the No. 8 seed Los Angeles Clippers, the biggest first-round underdogs in 30 years , midway through the third quarter. 1 Yet those who cut off their TV at that point, or before, missed out on the biggest comeback — or collapse, depending on how you view it — in NBA playoff history .
The Clippers poured in 85 second-half points en route to an improbable 135-131 win, knotting the best-of-seven at one game apiece as the series heads to Los Angeles later this week.
There’s no need to concoct an over-complicated explanation for the comeback. While there wasn’t an immediate effect, Stephen Curry’s fourth foul prompted coach Steve Kerr to sit the scorching sharpshooter (who had 22 points and was 6-of-9 from the field) for an eight-and-a-half-minute stretch during the third quarter, until there were 13 seconds left in the period. By that point, the Warriors’ lead (still 17 points) had already been cut by almost half. And Curry’s magic had largely faded once he was subbed back in: Upon returning, he shot just 2-of-9 the rest of the way.
Fellow star Kevin Durant was efficient as a scorer but turned the ball over four separate times during that third quarter alone. He would finish with a team-high nine giveaways, and the club — whose problematic turnovers we’ve detailed here before — had 22 turnovers on the night. (It marked the second game in a row that Golden State has had more than 20.) Durant again got frustrated with Clippers irritant Patrick Beverley, who stands about 10 inches shorter , never stops giving everything he has and seems to effectively get into the All-Star’s head .
Lastly, the Warrior defense allowed Lou Williams, the Clippers’ top scorer, to get rolling and simply couldn’t find a way to stop him late. From the point that L.A.’s deficit peaked at 31 points, Williams, the likely Sixth Man of the Year, shot 11-of-17 for 26 points while also dishing out seven assists over the final 19 minutes of the game. He even grabbed a pair of his own misses and put them each back for valuable buckets. 2
“We stopped playing, and got kind of disconnected, in that mid-third quarter,” Kerr told reporters of the turnaround. “We lost our defensive edge.”
It’s been tempting not to even bother writing about the key factors in this series, largely because of how enormous an underdog the Clippers are. But one thing the Warriors would have wanted to avoid going in was this: Don’t allow Los Angeles to stay in the game late. The win marked the third time this season alone that the Clippers had come back from 25 or more down on the road to win, 3 and they were the NBA’s most efficient team in late-game, clutch scenarios during the regular season. With the score separated by 5 points or fewer in the final five minutes of play, L.A. outscored opponents by a league-high 17.7 points per 100 possessions .
The clutch shooting of Williams will stand out, but he was far from alone. The Clippers shot 8-of-14 from deep as a team in the second half. Montrezl Harrell, Williams’s high-flying pick-and-roll partner, shot 5-of-5 for 17 points after L.A. fell behind by 31. Beverley made a key play, picking Curry’s pocket as he brought the ball up the court early in the fourth, as if to say that the Clippers weren’t simply going to lie down, despite the Warriors still holding a double-digit lead.
And in what’s marked a sea change under coach Doc Rivers, a couple of the team’s youngsters — a contingent that just a few years ago never would have gotten an opportunity to show what they can do — pulled off arguably the biggest play of the game. Williams got a screen at the top of the key from rookie Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who then short-rolled before hitting fellow rookie Landry Shamet on the wing for the go-ahead triple.
Still, the stunning comeback likely doesn’t figure to change all that much concerning this series, given the massive gap in talent. Yes, the Warriors lost center DeMarcus Cousins to what may be another significant injury , something that could throw them out of rhythm now that the playoffs are underway. Their chances of winning the NBA title — while still better than anyone else’s — are down significantly as a result. 4 But the reality is that the Warriors still have a number of other All-Stars to lean on, while the Clippers have none.
It may end up being nothing more than a single, historic comeback in what amounts to a five-game series victory for Golden State. But even if that’s all, the outcome may have been enough to prompt some sleepy fans to catch the final quarter the next time they’re weighing whether to get that extra half-hour of rest.
Check out our latest NBA predictions . Footnotes
Another thing that might have prompted some to call it a night: The game finished with 64 personal fouls and 76 free throws, which slowed things down considerably.
For his part, Warriors defensive star Draymond Green seemed to be playing extremely hard on defense as the Clippers’ run was beginning and grew frustrated when teammate Jordan Bell didn’t hunt down one of his blocked shots.
They won at Detroit on Feb. 2 after trailing by 25 and beat Boston on the road Feb. 9 after falling behind by 28.
From a 62 percent probability on April 9 to just 44 percent now, according to FiveThirtyEight’s projections.

We won’t find out who won until late June , but the 2018-19 NBA season treated basketball fans to one of the great MVP battles in recent memory. Several worthy players hung around the race for large portions of the season, including Paul George and Nikola Jokic . But in the end, there were two : Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden — each of whom has several arguments working in his favor.
Antetokounmpo is the best player on the best team 1 in the league, and he led the 60-win Bucks to the best defense and fourth-best offense in the NBA . He averaged an unheard of 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.5 blocks per game. He is also one of the best defenders in the league — a top-tier candidate for Defensive Player of the Year .
Harden, meanwhile, carried an offensive burden unlike any in modern NBA history. His 40.5 percent usage rate is the second-highest of all time . He finished the season averaging 36.1 points per game, eighth-most in league history and the most since Michael Jordan ticked off 37.1 per game in 1987. Harden boosted his deep attempts far beyond what previously seemed either possible or reasonable, taking 13.2 triples per game and connecting on them at a 37 percent rate. 2
Really, though, the argument between the two players is less about who had the better season and more about the definition of “valuable.” Is it just the best player in the league? Is it the best player on the best team? Is it the player whose performance was most outstanding, whatever you decide that means? Is it the player whose team needs him the most? Is it some combination of all of those things, as well as a few others? Different players, coaches, executives, fans and media members have different definitions.
What if we took the word “valuable” as literally as possible, though, and tried to identify the player who provided his team with the greatest bang for its buck throughout this season? After all, what’s more valuable than performing at a level that far outstrips your salary, allowing your team to spend those surplus dollars on more talent elsewhere?
The first step to answering this question is to quantify the dollar value of a win in the NBA. There were 1,230 games played this season, which means there were 1,230 wins up for grabs. According to Basketball-Reference.com, NBA teams handed out more than $3.6 billion in salary this year. Dividing that figure by 1,230 means that a single win was valued at $2,949,908.82.
We can then turn to ESPN’s Real-Plus Minus and specifically RPM wins , a stat that uses a player’s RPM and his possessions played to estimate his contribution to the number of his team’s wins. Not all players qualified for the RPM leaderboard, so there was a slight shortfall of wins produced by the 514 players who did qualify. We applied a multiplier to each of those player’s totals in order to account for the shortfall. Then, we multiplied the dollar value of a win by the number of adjusted RPM wins each player produced to pinpoint the dollar value of that player’s production. Subtracting his actual 2018-19 salary from that number yields a surplus, meeting our goal of identifying the best bang-for-buck player in the league this season. Pascal Siakam led the NBA in most bang for the buck NBA players by value provided to their teams above their salaries as measured by Real Plus-Minus (RPM) wins, 2018-19 season RK"
What First-Quarter Fundraising Can Tell Us About 2020 | FiveThirtyEight,projects.fivethirtyeight.com,Julia Wolfe,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-fundraising/,"Total raised in the first quarter $NaNM PUBLISHED Apr. 16, 2019, at 9:00 AM What First-Quarter Fundraising Can Tell Us About 2020 By Julia Wolfe and Chris Zubak-Skees When a presidential candidate raises a lot of money, they’re probably going to tell you about it, which leads to a lot of headlines like this: Those headlines aren’t wrong, but they also don’t tell you that much on their own. That’s because each candidate who’s bragging about his or her fundraising total is doing it in a vacuum. It’s tough to know whether to care about, say, Sen. Bernie Sanders’s haul without knowing what the other candidates brought in. Luckily, all candidates must file detailed reports of their fundraising and spending at least once a quarter. This information, which is made public by the Federal Election Commission, allows for a better kind of analysis: one that compares each candidate to all the others. We’re going to help you do that. This primary season, FiveThirtyEight and the Center for Public Integrity , a nonprofit investigative news organization, are teaming up to track those filings and update this page with the latest numbers each quarter. Fundraising is obviously hugely important to a political campaign, but fundraising numbers alone can’t always tell you whether campaign is going strong or hitting the skids. (For example, women and people of color generally have a harder time raising money than white men do, so a strong quarter for Sen. Kamala Harris might still bring in a lower total than a similarly strong quarter for Sanders.) Instead, think of fundraising as one more indicator of campaign health, alongside things like endorsements , polls and media coverage . Together, all these metrics give us a sense of who is attracting attention heading into the primaries and caucuses. Here’s how the 2020 money race is shaping up. Totals here include all the money a candidate raised for the presidential race this quarter, regardless of whether it’s earmarked for the primary or the general election. The leader Sen. Bernie Sanders led the Democrats this quarter, raising $20.7 million. That’s $4.2 million more than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who came in second with $16.5 million, and $9.6 million less than President Trump, who raised $30.3 million in the first quarter. But wait, you might grumble, this is exactly the sort of boring financial coverage that gives people an incomplete picture of the race! You’d have a point. In general, these numbers make more sense when they’re judged against candidates’ expectations. We’ve written before about the relationship between poll numbers and name recognition — namely, politicians tend to have higher net favorability ratings when more voters know who they are — and it stands to reason that higher name recognition could translate to more money as well. After all, people don’t donate to candidates they’ve never heard of. Here’s how Democratic candidates’ fundraising this quarter compares to their name recognition. Big names tend to get more cash Not well known, raised a lot Like Mitt Romney in early 2007 Well known, raised a lot Like Jeb Bush in early 2015 Not well known, raised a little Like Carly Fiorina in early 2015 Well known, raised a little Like Rick Perry in early 2015 Estimated name recognition: % Total raised: $NaNM Name recognition was estimated using favorability polls — the share of respondents who had any opinion (positive or negative) of a candidate is used as a proxy for the share of people who know who the candidate is. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who leads in name recognition at 88.8 percent, was the first-place fundraiser this year. But bear in mind, candidates who raise a lot might not be getting all of it from individual donors. These totals include money from PACs, money left over from previous races and money the candidate gives to his or her own campaign — Mitt Romney, for example, boosted his fundraising totals in 2007 with a healthy contribution from his own pocket.

This week on Hot Takedown, we’re reacting to a series of upsets in the first round of the NBA playoffs. The Los Angeles Clippers pulled off the biggest comeback in playoff history, but we don’t necessarily think the Warriors should be too worried for the rest of the series. Other upsets included the No. 7 seed Orlando Magic defeating the No. 2 Toronto Raptors; that Game 1 victory had Mike Tuck on “Open Mike” from Orlando’s 96.9 The Game positing that Orlando is underrated in the Eastern Conference. Our basketball guru, Chris Herring, makes a guest appearance to help us break down this claim.
Someone who is openly shaking in his boots this week is golfing great Jack Nicklaus. Tiger Woods’s victory at the Masters gave him his 15th major, just three behind Nicklaus’s all-time record. Does Tiger have it in him to catch Jack? Or do we expect this to be his last big victory?

Which NBA Playoff Teams Have The Most Star Power? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Neil Paine,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-playoff-teams-have-the-most-star-power/,"0 0 * Star points are based on a weighted total of a team’s stars, in which Alphas are worth 3 points, Betas are worth 2, and Gammas are worth 1. Team totals do not include injured players. Sources: ESPN, Basketball-Reference.com
The Rockets and Sixers rank just below the Warriors and Raptors in star points with 5 apiece, but where in that group is Milwaukee, the East’s No. 1 seed? The Bucks have perhaps the Alpha of all Alphas this season in Giannis Antetokounmpo. But only one other player around him qualified as a star: Eric Bledsoe is a Gamma, while Brook Lopez barely misses the cutoff. Milwaukee’s overall lack of supporting star power would make it a historical anomaly if it does end up winning the NBA title.
The Utah Jazz, in the midst of a brutal first-round matchup against the Rockets, also has very little star power (one Beta in Rudy Gobert). But they have a bunch of guys who just barely missed Gamma status: Joe Ingles, Derrick Favors, Ekpe Udoh and Donovan Mitchell all had CARMELO plus/minus ratings under +2.5 but greater than +1.5. If we added an extra category for “Deltas” — worth, say, a half-point per player — the Jazz would leapfrog Boston and be much closer to the top of the heap than the bottom.
Regardless, there’s a reason that star points don’t track perfectly with a team’s CARMELO rating or its championship odds. Depth does matter some, even if the effect is less of a factor as rotations shorten during the postseason. And sometimes teams are simply built with a blueprint that helps them perform better than their star power would suggest (the Bucks are a good test case there as well), while others aren’t quite as good as their multiple stars say they should be (the Sixers could be lumped into that group).
Before they blew a 31-point lead Monday night — and, more importantly, lost Cousins to injury — the Warriors were looking every bit the star-studded machine we thought they’d be all season long. Now, they are still sizable favorites to win it all , but their edge in star power is not quite as decisive as it’s been in recent seasons. We’ll find out soon enough whether that will matter in Golden State’s quest for a third straight championship, or if another team near the top of the rankings above can finally supplant the Warriors and build a star-powered legacy of its own.

Mueller’s Report Doesn’t Exonerate Trump. But Does That Matter? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/muellers-report-does-not-exonerate-trump-but-does-that-matter/,"Twitter EMILY SCHERER / GETTY IMAGES
Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election finally became public this morning, with an explanation for why he didn’t come to a conclusion about whether President Trump committed obstruction of justice that appeared to be in tension with Attorney General William Barr’s interpretation of the report. In a press conference before Mueller’s report was released, Barr offered an explanation for his decision not to prosecute the president on obstruction of justice charges, saying that he believes that regardless of whether Trump actually committed obstructive acts, he’s satisfied that the president had “ non-corrupt motives .”
Mueller’s report , however, is darker and more ambiguous. Mueller’s team found “multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations.” And in many cases, Trump was kept out of further legal hot water by his staff’s unwillingness to carry out his directives, such as when his White House counsel refused to fire Mueller. Mueller pointedly wrote in the introduction to the section of the report dealing with obstruction that the report did not “exonerate” Trump. Mueller also wrote that he didn’t try to come to a conclusion about the president’s innocence or guilt because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that prevents a sitting president from being charged and put on trial — which he saw himself as bound by.
The report also said that although there were many contacts between members of the Trump campaign and people affiliated with the Russian government, there was insufficient evidence to prove that the campaign was involved in a criminal conspiracy with Russia.
The question, now, is what Congress will do.
Although Barr has closed the door on criminal charges for Trump, Mueller’s evidence and analysis — particularly the story Mueller told of Trump’s willingness to repeatedly interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation — could take on a very different meaning in a political context. The president’s conduct doesn’t have to be criminal to be impeachable ; instead, Congress can consider, among other factors, whether his behavior represents an ongoing threat to the country.
In a debate over whether Trump’s behavior merits political consequences like investigations or impeachment, Mueller’s evidence and — in the case of obstruction of justice — his analysis will be an important guide for Congress. Even though Mueller’s team didn’t think the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia rose to the level of a crime and Barr concluded that Trump shouldn’t be charged with obstruction of justice, that doesn’t necessarily matter in a political context.
Democratic leaders, though, have set a high bar for impeachment, saying that any effort would need to be bipartisan . And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier today that he thinks Trump “has every right to feel good about what we’ve heard today.”
As the Mueller investigation wore on , Americans’ perspectives on Mueller became more and more politically polarized, with Republicans much less likely than Democrats to say they approve of the special counsel. Mueller’s favorable rating among Republicans did jump up quite dramatically after the release of Barr’s letter to Congress last month highlighting what he said were the report’s key findings. But Republicans were also much more likely than Democrats to say that the report (which hadn’t yet been released) had cleared Trump’s name, which means this support may decline if the report is widely perceived to be critical of the president.
So while Mueller’s report certainly contains details that are much worse for the president than Barr’s letter or his press conference indicated, it’s not clear yet what the political consequences — if any — will be. The report has, however, given ample fodder for a political showdown — including potential congressional testimony by Mueller himself. From ABC News:"

Is The Mueller Report A BFD?,fivethirtyeight.com,Nate Silver (nrsilver@fivethirtyeight.com),04-19-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-mueller-report-a-bfd/,"Is The Mueller Report A BFD?
Welcome to a special, extra edition of FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat . The transcript below has been lightly edited.
sarahf ( Sarah Frostenson , politics editor): At long last, we have special counsel Robert Mueller’s report into Russian interference in the 2016 election. And compared with Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the report , which he sent to Congress last month, it paints a murkier picture of whether President Trump might have obstructed justice; for example, the report includes details of the president attempting to fire the special counsel.
Ultimately, though, Mueller’s team wrote that it did not have the confidence to clearly state that the president either did or did not obstruct justice and that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
So, tell me … now that we have the report, is it a BFD?
ameliatd ( Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux , senior writer): The obstruction findings were a BFD, to me, because I was surprised by how clear Mueller was in suggesting that Trump had corrupt intent when he took various actions around the Russia investigation (such as firing FBI Director James Comey). That was a big deal, for Mueller to paint such a dark picture of Trump and his White House.
Mueller essentially told the story of a president who’s willing to intervene in ongoing criminal investigations to serve his own ends, and I wasn’t expecting Mueller to do that so directly.
Whether anything will come of that is another question, though, since Mueller himself didn’t actually come to a conclusion on obstruction.
clare.malone ( Clare Malone , senior political writer): “Our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can validly prohibit a president’s corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere with an investigation.”
That line from the report really stood out to me in contrast to what we’d been hearing from Barr over the past few weeks.
perry ( Perry Bacon Jr. , senior writer): There was a whole, whole lot of obstruction documented here. Like 95 on a scale of 1-100, to me. And it sounds like Mueller didn’t conclude that Trump obstructed justice largely because Justice Department guidelines are viewed as not allowing a president to be charged with a crime . Mueller all but said Trump obstructed repeatedly.
ameliatd: There were a lot of things that were pretty different from what we heard from Barr, both in his summary and in his press conference today — it will be interesting to see what happens if Mueller does testify before Congress. I will be curious to hear what he thinks about how Barr handled this.
clare.malone: I agree, Amelia. I sort of wonder if he’ll unburden himself in a lawyerly way.
ameliatd: I am sure that he’ll do some expert hair-splitting. But still. It will have to be hair-splitting to explain some of the discrepancies between how Barr characterized the report/Mueller’s analysis and what we can read in the actual report.
sarahf: Let’s dive into those discrepancies a bit.
What do we think are the key ways in which Barr’s summary and comments in the press conference on Thursday differed from Mueller’s team’s conclusions?
ameliatd: Well, Barr said on Thursday that Mueller’s decision not to come down on obstruction was not driven by an opinion from the Justice Department saying that a sitting president can’t be indicted. And that was important in the wake of the Barr summary because it raised the question — OK, so is Mueller not coming down on this because there just isn’t enough evidence to support obstruction charges?.
Reading Mueller’s report, it is very clear that he started from the position that he couldn’t indict the president and then charted his path from there.
perry: Barr, to me, implied that Mueller couldn’t reach a conclusion on obstruction, like it was a 50-50 call or something, based on the evidence. It looks like Mueller saw obstruction and the question was should he indict based on that or defer to Congress.
clare.malone: I was going to say what Amelia and Perry said. Barr really seemed to have been misleading.
 I’ve mostly read Volume 1 so far — i.e., the collusion/conspiracy part — and there are some discrepancies there as well. Namely, Barr downplays the extent to which people in the Trump campaign were sometimes receptive to efforts to coordinate with Russia. (Although they rebuffed them at other times.)
From the report:
And from Barr’s letter:
perry: Also, Barr in his press conference today implied that Trump was annoyed by the investigation because it was hurting his presidency and the media coverage was bothering him. The report suggests that Trump was worried where the investigation might lead and wanted to stop it by any means necessary.
sarahf: Right. That’s the part of the report that hasn’t gotten as much attention — Mueller’s team wrote that “while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.”
ameliatd: Barr’s summary also seemed to imply that the fact that there wasn’t an underlying crime (i.e., nobody within the Trump campaign was ultimately charged with coordinating with Russia) had an impact on whether Trump could have obstructed justice. Mueller said very pointedly that you can charge obstruction without an underlying crime.
perry: Mueller’s team also notes that the collusion/conspiracy/coordination investigation was hampered by Trump allies lying about what happened.
clare.malone: More to the Russia side of things, not obstruction?
I think there’s still the question of why Trump was so into being pro-Russia or accepting help. You could maybe extrapolate that he had business interests …
natesilver: But “evidence not sufficient to support criminal charges” is a lot different than “no evidence” or “no effort to coordinate.” For instance, the stuff about former Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort sharing internal polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik (a Russian political operative with suspected ties to Russian intelligence) — including the emphasis the Trump campaign would go on to place on Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania! — isn’t great for Trump. And Mueller isn’t sure what happened to that data, in part because Manafort isn’t a reliable witness so everything about what he did is murky.
perry: Right, there is “no evidence to support criminal charges” on the collusion part is just way different than nothing happened.
clare.malone: Yeah, especially given the narrow definition that Mueller gave to “collusion.” And we should note that there are a lot of other criminal referrals that came from this investigation, so there’s still some story left to tell. Politics Podcast: The Fallout From The Mueller Report Has Just Begun
ameliatd: Clare, to your point, it’s also relevant that Mueller focused very narrowly on 2016 election interference. We don’t know what he found and turned over to other investigators.
One other big unanswered question on the Russia side: Why were all of these people making false statements about their ties to Russia?
natesilver: Maybe because (i) there’s a lot of “smoke,” enough for them to be paranoid even if it all doesn’t amount to a criminal conspiracy to interfere with 2016; and/or (ii) nobody actually is quite sure what happened or what didn’t because the campaign was such a shitshow; and/or (iii) they’re people who lie habitually?
And for the most part, the report confirms media reporting, as well as material uncovered in earlier indictments that Mueller issued.
ameliatd: I genuinely don’t know, Nate. I think the explanation could be any of the above, all of the above or none of the above. It’s just so puzzling. It’s also puzzling that Trump saw the Russia investigation as such a serious threat , and ultimately we’re left with something that’s not so dramatic.
natesilver: The one thing Mueller really seems to go out of his way to bat down is the idea that Russia interfered to change the GOP platform on Ukraine — he seems pretty confident that there’s an innocent-enough explanation for that, which is that Trump had already taken a position on Ukraine on the campaign trail and the campaign/Republicans didn’t want the GOP platform to contradict it.
perry: And he also downplays the idea that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions was involved in much of anything during the campaign.
natesilver: Yeah, he bats down the Sessions stuff too.
clare.malone: One thing that does come across in the report is that a lot of this obstruction stuff was self-inflicted. So, it could be just the idea of Trump being habituated to the “deny, deny, deny” theory of PR. Which, when you’re president, leads you down a pretty dangerous road.
perry: I think I get why he wants to end the investigation. Volume 1 documents: Trump going around telling former national security advisor Michael Flynn to get Hillary Clinton’s emails. Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner meeting with Russians to get dirt on Clinton. The various things Manafort was doing that would all look bad for Trump.
So all of that stuff in total looks pretty bad.
natesilver: For the most part, though, if you were one of those people who, from the Barr memo, characterized the media’s entire Trump-Russia coverage as a gigantic fail … well, the Mueller report itself makes you look pretty dumb. All of the stuff that people were expecting to be in there is pretty much in there. And some of it is reasonably serious! But does it amount to a criminal conspiracy? Mueller thinks not.
perry: Like Volume 2 (obstruction) is worse for Trump than Volume 1 (collusion), but if Trump knew most of what is detailed in Volume 1, I can see why he wanted to stop the investigation.
clare.malone: Volume 2 just lays out a lot of Keystone Kops scenarios: Trump giving different orders to different people, mismanaged responses to media stories dropping, etc.
natesilver: And also, to the extent that his efforts to obstruct the probe were pretty serious, maybe Mueller didn’t find out everything he could have in Volume 1.
The report actually says that at some point, and it seems particularly relevant for the Manafort-related stuff. I'm not an expert on this stuff, but this seems like an interesting part on page 18 of the PDF that I haven't seen other people point out, where Mueller says his conclusions could conceivably be different if not for witnesses lying, invoking privilege, etc. pic.twitter.com/nRm85Ec4zj
— Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) April 18, 2019
ameliatd: It does seem pretty clear that Mueller was frustrated with his inability to get reliable information out of Manafort. I wonder now that the report is out whether we’ll actually see any pardons.
That’s been hanging over the investigation this whole time, and it would actually be unusual, from a historical perspective, if no one implicated in the Mueller investigation ended up being pardoned.
natesilver: I mean, that would be a very risky move for the White House politically.
ameliatd: Right. There’s a reason why presidents wait until they’re on their way out the door to pardon people.
clare.malone: Who do we think the most likely candidates for a pardon are?
ameliatd: Manafort.
clare.malone: Yeah.
ameliatd: Maybe someone like George Papadopoulos , who was a relatively minor figure.
natesilver: But maybe Trump would do it. You sometimes get the sense that the whole way the White House played it was more to soothe Trump’s ego than to necessarily win the battle of public opinion. The press conference this morning didn’t help the White House at all, I don’t think.
perry: Well, the report suggests that Manafort stayed loyal to Trump. But the report also says he was involved in some of the stuff that looks most collusion-like (meeting with Russian officials and discussing poll numbers).
Pardoning Manafort would be a really stupid political move.
But he might do it anyway.
ameliatd: If this report has taught me anything it is that Trump does not think about risk in a way that I understand.
clare.malone: I feel like Trump definitely misses the forest for the trees. ALL THE TIME.
perry: Well, it appears Trump is always trying to get deputies to actually carry out the legally dubious actions .
So I suppose that is smart.
sarahf: OK, on the question of obstruction of justice, though, what did we learn that was particularly damning or mischaracterized by Barr’s interpretation that made it a big deal?
After all, there were some examples in which Mueller’s team said that the president had the prerogative to, say, fire Comey because it didn’t prevent the FBI from continuing its investigation.
But in other instances, Trump was arguably saved from complicated legal issues only because someone in his administration intervened.
ameliatd: It would have been huge if Trump had actually managed to fire Mueller.
clare.malone: Well, the Comey thing is more complicated, though. It’s within Trump’s power to fire the FBI director, but the way he went about it and the reasons given could tilt it more toward obstruction.
perry: The actual activities had been reported — trying to get Mueller fired, firing Comey. But Mueller provided new details that suggest Trump really was behaving in nefarious ways — like deciding to fire Comey but then trying to get Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to say he came up with the idea is pretty bold. And trying to get former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowki to tell Sessions to basically un-recuse himself from the Russia probe and stop parts of the investigation.
ameliatd: And Barr was making it seem like maybe the evidence wasn’t there, when in fact Mueller said he couldn’t charge Trump but he could, in theory, clear him of wrongdoing. Then Mueller explicitly said he could not exonerate Trump, which suggests Mueller does think the evidence was at least somewhat compelling.
perry: The report shows Trump being deeply involved in the details of trying to stop the investigation and obscure his role in stopping the investigation.
ameliatd: Which makes it pretty clear that Mueller found this evidence at the very least compelling, in terms of obstruction. And he didn’t buy arguments from the president’s defenders that Trump couldn’t obstruct justice by firing Comey because it’s one of his constitutional powers, regardless of his motivation.
perry: Right.
ameliatd: I also just want to note that Mueller said explicitly that a president could be charged with obstruction after leaving office. And Barr just closed that door!
natesilver: Are y’all surprised at how wantonly Barr was willing to spin?
clare.malone: No, Nate — I guess not?
natesilver: I mean, I guess I thought that, say, if the actual report were a 5 out of 10 for Trump (on a scale where 0 is terrible and 10 is great), he’d be willing to spin it to a 6 or a 6.5. Instead he tried to spin it to an 8.
ameliatd: I am surprised, if only because it seemed so ill-advised. Eventually, much of the report was going to go to Congress and the public, right? So why be so misleading?
clare.malone: To play to Trump?
perry: I think Nate suggested this in the podcast , but the report would have basically met my expectations if it came out pre-Barr’s summary . But the White House took the Barr letter and framed it as an exoneration. So that made the report even more damning — I expected it to be not that bad, and it was, on the merits, really bad for Trump.
sarahf: So to that point about expectations — how much of the Mueller report did we already have ?
ameliatd: I don’t think there’s much of the report that is genuinely new, but there’s a lot we hadn’t heard from Mueller before.
natesilver: Let’s keep in mind: If you’re willing to work for Trump — at, frankly, a lot of risk to your reputation and maybe also some legal risk — then maybe you’re a True Believer after all.
sarahf: But do we really think this is bad for Trump? For example, what do we think Congress actually does next? Or will it be advantageous for Democrats to use this in 2020?
natesilver: It’s not that bad for Trump. It’s a 5 out of 10, relative to pre-Barr letter expectations. But it feels a lot worse because of Barr’s clumsy attempts at spin.
clare.malone: I think Democrats are going to: Want Mueller to testify. Face a struggle between leadership (which has resisted impeachment efforts ) and a renewed push to start impeachment hearings. And fundraise off making the full Mueller report available!
perry: The report portrays Trump very negatively. And a report can be bad in a legal sense that is separate from its electoral impact.
ameliatd: One of the main takeaways for me is that the report has given Democrats ammunition to drag this fight out without necessarily calling for impeachment. Instead, they can call Mueller to testify, call Barr to testify, and use what’s in the report to support more investigations.
clare.malone: We’re already seeing Trump campaign emails and videos out today pushing the line that the tables need to be turned and the investigators investigated. We’re already seeing the playbook for how the Mueller report will play out in the campaign: Trump running with the idea that he was persecuted, and Democrats running with the whole “can you believe this guy?” line.
natesilver: The report is bad, but it’s roughly in line with what people would have expected, as Amelia and Perry said. Keep in mind that only 42 percent of the public approves of Trump , and that’s in a really good economy! They don’t think he’s honest about Russia or other things. They also didn’t necessarily expect there to be a smoking gun about collusion/conspiracy. The public was way smarter than the media on this stuff, I think.
ameliatd: Barr’s little intro to obstruction of justice in the press conference, saying that Trump was facing all of these investigations and scrutiny and there was ultimately no collusion, seems like it will be very useful for Trump and his defenders.
perry: So earlier today, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer made this “no impeachment” statement. And as you can see the tweet referring to it was ratioed : “Based on what we have seen to date, going forward on impeachment is not worthwhile at this point. Very frankly, there is an election in 18 months and the American people will make a judgement,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told @DanaBashCNN .
— Manu Raju (@mkraju) April 18, 2019
natesilver: But Hoyer is right on the politics of this. Impeachment is not a popular option . As Amelia said, call Mueller to testify. Call Barr to testify. Call other people to testify. So you can have a drip, drip, drip against Trump, mostly to satisfy partisans and keep him off balance. But impeachment? Not popular.
clare.malone: The ultimate “ Twitter is not the Democratic base ” stance!
natesilver: It’s also Trump’s first term. The Nixon/Clinton impeachment efforts both came in the second term, when those presidents were lame ducks and there wasn’t any recourse from the public.
ameliatd: I’m not sure this gives Democrats much fodder for more investigations because the obstruction stuff was so clear and there don’t seem to be many more avenues to explore the 2016 election. Maybe it helps them get momentum to look into Trump’s finances for ties to Russia ?
natesilver: Also, if Trump were unpopular enough that he could be not only impeached but also removed by the Senate — which would mean that his approval rating with Republicans would have to be way down — wouldn’t you rather run against him anyway?
That would probably imply he had like a 29 percent approval rating or something, in which case the Democratic nominee in 2020 would be on track to win in an epic landslide and maybe pick up some huge congressional majorities too.
clare.malone: But what does it take for him to slide to that point? And is that a realistic expectation given our political environment, Nate? That just seems to be a pretty unlikely thing to happen.
natesilver: No, I’m not saying that at all.
I’m saying that impeachment won’t actually result in his removal from office unless he’s fallen to like 30 percent.
But if he’s fallen to 30 percent, Democrats don’t want to impeach him because then they’re basically guaranteed a landslide victory in 2020!
ameliatd: And if they impeach him, they risk turning him into a martyr.
sarahf: OK, to wrap … We have the report. And the evidence that Mueller had on the question of obstruction justice was a bigger deal than Barr indicated in his initial summary. But what does the report’s release actually change? Is it a question of who wins the political narrative?
ameliatd: This is the tricky thing about special counsel investigations! If they don’t come to a conclusive result, it’s hard to know what to do with the findings politically.
clare.malone: Basically, Democrats have to keep their base on board with the long-term plan of winning back the White House and not the short-term impulse to impeach.
perry: The question, I think, that is on the table is: What is the non-impeachment remedy for a president who appears to be at least somewhat open to violating norms and/or laws?
natesilver: What does it change going forward? I dunno. The Barr memo didn’t do much to shift public opinion in Trump’s favor , so Occam’s razor is that the Mueller report won’t do much to shift public opinion against him.
I do think it will make the press more skeptical of Barr and any efforts the White House makes to normalize its conduct.
ameliatd: And it does mean we’re going to keep hearing about the investigation, which could be good for Democrats because people are so fired up about it.
natesilver: It certainly describes a White House and a campaign that’s in total disarray. In the end, as Perry said earlier, I think it brings us back to where we were a month ago, where “the Russia stuff” is a negative for Trump and one of the reasons his approval rating is so low but not an acute crisis for him or the first (or second or third or fourth) thing that voters are thinking about.

Which Positions Do Teams Obsess Over (And Overlook) On Draft Day?,fivethirtyeight.com,Michael Salfino,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-positions-do-teams-obsess-over-and-overlook-on-draft-day/,"* Draft points are found by adding up the values per pick from FootballPerspective.com. Sources: pro-football-reference.com. Over the Cap, FootballPerspective.com
Tight ends will get 4.9 percent of the salary pie this year, but teams have spent only 1.8 percent of first-round value on the position. Looking at the past nine drafts, it’s also clear that the running back balance is out of whack: GMs have spent 5.5 percent of their draft capital on the position (led by the game’s fiercest defender of RB value , the Giants’ Dave Gettleman) compared with just 4.3 percent of 2019 salaries.
Wide receivers also seem to be getting short-changed on draft day. But this may have to do more with how difficult it is to assess them. The position has proved exceedingly difficult to scout, judging by first-round bust rate . What’s more, many of the drills that wide receivers endure at the scouting combine don’t seem to predict actual NFL success . So maybe spending more money on proven receivers rather than rolling the dice in the draft than you are willing to spend in the draft is wise. After all, the smartest team in football hasn’t drafted a wide receiver in the first round in 23 years.
But by far the biggest incongruity in absolute value among the positions is on the defensive line, where teams are spending 16.6 percent of their money but 22.4 percent of their first-round draft power. Teams seem to be buying into the belief that, after quarterback, the most valuable player in the league is the person who trying to throw the quarterback to the ground.
The rate at which teams spend first-round picks on pass rushers is likely to climb even higher this year given that defensive linemen are expected to rule this draft like no other . In some mock drafts, as many as five or six defensive linemen are projected to be selected among the first 10 picks. Looking at SBNation’s mock draft database 1 and pairing that with Chase Stuart’s Draft Value Chart , we can predict that an amazing 37.7 percent of first-round draft capital will be spent on defensive linemen. Yet not one safety is expected to be drafted in the first round, and just two linebackers who aren’t pass-rush specialists, LSU’s Devin White and Michigan’s Devin Bush.
The experts who follow the draft most closely are also predicting that general managers will more heavily weight a prospect playing quarterback than his scouting grade. Despite this quarterback draft class being regarded by some experts as subpar, four signal callers are expected to be selected in the first round, including three in the top 10 — something that’s happened just five times since 1970 . Any chance to land a good quarterback at the relative bargain-basement price of a rookie contract is apparently too tempting to pass up. Footnotes
This consensus of mock drafts makes it possible for one player to be “selected” by multiple teams, but it’s used here simply for assessing the predicted position being drafted at each slot, not the specific player.

"Bernie Sanders Can Win, But He Isn’t Polling Like A Favorite | FiveThirtyEight",fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bernie-sanders-can-win-but-he-isnt-polling-like-a-favorite/,"12 1.6 Only candidates whose favorability was asked about in all three polls are included in the table. Morning Consult poll was conducted April 15-21, Monmouth University poll conducted April 4-9 and Saint Anselm College conducted April 3-8. Sources: Polls
From what data we do have, however, Sanders’s favorability ranks somewhere in the middle of the Democratic pack. While Sanders does well in the Morning Consult poll, he has relatively high negatives in the polls of Iowa and New Hampshire. On average between the polls, Sanders has a favorable rating of 70 percent and an unfavorable rating of 22 percent, or a ratio of 3.1 to 1. That’s good, but not great. Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar are much less well-known than Sanders but have about the same favorable-to-unfavorable ratio among voters who know them. And Buttigieg, Biden, Harris, Cory Booker and O’Rourke have better ratios than Sanders. 7
So while Sanders currently trails only Biden in first-choice preferences, it’s not clear who would win a one-on-one race between, say, Sanders and Booker, or Sanders and Buttigieg, especially once Booker and Buttigieg became as well-known as Sanders is. Buttigieg in particular is already running close to Sanders in some recent polls (though not others) despite considerably lower name recognition. Learning the lessons of 2016 — or overlearning them?
But doesn’t all of this sound awfully familiar ? The chances of a candidate who polls fairly well are dismissed by the media on the theory that he lacks support from party elites and/or because supposedly he’s a factional candidate who won’t improve his support beyond his 20 percent or 25 percent base?
We made all of those arguments in 2016 about Donald Trump, about which — of course — we were pretty darned wrong .
The parallels between Sanders in 2020 and Trump in 2016 aren’t perfect, by any means. Sanders isn’t exactly a traditional politician, but he’s much closer to being one than a reality-TV star like Trump is. Trump initially polled poorly but surged in the summer of 2015, whereas Sanders started out polling well from the get-go. 8 Trump (after his surge) was polling in first place, whereas Sanders is second behind Biden. Perhaps most importantly, Republicans use a winner-take-all system in some of their primaries, especially later on the race, so winning 30 or 35 or 40 percent of the vote could allow Trump to win a preponderance of delegates. The Democratic system is more proportional, so the same vote totals for Sanders might result in a contested convention.
Still, the cases are similar enough that Democrats see the parallels — “a political scenario all too reminiscent of how Mr. Trump himself seized the Republican nomination in 2016” is how the Times article put it . Reporters and people analyzing the campaigns see the parallels too, and that undoubtedly makes them reluctant to downplay Sanders’s chances — all the more so since Sanders himself did better in 2016 than most people (myself included) expected.
But our goal here at FiveThirtyEight is not to make predictions that minimize the amount of crap we get from readers. Instead, it’s to use data and history to zoom out and provide as much perspective as possible. Over the long run, that philosophy has worked pretty well . And over the long run, and across a larger sample — not just the recency bias brought about by 2016 — candidates in Sanders’s position have been fairly big underdogs against their respective fields , 9 whether on the basis of polling alone or polling plus other factors. That doesn’t mean Sanders can’t win or won’t win, or that his support is only about name recognition . But in a field this wide open, and so early on in the race, he’s equivalent to a No. 1 or a No. 2 seed in the 68-team NCAA basketball tournament : about as likely (arguably) as anyone else to win it all, but still a clear underdog against the field.

Sanders’s numbers improved slightly after he officially announced his bid , but they’ve since fallen a bit from their peak.
Candidates in Biden’s position — polling at about 30 percent nationally — have also historically been underdogs against their fields, although less so.

Who Owns The Dinosaurs? It All Depends On Where You Find Them | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Maggie Koerth-Baker,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-owns-the-dinosaurs-it-all-depends-on-where-you-find-them/,"“Samson,” one of the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons ever found, was auctioned off to a private buyer who has not made the fossil available to scientists or the public. Ethan Miller / Getty Images
In early April, a paleontology graduate student, Robert DePalma, published a major find in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and hyped the discovery in The New Yorker . Locked in layers of North Dakota rock, he had found an impressive collection of ancient fish , microorganisms and plants that date to the same time period as the infamous global extinction event that killed the dinosaurs. That extinction is widely believed to have been caused by an asteroid impact, and DePalma’s site seems to offer further evidence supporting that theory.
But behind the discovery lurked an uncomfortable question: Who should own a fossil? DePalma’s dig site — which he called Tanis after the real ancient Egyptian city depicted in “Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark” — is on privately owned ranchland. That allowed him to sidestep bureaucratic red tape and set contracts that give him perpetual control over the management of any fossils from the site — even those that end up being given or sold to museums and research institutions. Those contract clauses are an unprecedented arrangement, according to other paleontologists, and they mean that the Tanis finds bump up against some bigger debates about fossil ownership. Turns out, where you dig matters almost as much as what you find there.
The central issue is one that should be familiar to any Indiana Jones fan: Where does a specimen belong once it has been dug up? In 2009, Congress passed the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, a law that comes down squarely on the side of “in a museum.” Under the law, most fossil digging on federal lands requires a permit, those permits can only be obtained by qualified scientists, and any specimens that are found belong to the public. Scientists at accredited museums and research centers get first dibs.
But none of that applies on private land, said Thomas Carr, senior scientific advisor at Wisconsin’s Dinosaur Discovery Museum and director of the Institute of Paleontology at Carthage College. There, both access to the land and ownership of the fossils usually go to whoever is willing to pay landowners the most, he told me. And that often means commercial fossil hunters who sell specimens to private collectors rather than museums and research institutions.
That makes a difference because, like all scientists, paleontologists are supposed to ensure that their work can be reproduced. For a fossil to be scientifically valuable, both it and its geologic context need to be carefully documented, and it has to remain accessible to future scientists who want to re-examine and reinterpret it. And that’s not always possible with fossils that come from private land.
In some cases, landowners might not have much incentive to give anyone access to fossils at all, said J.P. Cavigelli, museum collections specialist for the Tate Geological Museum at Wyoming’s Casper College. For instance, a lot of fossils in the eastern part of the United States are found in quarries. Cavigelli told me about visiting a quarry in North Carolina and seeing a beautiful exposed layer rich with fossils. But the value to the quarry owners was in the rock, not the specimens. “In the last few years, they just blew through that whole layer,” he said.
In other cases, fossil hunting on private lands means important fossils become interior decoration rather than science. Carr lamented the loss of “ Samson ,” one of the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex skeletons ever found. It last sold for around $5 million in 2009, to a private buyer who wanted their identity kept secret. “It’s virtually perfect, and it’s gone. The skull is in the lobby of some company somewhere,” Carr said. And while Samson has been put on public display before , Carr said that the lack of contextual information and the fact that it isn’t being kept in a museum or research facility makes it virtually useless to science. “Even if I knew where it was now, I wouldn’t make the effort to study it,” he said.
But while some scientists, like Carr, are generally opposed to doing paleontology on private land, Tanis isn’t the only professional, scientific dig happening beyond the public’s reach. Cavigelli gets most of his specimens from digs on private land, for instance. And Pat Leiggi, director of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in Montana, told me that about 20 percent of the digs his museum is involved in happen on privately owned land or land owned by a state, where the laws governing digs on federal lands don’t apply.
Nobody knows exactly how much paleontology is done on public lands versus private lands, partly because profiteers who dig on private land and sell what they find don’t have to tell anyone what kinds of specimens they have delivered to private collections. But Carr has done some back-of-the-envelope calculations of how paleontology on private land affects access to Tyrannosaurus rex specimens. By Carr’s estimate, there are about 34 T. rex specimens in private hands. In a recent study he did on T. rex bone growth, Carr worked with 46 specimens, ranging from a complete skeleton down to individual bones. “If all those privately owned T. rexes were available, my sample size would leap to nearly 80,” he said.
Digs on private land also raise ethical complications about whether to treat fossils as a natural resource commodity that you’d pay landowners for, or as a piece of universal scientific heritage. For example: Should scientists pay landowners? Cavigelli does — first in “trespass fees” for exploratory digging and then, if any spectacular specimens are found, he writes up a separate agreement to compensate the landowners for taking the find to a museum. In one case, a mammoth was worth a tax write-off. In another, Cavigelli paid a landowner for a T. rex find. “They would have made more from a private collector,” Cavigelli said. “But they also wanted it to stay here and be on public exhibit. There are other landowners who want too much [money], and we don’t deal with those guys.”
Leiggi, in contrast, won’t deal with anyone who wants any money. He sees that as a violation of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology’s ethics rules, though the rules allow scientists to make payments if they bring a specimen into public trust. “I tell my staff we do not and will not ever get involved in that,” he said.
These kinds of disagreements contribute to professional skepticism of the Tanis site and the specimens found there. DePalma didn’t respond to requests for an interview, but Carr and Cavgelli both said they were troubled by the ownership stipulations in the contract described in the New Yorker article because it’s not clear how these types of ownership clauses would be used. For instance, both scientists worried about the possibility that DePalma could give or sell a fossil to a museum and, later, take it back, removing the specimen from the scientific purview. Landowners have tried to take back fossils donated to museums often enough that Cavigelli and Leiggi have to specify in writing that that isn’t possible. More broadly, the clauses add uncertainty to the already complicated world of fossil ownership. With a site that’s likely to be a big deal in science for years to come, that confusion could create a mess almost as big as an asteroid crashing to Earth.

Apparently The Regular Season Is Irrelevant In The NHL | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Josh Planos,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/apparently-the-regular-season-is-irrelevant-in-the-nhl/,"The Calgary Flames were one of two No. 1 seeds to fall in the first round of the NHL playoffs. Derek Leung / Getty Images
While the opening round of the NBA playoffs so far could have been blindly simulated , chaos is governing the ice.
Ranked dead last in early January , the St. Louis Blues completed arguably the greatest midseason U-turn in NHL history by advancing to the conference semifinals. And that’s probably just the third- most-surprising storyline of this young postseason. Tampa Bay and Calgary, the top seeds in each conference, survived less than two weeks, combining to win a single game. Never before had the President’s Trophy-winning team been swept. Never before had the top seeds both been eliminated in the opening round.
It has already seemed like “the year of the underdog” in the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs. But unlike its hardcourt brethren, the NHL is accustomed to things not going to plan in the “second season.” So how does this postseason stack up against years past? Using the archived money lines at SportsOddsHistory.com , we can decipher a team’s implied probability of advancing and use that to rank the wildest opening rounds in Stanley Cup history.
After marauding the league during the regular season, the Tampa Bay Lightning were installed as 1-to-4 favorites going into their series with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Jon Cooper’s outfit won the President’s Trophy behind 128 points and 62 regular-season wins, which tied for the most ever . Tampa was the league’s highest-scoring team by a generous margin, spearheaded by three 40-goal snipers — a feat that hadn’t been accomplished in nearly a quarter-century . Not since 2009-10 had there been a bigger favorite in a series. 1 Columbus checked in at +325, which translates to a 23 percent implied probability of winning after adjusting for the cut of the bookmaker, or the vigorish . 2 Tampa Bay fell apart against the new-kids-on-the-block Blue Jackets in what could be argued was the single biggest collapse in modern sport . What’s more, it was the first series win in Columbus franchise history.
“In today’s game with the parity, it’s not unusual that an eight [seed] beats a one anymore,” Cooper said after the loss . “Everybody’s that close.”
North of the border, the Calgary Flames were given a 67 percent implied probability of winning their series against the Colorado Avalanche. Bill Peters’s squad included the league’s second-best offense 3 and a triumvirate of 30-goal scorers . After taking the series opener, Calgary got buried in four straight games by the Avalanche, a wild-card club with the 17th-best record in the NHL .
“Obviously we were the big underdogs,” Avs center Nathan MacKinnon said . “And no one picked us to win.”
But the pandemonium didn’t stop there. Despite not having home ice, the Pittsburgh Penguins had a 59 percent implied probability of winning their series against the New York Islanders. They were promptly swept. The Nashville Predators, which had reached at least the second round in three consecutive seasons, had a 61 percent implied probability against the Dallas Stars, but the Preds fell in just six games.
The Vegas Golden Knights, last season’s expansion surprise , were slight favorites over the San Jose Sharks despite not having home ice. But the Sharks came back from down 3-1 in the series to force a Game 7, in which they found the net four times on one power play and edged Vegas in an all-time classic . “That’s a once in a lifetime game,” Sharks center Logan Couture told The Athletic . “I don’t think my heart can take another one like that.”
The Winnipeg Jets, meanwhile, entered the season on the short list of Cup contenders but were slight underdogs against St. Louis even with their home ice. They lasted only six games in the playoffs. And the Toronto Maple Leafs gave the favored Boston Bruins all they could handle before falling in Game 7. There’s potential for more chaos as well: The defending champion Washington Capitals hold home ice and a 57 percent implied probability of winning. But they failed to put away the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 6 and will need to win a series-deciding seventh game on Wednesday to stay alive.
In total, of the seven teams to advance so far to the second round, just two were favored (St. Louis and Boston), and just three of those with home ice advanced (Boston, San Jose and New York). Last year, seven of the eight opening-round matchups were won by the team holding home ice. Since the turn of the century, only 18 away teams have advanced to the second round without an implied probability of at least 35 percent. Two have come this season.
Which is to say, the second round won’t be as top-heavy in terms of quality as it has been in recent years. From the 2010-11 season through last year’s playoffs, 4 the average team to qualify for a conference semifinal team had been a 105-point outfit that was 0.39 goals better than the average team in that given season, according to Sports-Reference’s Simple Rating System . The average of this year’s crop is a 99-point outfit that’s 0.29 goals better than average. Three of the four best teams in the league didn’t even reach the second round. This means that the eventual winner is anybody’s guess: MoneyPuck.com gives six teams odds of better than 10 percent to win the whole thing, with the Blues leading the pack at 16 percent.
These gargantuan first-round upsets are rare, regardless of the sport. In MLB’s wild-card era, only five teams touting the best conference record have failed to reach the second round, according to the Elias Sports Bureau . In the NBA, a 1- or 2-seed hasn’t lost in the opening round of the playoffs since the top-seeded Chicago Bulls in 2012. But with its randomness, hockey stands out for its opportunities to surprise. Research by Michael J. Lopez, Gregory J. Matthews and Benjamin S. Baumer found that, on average, the better NBA team in a best-of-7 series advances 80 percent of the time. To match that rate, the NHL would require a best-of-51 series.
This postseason has been a difficult one for giants, with new blood chasing Lord Stanley’s Mug. And while the outcome in the NHL is far less predetermined than, say, the NBA or NFL, it’s been a banner two-week stretch of upsets. Suffice it to say that luck goes a long way in hockey (so too does a red-hot goalie). But seldom does the best team hoist the trophy at season’s end. That’s what makes professional hockey special — you can witness history every time you tune in. Footnotes
That year, Washington, Chicago and San Jose all had implied odds greater than 77 percent.
We calculated the true implied odds by dividing the implied probability of one team by the sum of the implied probability of both teams.

How Joe Biden Could Win The 2020 Democratic Nomination,fivethirtyeight.com,Nate Silver (nrsilver@fivethirtyeight.com),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-joe-biden-could-win-the-2020-democratic-nomination/,"+0.3 -2.7 The most recent poll from each polling firm is used for each matchup, dating back to polls from when Bernie Sanders officially entered the race (Feb. 19). Where a pollster included versions of a poll with and without Howard Schultz, we list the version without Schultz. Sources: Polls
But are these head-to-head polls actually a meaningful signal? To a first approximation, I’d say “no.” For one thing, presidential polls simply aren’t very accurate a year-and-a-half before a general election . (Even half a year out is marginal, for that matter.) For another, candidates with low name recognition tend to poll poorly in early, head-to-head matchups, so while the polls are somewhat interesting to look at for Biden and Sanders, they really don’t say very much about the lesser-known Democrats. For a third, Biden may have benefited from the fact that he hasn’t officially been running for the nomination and therefore has been somewhat above the fray. Sanders’s numbers with general election voters declined after he announced his candidacy , and Biden’s conceivably could too. For the time being, however, the polls give the Biden campaign a good talking point.
If some of the Biden campaign’s justifications for its electability argument are flimsy, others have some basis in reality. Other factors held equal, more moderate candidates tend to perform better in presidential elections , and Biden’s appeal to working-class white voters and African Americans could conceivably reduce or even reverse the Electoral College disadvantage that cost Hillary Clinton the presidency .
Biden’s “lane” is relatively clear. Although I wouldn’t go overboard with this, since “lanes” in the Democratic primary are still blurry , Biden faces relatively little competition for some of his base voters. In 2016, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , 25 percent of the Democratic primary electorate was in the baby boom generation or older and identified as moderate or conservative. Another 14 percent of Democrats were baby boomers or older and identified as “liberal” but not “very liberal.” Candidates such as O’Rourke and Amy Klobuchar will try to compete for those voters, but other candidates who might have done so — such as Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown 5 , former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg — declined to run for president. Democrats obviously did not clear the field for Biden — that so many candidates are running is a bearish indicator for him . But he did clear his own orbit, at least. Politics Podcast: Joe Biden's Path To The Democratic Nomination Biden also has some big liabilities
While there are several reasons to think Biden is not as strong as he appears in the polls, there are other critiques that I don’t find as convincing. So let me run through those quickly, just so you know I’m not ignoring them. They are: First, I’m not convinced that Biden’s positions on long-ago controversies such as school busing are liable to hurt him much. Although it’s not quite the same thing, we’ve found that voters tend to apply a high discount rate to presidential scandals ; a new scandal can hurt a candidate, but older ones tend to be priced into his stock. It’s reasonable to infer that the same is true of issue stances, especially in the case of Biden, when Democrats have eight years of more recent data in the form of his tenure as Obama’s vice president. And Biden’s not really trying to out-woke or out-liberal other Democrats anyway; his voters are older and more moderate. Second, the initial evidence from polls seems to be that Democrats are fairly indifferent toward accusations that Biden touched women inappropriately. I don’t want to totally dismiss this as a risk factor for Biden; there could be other accusations later that Democrats view differently, and party activists may care about the accusations even if rank-and-file Democrats don’t. Nonetheless, Biden is helped by the fact that (i) his base is older and less progressive and therefore less likely to view this sort of conduct as inappropriate and (ii) voters feel like they know him given his eight years as vice president. Third, while it’s worth noting that Biden’s previous presidential campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, flopped, the boilerplate criticism that he’s a “bad candidate” also strangely ignores his mostly controversy-free performances as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 and 2012 (and as a surrogate for Clinton in 2016 ). Plenty of politicians have learning curves as candidates, and although Biden will make his share of gaffes, I’m not sure that he’s necessarily more at risk of them than other, less-experienced candidates.
But there are several areas of real concern for Biden.
He’s really old for a presidential candidate. Biden is currently 76 and would be 78 upon taking the oath of office; the same age that Trump would be at the end of his second term . (Sanders is 77, so he has some of the same problems, of course.) And while there isn’t any hard-and-fast medical rule about how old is too old to run for president, 62 percent of general election voters (!) said they’d have reservations about voting for someone older than 75 in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , far more than the share who said they’d have reservations about a woman, an African American, or a gay or lesbian president. While you could argue that age is priced into voters’ assessments of Biden, there hasn’t really been a news cycle devoted to the age of the candidates yet, although there probably will be at some point.
Despite Biden’s credentials as Obama’s heir apparent, his party support may be lukewarm. Traditionally, former vice presidents are strong in a “Party Decides” model of the race in which party leaders and party activists have a lot of influence — or at least, are good leading indicators — over who rank-and-file voters eventually pick. In Biden’s case, however, the reception from the Democratic Party establishment has been mixed. He has some endorsements , including from the only Democratic senator (California’s Dianne Feinstein) and governor (Cuomo) to have endorsed a candidate from outside of their home states so far. But he isn’t racking up dozens of them, as Clinton already had at this point in the cycle in 2016 or Al Gore did in 2000. Nor, obviously, has Biden cleared the field of other candidates as Clinton and Gore did. And while Biden enjoys some support from former Obama staffers and donors , he by no means monopolizes it, with some ex-Obamaworld people having gravitated toward candidates such as O’Rourke and Buttigieg . (Obama himself is not expected to endorse a candidate anytime soon .) Party activists in the early states are also lukewarm on Biden and in some cases are actively opposed to him , based on surveys and interviews with them.
All of this makes Biden difficult to assess . He’s somewhere in between being a traditional, next-in-line front-runner, with the polling and party support to match, and a factional candidate, where the faction is the old guard of more moderate, working-class Democrats. Factional candidates sometimes can win their nominations, but it’s a harder road to navigate, especially given a Democratic nomination process where delegates are awarded in a highly proportional fashion and a plurality of support is not necessarily sufficient to avert a contested convention.
“Electability” could be inflating Biden’s numbers. In the California poll I mentioned earlier , Biden was the first choice of 26 percent of voters, but 35 percent of voters thought he was the most electable. The flip side to this is that only 13 percent of voters said they thought Biden had the best policy ideas. The same share of voters, 13 percent, thought Elizabeth Warren had the best policy ideas. But only 4 percent thought she had the best chance to beat Trump. And only 7 percent of voters had her as their first choice.
In essence, voters are averaging out how electable they see the candidates with how they see them on the issues. We shouldn’t necessarily expect that formula to change. Democrats really want to beat Trump, and they think electability is important.
But we could see assessments of the candidates’ electability even out as lesser-known candidates become more familiar to voters, perform well in the debates and eventually start winning primaries and caucuses. In 2008, for instance, electability was initially a huge advantage for Hillary Clinton , but that perception eroded after Obama won endorsements from trusted leaders , began to perform as well or better than Clinton in head-to-head polls against Republicans, and won Iowa, a general-election swing state that largely consists of white, working-class voters . That helped Obama gain ground in the polls against Clinton; voters no longer felt like they had to make a tradeoff between beating John McCain and picking the candidate they really liked.
It’s easy enough to imagine a similar process taking place this time around for Warren or Harris or Buttigieg, as voters grow more comfortable with how a woman or black or gay candidate would perform in the general election. Women candidates also performed extremely well in Democratic congressional primaries last year , so there’s a chance that several of the male candidates lose ground to women as perceptions of electability evolve beyond voters’ initial, gender-driven priors.
Harris and Cory Booker are likely to erode Biden’s support among black voters. Recent polling has shown Biden performing strongly among African American voters . Morning Consult has had him with around 40 percent of the black vote in its recent national surveys, for instance, and Quinnipiac had him at 44 percent in its national poll last month. Biden has also been performing well in polls of South Carolina , where about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate is black .
This is a real asset for Biden. Black voters — especially older black voters — tend to be more moderate than white Democrats, so they fit fairly naturally into his constituency. His tenure as Obama’s vice president undoubtedly also gives him credibility with black voters. Nonetheless, there are two major black candidates in the race, and Harris and Booker probably stand to gain ground with black voters as they become better-known, not unlike how it took some time for Obama to win over black voters in 2008 . The Biden campaign also said they expect some erosion, although it thinks that Biden could hold 25 percent to 30 percent of the black vote even once it occurs. That’s a fairly reasonable expectation, but it does mean that Biden’s overall numbers would decline a little bit from where they are now. 6
His media coverage will probably be unfriendly. The conventional wisdom about Biden has already been wrong at least once. His winning chances plummeted in betting markets after New York magazine published an account from Lucy Flores that Biden made her feel “uneasy, gross, and confused” when he allegedly kissed her on the back of her head at a campaign event of hers in 2014. But they later rebounded once a variety of polling showed that Democratic voters hadn’t changed their perceptions of Biden by much. So it’s possible that the media is underestimating how robust Biden’s support might turn out to be.
Media coverage could nonetheless be a problem for Biden. Within the mainstream media, the story of Biden winning the nomination will be seen as boring and anticlimactic. That tends not to lead to favorable coverage. Meanwhile, some left-aligned media outlets may prefer candidates who are some combination of more leftist, more wonkish, more reflective of the party’s diversity, and more adept on social media.
If Biden is framed as being out of touch with today’s Democratic Party and that narrative is repeated across a variety of outlets, it could begin to resonate with voters who don’t buy it initially. If he’s seen as a gaffe-prone candidate, then minor missteps on the campaign trail could be blown up into big fumbles. Biden might not have the sort of openly antagonistic relationship with the media that Hillary Clinton did — but he could have similar sorts of problems with it gradually sapping his favorability ratings . Two theories for how Biden can wage his campaign. Neither are sure to work.
As I mentioned earlier, Biden is unusual in that he embodies some aspects of a traditional, odds-on front-runner (good credentials, a claim to being the party’s natural successor, reasonably strong polling) and some of a factional candidate (lukewarm support from party elites, inability to clear the field, much stronger support with some demographic groups than others). That’s a challenge for him, because each of those archetypes involve different strategies.
As a front-runner, Biden would seek to build consensus by not being too combative with other candidates, playing it safe on policy, spending time before different Democratic constituencies (e.g., unions, black evangelicals) and seeking endorsements among these groups, putting a lot of time and effort into fundraising , and projecting forward to the general election by emphasizing his strengths against Trump. In essence, he’d go into a risk-averse, “prevent defense” mode . The goal would be to win Iowa and/or South Carolina, at which point the field would winnow and Biden could use his fairly broad favorability to appeal to the rest of the party and glide to the nomination. In this strategy, Biden is probably perfectly happy to have Sanders in the mix, since Sanders as a factional candidate soaks up support from candidates who might otherwise leapfrog Biden. Not to mention, Biden is probably a favorite against Sanders in a two-candidate race.
The problem with a prevent-defense strategy is that you tend to lose a few yards on every play even if you avoid giving up a long pass. And it’s not clear whether Biden’s position is robust enough to withstand this. If you’re Hillary Clinton and you start out with 60 percent or 65 percent of the vote , you can lose quite a bit of that support and still come out ahead. But if you’re Biden and you start out with 25 percent or 30 percent, there’s much less margin for error. Is Biden’s floor higher than everyone else’s ceiling? Maybe, but it’s not hard to imagine Sanders or Buttigieg or O’Rourke or Klobuchar or pretty much anyone else cobbling together 20 percent or 25 percent of the vote in Iowa, winning the state and sending the race on an entirely different trajectory — or Harris or Booker causing problems for Biden in South Carolina.
Alternatively, Biden could adopt a more combative and defiant approach, leaning into his differences with the rest of the field, not playing it safe in his public appearances and perhaps even pushing back against the “identity politics” of the left. The idea would be to prop up his floor — to ensure that he won the 25 percent of Democrats who are older moderates — at the cost of lowering his ceiling. But this would also entail risk. He’d be resigning himself to being a factional candidate, and like Sanders, Biden could have trouble building consensus later on once the had field winnowed, even if he’d won some early states.
So those are two deeply challenging paths to the nomination. Still, both are plausible, and having two paths isn’t so bad in a field in which a lot of candidates don’t seem to have any path at all.

As for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who ranks second to Biden in most polls of the Democratic primary thus far, his perceived electability was on par with his popularity as a candidate. Apparently, Democratic voters don’t agree that Sanders’s socialism makes him unelectable . Meanwhile, only former Rep. Beto O’Rourke joined Biden as a candidate whose perceived electability outstripped his popularity as a candidate, although for O’Rourke, the difference was quite small. Quite a few candidates showed up at the other end of the electability spectrum, including South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth Warren. All three enjoyed decent voter support but were less likely to be seen as electable.
You probably noticed a pattern there. The moderate, straight, white men score best, while the women and the man seeking to become the first openly gay president lose points on electability, as do nonwhite candidates like businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker. Harris ranks particularly low considering her level of voter support, which may reflect the fact that she is both a person of color and a woman . And even Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seen as a relatively weak general-election candidate even though her strong past electoral performances make a good case for her being electable .
The theory that perceptions of electability are linked to race and gender is hardly new, but we do have some recent polling that supports it. A March poll by HuffPost/YouGov asked Democrats how they thought a candidate’s gender and race would affect other voters’ decisions. In both cases, about a third of respondents said they expected that being male or being white would make other people more likely to vote for a candidate while a single-digit percentage thought it would make people less likely to vote for a candidate. (About 40 percent thought it would make no difference.) And being female and nonwhite were each seen, less overwhelmingly, as net negatives. Interestingly, though, the HuffPost/YouGov poll also found that respondents viewed being over the age of 70 as a serious electability problem, yet in that same poll, 64 percent of voters thought 76-year-old Biden was capable of winning the general election, and 48 percent thought 77-year-old Sanders could do so. Both candidates also had strong electability numbers in both the Quinnipiac and UNH polls. (This may be partly explained by the fact that Trump is 72, so the likely Republican nominee has the same age problem.)
Let me wrap with a different way of polling electability. Instead of asking about voter preferences in the Democratic primary, Business Insider and SurveyMonkey have been asking voters nationwide which candidates they believe would likely win and lose an election against Trump. Unlike in the Quinnipiac and UNH polls, respondents were allowed to select as many candidates as they felt fit that description. Despite the difference in methodology, Business Insider’s early-April poll also found that Democrats viewed Biden as the most electable candidate. A full 56 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they thought he would beat Trump, and just 15 percent said they thought he would lose. By this metric, Warren rated as the weakest general-election candidate: Just 21 percent thought she would beat Trump, and 33 percent thought she would lose to him.

Former Vice President Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president on Thursday. The FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast crew discusses how he could win the Democratic nomination and also why he might come up short. A core question for his campaign will be whether he runs as a consensus candidate or as a factional candidate, relying on the older and more moderate part of the Democratic Party.

"We Looked At Almost 2,000 Mock NFL Drafts. Here’s What We Learned.",fivethirtyeight.com,Josh Hermsmeyer,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-looked-at-almost-2000-mock-nfl-drafts-heres-what-we-learned/,"D.K. Metcalf is one of two Ole Miss receivers who could go in the first round of the NFL draft. Wesley Hitt / Getty Images
The NFL draft is a spectacle. Last year, the draft averaged more viewers than the previous year’s Stanley Cup Final . Social media and fan interest have exploded with a thirst for draft information, and media outlets have sprung up to cater to those fans with a bevy of mock drafts conducted by analysts and armchair handicappers.
There are even sites dedicated to tracking the predictions of mock drafters so that consumers of draft information can properly judge who is most reliable. Last year’s top forecaster, NFL analyst Evan Silva, identified 28 out of 32 players selected in the first round and also correctly predicted the team that would select 10 of those players. That 31 percent hit rate on pairing a drafted player with a team may not seem impressive, but it was good enough to place Silva at the top of the 2018 rankings and vault him to 16th over the past five years.
“You should be able to pick 26 of the 32 first-round picks rolling out of bed,” Silva said. “The hard part is matching teams to players. I’m continually surprised each year. Teams don’t act like I expect.”
Despite that uncertainty, the mock drafters can give us a pretty good sense of the names Roger Goodell will call on Thursday night. Perhaps even more interesting, we can use this data to explore the player trends as the draft process has progressed. The actual draft may be one weekend in April, but draft prognosticating is a year-round affair. Mock drafts from last June hardly resemble the ones on the eve of the draft, as the stock prices of college players are constantly ticking up and down based on a host of reasons — performance, health, eligibility and results from the scouting combine.
Using data from Benjamin Robinson , who has curated close to 2,000 mock drafts from expert, media and fan sources from April 2018 to present, here are some of the most interesting fluctuations over the past few months — along with some of our own analysis mixed in. After all, it’s the draft, so we are all experts. The pass rushers
Pass rusher may be the position most stocked with top-end talent in this year’s draft. If Oklahoma QB Kyler Murray isn’t the first overall selection, Ohio State defensive end Nick Bosa will likely be called. But two other promising defensive standouts, Kentucky’s Josh Allen and Alabama’s Quinnen Williams, are expected to be off the board by the 10th pick. Both players wreaked havoc on the SEC in 2018, and the evolution of each player’s draft value has mirrored the other’s. While Bosa has been a fixture atop draft boards all year, Allen and Williams have each steadily climbed from a late first-round position.
Williams, a defensive tackle, finished eighth in the Heisman voting in 2018 and closed out the year at Alabama with 10 sacks and 55 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. Williams also ranked first in the nation in run-stopping rate with 14.2 percent, showcasing his versatility. Meanwhile, Josh Allen (not to be confused with Bills QB Josh Allen, who can hit a goal post 50 yards away from his knees ) creates pressure from the outside — pressure that Eric Eager and George Chahrouri of Pro Football Focus have shown to be more valuable in generating negative expected points for the opposing offense than interior pressure. Allen’s pass-rush productivity — the share of pass plays in which the defender applied pressure on the opposing QB — led the nation at 15.2 percent. The success of Rams interior lineman Aaron Donald seems to suggest that teams might hope for similar returns from Williams, but a sharp team will focus on creating as much outside pressure as possible by choosing Allen. The Iowa tight ends
One set of players moving up mock draft boards not only play the same position, but they were also college teammates. Tight ends Noah Fant and TJ Hockenson of Iowa are both mocked to go in the middle of the first round, and they’re also the only two TEs likely to be called in Round 1. But while Fant’s mock draft graph shows a flat overall trend, Hockenson’s draft stock has surged since the combine in February. On average, he’s now surpassed his Hawkeye cohort in projected draft position.
The mock drafters probably have the ordering right: Hockenson had 760 receiving yards — 25.8 percent of Iowa’s team total, according to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group — while Fant gained 519 yards for a 17.6 percent share. Hockenson is the better blocker of the two TEs and also ran 340 routes to Fant’s 242. But it wasn’t just volume that drove Hock’s numbers: He was also slightly more efficient on a per route basis, gaining 2.24 yards per route run vs. 2.14 for Fant. Hockensen was deployed further downfield than Fant as well, earning an average depth of target of 9.2 yards — nearly half a yard better than Fant. And despite the deeper routes, Hockenson still managed a higher catch rate. 1 The Ole Miss receivers
Oddly, another pair of teammates that play the same position are also vying for a first-round selection. The fortunes of Ole Miss wide receivers A.J Brown and D.K. Metcalf have flipped since the start of the draft process. Last July, A.J. Brown was considered a high first-round pick, but he has since seen his draft stack plummet to the bottom of the first round.
Metcalf became an overnight internet sensation during February’s combine with his comic-book physique and blazing 4.33-second 40-yard dash — a ridiculous amount of speed for a 228-pound man. He then turned right around and disappointed athletic measurable aficionados by posting a sluggish 7.38 seconds in the three-cone drill. Brown was not slow, running a 4.49 in the 40 at 226 pounds, but he appears to have stabilized at a level well below his teammate, and it’s unclear why. According to ESPN’s Stats & Information Group, Brown caught 1,320 receiving yards on 435 routes at Ole Miss in 2018, good for 3.03 yards per route run. Metcalf, hampered by injury, caught just 569 yards on 197 routes at 2.88 yards per route run, well under the efficiency set by Brown. Combine speed only weakly correlates to actual game speed , so it’s curious that a player like Metcalf would be selected over his more productive peer. Again, it might just be based on D.K.’s shirtless photo , suggesting this could be one the mock drafters get wrong.
On Thursday, we’ll discover just how accurate these expert and amateur mock drafts are. If 2018 is any indication , mock drafters will probably correctly identify the majority of the players selected in the first round but completely whiff on the exact order and the actual team to select a player, which is probably for the best. Between last-minute trades and out-of-left-field picks, it’s more entertaining when we don’t know everything going in.

Everybody will be watching Josh Allen on Thursday night, four years after Allen struggled to find anybody to watch him. The former two-star recruit out of Montclair, New Jersey — now projected to be taken in the top five of the NFL draft — had only one initial Division I offer , from nearby Monmouth. But late in the 2015 recruiting cycle, when Kentucky had missed out on a handful of players and needed bodies, the Wildcats took a flier on Allen and gave him an SEC offer. Allen did the rest, breaking out with 17 sacks last season and winning the Bednarik Award as the country’s best defensive player .
How does a 6-foot-5, 262-pound pass rusher end up overlooked? Allen didn’t always fit the mold of a future star. Kentucky’s 2015 roster listed him at just 210 pounds, and he didn’t start playing defensive end until his senior season in high school, after moving from Alabama to New Jersey.
There will always be top NFL draft picks who were missed by the high school recruiting ratings. Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz, drafted No. 2 overall in 2016, was unrated out of high school , while Chicago pass rusher Khalil Mack, drafted fifth in 2014, was a two-star recruit like Allen. But those stories are the exceptions — the first round is still filled with players who caught the eye of recruiting websites while still in high school. We looked at the past 10 years of first-round picks and their ratings entering high school and found that players unrated or receiving a rating equivalent to less than three stars averaged just four slots in the first round.

PJ Tucker Does More For The Rockets By Doing Less. A Lot Less.,fivethirtyeight.com,Owen Phillips,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pj-tucker-does-more-for-the-rockets-by-doing-less-a-lot-less/,"PJ Tucker averaged just 7.3 points this season while logging more than 34 minutes per game. Vaughn Ridley / Getty Images
Creative shot makers and flashy passers are the easiest players to appreciate as fans. Less obvious are the role players who contribute to winning even when they don’t have the ball — and few such role players have had a bigger impact than Houston’s PJ Tucker.
There isn’t a formal definition for what constitutes a role player, but role players do have some defining characteristics. For instance, think of the relationship between a player’s minutes per game and his usage rate, which is the share of a team’s plays used by a player while he is on the court. Star players — your LeBron Jameses and Steph Currys of the league — log heavy minutes and have high usage rates. Role players may also log heavy minutes but tend to be comparatively less involved on offense.
Below is a scatter chart that shows the relationship between usage rate and minutes played per game. The relationship is flat for players who see fewer than 20 minutes per game, but there is a strong, positive relationship among starter- and rotation-level players. After all, if you weren’t producing on the offensive end, you wouldn’t be worth playing for long stretches of time. Unless you’re Tucker.
No one in the NBA this season logged more minutes while doing less on offense. Tucker is the first player since Shane Battier in 2008-09 to post a usage rate of less than 10 percent while also playing at least 30 minutes a game. In Game 1 of the Rockets’ series against Golden State, the Rockets were +9 in net points with Tucker on the court even though he scored no points and took only four shots while logging 39 minutes — the same time spent on the floor as James Harden.
Tucker ranks near the bottom in passes made per game and touches per game , and on average he had the ball in his hand for the shortest amount of time per possession of anyone who played at least 30 minutes per game this season. On offense, Tucker’s role is to stand in the corner and wait for a teammate to pass him the ball so that he can shoot an open three, which is the point of Houston’s spread-out, isolation-heavy offense.
So why can Tucker stay on the court for as long he does without doing much on offense? Two reasons.
First, Harden had the highest usage rate in the NBA during the regular season, and Harden and Tucker are on the court together more than any other two-man combination for the Rockets. 1 Since usage rate is a zero-sum game among the five players on the floor, any increase in Tucker’s usage would come at the expense of Harden’s.
Second, Tucker’s defense is vital to the Rockets. While he might not be widely known as an elite defensive stopper, he has the profile of one. Five of the seven players he guarded most often during the regular season were Paul George, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Nobody matches up with those guys that often unless he’s built for it.
Only nine players since the 1977-78 season have played at least 30 minutes a game while using less than 10 percent of their teams’ plays. The list is a who’s who of the best defensive specialists in NBA history, including Dennis Rodman, Ben Wallace, Mark Eaton, Bruce Bowen and the aforementioned Battier. Most of those guys went on to win defensive player of the year, earn All-NBA honors or play a critical role on a championship team. Meanwhile, Tucker has never made so much as an All-Defensive team.
Even though the casual fan might not recognize Tucker for his defensive prowess, his peers do. Earlier this year, DeMar DeRozan praised Tucker’s defensive intensity. “PJ is one of the most intense individual defenders on the defensive end,” he told The Athletic. “I don’t think he gets enough credit for it.”
The good news for Tucker is that he has the chance to raise his profile during the Rockets’ second-round matchup against the Warriors. The bad news is that he has to prove his mettle by trying to guard Durant.
During the regular season, Tucker matched up with Durant on 111 possessions and held him to shooting 48 percent from the field, a tick below Durant’s 52 percent season average . Durant scored 35 points during the Warriors’ Game 1 victory on Sunday, though only 13 of those points were scored while Tucker was guarding him. In reality, the only person that can stop Durant is Durant. But as long as Tucker doesn’t allow him to shoot over 60 percent from the field like he did when he was guarded by Patrick Beverley during the Warriors’ first-round series, the Rockets will have a chance to pull off the upset.
Check out our latest NBA predictions . Footnotes
Of Tucker’s 218 total playoff minutes , 206 of those have been with Harden also on the floor.

Biden Was All Over Cable News Last Week — And So Was Anita Hill | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-was-all-over-cable-news-last-week-and-so-was-anita-hill/,"– 0 Includes all candidates that qualify as “major” in FiveThirtyEight’s rubric.

According to data from the TV News Archive processed using the GDELT Television API , 1 Biden’s full name was mentioned 3,393 total times last week across the three cable news networks we monitor — CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Sen. Bernie Sanders was the second most talked-about candidate with 1,099, followed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had been enjoying the spot as the second most talked-about candidate over the past two weeks, saw a drop in coverage, moving him to fifth place. Rep. Seth Moulton, who also declared his candidacy last week , was only the ninth most talked-about candidate, with 76 clips on cable news.
Biden obviously got a surge in coverage because he just announced his candidacy, but even when compared to how often other candidates were mentioned in the weeks that they declared, Biden got an unusually high level of coverage. On Thursday alone, when he jumped into the race, Biden’s name was mentioned in 1,209 clips, accounting for just under 9 percent of all clips that day on the three networks we looked at. That’s more than twice as much coverage as Sanders got when he entered the race on February 19th. Until Biden joined the race, Sanders had the most media coverage of any candidate on announcement day. 2
Biden’s media coverage hasn’t all been positive, though. Biden’s past treatment of Anita Hill — who testified to Congress at Justice Clarence Thomas’s 1991 confirmation hearing that Thomas had sexually harassed her when they worked together — was also a big part of the media narrative last week. Biden recently called Hill to discuss what happened, but Hill said she is not fully satisfied with his apology for the way she was treated at the hearing. Biden, as chair of the committee, allowed senators to pursue contentious or inflammatory lines of questioning and declined to call witnesses who could have backed up Hill’s story. The day after Biden declared, Hill’s name was mentioned 266 times — about a quarter as often as Biden. And a few weeks before Biden entered the race, Lucy Flores, a Nevada politician, publicly recounted an uncomfortable encounter she had with Biden, who she says smelled her hair and planted a “big slow kiss” on the back of her head. The week after that story published, Biden’s name was mentioned 2,690 times , almost five times as often as the top declared candidate that week.
Biden has been around long enough to have weathered bad news cycles before , but his increased visibility has renewed the focus on his perceived flaws. It’s up to voters to decide if they’re fatal ones. Footnotes

Democrats Are Stifling Their Liberal Wing’s Biggest Ideas | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-are-stifling-their-liberal-wings-biggest-ideas/,"House Democrats in the Capitol Visitor Center wearing “suffragette white” to the State of the Union address in 2019. Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call
It has been more than a week since the full 1 report from special counsel Robert Mueller became public, including details of numerous actions by President Trump that could constitute obstruction of justice, and the Democratic Party seems split on what to do with it. Many of the newly elected liberal firebrands in the House say Congress should start the impeachment process . House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats from the old guard seem hesitant to take this step .
This is a hard issue for Democrats because it pits electoral considerations (impeachment is not particularly popular right now ) against values-based ones ( some Democrats argue that Trump’s conduct as described in Mueller’s report requires at least the consideration of impeachment). But I doubt that the party will move toward impeachment unless the old guard suddenly has a wholesale change of heart. On issue after issue, the Democratic old guard on Capitol Hill is winning its fights with the party’s left wing. If, say, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has one position and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland holds another, expect the Hoyer view to win out.
At least that’s largely what has gone down so far. Here’s a short list of the progressive wing’s defeats since Democrats took control of the House in January: The Green New Deal . Of the 235 Democratic members in the House, 91 have signed on to Ocasio-Cortez’s signature resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change but also includes other liberal priorities such as guaranteeing jobs for all Americans who want them. There is no indication , however, that House Democratic leaders are trying to write a version that would unify the party and be approved in a vote. “Medicare for all.” Nearly half ( 107 ) of House Democrats support the single-payer health care bill written by Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , a bloc of the most liberal figures on Capitol Hill. But there is virtually no chance that Pelosi ( who has not embraced the legislation ) will put it up for a vote in the full House any time soon. Primary challenges. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House Democrats’ campaign arm, confirmed last month that it would not work with any campaign consultant or firm that helped Democratic candidates mount primary challenges against the party’s incumbents. Remember that influential progressives like Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ocasio-Cortez got to Congress by first defeating Democratic incumbents. The liberal wing protested the policy, but Democratic leaders have said that it will remain in place . A resolution condemning Ilhan Omar . Veteran House Democrats pushed for a resolution condemning Rep. Omar of Minnesota in the wake of comments she made that some in the party felt were anti-Semitic . 2 Pelosi brought the resolution up for a vote, although the version that the House adopted was a broad condemnation of bigotry that addressed Islamophobia and other kinds of hate, in addition to anti-Semitism. News coverage still reflected the fact that Democrats initially came up with the resolution as a way to chastise Omar.
In all, the newly elected progressive members have made a lot of news but less legislative impact — a fact not lost on the members themselves.
“They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,” Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, one of the liberal new members, recently tweeted . “However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.”
I don’t want to overstate my thesis — Democrats have been in control of the House for only about four months, and these dynamics could shift. Also, I’m not saying that the progressives aren’t having any impact. On the Omar resolution, the progressives got a partial win — they basically forced party leadership to adopt the broader anti-bigotry legislation , instead of focusing just on anti-Semitism.
And it’s not surprising that massive policy proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for all aren’t advancing. It’s a logical decision by Pelosi and party leaders not to push proposals that will likely be controversial when they have no chance of passing in the GOP-controlled Senate or signed into law by President Trump. Moreover, these ideas are having an impact on the Democratic Party — just not on the Hill. For example, several of the party’s presidential candidates have embraced the Green New Deal.
“The progressives are having the impact they should have given the context: a Senate and presidency in the hands of the Republicans, plus all the electoral considerations,” said Gisela Sin, a political scientist at the University of Illinois. Sin argued that the progressives’s strong opposition to allowing any dollars for Trump’s border wall was a factor in Pelosi taking a no-compromise stance on that issue . “We should contemplate the possibility that whatever the Democrats are achieving, it is because they have this left flank that gives the leadership more negotiating power with Republicans,” Sin said.
But so far, the party’s “Super Progressive” wing , as I think of it, has had substantially less influence on the congressional agenda than the House Freedom Caucus had in 2017 and 2018 , when Republicans controlled the chamber. For example, the conservative bloc forced the House to adopt its proposal for repealing major parts of the Affordable Care Act after it blocked legislation that had largely been written by then-Speaker Paul Ryan . Members of the caucus also pushed their fellow House Republicans to pass a resolution attacking the Justice Department over its handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of e-mail as a secretary of state.
You are probably wondering why exactly the progressives are losing. There is not one simple explanation — it’s a fairly complicated story. We’ll try to answer that question in a follow-up article this week. From ABC News: Footnotes

His total winnings are now above $1.3 million, second all-time behind only one player — the immortal Ken Jennings. 1
FiveThirtyEight has previously hosted an ad hoc debate ( point ; counterpoint ) on the unbreakability of Jennings’s 74-show winning streak. Regardless of whether Holzhauer takes Jennings down on that front, it’s Jennings’s money record, his iconic $2,520,700, that now appears to be in real … jeopardy.
Why?
Because even relative to Jennings, James Holzhauer is already the greatest “Jeopardy!” player who ever lived.
Holzhauer is winning about $74,000 per game on average, more than twice the $34,000 that Jennings averaged during his run. At this rate, Holzhauer will eclipse Jennings if he wins just 17 more games — and he’s likely to do that, according to a model built by The Jeopardy! Fan , a blog written by … well, you know. The model uses contestants’ scores going into Final Jeopardy to predict whether they will win their next game and how long their streak will last, and it projects that Holzhauer’s streak will extend nearly 48 games. That analysis also gives Holzhauer a 15 percent chance of winning at least 75 games, which would eclipse Jennings’s DiMaggio-ish streak.
“Jeopardy!,” like any other self-respecting competitive pursuit, has the analytics to help make sense of Holzhauer’s run. Take, for example, his “Coryat score,” named for the former contestant Karl Coryat , who conceived of the method. A Coryat score is a player’s score on “Jeopardy!” if all of the wagering is disregarded (so, Daily Doubles count for their base value on the grid, and Final Jeopardy doesn’t count at all). It is an unofficial calculation meant to provide a metric for “hopefuls playing along at home to gauge their scores against the contestants playing on the show.” Jennings’s average Coryat during his run was $27,861; Holzhauer’s is $29,567. Or we might consider “batting average” — the ratio of a player’s correct responses to his possible correct responses. Jennings’s batting average was .597; Holzhauer’s is .586. (For context, the batting average of a typical contestant in the seasons before Jennings’s and Holzhauer’s runs began was around .280, and a typical Coryat score was less than $11,000.) According to these measures, Holzhauer and Jennings are quite comparable — and very good.
But the two all-time greats diverge dramatically when it comes to wagered clues. And this is where Holzhauer shines. There are four opportunities to wager in a game of “Jeopardy!” — the three Daily Doubles and the Final Jeopardy round. Jennings found 71 percent of his games’ Daily Doubles, answering 83 percent of them correctly; Holzhauer has found 78 percent of his games’ Daily Doubles, answering 90 percent of them correctly. Jennings got 68 percent of his Final Jeopardy clues right; Holzhauer has gotten 94 percent right. (Jennings told me that Final Jeopardy clues are easier now than they were in his day.)
And thanks to the J! Archive , a fan-maintained archive of the show, and Jacob Bovee’s J-Archive-Parser , we can chart just how dramatically their Daily Double wagering has diverged. It’s here that Holzhauer has set himself far apart, even from a legend.
Last week, I wrote that Holzhauer isn’t breaking “Jeopardy!,” so much as he is “Jeopardy!” — he is the final, full embodiment of its long-term strategic trends. Driven by a gambler’s instincts and armed with historical data about the game’s board, Holzhauer hunts down Daily Doubles and bets huge when he finds them.
Below is an illustration of how much each player wagered on their Daily Doubles as a function of how much cash they had at the time. The higher the dot, the bigger the risk — and the reward.
Note the series of diagonal lines in Jennings’s data. Those exist because Jennings liked to use Daily Doubles as an opportunity to bring his overall score to a big round number. If, for example, he had $16,200 going into a Daily Double, he might have wanted to boost his score to $20,000, and so would wager the difference, $3,800 (precisely what he did on Sept. 7, 2004 ). For each dot in any diagonal group, its coordinates (Daily Double wager + amount of cash that he had at the time of the wager) add up to one of those nice round numbers, like $15,000, or $20,000, or $25,000 and so on.
“Absolutely right, I bet for round numbers,” Jennings told me in an email. “By the second round, the game would usually be well in hand, so I could just bet to bump my score up to some easy-to-compute ‘next tier.’ With a comfortable lead, there’s more risk in the downside (a missed Daily Double and suddenly a competitive game) than advantage in the upside (a big payoff).”
Holzhauer’s approach is more extreme, and far less regular, exhibiting none of the decreasing tendencies of Jennings’s. Credit his sports betting background. “I would say my bet sizing is based on intuition, but my heuristics are very specific to me,” Holzhauer told me last week via email. “Quickly calculating the right bet size based on my perceived edge is my job in a nutshell.”
As some wondered whether “Jeopardy!” could remain solvent during Holzhauer’s historic and lucrative winning streak, Jennings himself acknowledged his divergence from Holzhauer. I don’t feel I get enough credit for making small, sensible Jeopardy wagers, which helped the show with its prize budget.
— Ken Jennings (@KenJennings) April 23, 2019
“I think there are some games where I should have bet more aggressively on the Daily Double in the first round, but I never played to maximize winnings, the way James is,” Jennings said. “I did get letters from poker players telling me that I was leaving so much money on the table. In hindsight, I think I’m temperamentally suited to smaller wagers, but I also think playing a low-drama, comfortable game helped create the long streak.”
Other commentators — a rather misguided lot, in the opinion of this reporter — have lamented that Holzhauer is so good that he’s sucked not only the money but also the charm out of the game.
“Sadly I was not programmed to feel joy,” Holzhauer joked in response.
But at least one reporter — and plenty of other “Jeopardy!” watchers — are finding joy nonetheless. From ABC News:

Biden Is Way Out In Front. Second Place Is Anyone’s Guess. | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Nate Silver,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-is-way-out-in-front-second-place-is-anyones-guess/,"Does Biden’s Polling Bounce Mean Anything? Warren is rising, and Sanders and O’Rourke are falling. Joe Biden takes the stage to address a campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Tuesday. REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst
Last week, when he launched his presidential campaign , I made the case for why Joe Biden is the front-runner for the Democratic nomination . This week, with the release of several new polls, that case has become clearer.
Four national polls released on Tuesday all showed Biden’s support significantly higher than it was in previous editions of the same surveys. CNN’s poll found Biden at 39 percent — up 11 points from 28 percent in their previous poll in March — and well ahead of Bernie Sanders, who was at 15 percent. Quinnipiac University had Biden at a similar 38 percent , but with Elizabeth Warren nominally in second place at 12 percent of the vote, compared with 11 percent for Sanders and 10 percent for Pete Buttigieg.
Morning Consult also released its weekly tracking poll, and it showed Biden at 36 percent , up from 30 percent last week — an impressive result, especially considering that about half the poll was conducted before Biden officially launched his campaign. In interviews conducted after Biden’s announcement, he was polling closer to 39 percent . A HarrisX poll for ScottRasmussen.com found the smallest bounce, with Biden at 33 percent, up from 29 percent in its poll last month . 1 The Morning Consult and HarrisX polls still had Sanders fairly clearly in second place. New national polls show Biden clearly in front Democratic primary polls released on April 30, 2019 CNN N/A Source: polls
On average between the four national polls, Biden has gained 8 percentage points. Where did he take that support from? It came from all over the place. Sanders is down 4 points, on average, as is Beto O’Rourke. Kamala Harris is down 2 points; Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are each down 1 point.
But some other Democrats have also gained ground. Warren is up 3 points, on average, in the new national polls. So is Buttigieg, although that’s a little misleading since the previous HarrisX, Quinnipiac and CNN polls were conducted before his surge had really kicked in. In the poll that offers the most recent basis for comparison, Morning Consult, Buttigieg is actually down 1 point from last week’s edition.
Biden’s support is driven by older Democrats and by nonwhite Democrats — two groups that aren’t always well-represented on social media or in other forums that sometimes dictate the conventional wisdom about the candidates. Biden had 50 percent of nonwhite voters in the CNN poll, well ahead of Sanders’s 14 percent. In Morning Consult’s poll, Biden polled at 43 percent among black Democrats , compared to Sanders’s 20 percent. Biden had 46 percent support from Democrats age 50-64 in CNN’s poll and 50 percent support from those 65 and older.
In addition to the various national polls, Suffolk University also released a poll of New Hampshire on Tuesday , and it can’t leave any of the Democratic contenders feeling especially satisfied. Biden was in first place at 20 percent, with Sanders and Buttigeg tied for second at 12 percent and Warren in fourth place at 8 percent. Suffolk has not previously polled New Hampshire this cycle, but compared with other recent polls of the state , this is clearly a poor result for Sanders, while it’s roughly in line with the previous polling for the other candidates. The latest New Hamphire poll shows weakness for Sanders Recent New Hampshire Democratic primary polls as of April 30, 2019 Latest Poll Source: POLLS
What should we make of all of this? I have roughly four conclusions:
Biden’s bounce will probably fade. Biden’s not the only candidate to have seen his numbers improve following his announcement; Sanders and Harris did too, and so, to a lesser extent, did O’Rourke. All of those candidates have since seen their numbers revert to their previous position , however. Sanders has fallen back to the low 20s in his better polls and the low-to-mid teens in his worse ones, and Harris and O’Rourke are now back to polling in the mid-to-high single digits.
And it’s not clear that much has changed in terms of voters’ underlying attitudes toward the candidates. Biden’s favorability ratings are strong in the Morning Consult poll , but they’re also largely unchanged from earlier editions of the poll, which suggests that some of his new support is fairly soft and consists of people who are suddenly hearing his name a lot more often in the news , and who might switch candidates again once the news cycle moves on.
Nonetheless, the bounce is sorta important. At least in the medium term — basically, from now through the Iowa caucuses — Biden is more likely to lose support than to gain it . Other candidates will become better known, and they will tend to take support from candidates such as Biden and Sanders who already have essentially universal name recognition. Biden is doing very well among black voters for now, but Harris and Booker might have something to say about that later in race. Biden benefits a lot from perceptions that he’s electable , but that could also fade over time as voters grow more comfortable with the rest of the field.
But it’s precisely for that reason that starting from a higher perch is important. If you’re polling at around 28 percent — where Biden was before his announcement — you don’t have much margin for error, given that it usually takes support in at least the low-to-mid 20s to win Iowa and New Hampshire. If you’re at 37 percent, however, you can lose 5 or 10 points and still hold up in the early states against a candidate making a late surge.
In addition, Biden’s bounce comes near an empirical inflection point of when early polling leads tend to hold up and when they don’t. Well-known candidates polling in the mid-30s in the early going 2 are about even money to win the nomination, historically. Well-known candidates polling in the mid-to-high 20s have roughly a 1 in 4 shot, conversely.
In some ways, the bounce exposes the weakness of the other candidates — especially Sanders — as much as Biden’s strength. Although previous bounces, such as Harris’s, have faded, that doesn’t necessarily mean the candidates who were hurt by those bounces have regained ground. Instead, it has sometimes opened up an opportunity for yet another candidate to surge instead.
What that means is that it’s time to take stock of the three candidates who have clearly fallen from their peak (so far) in the polls — Sanders, Harris and O’Rourke. You might think that on the basis of his current polling, Sanders remains in a better spot than the other two. However, he’s also much more of a national brand name. And as I wrote last week — and as you can see from the chart — polling at 20 percent is not all that strong a position for a candidate with near-universal name recognition. Sanders, however, polled at just 16 percent in the average of the four national polls released on Tuesday. And he was at only 12 percent in New Hampshire, which should be one of his strongest states. Sanders can win — he’ll raise a lot of money, he came from way far back last time, and he’d likely benefit from scenarios where the field remains divided . But given his name recognition, those polling numbers put him right at the divide between someone whose campaign is going well and someone whose campaign is going poorly.
Harris and O’Rourke are not as widely known as Sanders, and they still have reasonably good favorability ratings and plenty of cash on hand , which suggest that they have upward potential if and when the media’s attention turns to them again. But it’s become harder to make the case that they’re on the lead lap with Biden, especially for O’Rourke, who is competing against a field that’s overstatured with white male candidates and whose polling has fallen further than Harris’s.
Buttigieg doesn’t have any reason to be unhappy; given his low name recognition, polling in the mid-to-high single digits — sometimes higher than that, especially in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire — is a pretty decent position. But if you were expecting a further immediate surge into the teens or beyond — and I sort of was — it isn’t as clear now whether that’s coming. Instead, Buttigieg will need to work to expand his support beyond his initial coalition of highly educated white voters and survive media coverage that’s both less plentiful and more skeptical than it was initially.
But Warren is in an intriguing position . Warren’s the candidate who we thought might have the least overlap with Biden and therefore would be least hurt by his entry into the race — and the polling seems to bear that out. Although both candidates are broadly within the Democratic mainstream, she’s toward the left half and he’s toward the moderate half. She’s a woman and he’s a man, obviously. His case rests heavily on electability and big, abstract, meat-and-potatoes themes ; she appeals to voters on the basis of her highly detailed policy proposals. Her base is college-educated whites; his is non-college-educated white voters and black voters. Biden and Warren have directly clashed over issues such as bankruptcy laws .
In short, Biden and Warren make pretty good foils for one another, probably better foils than Biden and Sanders make, as both are old white men who aren’t especially well-liked by party activists . A showdown between Biden and Buttigieg, or Biden and O’Rourke, could also leave big segments of the party unhappy, including parts of the left and many women and nonwhite voters. 3
So in the scenario where the nomination comes down to a battle between Biden and one other Democrat — not the only way the race could unfold, but one plausible path — Warren could turn out to be that Democrat. Together, they capture most of the major Democratic constituencies. I’m less convinced that you could have a Biden-versus-Sanders showdown. I think a lot of voters, and certain parts of the Democratic establishment, would go shopping for a third candidate in that eventuality.
But Warren could also become a major player in the race in other ways. Independently of Biden’s entry to the race, she seems to be gaining ground from the candidates who are fading, including gathering some of Sanders’s support on the left, some of O’Rourke’s college-educated whites, and perhaps some of Harris’s support among women.
With that in mind, it’s time for one more rendition of my not-to-be-taken-too-seriously presidential tiers . I’d already had Biden as the front-runner — note that doesn’t mean I think he has a better-than-50-percent chance to win (I don’t), just that I think he’s more likely to win than anyone else. But we probably need to create an additional half-step between Biden and everyone else. That means I’m demoting Harris, Sanders and Buttigieg from tier 1b (which we’ll leave empty for the moment) into tier 1c. However, I’m moving Warren up to tier 1c from tier 2. Harris, Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren can all make interesting arguments for why they’re the next-best-positioned candidate after Biden, and I really have no idea whose argument is best, so it makes sense to group them together.

How Do You Lose When You Make 17 Threes? Ask The Rockets. | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Jared Dubin,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-do-you-lose-when-you-make-17-threes-ask-the-rockets/,"The Houston Rockets committed 18 turnovers in Game 2. Thearon W. Henderson / Getty Images
In each of the past two seasons, the Houston Rockets have shattered previously held records for 3-pointers made and attempted. They took the three to previously unseen heights by connecting on 1,256 of 3,470 attempts during the 2017-18 season, then surpassed both of those marks by making 1,323 of 3,721 of their shots from beyond the arc this year.
Given that they’ve attempted so many more threes than any other team, it should come as no surprise that the Rockets have also had more single-game 3-point explosions than any other team. The Rockets have made at least 15 treys an incredible 113 times in the past two seasons, 1 including Tuesday night against the Warriors, when they made 17 . The next-closest team is the Brooklyn Nets, who have nailed 15-plus triples just 51 times in the last two years.
Connecting on at least 15 shots from beyond the arc guarantees you at least 45 points, so it’s not surprising that the Rockets’ record when hitting all those treys was incredibly good heading into last night’s game. The Rockets were 89-23 in such games prior to their Game 2 loss — good for a 0.795 winning percentage, or the equivalent of a 65-win season.
So then how does a team to manage to lose when hitting 17 3-pointers? The quick and easy answer: by turning the ball over 18 times .
The Rockets gave the ball away on each of their first three possessions of the game, six of their first 10, and a total of nine times in the first quarter alone. With those blunders, they dug themselves a 14-point hole less than eight minutes into the game. Houston cleaned things up a bit during the final three periods, but the early struggles gave the Rockets a turnover rate north of 16 percent — far worse than their seasonlong average of about 12 percent, which ranked ninth in the NBA.
Usually, the Rockets are able to overcome error-filled performances like this one. 2 Before dropping Game 2 to the Warriors, James Harden and company were 19-12 over the past two seasons in games in which their turnover rate was at least 15 percent. Turning the ball over 15-plus percent of the time against the Warriors, though, is a different story altogether. Golden State is practically unbeatable when its opponent coughs up as many possessions as the Rockets did in Game 2.
Since acquiring Kevin Durant before the 2016-17 season, the Warriors had racked up a 41-6 record 3 when forcing a turnover on at least 15 percent of their opponent’s possessions. After Tuesday’s win, they’re now 3-0 when forcing the Rockets into that many errors — with the prior two victories coming in Game 3 and Game 6 of last year’s Western Conference finals.
The Rockets compounded their turnover problems by allowing a ton of offensive rebounds. With Draymond Green (five) and Andre Iguodala (four) leading the way, Golden State snared the board off one of its own misses 18 times during Game 2. That 36.7 percent offensive rebound rate made this both the Warriors’ fifth-best offensive rebounding game of the Durant era and Houston’s sixth-worst defensive rebounding game this season.
In the NBA, if you have enough talent and that talent is harnessed in the right way, you can overcome all kinds of deficits. You can shoot your way to victory even when you’re irresponsible with the ball and even when you let your opponent run wild on the offensive glass. Sometimes you can even overcome the odds and win when you do both of those things. Just, not against the Warriors .

Are Any Of MLB’s Breakout Teams For Real? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-any-of-mlbs-breakout-teams-for-real/,"+9 Sources: Baseball-Reference.com, Baseball Databank
We can break the most improved teams into a couple of groups. One features teams that were on the edge of contention before the season and whose hot starts solidified them as teams to be reckoned with in the playoff race. The other contains clubs who were not “supposed” to be this good (or even good at all) in the eyes of the preseason projections . These teams are in an interesting spot because their playoff odds are still low despite their promising showings. So how well they maintain their surprising performances will have a big effect on their decision-making around July’s trade deadline . Playing themselves into contention
No team has improved its playoff odds more in April than the Tampa Bay Rays , who had a 42 percent shot at the postseason on opening day but as of Tuesday boasted a 74 percent chance to make the playoffs. Some of that is a byproduct of Boston’s poor start — the Red Sox had shed an MLB-high 39 points of playoff probability since starting the season — but the Rays are also a great example of a team that makes shrewd acquisitions and gets the most out of its talent . In addition to known commodities Tommy Pham, Kevin Kiermaier and Blake Snell, Tampa is also getting unexpectedly great performances out of infielders Yandy Diaz and Brandon Lowe, right fielder Austin Meadows 1 and pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Some of that quartet’s early numbers are bound to revert to the mean, but Diaz, Lowe and Meadows all rank among the top 20 percent of hitters in exit velocity , and Glasnow has elite underlying indicators . Although the injury-plagued Yankees are the AL East favorites in our model, no team currently has better wild-card odds than Tampa Bay.
As we mentioned before the season , the Minnesota Twins figured to be right in the most precarious zone between making and missing the postseason. A few extra wins here or there, and the Twins’ playoff odds would increase massively; a few extra losses, and they might be left out in the October cold. So Minnesota has done itself a huge favor by getting off to a 17-10 start, which is third-best in baseball . Obvious star candidates such as Byron Buxton and Jose Berrios have played well, but the Twins’ hot April was fueled even more by breakout seasons from the likes of Jorge Polanco (162 adjusted on-base plus slugging ), Eddie Rosario (130) and even catcher Mitch Garver (203). Minnesota’s rotation has huge questions beyond Berrios and Jake Odorizzi, but with the Indians’ talent advantage in the AL Central diminished relative to previous seasons , the Twins have played their way into what could be the division’s most interesting race in years.
The St. Louis Cardinals are a little different from the Rays and Twins because we basically listed them as co-favorites (with the Brewers and Cubs) in the NL Central during spring training. Still, with an 85-win projection on the heels of a three-year playoff drought, the Cards’ postseason fate was far from assured. The team’s hot start, however, has set St. Louis up with a 67 percent chance of making the playoffs as of Tuesday — 23 percentage points higher than it was before the season started. Prized offseason acquisition Paul Goldschmidt has been his usual self , while lineup mates Paul DeJong, Marcell Ozuna, Kolten Wong and Dexter Fowler have exploded for huge seasons so far. It’s fair to wonder how long some of that can last: At age 33, Fowler is a little old to suddenly emerge as a 5-win player, while DeJong has a .607 slugging percentage despite an average exit velocity in the bottom third of MLB . But by the same token, the Cardinals’ pitching is probably better than its current 25th-place ranking in wins above replacement , 2 particularly once Carlos Martinez returns from injury this month . Whatever happens, St. Louis has given itself the early edge in a brutal division race. We’re good! OK, now what?
The Texas Rangers got everybody’s attention over the weekend by blistering the Seattle Mariners by a combined score of 29-2 in back-to-back games . The Rangers are 14-14, but they also have a +9 run differential against a schedule that ranks second-toughest in baseball so far, according to the average Elo rating of its opponents. Texas wasn’t supposed to be competitive like this: They haven’t broken .500 since 2016 , and they lost longtime franchise cornerstone Adrian Beltre to retirement over the offseason. But the team has seen a handful of pleasant surprises early on — starting with pitcher Mike Minor, who boasts the eighth-best adjusted earned run average (174) in the AL . Left fielder Joey Gallo has launched 10 home runs already, Elvis Andrus and Shin-Soo Choo have produced vintage seasons, and Danny Santana has recaptured the form that saw him vie for rookie of the year honors in 2014. But even with all that, Texas is still just third in the AL West, and our model gives it only a 7 percent chance of making the playoffs. In the race to the bottom for better picks, the Rangers were looking before the season like they might get a top-five selection in next summer’s MLB draft, but now their hot start might have them rethinking their rebuilding trajectory for the time being.
Similarly, the Arizona Diamondbacks seemed destined for a rebuild after trading Goldschmidt to the Cardinals and watching free agents such as Patrick Corbin walk during the winter. Yet those plans might need to be put on hold in light of the team’s 17-13 start. According to our model, the D-backs on Tuesday had a 35 percent chance to make the playoffs (up 12 percentage points from preseason) and are on track to win 83 games, which would actually be an improvement on last year’s record despite the offseason talent exodus. First baseman Christian Walker (151 OPS+) has come out of nowhere with a scorching start, Zack Greinke continues to pitch like an ace, and closer Greg Holland hasn’t yet allowed a run. Arizona has gotten strong performances up and down the lineup, including from the likes of David Peralta, Adam Jones, Ketel Marte, Eduardo Escobar, Nick Ahmed and Jarrod Dyson. The Dodgers look too good to realistically be chased down in the West, but the D-backs are still in the NL’s playoff race, however improbably.
The Seattle Mariners have cooled off some after their 13-2 start , going 5-12 since April 11. Even so, they’re another team with better playoff odds (15 percent as of Tuesday) than we’d expect from their offseason dealings — which included losing free agent slugger Nelson Cruz and trading ace pitcher James Paxton, closer Edwin Diaz and star second baseman Robinson Cano. Even through its recent slump, Seattle maintains MLB’s third-highest batting WAR courtesy of big years from Daniel Vogelbach (224 OPS+ !), Omar Narvaez (140) and Tim Beckham (139), to go with the usual mashing by Edwin Encarnacion (136), Domingo Santana (131) and Mitch Haniger (131). Starter Marco Gonzalez has also delivered an unexpectedly great season thus far, with a 150 ERA+ that has him leading the AL in pitching WAR. Seattle’s big home run rate (4.7 percent of all plate appearances) is out of line with its batted-ball metrics, and the team’s defense remains abysmal , so it’s no surprise that a regression has already begun to set in. But by virtue of their early record — still among the best in baseball — the Mariners will have to decide whether to try to end the franchise’s long-running playoff drought by making upgrades this season or to keep biding their time for a future postseason run.

How Mapping Shots In The NBA Changed It Forever | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/,"Twitter
Kirk Goldsberry is an ESPN analyst and FiveThirtyEight contributor. His new book, “SprawlBall: A Visual Tour of the New Era of the NBA,” is available this week . In it, he examines the history of the NBA’s 3-point line and how players and teams are using it to change the game. We’re publishing an excerpt of the book on how the NBA’s genome is mapped.
Every year, NBA players take about 200,000 shots. Each season, 30 teams combine to play 1,230 games, and at the end of the regular season, you can bet the sum total of shots taken will be very close to 200,000. In the hands of a cartographer, a season’s worth of this shooting data is a veritable treasure trove of information. But here’s the thing: In the first decade of this century, there weren’t many cartographers working in the NBA league office or for analytics departments in any of the team front offices.
Back then, basketball analytics was still in its infancy; it was all about spreadsheets and linear regression, not spatial and visual reasoning. Still, whether the league knew it or not, by adding these little spatial references to their game data, basketball analytics was about to become a lot more than spreadsheets. Things like data visualization and spatial analyses were going to be very important.
Unfortunately, there weren’t many folks with those skills working in pro basketball, and even though countless analysts had access to all the data the league was collecting — including all of the shot data — nobody was applying a spatial treatment. Nobody was mapping the NBA.
[ Related: Kirk Goldsberry joins Hot Takedown to discuss his new book .]
When I first got my hands on these massive haystacks of shooting data, I was teaching cartography at Harvard. I’d found a way to retrieve five seasons’ worth of shooting data from the web, and I built a database that included over 1 million NBA ﬁeld-goal attempts, who shot them and where they shot them from. As an analyst, I knew there was amazing intelligence waiting to be revealed within the database. As a mapmaker, I was conﬁdent I could visualize some of it in cool new ways. And as a huge NBA fan, I couldn’t wait to see the results.
Although I was desperate to chart out the shooting abilities of players like Kobe Bryant and Dirk Nowitzki, the first thing I wanted to see was the basic shooting patterns of the entire league. When you plot an entire season’s worth of shot data, some interesting patterns quickly emerge:
The graphic is more than just a shitload of dots. This basic plot shows us where on the floor the most important concentrations of ﬁeld-goal attempts occurred in 2014-15. We can see that there was a major hub of shooting activity near the basket and another band of activity out beyond the 3-point arc. We can also see that the league’s shooters were generally less active in the 2-point jump-shooting areas between the arc and the paint, but this plot says nothing about the relative values or successes of shots in different areas.
Each one of these dots has a backstory. Each one has a shooter attached, a team attached and an outcome attached. We know who took each shot and whether it went in or not. And we can smooth out these dots statistically and map out the overall ﬁeld-goal percentage of the NBA as a collective.
Aha. Now we’re getting somewhere. Now we can see that the probability of a shot going through the net greatly depends on where that shot came from. This insight is not surprising on its own, but it does reveal specifics about the basic relationships between distance, direction and ﬁeld-goal percentage. What did surprise me when I first studied this chart was learning that outside of 6 feet, there is no place on the court where shooters make more than 45 percent of their shots. I’d always thought that 50 percent was the magic ﬁeld-goal percentage threshold, but this graphic shows that the only place on the floor where players exceed that magic number is the tiny swath of space just in front of the basket.
The next thing I noticed was even more surprising. When you look at leaguewide shooting numbers between 6 and 25 feet, the league is strangely consistent. I expected to see a marked decrease in ﬁeld-goal percentage with greater distance: I thought shorter jump shots would go in at higher rates than longer jump shots. While this is true, the effect is much more subtle than I would have expected.
As it turns out, NBA players make only 40 percent of their shots between 8 and 9 feet from the rim, and that number drops to only 35 percent between 25 and 26 feet from the rim. When it comes to ﬁeld-goal percentage on jump shots, the effect of shot distance is pretty minor. It was a revelation, and it drove me to quickly build the following map, which would forever change the way I viewed scoring in the NBA.
Field-goal percentage is only part of the story, and in a league with a 3-point line, it is a very misleading part of the story. After all, points are the ultimate currency in the NBA.
When we visualize the average points per shot according to shot location, only then does the true economic landscape of the contemporary NBA reveal itself. Only then does Daryl Morey’s economic vision become clear. Only then do we see the massive economic subsidy represented by the 3-point line. And when we compare the points-per-shot map with the ﬁeld-goal percentage map, we are left with a troubling thought about the contemporary geography of NBA basketball.
If it’s true that 3-point shots go in 36 percent of the time and 10-foot shots go in just 40 percent of the time, then why are we assigning 50 percent more value to shots from beyond that magical little arc?
The natural landscape depicted in the ﬁeld-goal percentage map demonstrates that jump shooting in the NBA is essentially a 35 to 45 percent proposition; however, some of those shots are worth 3 and some are worth 2. Naturally, as basic economics would predict, the behavior of players and teams has reacted in the form of shot selection. When we overlay the most common 200 shot locations in today’s NBA, we see that shot selection and economic efficiency are aligned.
No wonder 2-point jump shooting is dying.

Is This The Year The St. Louis Blues Stop Disappointing Their Fans? | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Terrence Doyle,05-03-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-the-year-the-st-louis-blues-stop-disappointing-their-fans/,"St. Louis probably should have won a Cup by now. Ronald Martinez / Getty Images
There are few fans as tortured by their team’s constant inability to win a championship as those who support the St. Louis Blues. It’s not because the Blues are perpetually lousy — in their 51 seasons, they’ve failed to qualify for the playoffs on only nine occasions. But they’ve never won a Stanley Cup, and they haven’t advanced to a Stanley Cup Final since doing so three consecutive times from 1967-68 to 1969-70. 1 They were swept in all three of those finals and were outscored 43-17.
Those early failures didn’t derail the Blues — they qualified for the playoffs in six of their following nine seasons before embarking on a streak of 25 consecutive playoff berths from 1979-80 to 2003-04. That streak is tied for the third-longest in NHL history. But while the three other clubs to match or exceed St. Louis’s streak went to the Stanley Cup Final at least three times during their runs, the Blues teams advanced beyond the second round on only two occasions. Those Blues were like a weird second cousin: always showing up to the party but never having much to say.
But all that might change this season. The Blues are currently locked in a 2-2 tie with the Dallas Stars with a spot in the Western Conference finals on the line. St. Louis might be setting its fans up for yet another postseason disappointment in what has been a long line of them — but this could also be the year that the bounces finally go in the team’s favor, for once.
The six seasons immediately following the end of St. Louis’s long playoff streak were lean for the Blues: They qualified for the playoffs just once, in 2008-09, and were promptly swept in the first round by the Vancouver Canucks. But aside from 2017-18, the Blues have used the past eight seasons to reestablish themselves as perennial playoff participants. Just like the teams in the streak years, the Blues of the 2010s haven’t advanced to the Stanley Cup Final. The Blues usually stay on brand: They are almost always pretty good, but they are seldom ever great.
That’s especially been the case since the dawn of the 1990s, back when St. Louis featured a string of stars including Brett Hull, Grant Fuhr, Adam Oates, Al MacInnis and (eventually) Chris Pronger to form potent contenders in the West — on paper, at least. Since the 1989-90 season, no NHL team has underperformed in the postseason more than the Blues in terms of actual versus expected championships. Based on a logistic regression using Hockey-Reference.com’s Simple Rating System (SRS) scores 2 from each regular season, we would have expected the Blues to have won 1.4 Stanley Cups over that span; instead, they won zero. According to this measure of postseason disappointment, the next-closest NHL team since 1990 is the Ottawa Senators, who won zero Cups despite an expectation of 1.2 titles.
Compared with the other three major sports leagues, the plight of St. Louis Blues fans is only exceeded by those of fans who support the Oklahoma City Thunder (nee Seattle SuperSonics), Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz. It’s a motley crew of losers that residents of the Gateway City would rather not be associated with.

How Americans — And Democratic Candidates — Feel About Letting Felons Vote,fivethirtyeight.com,Nathaniel Rakich (nathaniel.rakich@fivethirtyeight.com),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-and-democratic-candidates-feel-about-letting-felons-vote/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER / GETTY IMAGES
Last month, during a CNN town hall featuring several Democratic candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders helped reignite a national conversation when he said people in prison should have the right to vote . It’s a controversial question, even within the Democratic Party. At the same town hall, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg said that he does not support extending voting rights to the incarcerated, drawing applause from the largely Democratic audience.
From ABC News:
Despite the issue’s recent rise to prominence, the question of whether and when felons should be allowed to vote has been percolating at the state level for a while now, as it overlaps with a broader progressive voting-rights agenda , criminal justice reform efforts, and pushes for racial equality (felon disenfranchisement disproportionately affects black Americans). A handful of states have recently restored certain felons’ right to vote, most notably Florida, where the passage of Amendment 4 in the 2018 midterm elections restored voting rights to an estimated 1.2 to 1.5 million people. 1 But how big an impact would restoring the vote to felons really have, and how much support is there for it?
To answer that question, first we need to take a step back and get a better sense of what voting rights felons are granted at the state level. Each state has different rules for whether felons are allowed to vote, and those rules vary widely. Only two states allow all felons, even those who are currently incarcerated, to vote: Maine and Vermont. Fourteen states, plus the District of Columbia, bar prisoners from voting but automatically restore their right to vote when they are released. Twenty-two states restore felons’ right to vote only after they complete their full sentences, including prison and parole; four of those states allow people on probation to vote, while the other 18 do not. Ten of the remaining 12 states permanently disenfranchise some felons, while Iowa and Kentucky do not restore voting rights to any felons except on a case-by-case basis. 2 But even within these categories there are differences: For example, some states treat violent offenders (murderers and sex offenders, for example) differently from nonviolent ones. So felon re-enfranchisement proposals could take many forms, but the more sweeping a proposal is, the less popular it tends to be.
The farthest-left position — Sanders’s — is to follow in the footsteps of Maine and Vermont by never stripping felons of their voting rights to begin with. Adopting that policy nationwide would have a bigger electoral impact than other ideas that have been floated over the years. A 2016 study by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform group that opposes felon disenfranchisement, estimated that 6.1 million felons (including 2.2 million African Americans) were disenfranchised nationwide, 3 although that research was done before Florida’s re-enfranchisement amendment passed last year. (A few other states have also made changes that put a smaller number of felons back on the rolls in the intervening years.) But the idea of allowing all felons to vote does not have much public support. In a March 2018 poll for HuffPost, YouGov found that 24 percent of U.S. adults supported restoring felons’ voting rights while they are in prison and 58 percent opposed it, including 41 percent who were “strongly” opposed. And a Quinnipiac poll conducted just last week found that only 31 percent of registered voters support allowing prisoners to vote — 65 percent were opposed.
From ABC News:
As of now, at least, full re-enfranchisement doesn’t seem like a winning issue for Democrats. For example, President Trump’s re-election campaign attacked Sanders for his stance in the days after the town hall, calling it “deeply offensive” and pointing out it would allow domestic terrorists like the surviving Boston Marathon bomber to vote. Even among Democrats, the idea is controversial. The HuffPost/YouGov poll found that Democrats opposed Sanders’s position 46 percent to 38 percent; Quinnipiac found that Democratic voters were about evenly divided on the issue. Bills to eliminate felony disenfranchisement failed to pass the legislature this year in both New Mexico and Hawaii , where Democrats have full control of state government. And no other Democratic presidential candidate has yet joined Sanders in calling for all prisoners to be allowed to vote.
But the public is more likely to support restoring the right to vote for felons who have been released from prison, even if they are on probation or parole — 38 percent of adults supported the idea in the HuffPost/YouGov poll, while 44 percent were opposed. According to that Sentencing Project study, if a measure like that had passed in 2016, it would have restored the right to vote to all but 1.4 million of the people who were disenfranchised at the time.
Although the public at large is narrowly opposed to letting people on probation or parole vote, the HuffPost/YouGov poll did indicate that the idea was a fairly mainstream position among Democrats (who supported it 58 percent to 30 percent). That might explain why there has been some momentum on this front in Democratic-controlled legislatures this year. Both chambers in Colorado have passed a bill to allow parolees to vote (Colorado already allows people on probation to vote), and if Gov. Jared Polis signs it, it will grant the vote to an estimated 10,000 more people. A similar bill has passed the Nevada Assembly, and Connecticut is considering a bill that could enfranchise 4,600 parolees and thousands more people facing trial.
But the easiest proposal to pass might be one that simply returns the ballot to felons after they have completed all parts of their sentence, as a plurality of states currently do. ( Buttigieg , Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Elizabeth Warren have all said they’d support voting rights for people who’ve been released from prison, though it’s unclear if that includes parolees and people on probation.) According to the Sentencing Project report, that would have re-enfranchised about 3.1 million people in 2016. However, at the time, Florida alone accounted for nearly half of all felons who had completed their sentence but still could not vote, according to the report, and it has since restored voting rights to many of those people. To get a rough idea of how many people might be eligible to have their voting rights restored if this kind of bill passed, we subtracted state-by-state estimates of how many people have been re-enfranchised in the last three years from the Sentencing Project’s 2016 estimate and got a ballpark figure of about 2 million. 4 And crucially, it is downright popular as a policy: 63 percent of adults told HuffPost/YouGov that they supported restoring the vote to felons who had completed their sentences. Just 20 percent were opposed.
That support cuts across all demographic groups, too — men and women, whites and nonwhites, young and old voters, Democrats and Republicans all favor it. 5 Indeed, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, announced earlier this year that restoring the vote to people who have completed their sentences was one of her top priorities . The state House overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment that would have achieved her goal, but it died in committee in the state Senate. But a February poll , conducted by Selzer & Co. for the Des Moines Register, found that 64 percent of Iowa adults favored Reynolds’s proposal and only 29 percent opposed it. And Florida’s Amendment 4, which re-enfranchised people who had served their full sentences, passed with 65 percent of the vote.
Crucially, though, that Florida amendment carved out an exception for those convicted of murder or felony sexual offenses. In that HuffPost/YouGov poll, people who said they supported the restoration of felon voting rights were split about evenly between believing rights should be restored to all felons and believing they should only be restored to people convicted of nonviolent felonies, so limitations like these probably do make the idea a safer political proposition. Perhaps not coincidentally, that seems to be where lots of 2020 presidential contenders have landed too — neatly avoiding the threat that their opponents will run attack ads saying they would restore rights for the imprisoned Boston Marathon bomber. In the aftermath of Sanders’s proclamation, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro said they were willing to grant prisoners the right to vote , but only those who had been convicted of nonviolent crimes. Sen. Kamala Harris said , “Do I think that people who commit murder, people who are terrorists, should be deprived of their rights? Yeah, I do.” And Rep. Eric Swalwell believes that “some people, like the Boston Marathon bombers, those individuals should never vote in America again.” Footnotes
However, the legislature just passed a bill requiring felons to pay fines, fees and restitution before they can vote; if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs the bill, it could keep an estimated 700,000 people off the voter rolls, at least temporarily.
Technically, this also true in Virginia, but in practice, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and current Gov. Ralph Northam have individually restored the voting rights of most Virginia felons who have completed their sentences.
Based on prison, parole and probation statistics from the Department of Justice, as well as estimates of how many felons have completed their sentences, which were made using past years’ felony conviction data with adjustments for mortality and recidivism rates. These state-by-state estimates were then compared against each state’s rules about which felons, if any, are allowed to vote.
Specifically, we estimated the low end of the range would be about 1.4 million people and the high end would be around 2.5 million.
Majorities of most demographic groups favored the policy, except for among Hispanic respondents, where the idea received plurality support.

Kawhi Leonard Is The Terminator,fivethirtyeight.com,Chris Herring (chris.herring@fivethirtyeight.com),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kawhi-leonard-is-the-terminator/,"11:03 AM Kawhi Leonard Is The Terminator And unfortunately for the Sixers, throwing him into a vat of molten metal isn’t legal in the NBA. Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors have tied the series at 2-2. Mitchell Leff / Getty Images
Even though they held a one-point lead with just more than a minute left in Game 4, Kawhi Leonard and the Toronto Raptors found themselves with their backs against the wall on Sunday in Philadelphia.
The Sixers and their raucous home crowd at Wells Fargo Center could almost taste a victory, one that would have given them an enormous 3-1 series advantage over Toronto heading into Game 5. And they would be accomplishing that despite getting a poor scoring effort from Joel Embiid, who was under the weather for the second time during the series.
But as the clock ticked down to that final minute, Leonard, who’d gotten almost everything he’d wanted Sunday, had other plans. He used a screen from teammate Marc Gasol, and four dribbles to his right, but both of Philly’s pick-and-roll defenders — Embiid and Ben Simmons — opted to follow Leonard to the right wing. Where another player might have passed the ball, Kawhi chose to elevate, lofting a rainbow 3-pointer over the outstretched left arm of the 7-foot-2 Embiid.
Aside from all but assuring that Toronto would knot the best-of-seven series at two games apiece, the shot punctuated yet another virtuoso performance by Leonard, who logged 39 points on 13-of-20 shooting and 14 rebounds, and is so far having one of the most efficient postseason runs we’ve ever seen from an NBA player , let alone a wing player specifically .
In this series against Philly, Leonard is somehow averaging 38 points on 62 percent shooting, with a perfect-looking shot chart. He’s drained an unthinkable 21 of his 24 uncontested shot attempts through the four games, including hitting 6-for-6 on Sunday.
Leonard did all this while continuing to have an impact on the defensive end, where he held Simmons in check during the first half before sliding over during the third period and heavily limiting swingman Jimmy Butler, who had scored efficiently up until that switch occurred.
Leonard wasn’t solely responsible for Toronto’s win Sunday. Gasol — who’d been held to eight points or fewer in Games 1-3 — was more aggressive and finished with 16 in Game 4. Similarly, Kyle Lowry looked for his shot early and finished with 14 points after having just seven in Game 3. Danny Green was a perfect 8-for-8 from the line. All of these contributions were helpful in light of Pascal Siakam, arguably Toronto’s second-best player, shooting 2-of-10 from the floor while playing through a calf injury, and Serge Ibaka being the only Raptor to score off the bench.
But make no mistake: Kawhi has played as if he were content to do this all by himself if need be. And in many ways, that spectacle is still noteworthy considering how far a cry it is from what Leonard was earlier in his career, before he became a clear-cut franchise player.
During this postseason, just 33 percent of Leonard’s baskets have been assisted, according to NBA Advanced Stats, while the other two-thirds have been self-created. Snapshots over time illustrate how that’s flipped almost entirely, as he’s become more of a 1-on-1 player . During the 2012-13 regular season, for instance, 65 percent of Kawhi’s makes were assisted. That share of assisted baskets dropped to 54 percent during 2014-15, and to just under 48 percent in 2016-17 before dwindling to just a third during these playoffs.
The question to raise here, of course, is whether it’s possible for Leonard to keep this up. He can’t keep shooting 70 percent from midrange when he was a 46-percent shooter from there during the regular season, right?
On some level, the answer to that may depend on whether the Sixers are willing to be more aggressive about forcing the ball out of Leonard’s hands. We’ve written before about what makes Leonard so different from the other stars in the NBA (aside from how mysteriously quiet he seems to be): He does just about everything at an above-average level , while defending and scoring better than almost anyone. But if there’s one area to test, it’s his playmaking, which generally pales in comparison to LeBron James’s or even Kevin Durant’s. (Both contemporaries regularly enjoy 2-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratios, while Leonard has yet to post such a season.) Leonard, who had five assists and seven turnovers Sunday, has closer to a 1-to-1 ratio this postseason, with 31 assists and 29 turnovers so far.
Going one level deeper, Kawhi was the NBA’s least efficient wing player 1 this past regular season when opposing defenses either blitzed or trapped him in pick-and-rolls, with the Raptors scoring just 0.46 points per chance in such situations, according to data from Second Spectrum.
So while Philadelphia hasn’t been able to stop The Terminator-like Kawhi yet, the Sixers at least have something they can try in hopes of slowing him down as the series moves back to Toronto. Footnotes

John Delaney is one of many candidates who have tried to use a CNN town hall to get his message out to voters. Gary Miller / FilmMagic
In the calm before 2020, FiveThirtyEight is taking a look at the ideas and people who are nudging the country’s rapidly changing political conversation in one direction or the other. We’re calling these people and ideas “nudgers.” (Creative, we know.) This installment takes a look at CNN’s televised town halls with presidential candidates.
There is an awful lot of appointment viewing for “political” Americans.
If you care about our democracy for reasons civic or contractual, there are, month to month and week to week, any number of live events that demand you tune in and turn on. Blockbuster congressional testimony . Debates . Press conferences of all stripes .
CNN’s presidential town halls are a newly viral addition to the “did you watch that?” industrial complex. There have already been 20 of these events, and most of the Democratic candidates who have said they’re running in 2020 have been featured. Started during the 2016 presidential primary cycle, the formula is simple: plug a candidate into a prime time (ish) slot, fill the room with likely voters armed with questions to read off of index cards, and make sure that a CNN anchor is on stage to keep everyone (relatively) honest. The questioners are polite and earnest — it’s not really a venue for heated follow-up — and candidates get the opportunity to perform empathetic conversation. They nod, repeat the name of the questioner, and then typically launch into a portion of their stump speech on any given topic. If the candidate has dodged a voter’s question, the CNN anchor often follows up with more pointed questions.
In these town halls, CNN has created a kind of petri dish for news at a time when candidates aren’t otherwise doing all that much that’s considered newsworthy. They haven’t radically reshaped the campaign, but they have given it some useful plot points.
Mark Preston, CNN’s executive director of political programming, told me that he’d long had the idea to do town halls but that things came together in earnest when he ran into a couple of Bernie Sanders advisers while getting a drink after a 2015 Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. “There was a lot of criticism of candidates on the Democratic side not being able to articulate their message beyond the debate stage, which was three or four people at a time,” he said. The Sanders aides seemed enthused about the prospect of a platform that gave their guy more time to talk.
The format as it exists today is a (better lit) re-creation of town halls in places like Iowa and New Hampshire. There, voters who are seemingly unimpressed by celebrity or wealth ask politicians pointed questions and watch them squirm. “The simplicity of it is beautiful in its own way,” Preston said, and gives national audiences the time and insights that usually only early-primary voters are afforded.
This time around, CNN’s presidential town halls began 22 months before the 2020 election and are a fascinating set of TV show gewgaws. They are not necessarily ratings gold — Fox News beat CNN on a recent night when the network aired back-to-back town halls with five different candidates — yet the town halls tend to move news cycles in the suffocatingly close-read environment of political journalism. Fox News has even begun aping the CNN format. The network hosted Sanders for a town hall and has announced plans to hold them for Democratic candidates Pete Buttigieg, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar.
Eighteen months out from the presidential election, the clearest role that CNN’s town halls seem to be playing is as useful generator of what historian Daniel Boorstin called “pseudo-events” in his 1961 book, “ The Image .” Boorstin had noticed a rise in news events that weren’t really news events at all in the classic sense of things. Rather than organic happenings like protests or confrontations, these pseudo-events were the creations of public relations professionals, artificial inflection points designed to help public figures get their messages out. (I recently saw an article reporting that public relations professionals now outnumber journalists 6 to 1. I wonder what Boorstin would have thought of that.)
As a political journalist, I’ve realized an unfortunate, stomach-dropping thing: An awful lot of what we cover is pseudo-events. Political conventions, speeches, candidates buying doughnuts in New Hampshire in front of 15 television cameras and five confused bystanders: It’s all manufactured. CNN’s innovation is its regular propagation of pseudo-events for the 2020 cycle — there are hordes of reporters at myriad news organizations assigned to the beat, each one marking time and looking for chum in the water.
So it’s no wonder that the town halls have become influential in driving the political news. Outlets from the left-leaning Young Turks to Glenn Beck’s The Blaze have done their own programming off the CNN town halls. News — of sorts — is often made during the broadcasts and picked up by political journalists who watch and punt it around Twitter. Elizabeth Warren said she’d like to get rid of the Electoral College in her March town hall. Sanders’s ( previously stated ) view that all felons should have the right to vote was discussed in his April town hall event and became the issue du jour. Kamala Harris was asked the same question and found herself doing next-day clarifications . Buttigieg saw a massive fundraising boost for his fledgling campaign from his first town hall — after explicitly asking for donations on air — and his standing in the polls rose after his appearance.
CNN itself churns out quite a bit of content off the town halls. There are the “ takeaways ,” the fact-checks and the stories following up on news made. Sam Feist, CNN’s Washington bureau chief, told me that the network’s digital team is on high alert during town halls. “By the time we go to bed, there are a half a dozen stories,” he said.
Not every candidate has gotten their shot at the town hall experience, though. After the five-town-hall night — which saw Klobuchar, Warren, Sanders, Harris and Buttigieg all get their second event — Democratic presidential candidate Wayne Messam , the mayor of a Florida city with 140,000 residents, tweeted : . @cnn There is a candidate who proposed to forgive $1.5 Trillion in Student Loan Debt long before the other candidate. I would love to have a #TownHall to share my proposal. What you say? – How college debt debate shifted with one big idea https://t.co/8fNeCoUONT
— Wayne Messam (@WayneMessam) April 24, 2019
CNN did not provide comment when asked about Messam’s tweet.
Both Feist and Preston said the town halls are more than just contrived ways to juice the news cycle. “It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Preston told me. “I think that these Democratic candidates can drive the news cycle without CNN.” If anything, he said, the town halls are a way to prove to the viewers that the network is the home of substantive political coverage.
At least until the first Democratic debate in June — when candidates will finally be allowed on stage together — CNN owns a sizable chunk of the grill-the-presidential-hopeful market. The town halls are a sign, though, that the ghost of Boorstin is already haunting the 2020 presidential contest and is unlikely to leave. Masses of journalists will spend the next year and a half ferrying around the country, learning stump speeches by heart and dutifully tweeting scene reports for the interested masses. This, after all, is how we have settled on electing the most powerful person on Earth. From ABC News:"
Ronald Acuna Is Quietly Getting Better. And That’s Scary.,fivethirtyeight.com,Neil Paine (neil.paine@fivethirtyeight.com),05-06-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ronald-acuna-is-quietly-getting-better-and-thats-scary/,"Min. 450 plate appearances for OPS+ leaders and 100 games for WAR/G leaders Sources: Baseball-Reference.com, FanGraphs
At a glance, Acuña’s early 2019 numbers actually represent a slight downgrade from that stellar rookie campaign. His OPS+ has dipped from 145 to 134, thanks to a big decline in slugging percentage (.552 to .487). Relatedly, Acuña is hitting home runs less frequently , and his isolated power is down nearly 70 points. It looks sure like a mild sophomore slump — albeit one we should all be so lucky to have.
Under the surface, however, Acuña has made some impressive strides this year in two important areas: plate discipline and defense.
Acuña’s 2018 walk rate of 9.2 percent was already better than league average — particularly impressive considering the whole “20-year-old rookie” factor — but his 2019 rate is up to 12.7 percent, which ranks 35th in baseball . He’s seeing more pitches (4.61 per plate appearance, second-most in baseball ) and consistently getting into good hitter’s counts more often than he did a year ago. At the same time, Acuña has been whiffing a lot less so far in 2019. He struck out in 25.3 percent of his plate appearances last season, which ranked him around the bottom quarter of MLB hitters, but this year that rate is down to 21.8 percent, comfortably in the top half of the league.
Those changes give Acuña an overall strikeout-to-walk ratio of 1.72, which is the second-lowest in baseball for a hitter his age. Since a player’s batting eye is a core leading indicator for his underlying hitting skills, Acuña’s improved strike-zone judgment is a great sign of his ongoing development at the plate.
The other area in which Acuña has improved is defense. We combined the Ultimate Zone Rating figures found at FanGraphs and the Defensive Runs Saved numbers at Baseball-Reference.com and found that Acuña was no better than an average outfielder last season. (And he might have been worse than that — another prominent metric, Michael Humphreys’ Defensive Regression Analysis , considered him to be 3 runs below average.) This season, Acuña’s numbers are up no matter which source you consult; he’s on pace to have improved by about 10 runs — or 1 entire win — if he ends up playing the same number of innings as in 2018. 4
The advanced fielding stats may just be catching up with what the eye test already knew about Acuña’s defensive potential. FanGraphs’ annual poll of fan fielding assessments had already judged Acuña to be one of the most talented left fielders in the game last season, thanks to his tremendous first step and speed to the ball off the bat. But now that he’s putting those skills to use in the metrics, Acuña’s potential value looks even greater: Per 162 team games, he’s tracking for 7.0 WAR this season, which basically matches what Ken Griffey Jr. and Albert Pujols had at the same age.
Acuña’s dip in power this year is a bit puzzling, particularly since his Statcast hitting metrics — including exit velocity, hard-hit ball rate and “ barrels ” (balls hit with the ideal velocity and launch angle) — are also down across the board. Some of that might come down to the injury that kept him out of Sunday’s game: “It’s been on and off,” Acuña told reporters through an interpreter after picking up four hits but exiting Saturday’s game early . “I’ve felt it for a while, so it wasn’t today. Today, it just kind of grabbed at me after I had a quick swing like that and got out of the box pretty quickly. That’s when I felt it. But I felt good coming into today, as always.”
But assuming his back isn’t an ongoing issue, Acuña should get plenty more pitches to crush as the season goes on, given his improved willingness to wait out favorable counts. Acuña may not be launching balls out of the park left and right like Bellinger at the moment — he hasn’t homered since April 16 , in fact — but the foundation of his game still has superstardom stamped into it as much as ever. Footnotes
Averaging together the WAR versions found at Baseball-Reference.com and FanGraphs.
Minimum 100 games.
Which probably undersells his potential improvement, because Acuña was limited to 111 games last year between injuries and Atlanta’s service-time chicanery.

Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee May 1, 2019. Win McNamee / Getty Images
(UPDATE: May 8, 2019, 5:02 p.m.): In a 24-16 vote, the House Judiciary Committee advanced a contempt resolution to the House floor. If a majority of the full House approves the measure, Barr will be held in contempt.
On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee is slated to vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress, intensifying congressional Democrats’ ongoing battle with the Trump administration over special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The committee’s Democratic chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, scheduled the vote after Barr missed Nadler’s deadline for delivering Mueller’s full, unredacted report and its underlying materials to Congress. If the resolution passes committee , it won’t be final until it’s passed by a simple majority in the full House of Representatives — but that doesn’t seem too far-fetched, given that Democratic leaders are still angry about how Barr has handled the rollout of the Mueller report.
A contempt citation would be largely symbolic in this case, however, even though contempt rulings are Congress’s only formal mechanism for enforcing subpoenas. That’s because the Department of Justice is responsible for pursuing criminal contempt charges and it seems unlikely that Barr will sign off on his own prosecution. 1 Nevertheless, it’s a dramatic step. Barr would join a small group of senior administration officials who have been held in contempt, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service tally of contempt procedures since 1980. Only one attorney general — Eric Holder — was held in contempt by the full House, although contempt proceedings were also started against Janet Reno during the Clinton administration. Few senior officials have been held in contempt All White House counsel and Cabinet secretaries who faced contempt proceedings and whether the full House held them in contempt, since 1980 Year White House chief of staff ✓ * Held in contempt by the full House following the passage of a committee resolution Source: Congressional Research Service
But while big contempt showdowns appear to be increasingly common — three of the four senior executive branch officials who have been held in contempt by the full House served in the past two administrations — the changing political landscape may be reducing their impact.
Political scientists Douglas Kriner and Eric Schickler, who have shown that prolonged congressional investigations can lower presidential approval ratings over time, said that a contempt citation could still pack a political punch, particularly if it leads to increased or negative media coverage. But Kriner added that the power of this tool may be diminished by deep polarization in Congress and the president’s unusually steady approval ratings , which so far appear to be impervious to the Democrats’ investigations.
In the past, contempt fights had the potential to turn into a serious presidential liability. “They were used by Congress as a kind of stick to reach an accommodation with the president,” Kriner said. For instance, in the 1980s, Anne Gorsuch Burford, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was held in contempt after she refused to turn over documents about her agency’s efforts to clean up toxic waste. Political pressure mounted after the bipartisan vote, making Burford seem like a liability to the GOP, and eventually the administration reversed course, turning over the contested documents and forcing Burford to step down .
More recent examples underscore the limitations of contempt citations, though. In 2012, Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over papers related to a botched operation where illegal guns were sold to people who were thought to be connected to Mexican drug cartels . Holder left office in 2014 with a relatively low approval rating and the Obama administration eventually turned over the documents after a lengthy court battle, but Holder wasn’t prosecuted or forced to resign, and Kriner said the overall political impact was minimal as the investigation wasn’t covered widely in the media, even after Holder was held in contempt.
While Kriner and Schickler’s research has found that prolonged investigations can drag down presidential approval ratings, the fact that recent presidents’ favorability numbers have stayed pretty steady over time could mean that congressional investigations are less likely to have an impact — if nothing seems to affect approval ratings anymore, it may indicate that voters’ opinions are essentially fixed and a congressional investigation may not be enough to move them. This is particularly true for Trump, whose approval ratings are much lower than those of many other presidents. But even if it’s unlikely that holding Barr in contempt will pull Trump’s approval numbers down, that doesn’t mean the citation can’t be a weapon, Schickler said — it just might inflict a different kind of damage. “The risk for the Democrats with all of these investigations is that public interest wanes,” he said. “Because a contempt vote is dramatic, it can drive and sustain public attention on this idea of a lack of transparency and cooperation from the administration, and make it look like the Democrats are taking action.”
There’s a risk, of course, that the Trump administration will simply continue to stonewall and the Democrats will be forced to escalate the conflict again, which would likely mean opening impeachment hearings for Barr, or even Trump. This could backfire on the Democrats if it’s perceived as overreach, particularly since impeaching Trump remains unpopular overall . But Democrats seem unwilling to back down in the face of a recalcitrant White House — and holding Barr in contempt is one of the few cards they have left to play.
From ABC News: Footnotes
House Democrats could also vote to issue a civil contempt resolution, which would allow them to sue Barr in the courts. But in the past, this process has taken years . Congress also has the power to arrest or jail people who don’t comply, but that hasn’t happened in almost a century.

Pelosi Is Going After Barr And Rejecting Impeachment. Is That A Smart Plan?,fivethirtyeight.com,Perry Bacon Jr. (perry.bacon@fivethirtyeight.com),05-08-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pelosi-is-going-after-barr-and-rejecting-impeachment-is-that-a-smart-plan/,"Pelosi Is Going After Barr And Rejecting Impeachment. Is That A Smart Plan? A FiveThirtyEight Chat Twitter
Welcome to FiveThirtyEight’s weekly politics chat . The transcript below has been lightly edited.
sarahf ( Sarah Frostenson , politics editor): On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for his failure to comply with a congressional subpoena that required he turn over special counsel Robert Mueller’s full, unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as the underlying evidence.
Democrats are also calling for Mueller to testify before Congress. But impeachment proceedings remain off the table. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said that move would be too risky for Democrats looking to defeat President Trump in 2020.
In general, Pelosi’s playbook has gone something like this: 1) Do not get involved in a political fight over impeachment because the Republican-controlled Senate will never convict Trump and 2) Do not alienate the moderate wing of the party by drifting too far to the left on policy.
So what do you think? Is Pelosi’s gambit right?
Let’s start with her post-Mueller report strategy. Is going after Barr instead of the president the right move?
perry ( Perry Bacon Jr. , senior writer): I find this all a bit too clever. Yes, Barr misled Congress by suggesting that he didn’t know if Mueller had any concerns about Barr’s four-page summary of Mueller’s report. (Mueller had in fact written a letter to Barr laying out his concerns with the summary .) Yes, Congress wants the unredacted Mueller report. But what is the point of Joe Biden , Kamala Harris, and other 2020 candidates and congressional Democrats calling for Barr to resign? He is not resigning, and even if he did, Trump would pick a different attorney general to do his bidding.
It seems to me like a clear case of “we are too weak/scared/unwilling to take on the president directly, so we will take on this underling.”
ameliatd ( Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux , senior writer): Right. Going after Barr does not accomplish much in the short term or the long term. Democrats can vote to hold him in contempt, but the Justice Department is responsible for enforcing the contempt charge, which means that Barr would have to sign off on his own prosecution.
julia_azari ( Julia Azari , political science professor at Marquette University and FiveThirtyEight contributor): This is the problem with the executive branch in general. It has to execute stuff.
Me and my Ph.D. in political science will be here all day.
But I am serious about this. Our system isn’t super well-equipped to deal with problems in the executive branch.
sarahf: Yeah, it definitely seems as if we’re in a situation where Congress is running out of good options. Arguably, even holding Barr in contempt is more of a political move than anything else.
nrakich ( Nathaniel Rakich , elections analyst): I am not sure what to make of the Barr stuff. Maybe it will rile up Republicans, while Democrats will see it as a weak half-measure — in which case, it’s not smart? But maybe it’ll be the other way around and be seen as a sensible compromise among Democrats?
julia_azari: It’s not unreasonable for Democrats to dial down the theatrics and push on Barr in a way that is a big deal among “Washington insiders” or people who follow this stuff closely but doesn’t engage the larger electorate.
perry: If the goal is half-measures, the Barr approach is a good one. Pelosi can pretend to confront Trump without actually doing so — by attacking Barr, asking for Mueller to testify and demanding the full, unredacted report.
ameliatd: The advantage of holding Barr in contempt is that it signals that the Democrats are continuing to take the Trump administration’s refusal to comply with their oversight seriously. And it buys them some time. But my question is … what are they buying time for?
perry: Exactly. I suppose they are buying time through all of the various requests for more testimony and documents from people like former White House Counsel Don McGahn, who was one of the key witnesses in Mueller’s report.
But, eventually, that time runs out.
The options for Democrats, as I see them, are: 1) impeach, 2) censure and 3) do nothing.
nrakich: Don’t Democrats want to buy time until the election?
ameliatd: The problem is they don’t have many weapons beyond contempt. If the Trump administration continues to shrug off Democrats’ efforts, then they basically have to either impeach Barr or impeach Trump. It seems like there’s no stick big enough to make the administration cooperate.
nrakich: To Perry’s point, I think a censure is an underrated third path.
sarahf: Well, OK, say that Democrats get Mueller or McGahn to testify. What would they stand to gain from that?
perry: The testimony will make Trump look bad. And it will help stall the part of the Democratic base that wants impeachment.
ameliatd: But I still don’t get what the long game is. It’ll be very hard for Democrats to keep the public focused on this for the next 18 (?) months without talking more about impeachment.
perry: And what more is there to learn? Mueller put out a 400-page report . I don’t think his testimony will be groundbreaking. Let’s say that Mueller says Barr forced a premature end to the investigation. How surprising would it really be?
julia_azari: The Democrats are sort of stuck between what adhering to some of the practices of rule of law demand and what makes electoral sense.
ameliatd: This is the perpetual challenge for Trump’s opponents — nothing is surprising! Which makes it hard to weaponize the Trump administration’s actions.
perry: “Trump is goading us to impeach him,” Pelosi said this morning, saying doing so would “solidify his base”
— Manu Raju (@mkraju) May 7, 2019
So this is interesting. Pelosi’s argument is that Trump is trying to goad Democrats into impeachment because it would fire up Republicans and backfire on Democrats in 2020. Pelosi is claiming that she sees the trick — and she won’t fall for it. But what if there is no trick!? Trump has always behaved as though he is above the law — even before he was president .
Also, Trump’s base is already pretty solidly behind him already .
nrakich: Maybe that’s a convenient way for Pelosi to excuse herself from impeaching Trump? “If we do it, we’d be doing exactly what he wants us to do!”
ameliatd: I do think it’s fair to ask what the Democrats’ options are, beyond what they’re doing now. They really are stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they drop their demands for the unredacted Mueller report, they look weak. But if they go after Barr and still can’t get the full Mueller report, they look weak. It goes back to what Julia was saying — our system is really not set up to handle an executive branch that stonewalls Congress across the board.
sarahf: And most Americans don’t seem to want impeachment. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted last month found that 56 percent of Americans think Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, and that’s a 10-point increase from August.
julia_azari: Americans’ aversion to impeachment is pretty interesting. I noted in this piece that even though people thought Bill Clinton had lied, they didn’t support removing him from office.
I got some feedback from readers that the Trump situation would be different, which I think was logical, but so far, that has turned out to be wrong.
nrakich: I continue to believe that impeaching Trump is a political risk that Democrats don’t need to take . (It could hurt them politically in the 2020 election, and the GOP majority in the Senate means they’ll never remove him from office anyway.) But another thing I’ve been thinking about is that there might not be enough votes to impeach Trump in the House. I don’t really see any of the moderate/vulnerable Democrats voting for it?
perry: I tend to think public opinion is malleable — as are votes in Congress. If the Democratic leadership embraced impeachment, it would be hard for most Democratic members to be against it. All but five Republicans voted for one of the articles of impeachment against Bill Clinton in the 1990s — even while it was clear the public didn’t want it . Dissenting was difficult once that became the Republican Party’s position. If every leading Democrat embraced impeachment, that might shift the polls.
ameliatd: The upside of impeachment hearings, for the Democrats, is that it would be easier to get documents and testimony. So if they really want to put on a political show, that’s one way to do it.
sarahf: So one thing that I don’t understand about Pelosi’s stance on impeachment is that even as she categorically rules it out, she also tries to occupy this space where she suggests maybe she’s not that opposed, and instead says she doesn’t want to talk about impeachment because that’s what Trump wants the Democrats to do. The whole reason Pelosi has said she’s opposed to impeachment is because she’d rather Democrats work with the administration to pick up some bipartisan legislative wins, like an infrastructure bill or drug-pricing legislation , but I’m not sure that’s really happening. Doesn’t the ongoing fight over the Mueller report overshadow or undermine these efforts?
perry: It’s like Democrats are doing “impeachment lite,” which doesn’t actually put the hammer on Trump and keeps keep everyone talking about the investigations but doesn’t offer any resolution.
Do a censure and then move on.
That seems to me like the logical path — a carefully written censure can get 218 votes, and then you can move on from Russia and Mueller.
ameliatd: I’m also not convinced that focusing on Barr and Mueller is the best use of Democrats’ energy. Public opinion seems very set on the Mueller report. But the Democrats are investigating all kinds of other things — including Trump’s finances . It seems like if they want to keep the investigations going, that might be a better place to focus.
julia_azari: I agree with Perry about the path to censure. But, in my opinion, the question that underlies a lot of this is whether there are any paths to “good politics.” The country is polarized, the president is not playing by the rules, and he has a very strong base. What kind of path really exists?
perry: Pelosi seems to think that talking about health care and policy issues is better than talking about Russia and impeachment.
So I think “good politics” in her view means talking about other issues.
nrakich: I do think the midterms showed the potency of health care and other bread-and-butter issues.
perry: Even on immigration, Trump’s views are fairly unpopular .
nrakich: But part of me also wonders what would happen if Democrats ran the Mitt Romney playbook against Trump in 2020, especially with someone like Biden or Sanders leading the Democratic ticket.
julia_azari: What is the Romney playbook?
nrakich: Trump is a rich businessman who cheated on his taxes, exploited offshore tax havens, sides with billionaires over the little guy, etc.
There might be more fodder for that in the investigation of Trump’s finances, so that investigation might prove more politically beneficial.
perry: But we already have all the evidence you need for that.
Voters already know Trump did weird stuff with the Russia investigation, probably doesn’t pay his fair share of taxes and has shady business deals — people have won Pulitzers covering Trump’s finances.
nrakich: Right, but coupled with that kind of electoral strategy, the investigations into Trump’s finances wouldn’t look like overreach.
Like, the Russia card seems played out, but that card seems barely played at all.
“several people are typing” 😬
julia_azari: I’m on the fence about your theory of 2012, Nathaniel. As the resident “ fundamentalist ,” I think it’s pretty likely the election will be close if current conditions hold. So something like a populist anti-businessman strategy could make the difference, but Democrats would probably be better off getting different constituencies to turn out or focusing on keeping the suburbs blue .
ameliatd: So is there any benefit to the political theater aspect of these investigations, if the public already knows all of these things about Trump?
nrakich: The public may already know these things about Trump, but the election hasn’t been framed around them.
The 2016 election was framed around Trump being unacceptable and unfit .
I think it might have worked out better for Democrats if they had painted Trump as an out-of-touch billionaire.
Although your point is well taken, Julia.
sarahf: But setting aside Romney’s playbook, is Pelosi right in distancing party leadership from some of the most ambitious plans advocated by the left wing of her party? And instead focusing on the issues Democrats won on in 2018, i.e. health care? Perry wrote about this last week — why is the “Super Progressive” bloc of the party losing to the House leadership , or at least not gaining traction, when it puts forward big policy ideas like “Medicare for All” and the Green New Deal ? But is this a winning strategy for 2020?
ameliatd: The other issue is that Trump is also stonewalling on his tax returns and financial statements. So even with the Democrats focusing there, he’s basically trying to run out the clock until the election.
perry: And he will succeed.
Which is why I find this whole tax returns thing not a very interesting story. Trump will not release his taxes — he should, but he has the power not to.
julia_azari: My first reaction to the Pelosi statements about strategy is that we are in a moment where ideological labels mean nothing. Pelosi the leader of the center ? WTF?
I think Democratic strategies (and all strategies probably) come down to two different ways of thinking about the map. You can think of it as a sort of “median voter” approach, which would be trying to win a majority of the nation and hope that translates into an Electoral College win or focusing on “swing states” and making assumptions about what Midwestern voters want.
That approach usually leads Democrats — and Republicans, to an extent — to tack to the center on policy or pick “safe” candidates.
Alternately, you can move away from the “national majorities” idea altogether. The second approach is to think of parties as coalitions to mobilize, and fairly patchwork ones at that.
perry: I think the broader question is if Democrats should run a fairly bland, safe campaign on policy (say, defending the Affordable Care Act , pushing back on separating children from their families at the border and attacking Trump on ideas like getting rid of Obamacare’s protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions ), or be bolder on policy, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been doing in their 2020 campaigns. My thoughts are twofold: The first option is probably safer and maybe marginally better electorally, but if Republicans are going to run ads linking Joe Biden or the other centrist candidates to more liberal ideas anyway, is the safe choice really better if the Democrats think the more liberal ideas are better policy?
nrakich: I think Pelosi may have a slightly different agenda than Democrats in general or, to be more specific, than those running to be the Democratic presidential nominee. Pelosi’s majority in the House is much more clearly built on these moderate suburban districts. Ergo, Pelosi is probably right that it’s safer for those Democratic members to not have to run on a platform that supports Medicare for All or the Green New Deal.
But to win a presidential election, the math might be different. Maybe it is better to really get the base excited.
That said, I kind of think the base will be motivated to vote no matter what — hatred (and the desire to get Trump out of office) is a powerful motivator.
sarahf: Although Democrats are reportedly losing their voter enthusiasm edge over Republicans.
julia_azari: A different way of thinking about this is whether there’s a risk for Democrats in seeming too focused on Trump. Can I beat the dead horse of the Romney example? I mean, Republicans were pretty united against Obama, too, but it wasn’t enough to defeat an incumbent president in decent economic times.
(Although Obama’s reelection with less of the vote share than he won in 2008 was really, really rare. Most presidents either win a bigger vote share or lose reelection.)
ameliatd: I do think the Democrats need to excite voters about something other than beating Trump. It’s just not clear to me at this point if that can be Medicare for All.
On the other hand, maybe it’s worth the gamble. The idea that the best response to Trump is to play it safe seems like it could really backfire.
sarahf: Nathaniel’s point that Pelosi may be waging a different game strategy than what the 2020 Democratic contenders are doing is an interesting one, and maybe another reason why so many have them have been vocal in calling for Barr’s resignation or Trump’s impeachment.
perry: I think Pelosi would be fine calling for Barr’s resignation.
It’s kind of a non-position (he is not resigning) and another opportunity for Democrats to stall.
Only a few Democrats have called for impeachment proceedings against Trump.
julia_azari: I think among the Democratic candidates and other party leaders, it isn’t just a matter of whether to endorse impeachment, but of defining what it means to impeach a president and what it means to take that position. Is it a position of the far left of the party? Does it establishing you as a “rule of law” candidate? I think it’s unclear right now.
Because 200+ years of American history have not really answered those questions.
And now we have stark polarization, split chambers and a pretty unusual president.
perry: You are suggesting Democrats are thinking deeply about the history and merits of impeachment, but I don’t think they are. I would argue that some very liberal Democrats are in favor of impeachment and the rest of the party probably isn’t . Impeachment has the same dynamic as the Green New Deal: It’s another proxy for the fight between left and center-left Democrats .
And Pelosi’s stance on impeachment is similar to her approach to other issues that divide the party’s center-left from its left — arguing that impeachment is too politically risky .
sarahf: So I guess that’s kind of the question. Is Pelosi’s leadership of the Democratic Party — her decision not to impeach, not to move too far to the left — going to work for Democrats, at least in Congress? New York Times reporter Glenn Thrush wrote in a story on her leadership that she has embraced her role as “the only Democrat with the power to oppose” Trump. What do we make of that? Is that a convincing electability-style argument for Democrats in 2020?
nrakich: Pelosi can try to influence who the 2020 nominee is, but ultimately, he or she will set the tone for the 2020 election.
ameliatd: The big issue, I think, is that the House Democrats have to decide what they’re going to do about their relative lack of power, compared to the executive branch, and they may have to do that sooner rather than later. Pelosi can try to continue to stake out a middle ground, but they are running up against some big structural limitations — and I agree that impeachment lite is not a workable strategy in the long term.
It seems like the central challenge for Democrats is: Can you run on normalcy and basically treat Trump as an aberration? Or do you have to deal with the structural problems his presidency is exposing? The latter, of course, is incredibly hard to do. From ABC News:

How Every Senator Ranks According To ‘Popularity Above Replacement Senator’,fivethirtyeight.com,Nathaniel Rakich (nathaniel.rakich@fivethirtyeight.com),05-08-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-every-senator-ranks-according-to-popularity-above-replacement-senator/,"R+23 -36 A Democratic senator with a net approval of +2 in an R+7 state has a PARS of +9 (2+7 = 9). If the same state had a Republican senator with the same approval rating, the PARS would be -5 (2-7= -5). Independent Sens. Angus King and Bernie Sanders are considered Democrats for these calculations. Shaded rows denote senators whose seats are up in 2020, excluding those senators who are not seeking reelection. * Partisan lean is the average difference between how a state votes and how the country votes overall, with 2016 presidential election results weighted at 50 percent, 2012 presidential election results weighted at 25 percent and results from elections for the state legislature weighted at 25 percent. The partisan leans in this article were calculated before the 2018 elections; we haven’t calculated FiveThirtyEight partisan leans that incorporate the midterm results yet. Sources: Morning Consult, media reports
Like we did for PARG, we can use PARS as a tool to assess the 2020 Senate elections — specifically, to give us clues about which of the senators whose seats are up in 2020 might be poised to over- or underperform their party’s presidential ticket.
That conversation starts with Sen. Doug Jones, who comes in at No. 2 in PARS with a score of +33. Jones is a Democratic senator in R+27 Alabama, so he’s fighting an uphill battle. And if he is able to maintain a positive net approval rating (it’s +6 currently), that will be a sign of life for his candidacy.
Republican Sen. Susan Collins is another senator who hopes to overcome the partisan lean of her state (Maine is 5 points more Democratic-leaning than the nation) to win reelection. Her net approval rating in the Morning Consult poll has been on the decline over the past two years, but she still has a solid +13 net approval rating. The question is whether the results in 2020 will be closer to her net approval rating or Maine’s light-blue partisanship; splitting the difference yields a race that leans (or tilts) Republican, which is exactly where major election handicappers have it.
Similarly, if you were to look at state partisanship alone, you might assume that Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Warner of Virginia and Tina Smith of Minnesota are electorally vulnerable. But PARS reveals why the handicappers aren’t so sure. They all sit in closely divided states (from R+2 for New Hampshire to D+2 for Minnesota), yes, but they are all also quite popular. Shaheen has a +21 net approval rating, Warner has a +19 net approval rating and Smith has a +18 net approval rating.
Unlike this trio, there are some senators whose electoral fates probably do hinge on the presidential race. Those include Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Cornyn of Texas. Each has a PARS between +1 and -3, indicating that their net approval rating is in line with their states’ partisan lean. If the Democratic presidential nominee carries their states (admittedly, this will be easier for Colorado than for Texas), the party may get a Senate seat as a bonus.
Finally, the senator who ranks last in PARS is also up for reelection in 2020, and it’s a big name: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell manages just a -13 net approval rating despite inhabiting an R+23 state. It’s not crazy to think he could be vulnerable in 2020. Democrats are reportedly trying to recruit former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, who raised $8.6 million for an unsuccessful 2018 congressional bid, to run against him. But it’s worth remembering that Lucy has held this football in front of Democrats before. In 2014, McConnell also had popularity problems, and Democrats thought they had a top candidate to challenge him in Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. McConnell beat Grimes 56 percent to 41 percent.

The Loudest Places You Can’t Hear | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-loudest-places-you-cant-hear/,"Twitter PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER / GETTY IMAGES
Where is the loudest place in America? You might think New York City, or a major airport hub, or a concert you have suddenly become too old to appreciate.
But that depends on what kind of noise you’re measuring. Sound is actually a physical thing. What we perceive as noise is the result of air molecules bumping into one another, like a Newton’s cradle toy . That movement eventually reaches our eardrums, which turn that tiny wiggle into an audible signal. But human ears can’t convert all molecular motion to sound. Sometimes the particles are jostling one another too fast. Sometimes they’re too slow . Sometimes, the motion is just happening in the wrong medium — through the Earth , say, instead of through the air.
And when you start listening for the sounds we can’t hear, the loudest place in America can end up being right under your feet.
Scientists have tools that can detect these “silent” waves, and they’ve found a lot of noise happening all over the U.S. Those noises are made by the cracking of rocks deep in the Earth along natural fault lines and the splashing of whitecaps on the ocean. But they’re also made by our factories, power plants, mines and military.
“Any kind of mechanical process is going to generate energetic waves, said Omar Marcillo, staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. “Some of that goes through the atmosphere as acoustic waves, and some goes through the ground as seismic waves.” Marcillo’s work focuses on the seismic.
When researchers track seismic activity, they’re sensing the waves that make the Earth roll and rumble, of course. But those waves aren’t that much different than what we hear as sound. Some kinds of waves produced by earthquakes have even been known to generate sounds that people can hear before the ground starts to shake beneath them. And, along the way, their instruments also pick up the relatively small vibrations of very loud machines, including the spinning blades of wind turbines and hydroelectric dams.
Marcillo is trying to map these sources of small seismic signals in order to help other scientists track very small earthquakes that could help predict big, dangerous natural disasters. Right now, it’s hard to tell what’s a baby quake and what’s people being loud. “If you can understand the background noise, then you can better detect a signal,” he said.
To do that, Marcillo and his team used data collected over a decade by the U.S. National Seismic Network — 100 stations that track the movement of the ground all over the country. They combined that data with information about nearby industries to start figuring out which noises were likely human-made. “We’d have operational data telling me a wind farm started up, and I could see a signal emerging in the data within a couple months,” he said.
The result is a map that shows some big regional differences in seismic noise, with the wind-heavy Plains states showing up as “loudest.”
But if what you’re measuring is infrasound, it’s Nevada causing a racket. Infrasound travels through the air, just like the stuff we can hear does, but in this case, the molecular jiggles and vibrations are happening too slowly for our eardrums to convert them into information our brains understand. Infrasound can travel long distances and is often the unheard ripples set off by an audible sound that happened far, far away.
Back in 2011 , Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers Catherine De Groot-Hedlin and Michael Hedlin, who are married, mapped infrasound across the country by adding infrasound sensors to 400 existing seismic detection stations that are part of the USArray , a continent-wide seismic observatory. Their analysis spotted mining blasts, rocket launches and other sharp spikes in infrasound activity. They weren’t able to pick up the constant hum of a wind farm, De Groot-Hedlin said, but they could see daily upticks that coincided with working hours at mines. “You can see lunchtime [in the data],” she said.
In their data, it’s Western states like Nevada, Utah and Idaho that turn up loudest, probably the result of nearby military facilities.
Like Marcillo’s map, the map created by deGroot-Hedlin and her husband is meant as a jumping off point for further research: a sort of catalog of sound. The idea is that other scientists can refer back to their research later, to figure out why they’re getting a weird reading, to better understand atmospheric phenomena that also affect how infrasound travels, or to better understand how infrasound itself might affect things like bird migration.
In both cases, the map is less about where the loudest place is and more about how it got that way — i.e., people and the stuff we do. Turns out, to understand the world around us, we sometimes have to tune ourselves out first.

Sick Of 2020 Already? Most Voters Aren’t. | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,msn.com,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sick-of-2020-already-most-voters-arent/,"PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY FIVETHIRTYEIGHT / GETTY IMAGES
Welcome to Pollapalooza , our weekly polling roundup. Poll of the week
Democrats have lost their edge in voter enthusiasm, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out this week. When asked how interested they were in the 2020 elections on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the most interested), 73 percent of Democratic registered voters and 75 percent of Republican registered voters responded with a 9 or a 10.
At first glance, this doesn’t look good for Democrats. We don’t know what the difference in enthusiasm was between Democrats and Republicans at this point in the 2018 cycle, but in December 2017 (the earliest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll we could find that asked the question for that cycle), Democrats had a clear advantage. At that time, 59 percent of Democratic voters rated their interest in the 2018 elections as a 9 or 10, compared with just 49 percent of Republican voters who did.
But this might not be as good a sign for Republicans as it seems. And that’s because the enthusiasm gap practically disappeared by the time the 2018 elections rolled around. When NBC News/Wall Street Journal asked the same question in September 2018 — just a month and a half before the elections — 65 percent of Democratic registered voters reported high interest in the elections, but so did 61 percent of Republican registered voters. In other words, there is plenty of time for the 2020 numbers to change. And, of course, the blue wave washed ashore in 2018 just the same — Democrats picked up 40 House seats and won the national popular vote by 8.6 percentage points.
To me, the real takeaway from this poll question is not the enthusiasm gap between the parties, but the high level of voter interest overall at this point in the cycle. Voters are currently more interested in the presidential election than they were at this point in the 2016 cycle. In the most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 69 percent of registered voters said their interest in the 2020 election was a 9 or a 10; in April 2015 , that number was 60 percent. The share of voters who are very interested in the upcoming election is roughly similar to the share who told the pollster that they were very interested throughout 2016, much closer to the vote than we are now:
We couldn’t find any NBC News/Wall Street Journal polls that asked the enthusiasm question at this point in the 2008 or 2012 election cycles, but the share of voters who are highly interested in the 2020 election now exceeds or matches the share of highly interested voters in every NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from January through August 2012. 1 As for 2008, the share of voters with a lot of interest in the presidential election was consistently higher that year than it is now — but it wouldn’t take that much of an increase for 2020 to be in 2008’s ballpark.
It’s not just the NBC News/Wall Street Journal polls that show voters are amped up; other polling backs up the theory that voters are particularly enthusiastic about this cycle.
Last month, for instance, Fox News found that 52 percent of registered voters were “extremely” interested in the 2020 election. In July 2015 — the earliest Fox News poll asking this question that we could find for the 2016 cycle — just 31 percent of voters were “extremely” interested in the presidential election; in September 2011, the earliest Fox News poll we have in the 2012 cycle, 32 percent were “extremely” interested in the presidential election. In fact, “extremely” high interest in the 2012 and 2016 cycles did not hit 52 percent in the Fox News poll until the month before the election.
And according to a CNN poll from late April , 74 percent of registered voters reported being “extremely” or “very” enthusiastic about voting for president in next year’s election. That beats out the numbers from the earliest CNN polls we could find for the 2016, 2012 and 2008 elections, all of which were taken at around this point in the cycle. In CNN’s July 2015 poll, 48 percent said they were “extremely” or “very” enthusiastic; in March 2011, 58 percent said it; and in June 2007, 54 percent said it. Indeed, that 74 percent was the highest such number CNN has recorded since 2003 — at any point in the election cycle!
Of course, it’s still early, and we don’t know how these voter enthusiasm numbers will change — whether they will increase or whether one party’s numbers will diverge from the other’s. But there is at least a chance that 2020 could blow away all other recent elections for voter enthusiasm. Other polling bites After Attorney General William Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week about special counsel Robert Mueller’s report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, several pollsters asked about Barr’s popularity. According to HarrisX , 28 percent of registered voters said they viewed him favorably, while 32 percent said they viewed him unfavorably. According to Morning Consult , 22 percent of registered voters said they had a favorable opinion of him, and 34 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion. And according to YouGov , 33 percent of registered voters said they had a favorable opinion, and 43 percent said they had an unfavorable one. That might validate Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats’ decision to go after Barr , although it’s worth noting that a sizable chunk of voters in all three polls did not know enough about Barr to form an opinion. On Oct. 12, Louisiana will hold the first round of voting (an all-party primary) in its 2019 gubernatorial election. According to a new poll by JMC Analytics and Polling , if that election were held today, incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards would receive 38 percent of the vote, Republican U.S. Rep. Ralph Abraham would receive 23 percent and Republican businessman Eddie Rispone would receive 7 percent. Thirty-two percent of voters said they were undecided. If no one receives a majority of the vote, the race will advance to a Nov. 16 runoff. According to JMC, Edwards leads a hypothetical runoff with Abraham 40 percent to 36 percent. (Edwards is a pretty popular governor for a Democrat in a pretty red state, according to our Popularity Above Replacement Governor scores .) On Monday, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would refuse to provide President Trump’s tax returns to Congress. According to a YouGov poll conducted the next day, 46 percent of Americans said they think the Treasury should not be allowed to do that; 31 percent said it should. The Pew Research Center is out with a new survey that shines a light on the technology gap by income. More than 90 percent of all Americans with household incomes of at least $100,000 a year have a smartphone, desktop or laptop computer and broadband internet access. But among Americans with annual household incomes of less than $30,000, 71 percent have a smartphone, 54 percent have a desktop or laptop computer and 56 percent have broadband internet access at home. If you’re a fan of both our election forecasts and European politics, check out Politico Europe’s seat projections for the May 23-26 European Parliament elections. Euroskeptic parties are expected to gain ground in the elections, which could give them significant influence in the parliament. Trump approval
According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker , 42.4 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.7 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -10.3 points). At this time last week , 41.8 percent approved and 53.1 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -11.3 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 42.0 percent and a disapproval rating of 52.7 percent, for a net approval rating of -10.7 points.

There are two types: Riddler Express for those of you who want something bite-size and Riddler Classic for those of you in the slow-puzzle movement. Submit a correct answer for either, 1 and you may get a shoutout in next week’s column. If you need a hint or have a favorite puzzle collecting dust in your attic, find me on Twitter .

From Scott O’Neil, unriddle this sequence:
What number comes next? Riddler Classic
From Steven Pratt, where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? To Riddler Nation, perhaps:
Five brothers join the Riddler Baseball Independent Society, or RBIs. Each of them enjoys a lengthy career of 20 seasons, with 160 games per season and four plate appearances per game. (To make this simple, assume each plate appearance results in a hit or an out, so there are no sac flies or walks to complicate this math.)
Given that their batting averages are .200, .250, .300, .350 and .400, what are each brother’s chances of beating DiMaggio’s 56-game hitting streak at some point in his career? (Streaks can span across seasons.)
By the way, their cousin has a .500 average, but he will get tossed from the league after his 10th season when he tests positive for performance enhancers. What are his chances of beating the streak?
Submit your answer Solution to last week’s Riddler Express
Congratulations to 🎖 Alex Murray 🎖 of Philadelphia, winner of last week’s Riddler Express and the new Median Marquess of Riddler Nation!
Last week brought two interactive challenges. In the first, you submitted a whole number between 1 and 1 billion, and whoever submitted the number closest to 2/3 of the mean of all the submitted numbers won.
I received over 2,500 submissions. The mean of all the valid submissions was 163,918,246. Two-thirds of that is 109,278,831 , or nearly 11 percent of the maximum submission. Our winner, Alex Murray, submitted 109,185,185 — off by less than 100,000. That particular number was chosen because, as Alex rather cryptically explained, it was “163,777,777 times two-thirds.” In any case, that worked! Well chosen, Alex.
Here is the distribution of all of the numbers submitted by the Nation, in bins of 10 million. Five of you said you just guessed your phone numbers.
I see you, people who submitted 1 billion. You had no chance of winning, but you did have an effect on everyone else. One such submitter, Zane from Pittsburgh, explained: “I seek chaos.” Another, Will Heath, said that he “just wants to watch the world burn.” Yet another, Emma Cooper, wrote, “I do not intend to be right but I intend to make other people wrong.”
As the benevolent leader of this column I am shocked and appalled. Shocked and appalled , I say!
This challenge is well known in game theory and it is called — also shockingly — guess 2/3 of the average . In this game, there is a unique ( pure strategy ) Nash equilibrium, meaning a set of actions for all the players from which no player would want to deviate. We … did not achieve it.
To achieve equilibrium, each player would submit the lowest possible number, and everyone would then share in the prize. Why? You can arrive at this result through a process known as the iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. For example, no player would want to submit a number above 666,666,666, because that’s 2/3 of the highest possible submission, which means 2/3 of the average submission cannot possibly be higher than that. Given that , no player would want to submit a number above 444,444,444 (2/3 of 666,666,666), and then no number above 296,296,296, and so on. Eventually, by this iterative logic, the only submission that makes any strategic sense is 1.
Therefore, I’m proud to share our new slogan. Riddler Nation: Out of Equilibrium Since 2015 . Solution to last week’s Riddler Classic
Congratulations to 👑 Vince Vatter 👑 of Gainesville, Florida, winner of last week’s Riddler Classic and the reigning king of Riddler Nation!
Last week also brought the third installment of the Riddler Nation Battle Royale. These were the rules: In a distant, war-torn land there were 10 castles. There were two warlords: you and your archenemy. Each castle had its own strategic value for a would-be conqueror. Specifically, the castles were worth 1, 2, 3, …, 9 and 10 victory points. You and your enemy each had 100 soldiers to distribute, in any way you like, to fight at any of the 10 castles. Whoever sent more soldiers to a given castle conquered that castle and won its victory points. (If you each sent the same number of troops, you split the points.) You didn’t know the distribution of the enemy forces until the battles began. Whoever won the most points won the war.
You submitted a plan distributing your 100 soldiers among the 10 castles. I took all these battle plans and adjudicated all the possible one-on-one matchups.
I received nearly 1,500 battle plans, nearly 1,200 of which were valid — i.e., they only used 100 soldiers and only whole numbers of soldiers and so forth. And without further ado, here were the top performers: Riddler Nation’s top 5 warlords Castle"
Here’s How The Democrats Will Limit The Debate Field If Too Many People Qualify | FiveThirtyEight,fivethirtyeight.com,Geoffrey Skelley,05-10-2019,2019,5,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-how-the-democrats-will-limit-the-debate-field-if-too-many-people-qualify/,"Seth Moulton For candidates deemed “major” by FiveThirtyEight. To qualify via polling, a candidate must reach 1 percent in at least three national or early-state polls from qualifying polling organizations. To qualify via donors, a candidate must have at least 65,000 unique donors with at least 200 donors in at least 20 states. Information released by campaigns is used to determine whether a candidate has hit the donor threshold. If a campaign reached 65,000 donors but did not say whether it had at least 200 donors in 20 states, we assumed that it had met the latter requirement as well. Candidates will have to prove to the DNC that they have met the donor requirements. Sources: Polls, Media reports
If fewer than 20 candidates meet both standards but more than 20 qualify via the polling method, those who meet both criteria would qualify first and the remaining spots would be filled by those with the highest polling average. To calculate this, the DNC is planning to average the top three survey results for each candidate, 2 rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point. That is, the tiebreaker will be calculated using the polls where a candidate performed best, not necessarily the most recent polls. If that average results in a tie for the last spot(s) on the stage, the tied candidates will be ranked by the total number of qualifying polls they submitted to the DNC.
However, if fewer than 20 candidates hit both qualifying criteria and fewer than 20 qualify via the polling method, the DNC and its media partners (NBC and Telemundo in June and CNN in July) would first invite all candidates who reach both the polling and donor thresholds and then any others who meet the polling requirement. After that, the remaining debate slots would be filled by those who have the highest number of unique donors.
As things stand, our research shows that 17 candidates have qualified via the polling threshold, which requires candidates to earn at least 1 percent of the vote in three national or early-primary-state polls conducted by qualifying pollsters since the start of 2019. 3 So if three more people hit this mark, no candidate will qualify based solely on having met the fundraising threshold. This could be a challenge for Williamson, who has built her campaign largely on grassroots support — she’s the only candidate so far who has qualified on fundraising alone. On Thursday, she announced that she had met the DNC’s fundraising criteria by receiving donations from at least 65,000 unique donors, including at least 200 individual donors in at least 20 states, 4 but she has earned 1 percent of the vote in just one qualifying survey .
But Williamson is not the only contender who may wind up on the bubble. Two other candidates have not hit either threshold: Sen. Michael Bennet has earned 1 percent support in only one survey , and Rep. Seth Moulton has yet to hit that mark in any qualifying poll. Neither campaign has reported hitting the 65,000-donor threshold either. In fact, a total of eight candidates considered “major” by FiveThirtyEight’s standards haven’t met the donor threshold, so it remains to be seen if 20 people can meet both criteria. If not, the final debate participants will be decided by the polling average.
With so many candidates hovering around 1 percent or so in the polls, a few tenths of a percentage point could make or break a candidate’s chances of qualifying. The debates give candidates a vital chance to distinguish themselves in a crowded field, so these narrow margins could decide who still has any shot at winning the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Footnotes
The debates will include up to 10 people on stage over a two-night period.
Based on national or early-state polls and using the pollster’s top-line number, whether or not that number is rounded or has decimal places.
The DNC accepts national surveys and polls of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. A candidate’s three polls must be conducted by different pollsters or, if done by the same pollster, must cover different places.
In assessing who has met the fundraising threshold, we rely on self-reported figures from the campaigns, and we’ve assumed that candidates who’ve reported having at least 65,000 donors also have at least 200 donors from each of 20 states, though it’s possible that some of them haven’t hit that mark yet.

Steph Curry finally came alive in the second half of Game 6. Bob Levey / Getty Images
Playing without injured star Kevin Durant and working with what appeared to be a rapidly thinning bench , you might have figured the Golden State Warriors would be in deep trouble if they saw a half in which Stephen Curry went scoreless on 0-of-5 shooting. After all, while the Warriors entered Game 6 having compiled a 29-4 record in games when Durant sat and Curry played, those games involved Curry averaging 27.8 points.
But instead of finding themselves in trouble on Friday, the Warriors found themselves headed to the locker room at halftime tied with the Houston Rockets. They earned that halftime deadlock behind both a 3-point explosion from Klay Thompson and timely contributions from several of the same players who had seen their performances maligned earlier in the series. Then, Steph poured in 33 second-half points — including a career-high 23 in the fourth quarter — to send the Rockets home and the Warriors back to the Western Conference finals for the fifth consecutive season.
Thompson knocked down five threes during that first half , pouring in 21 of the Warriors’ 57 points. He scored only six points after the break, but the early burst was key in allowing his team to survive Curry’s frigid shooting. Not that this was anything out of the ordinary for Thompson — he has become something of a Game 6 specialist over the past several years, knocking down in excess of 52 percent of his 3-point tries in the Warriors’ seven Game 6s during the Steve Kerr era. This victory also pushed the Warriors’ record during that time to an incredible 95-9 (and 18-3 in the playoffs) in games when Thompson makes five or more shots from beyond the arc .
Thompson was not alone in buoying the Warriors while Curry struggled. Golden State’s bench players had been absolutely dreadful during this series, but in the first half of Game 6, Shaun Livingston, Kevon Looney, Quinn Cook, Jordan Bell, Jonas Jerebko, Andrew Bogut and Alfonzo McKinnie actually came to play. That group of seven players combined for 20 points prior to halftime — more than they had collectively scored during any of the previous five games in this series.
Livingston finished the game with 11 points, marking just the fifth time all season he cracked double digits and the first time since the middle of January. Looney hammered the Rockets on the offensive glass, collecting 16.7 percent of available offensive boards while he was on the floor — a rate that would rank among the best in the league if he sustained it over a full season. His 14 points also marked the second-highest total of his playoff career , and Friday was only the third time he’s reached double digits during a postseason game. Cook didn’t score in the second half, but he dished out two extremely timely assists before the break and, late in the third quarter, set up Curry’s first 3-pointer of the game .
The Warriors also got incredibly valuable contributions from Andre Iguodala, who should somehow find a way to include the tape of this game on his application to the Basketball Hall of Fame, if such a thing is possible. Iguodala not only finished with 17 points, but he also knocked down five threes for the first time in six years . His most valuable contributions, though, came on defense, where he hounded James Harden into an 11-for-25 shooting line and came away with a steal on four of Harden’s five live-ball turnovers, including one that essentially sealed the game late in the fourth quarter. Iguodala was Golden State’s preferred defender on Harden throughout the series, 1 and Game 6 was an object lesson in why.
Of course, all of those players’ contributions were merely the preamble to Chef Curry getting cooking in the second half. After going scoreless during the first half for the first time in 102 career playoff games, Steph had the most explosive second half of not just his own playoff career but of any player who had gone scoreless before halftime in the past 20 postseasons . Seemingly out of rhythm for most of the night, Curry didn’t really get going until he knocked down one of his classic relocation threes late in the third period. His next shot rimmed out, and a three-quarter-court heave at the end of the quarter came up just short, but he spent most of the rest of the game looking like the Stephen Curry we’ve come to know once he knocked down that corner three.
That Stephen Curry is a killer, and he absolutely killed the Rockets in the fourth quarter, racking up 23 points while shooting 6 of 8 from the field, 3 of 5 from three and 8 of 8 from the line.
Mostly, he shredded the Rockets out of the pick and roll. The Warriors had run a Curry-Draymond Green pick and roll 58 times during the first five games of the series, per Second Spectrum tracking data, for an average of 11.6 per game. They ran that action 10 times during the fourth quarter of Game 6 alone, and those plays resulted in 20 Warriors points, 15 of them from Curry himself. Driving layups, scoop floaters, step-back threes, hitting Green on the short roll so that he could make a 4-on-3 play coming downhill — Curry showed off the entire ball-screen repertoire down the stretch, and the Rockets simply had no answers for him. https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/qwk22.mp4
Very few teams have had answers for Curry over the years, though the Rockets did hound him into some of his very worst playoff basketball ever during this series. Steph struggled in Games 1 and 2, but the Warriors still came out on top thanks largely to the brilliance of Durant and the under-heralded contributions of Green and Iguodala. Houston rebounded to tie the series by winning the next two games at home while Curry continued misfiring, but in both Game 5 and Game 6, the Rockets squandered opportunities to take advantage of his continued struggles until it was too late, and he managed to get going again. And when Curry gets going like that, the Warriors are near impossible to beat .
