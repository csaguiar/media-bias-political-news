My dying grandfather has confessed to a string of affairs and a love child | Life and style,www.theguardian.com,Malinche15,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/12/dying-grandfather-affairs-love-child-annalisa-barbieri#128028685,"This story really isn't so uncommon. My mother forgave my father for a very similar story. So my sister and I did not judge. Twenty one years after his death I am researching his father whom he followed here from middle Europe to save his skin. Understanding the terrible tragedies the family endured made me understand why my father had to live life in the fast lane. It didn't mean he didn't love my mother, nor my sister and me. He adored all of us and did the best he could for us."

Your grandfather felt the need to unburden himself and he clearly trusted you enough to be able to confess his past indiscretions. We're all only human. It's not for us to judge someone else's behaviour, and it's not because he had affairs that someone else will. Be happy that you allowed a dying man to find some peace, and don't judge him too harshly - remember the good times."

Both my parents and stepparents conducted extensive affairs when I was a child (in front of me and using me as a decoy on occasion). It destroyed my idea of what a relationship could be and made it impossible for me to trust.
Lots has changed for the OP. Don't diminish it.

And that wasn't his only misdemeanour. And an aunt turns out to be a cousin. But they're all great in their own way, and am I really perfect?"

Brexit has stalled for a very good reason, a vast number of people in this great United Kingdom have serious doubts about leaving a European Union that has served the business interests of this country very well indeed and even more importantly ensured that the Human Rights and Social Welfare of millions across our wonderful nation are upheld.

Whatever deal the UK gets upon Brexit it isn't going to be anything like the deal it had inside the tent. Add to that the rest of the world now knows how deeply divided the country is and how weak the negotiating teams are. And how ineffectual and indecisive the government is, ditto its leadership.
The UK has never and will never be destroyed from the outside. If it falters and you lose your freedoms, it will be because you destroyed yourselves.
Therefore I hold that the UK should be a firm believer in its people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to form rational solutions in a national crisis. The great point is to bring them the real facts, and beer."

Democrats condemn Trump plan to send migrants to sanctuary cities as 'cruelty' | US news | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Amanda Holpuch,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/12/trump-migrants-sanctuary-cities-release,"President also criticized over reports he urged CBP chief to close Mexico border, offering a pardon if he broke the law. Democrats have accused Donald Trump’s administration of “cruelty” and using people as political pawns in the wake of reports that presidential aides considered a plan to release migrants in sanctuary cities.
At least twice in the past six months, the White House weighed a plan to pressure US immigration authorities to release people detained at the border in these cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to the Washington Post .
White House considered releasing detained migrants in sanctuary cities – report Read more
Trump confirmed that his White House was considering such a plan on Friday afternoon, contradicting his own Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which told reporters it had rejected the plan.
Trump tweeted: “Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only.... The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders, Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!”
In an earlier statement, DHS said: “This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.”
Democrats said the proposal was another example of the Trump administration’s extreme measures to curb legal and illegal immigration.
They also highlighted that viewing such a move as punishment was unusual, since it would affect cities that already welcome more immigrants than the rest of the country, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City.
“It takes a truly warped mind to think that releasing families who sought asylum at the border in Sanctuary Cities would be a ‘punishment’,” said New York City’s comptroller, Scott Stringer, on Twitter . “These families are just seeking a better life, and Sanctuary Cities exist because we *want them here*.”
Trump also faced criticism over fresh reports that he had urged his soon-to-be acting homeland security secretary to close the southern border, and said that he would pardon the official if he were to run afoul of the law.
Two people familiar with the private conversation told the Associated Press the conversation with Kevin McAleenan, then the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, came during the president’s trip last week to Calexico, California.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss what was said.
It was not clear whether the president was joking or why McAleenan would find himself in personal legal jeopardy. But the comments came just a day after Trump told reporters that he was delaying his threat to close the border because Mexico appeared to be stepping up its efforts.
“At no time has the president indicated, asked, directed or pressured the acting secretary to do anything illegal,” a DHS spokesman said.
US immigration police broke Facebook rules with fake profiles for college sting Read more
The government has said the US-Mexico border is at a “breaking point” because of the crowds of Central American families seeking asylum there, though its policies have so far focused on deterrence, instead of responding to the factors driving people to flee Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador .
“The cruelty of this administration never seems to end,” said Julián Castro, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president ahead of the 2020 election.
Speaking at a CNN town hall event on Thursday night, Castro compared the sanctuary cities proposal to family separation, which failed to deter people from coming to the border.
“Now they are talking about bussing families to particular cities to target political opponents,” Castro said. “These folks want us to choose cruelty as a weapon against people and against political opponents.”
Another Democratic presidential hopeful, Amy Klobuchar, said Trump was “literally using human beings as pawns in a political game”.
“Instead of passing comprehensive immigration reform he does this: White House proposed releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities, targeting political foes,” Klobuchar said on Twitter.
In January 2017, the Trump administration instructed the US attorney general to withhold funding for sanctuary cities, but the decision was quickly challenged in court. In November 2018 , a federal judge ruled the crackdown was unconstitutional.

I enjoy Marinas articles but I know I’m going to get hammered now for saying this, but having worked for many years on building sites, surrounded by my Sun reading working class comrades, I can’t help feeling that the liberal left for years really failed to address genuine concerns about immigration and other issues held by many people and simply maligned them as racist xenophobes.
I think the left can also take some responsibility for the current mess we are in and the lurch to the right of some of the electorate and there political parties, as people that have felt ignored, ridiculed and even persecuted will naturally become more tribal and extreme and relish any opportunity to lash back at those they perceived to have wronged them.
