"Trump 2020: Election News, Polls for President, Fundraising, Campaign, Opponents, Results & More - POLITICO",www.politico.com,Maggie Severns,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/news/trump-2020-presidential-election,"By NOLAN D. MCCASKILL 04/10/2019 11:59 AM EDT
Julián Castro hasn’t released his first-quarter fundraising numbers. He’s polling around 1 percent nationally and in early states. But he has a unique opportunity for a presidential primary breakout moment Wednesday, when he’ll hold a rally in his San Antonio hometown — the same day Donald Trump will be in Texas for fundraisers in Houston and San Antonio.
The split-screen moment worked wonders for former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) in February, when he staged a counter-rally to Trump’s own MAGA rally in El Paso. Aside from the national media coverage of the dueling events, O’Rourke received a windfall of attention from Democrats for raising the president’s ire — Trump derided him as “a young man who’s got very little going for himself except he’s got a great first name.” "

Because the women they've run or are in contention are as bad or worse than the men we've had. I'm all for a woman but if the DNC is going to run criminal idiots for the job, there's no advantage in supporting a woman. The idea is to get an improvement in the quality of the candidates, not run riff raff in a dress. I think a lot of women feel the same way. We don't care about the gender as long as they're honest, competent, and will represent U.S. Citizens instead of fill in the blank (Mexico, illegal aliens, oil companies, the new world order, global corporations, pedophiles, organized crime, absurdity, criminal idiots, self-destruction, bankruptcy, Israel, the .01 percent, spy agencies, a police state, anybody or anything besides the People). In other words, we want somebody that will do the job correctly and according to the Constitution and in the best interest of the People. It's really not that complicated. Maybe the political parties don't get it because they can't make a fortune off the People if they do their jobs correctly and they can't stand the thought of giving up all that graft. The solution is to get rid of the political parties before they get rid of us."

But Barack Obama proved that a really strong candidate can win, no matter what. He beat a really good, strong Republican in Romney. Biden and Sanders is leading because of name recognition.

Trump won almost solely on white male priviledge (he would not have won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, or Michigan were it not for support from the white racist working class voters). Had he been running against, say, Martin O'Malley, President Trump would have lost. But because he was running against a women, the white racist working class broke for him in key states. The way to combat this is not to take the Biden route of trying to bring the white racist working class voters of the rust belt back into the fold, but rather to try to increase minority and suburban professional female voter turnout, which could be enough to (narrowly) tip Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania back to the blue column. Racism and misogny is real, and the Rethuglicans are creating victory after victory by appealing to the white racist working class. Dems need to respond by getting out their own base, not by putting in racist misogoynists of their own like Biden (and yes, Biden is a TOTAL racist - opposed busing in the 70's, spoke at the time in favor of segregation or at least heavily implied it, later on crucified Anita Hill, and more recently in 2008 referred to then-Senator Obama as ""clean"", implying African-Americans as a whole didn't shower often or some such nonsense, it goes on)."

Sexism is a huge problem, including in politics and government. But, with respect to the performance of Democratic primary candidates, the article confuses correlation with causation. Just because a voter’s favorite candidate is a male does not mean that he’s the favorite BECAUSE he’s a male or because the voter thinks others aren’t ready for a female. That’s not giving voters nearly enough credit and feeds the antipathy toward condescension that causes democrats to lose despite their policies often being the most advantageous to the voters at issue. And, no, the fact that extremist Trump supporters chanted “lock her up,” does not evidence any problem “unique to women”! Those extremists also simultaneously and erroneously want to “lock up” (and chant as much) a material subset of the white MALES in the FBI and the “deep state” solely for having the audacity even to deign to investigate foreign electoral meddling and their tyrannical demagogue’s connections. Further, the notion that a material population supports the first openly gay major party candidate due to their misogyny and sexism — as opposed to being due to his policies, beliefs and historic role — is, well, to use the author’s allegation in the article’s title, just stupid. It’s frustrating and wrong for women to be forced to face sexist attitudes and misconduct; perpetrators of discrimination and traffickers in chauvinism should be held to account. But, like any other single lens to look at life through at the exclusion of others, it is a form of blinder that distorts important realities, including those associated with this election."

Misogyny is the hatred of women, and there are some who are truly like that but there are likely psychological issues involved. Sexism is a legitimate word to use for there are likely many who do not hate women but do no think they are ""built"" for executive leadership. And there may be a statistical slant in that direction for it seems that throughout history women have been noted more for nurturing leadership than the more aggressive leadership most people associate with the presidency. But, in the last election, I did not vote for Trump or any of the men in the primaries for they embarrassed me with their childishness or did not seem to have executive personality (e.g. the pediatric surgeon). I voted for Fiorina, the only one who acted like a grown-up. I have no aversion to female leaders. What I did notice is that in the one or two primary debates that I saw, THE PRESS virtually ignored Fiorina. Maybe they should have ignored Trump. Instead, they virtually handed him the presidency. Of course, virtually all the press was in the bag for Clinton and they could not allow for another woman to be taken seriously."

It's not about likeability. It's not about how pretty they are or what kind of haircut they have, what their arms look like in a sleeveless dress, or whether or not they are wearing designer outfits. It's about ABILITY. It's about quality. It's about their proposals, their goals, their voting records. It should be about their intelligence. Let's face it - when a man gets up on a podium the media never comments about how he looks, how his tone is ""off-putting"" or speculates about his stamina. He can say the most outrageous things, indulge in lies and explicit name calling, rant and whine and the media will cover his every word and every move and they'll opine endlessly - giving him loads and loads of media coverage on a daily basis. You don't see the media giving the women anywhere near that kind of coverage.

Warren is running third in the pols in her own state. But lets not forget, Booker and a bunch of other men also can't get any traction either. Beto is slowly sinking (he's a nut) and Bernie is running on the fumes of 2016. The DNC has had one viable Presidential candidate in 20 years and he served two terms, they've had no one in the Bull Pen since. Hillary was the best they could do, she was a joke."
