These chicken kabobs will be your new go-to recipe for BBQ season,www.nbcnews.com,Brianna Steinhilber,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/these-chicken-kabobs-will-be-your-new-go-recipe-bbq-ncna1009366,"Kabobs may just be the perfect summer party food. They're easy to munch while holding a cocktail and mingling with friends, stress-free for the host to prep and serve, and they leave no dirty plates or utensils to clean up afterwards. Even better, you can please vegetarians and meat lovers alike without having to make two separate entrees. The secret to a juicy, flavor-packed kabob is all in the marinade, which is prepped a day before, meaning less to do the day of a gathering. If you still haven’t found one that does the trick, don’t worry. This recipe from Andrea Correale, celebrity caterer and Founder of Elegant Affairs, is perfect for feeding a crowd in your own backyard or bringing along to a Memorial Day party this year.
“If you are using wood skewers make sure you soak them overnight first before putting the meat and veggies on them. Also make sure they are 12” skewers,” says Correale. “In order to get a good flavor, soak the meat and veggies for 24 hours before skewering.""
She also suggests using chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat for the most tender kabobs, and recommends always cooking them at about 350 degrees or medium heat. (If using a thermometer, meat should be 165 degrees.)
While the kabobs themselves are packed with flavor, Correale likes to serve them up with a few different dipping sauces as well, which makes the spread even more fun by letting your guests customize their meal with an extra pop of flavor. Some of her favorite pairings include:
Chimichurri Chipotle aioli Basil aioli Basil pesto Sundried tomato pesto Red pepper relish Lemon thyme vinaigrette Hoisin or an Asian style sauce How to throw a better summer BBQ July 3, 2018 04:12 And what about the rest of the spread? Correale serves her kabobs with grilled corn, corn salad or street corn, a potato salad or a farro or quinoa salad — or all three if you’re putting out a spread for a backyard party this season!
Now for the recipe. Simply toss all the ingredients together and add cubed chicken and/or veggies the night before, and you’ll be ready to thread on skewers and fire up the grill to feed your Memorial Day crowd.

How to hold on to the adult friends you value — and let go of the ones you don't,www.nbcnews.com,Janice McCabe,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/how-hold-adult-friends-you-value-let-go-ones-you-ncna1010526,"While college graduates are thrilled to let go of their student loans , they’re less willing to jettison the friendships they’ve made over the course of their collegiate journey. Sadly, despite their determination, they, like a lot of us, will probably fail (at least in part). But there are some things we can all do to not just keep our adult friends, but to strengthen them. In this transition to after-college attachments, one thing to consider is that proximity drives a lot of relationships. One of the earliest network studies of college students found that people are more likely to be friends with their roommates and neighbors than they are to those who live farther away. Other studies have confirmed this finding, showing why it is that we’re more likely to be friends with our co-workers , for example. It’s such a strong tendency that network researchers have named it “propinquity.”
In this transition to after-college attachments, one thing to consider is that proximity drives a lot of relationships.
The physical closeness of college not surprisingly leads people to befriend those whose paths they cross due to social or academic pursuits. It also makes it easier to maintain these friendships. This means, however, that when friends part ways at graduation, propinquity now works against rather than for keeping that connection.
 for the THINK newsletter to get weekly updates on pop culture news and analysis But that doesn’t mean that adulthood — and the necessary geographic and professional upheaval that accompanies it — is a friendship killer. Based on the 15 years I’ve spent talking with young adults about their relationships, I’ve found that the people who maintain strong bonds do a few simple things.
The first is to affirm the people with whom you have meaningful connections. To do this yourself, start by thinking about your closest friends. Perhaps even list them. Think about the last time you had a significant connection with each of them. Think about what you value in each of them. One way friends can be meaningful is in providing social support, protecting us from stress and bolstering our mental and even physical health. As I discuss in my book “Connecting in College,” friends also can help us succeed academically . In short, our friends can (but do not necessarily) make us happier and healthier.
Start by thinking about your closest friends. Perhaps even list them. Think about the last time you had a significant connection with each of them.
It’s easy to forget that keeping friends takes work. It may seem simple, but simply spending time together — in person, on the phone, or even on social media — is incredibly important. If you have just one group of friends, this is less challenging than if you have multiple groups of friends — or if your friendships are mostly one-on-one.
But each meaningful connection should get some special attention. Mentally mark which friends and friendship groups are especially meaningful to you and prioritize connecting with them. Even a five-minute check in, a 15-minute walk, or a 30-minute coffee break can help to maintain that connection. Once in a while, spend an evening or weekend together.
Sometimes, though, and despite our best efforts, friendships do fail. In my interviews, I expected to hear stories of dramatic breakups. More often, I was told friendships ended because no one was actively working on developing them; they just faded away. At times my interviewees regretted losing this friend, particularly when it had been meaningful in the past. Overwhelmingly, however, they expressed relief as they were freed from the demands of an unrewarding relationship.
Can ending a friendship be worse than a breakup? Nov. 27, 2018 05:32 This is perhaps the most surprising thing I’ve learned while studying friendship: It’s OK to let people go. Some friendships are just not meaningful and there are times when it is useful to say goodbye. It’s a scary concept. We tend to think the more friends we have the better off we are. Professionally, we are told “to network” and to keep these ties just in case they are helpful in the future. Online it’s even worse, as social media allows us to essentially collect friends, likes, shares and followers without any real substance or thoughtfulness. It’s no wonder we feel like a personal failure when a friendship ends. But we need to fight against this kind of cultural messaging.
Because change is not always bad, as I explained above. It’s also not unusual. For example, in my previous research, I have found that 25 percent of friendships remained over a 5-year period , which means that 75 percent did not. Similarly, other research on young adults finds that 20 percent of friendships remained over a 10-year period . While these numbers may make you feel hesitant to invest heavily in platonic relationships, it shouldn’t.
Whether in college or many years removed from it, May is as good a month as any to take stock of your personal life. If you’re satisfied with what you have, make sure to affirm your existing friendships. If not, consider letting one or two of them fade away. Although it won’t increase your Facebook “likes,” it will probably help you keep the relationships that matter.

By Associated Press JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing the possibility of having to fight a second election this year, as he struggles to form a coalition government. With a looming deadline, Israel’s newly elected parliament began drafting a bill on Monday to dissolve itself. If the bill passes, Israel would be in unchartered waters — sending the political system into disarray with a second snap election in just a matter of months. Netanyahu appeared to have a clear path to a majority coalition, and fifth term in office overall, after the April 9 elections. His Likud party secured 35 seats, tying it for the largest party in the highly fractured 120-seat parliament. Counting his traditional allies, Netanyahu appeared to control a solid 65-55 majority. But his prospective coalition has been thrown into crisis in recent days by former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, an ally and sometimes rival of Netanyahu’s. Lieberman has insisted on passing a new law mandating that young ultra-Orthodox men be drafted into the military, like most other Jewish males. Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox allies demand that the exemptions remain in place. Without the five seats of Lieberman’s Yisrael Beiteinu party, Netanyahu cannot muster a majority. “The draft law has become a symbol and we will not capitulate on our symbols,” Lieberman said at a combative press conference, vowing to press for new elections if his demands are not met. President Donald Trump tweeted on Monday that he hope things would work out for Netanyahu. Hoping things will work out with Israel’s coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2019 Netanyahu’s ruling Likud has traditionally had an alliance with ultra-Orthodox and nationalist parties. But Lieberman, a former top Netanyahu aide, is a wild card. Though stanchly nationalist, he also champions a secular agenda aimed toward his political base of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Likud insists Lieberman is motivated by his personal spite for Netanyahu and has launched a vicious campaign against him in recent days. But Lieberman says he is driven by ideology and will not be a hand to religious coercion. “I will not be a partner to a Halachic state,” he said, referring to Jewish law. Ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo, fearing that military service will lead to immersion in secularism. But years of exemptions have generated widespread resentment among the rest of Jewish Israelis. A stalemate on the issue was one of the factors that shortened the term of the previous coalition government, which Lieberman resigned from months before elections were called because he disagreed with its policy toward the Gaza Strip. Dissolving parliament would be a shocking turn of events for Netanyahu, who has led the country for the past decade and appeared to capture a fourth consecutive term in the April election. “We invite Lieberman to join us today and not contribute to the toppling of a right-wing government,” a statement by Likud read. With the 42-day timeline allotted to Netanyahu to sign agreements with his partners and present his new government set to expire late Wednesday, his Likud presented the paperwork to dissolve the parliament. The bill appeared to have a majority but could be pulled at any moment if a compromise is found. The main opposition party, Blue and White, which also controls 35 seats, appealed for a chance to form a coalition. But a parliamentary vote for dissolution would automatically trigger new elections. Blue and White has ruled out any alliance with Netanyahu. If the vote passes, it would mark the first time the scenario had played out in Israel and set the stage for an unprecedented second election in the same calendar year. Polls indicate the results of a new election would not be much different from the last one."

By Alexander Smith LONDON — The dust has settled on the world’s second largest democratic exercise, a continent-wide vote that has left Europe’s political landscape reshaped. Last week, some 373 million citizens across 28 countries took part in elections for the European Parliament, which makes laws that bind the political and economic bloc. The results rolled in on Sunday night. Far-right populists had some wins, but it wasn’t quite the dramatic, widespread surge seen in recent elections at the national and local level across the continent. What is clear is that the mainstream parties from the center-left and center-right hemorrhaged votes, with much of their support going to a fragmented collection of environmentalists and pro-European Union liberals. Here are five key takeaways. 1. The far-right surge never quite came Steve Bannon, the former adviser to President Donald Trump, called for these elections to be a referendum endorsing his right-wing populist vision for Europe. But while there were some victories for this camp, the full-blown tsunami that some predicted failed to materialize. Right-wing populists fell short of expectations in Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark, while Germany’s AfD party made only slight gains. Even in France, where Marine le Pen’s National Rally came first, beating President Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche party, its provisional vote share was down on the last European Parliament elections in 2014. “The big story is that the nationalist populists have not managed to turn this into a referendum on the E.U.,” said Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, a Brussels-based think tank. “People like Bannon have failed.” That said, while the gains might not have been as dramatic as some forecast, the election arguably cemented far-right populism as a European force that isn’t going away soon. Such parties are often anti-migrant, anti-Muslim and anti-E.U., or at least wish to radically reshape the bloc from within. There were clear victories for the right in Poland, Hungary and Italy. “The rules are changing in Europe,” said Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy’s far-right League party which got around 34 percent of the vote there. “A new Europe is born.” Britain’s Brexit Party was also victorious, securing around one-third of the vote and relegating the ruling Conservatives to fifth place at a dismal 9 percent. However, the U.K. should perhaps be seen as a special case due to the country’s protracted and messy attempts to leave the European Union. 2. The collapse of the mainstream For the first time, the traditional center-left and center-right parties will not have a majority in the European Parliament’s 751-seat chamber. The Social Democrats and the European People’s Party, groupings which have dominated for years, lost 39 and 36 seats respectively, according to provisional results. “This is a profound change,” said Janis A. Emmanouilidis, director of studies at the European Policy Centre, another Brussels-based think tank. “The two biggest parties have lost a significant number of seats.” However, voters often use the E.U. elections to give major parties a bloody nose, secure in the knowledge that it will not cause upheaval in their own national parliaments. Even so, Sunday’s results represented a seismic rejection of the traditional ruling parties across the continent. “We are facing a shrinking center of the European Union parliament,” Manfred Weber, chairman of the European People’s Party said. “From now on, those who want to have a strong European Union have to join forces.” The one exception was in Spain, where the Socialists looked set to gain 20 of the country’s 54 seats. The Socialists belong to the wider Social Democrats group, however, for whom the general outlook was far more bleak. “If you lose an election, if you lose seats, you have to be modest,” added Frans Timmermans, the lead candidate for the Social Democrats. “We have lost seats and this means that we have to be humble.” 3. More than Green shoots Riding something of an environmentalist wave washing over Europe, the continent’s Green group made big gains. This was most evident in Germany, where the Greens doubled their provisional vote share to 21 percent and overtook the country’s traditional center-left Social Democrats in the process. In France and Britain, the Greens also did well, placing third and fourth respectively. More subtly, environmental issues were given increased prominence in the manifestos of other parties, too. This shift comes on the back of months of demonstrations demanding action over climate change. In May, the United Nations released a report warning 1 million species of plants and animals were under threat of extinction. “We will work tirelessly. For people. For Europe. For our planet!” the European Greens tweeted . 4. Pro-E.U. liberals make gains Another group that mopped up support from the traditional parties was the pro-Europe, pro-business liberal centrists. Parties allied with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe — known as ALDE — looked set to increase their number of seats from 68 to 109, although this was largely thanks to Macron’s En Marche party joining them. ALDE is led by Guy Verhofstadt, one of the E.U.’s most ardent defenders against populist forces that wish to dismantle or disrupt the union. The boost in support suggests that voters, especially young people, came out to back their side of the argument. “When Europe is threatened, you have seen the youth mobilizing to defend it,” said Torreblanca at the European Council on Foreign Relations. The BBC also reported that turnout in the U.K. surged in areas that supported the country staying in the E.U. in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Britain’s Liberal Democrats came second with 20 percent of the vote. They were one of the parties to explicitly oppose Brexit, and gained huge support in Remain-backing areas, including beating Labour in that party’s erstwhile stronghold of London. 5. Good luck trying to govern now This was the first time in Europe’s history that turnout for these elections has risen, climbing from 43 percent to an encouraging 51 percent. “This is noteworthy,” said Emmanouilidis at the European Policy Centre, calling the leap “remarkably higher.” Yet the results spell a European Parliament that is going to be far more fragmented than it has been in recent years. The two centrist giants bled support and will be unable to form the kind of “grand coalition” that they had before. Instead they might need another coalition partner or two, meaning more compromise and room for disagreement on key issues. Timmermans, of the Social Democrats, has already ruled out attempting to build a coalition with the far-right, calling instead for a “progressive” grouping to be formed. “It will become quite messy,” said Emmanouilidis, describing attempts to find consensus in Brussels “an uphill struggle” at the best of times.

'Nuts! Out of control. Do something!': American robocall outrage,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nuts-out-control-do-something-american-robocall-outrage-n1009351,"Congress 'Nuts! Out of control. Do something!': American robocall outrage The FCC and the FTC receive hundreds of thousands of complaints a month about scam calls. Here's a snapshot. Adrian Lam / NBC News Breaking News Emails May 27, 2019, 5:46 PM UTC By Allan Smith It was 3 a.m. when the phone rang. But it wasn't an emergency — it was a robocall, and it enraged one resident of Marietta, Pennsylvania, enough to fire off a profane complaint to the Federal Communications Commission. ""Someone should shoot these a**holes,"" that robocall recipient wrote. Both the FCC and the Federal Trade Commission receive a mind-boggling number of complaints monthly from Americans who can't stand the growing scourge of scam calls. Last year, the FCC received 232,000 complaints regarding unwanted calls like robocalls and telemarketing offers, while the FTC received more than 3.7 million robocall complaints alone. For both agencies, these complaints are the most frequent ones they receive. Responding to a Freedom of Information Act request from NBC News, the FCC provided roughly 200 lightly redacted complaints — all from May 1 and with the names of the filers redacted — that highlight just how fed up Americans are with the scam calls and how badly they want the government to take action against the perpetrators. Related Politics Lawmakers hit speed dial on legislation to cut down on robocalls One individual from Denver described receiving daily calls from an organization identifying itself as the ""Health Enrollment Center,"" calling from a different number each time. ""DEMAND the FCC do something about this,"" the person wrote. ""It is harassment we are compelled to endure in order to own a phone. DO SOMETHING!"" Both federal agencies and lawmakers are trying . On Thursday, the Senate passed the TRACED Act, 97 to 1. That bill would push major telecom companies to better authenticate calls while also increasing penalties and fines that the FCC can levy for violations. In the House, legislative efforts are underway to combat ""spoofing,"" in which scammers trick a caller ID into believing that a call is coming from the recipient's area code. Technological improvements have allowed for robocallers to target thousands of phones an hour with minimal effort. According to Hiya , a Seattle-based software company, Americans received a total of 26.3 billion robocalls in 2018, a 46 percent increase from 18 billion in 2017. Scams Many of the people who complained to the FCC on May 1 outlined a nationwide scam involving Social Security numbers. According to the complaints, robocallers almost uniformly claimed that the person's Social Security number was suspended and he or she needed to take action to reactivate it. ( Social Security numbers are never suspended .) One person in Burlington, Vermont, wrote that a robocaller left a voicemail saying ""my social security number was in danger of being 'suspended.'"" ""They said I needed to call a 'federal agent' immediately at the above number this needs to be stopped!!"" the Green Mountain State resident added. A New York City resident, meanwhile, wrote to the FCC about a call he received regarding ""a discrepancy in his ConEd charges."" The person called Con Edison, a company that provides electricity, power and steam to New York City and Westchester. The company told the person it would never make such a call. ""Please investigate!"" the city dweller wrote. ""I have for a long time now been on the Do Not Call Registry, thought I suspect spammers ignore it. Again please shut down this illegal operation."" 'Harassment' Other complaints detailed repeated calls. ""This number started calling me early and called every few minutes,"" a Woodbine, Maryland, resident wrote. ""They called about 10 times today. The harassment of telemarketing is out of control, and most every call I receive now till marketing. When will something be done?"" That same person filed another complaint minutes later. ""This is nuts!"" the person wrote. In Bayonne, New Jersey, one person complained about receiving spoofed calls ""every day."" ""Almost always the same voice selling something different,"" the person wrote. ""If the voice is the same, surely the company doing this is the same. Track them down and SHUT THEM DOWN."" Some people went to great lengths to try and protect themselves from future scams, detailing just how problematic the calls can be. ""I am getting phone calls and text messages from people trying to buy my property,"" one person from Tolleson, Arizona, wrote. ""Not only am I getting them, but my family members are being contacted about my property as well. I've removed all of their information from all 3 credit bureaus, I've contacted the Clerks office and County recorders office. I'm not sure where to go from here, but these calls have got to stop. They are harassing me and my family."" Sometimes, there are human beings on the other end of the line, according to the complaints. Someone in Niantic, Connecticut, reported a flood of calls from people claiming to be Microsoft support agents between April 29 and May 1. A resident of Bridgewater, New Jersey, said one would-be scammer became upset when confronted. ""THIS CALL VIOLATED THE “DO NOT CALL” RULES FOR OUR PERSONAL/RESIDENTIAL PHONE NUMBER,"" the person wrote. ""I pressed '1' to speak with a representative and the rep indicated he was from VISA CARD SERVICES."" ""The company name he said he worked for didn’t match the Caller ID and I don’t have a credit card from Chase bank, so I told him that I knew the call was a SCAM, that the call was spoofing another company’s number and to NOT CALL AGAIN,"" the writer added. ""The rep immediately became upset and wanted to argue with me, so I hung up. PLEASE BLOCK THIS SLEAZY CALLING TEAM."" Meanwhile, whether the calls come from humans or robots, many are not well-targeted, as one Lancaster, Pennsylvania, woman revealed. ""I LOVE this one,"" she wrote in her complaint. ""For erectile dysfunction. (I'm a single woman.) Smack my head."" Allan Smith"

American climber dies on descent from summit of Mount Everest,www.nbcnews.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/american-climber-dies-descent-summit-mount-everest-n1010566,"An American climber died on the descent from the summit of Mount Everest on Monday, a Nepalese official said, taking the number of dead or missing mountaineers on the world's highest mountain to eight on the Nepali side during the current climbing season. Christopher John Kulish, 61, scaled the 29,035-foot peak from the normal Southeast Ridge route in the morning but died suddenly after descending from the summit, according to Nepalese tourism department official Mira Acharya.
Most of the deaths on Everest this year have been attributed to exhaustion and tiredness, exacerbated because a crowded route to and from the summit has led to delays. The short climbing season ends this month.
The route, also called the South Col route, was pioneered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepalese Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953.
Safety concerns increase due to overcrowding at Mount Everest May 27, 2019 01:56 About 5,000 people have scaled the Everest summit so far and about 300 have died on its slopes.
Three climbers have also been confirmed dead on the Tibetan side of Mount Everest this climbing season.
A record 381 climbers had been permitted to scale the summit from the Nepali side this season. About 130 others were tackling Everest from the mountain's northern side in Tibet.

Klobuchar: Leave my father out of it,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/meghan-mccain-sen-klobuchar-leave-my-father-out-it-n1010591,"WASHINGTON — Meghan McCain told Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar not to invoke her father, the late Sen. John McCain, on the campaign trail. Klobuchar, D-Minn., recounted a story in Iowa this weekend in which the Sen. McCain, her longtime colleague in Washington, seemed to compare President Donald Trump to various authoritarian leaders.
""The arc that we are on, this arc of justice, started the day after that dark inauguration,"" Klobuchar said. ""The day when I sat on that stage between Bernie and John McCain, and John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech, because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation. He understood it. He knew because he knew this man more than any of us did.""
While it was the first time Klobuchar recited that particular anecdote, she has regularly praised McCain in speeches and interviews. The senator visited McCain while he was battling cancer at his Arizona ranch and described him as a ""mentor"" after his death.
Meghan McCain, a co-host of The View, tweeted on Monday that Klobuchar should be ""respectful"" and not bring her father up in political speeches.
""On behalf of the entire McCain family (Senator Klobuchar), please be respectful to all of us and leave my father's legacy and memory out of presidential politics,"" she said.
The Klobuchar campaign responded to her request Monday night in a statement that emphasized the senator's respect for the McCain family but did not directly say whether she would continue to use the story.
""Senator Klobuchar had a long-time friendship with Senator McCain, she has defended him against President Trump’s attacks in the past, and she has deep respect for his family,"" said Tim Hogan, the campaign's communications director. ""While she was simply sharing a memory, she continues to believe that the best stories about Senator McCain are not about the views he had about President Trump: They are about McCain’s own valor and heroism.”
Both McCains have been critical of Trump, who still sometimes mocks and criticizes the former Arizona senator even after his death.
The late senator withdrew his endorsement of the Republican nominee in October 2016, citing Trump's taped statements about groping women as well as his feud with a Gold Star family, his attacks on a Mexican-American judge's heritage, and his “outrageous” accusations against the ""Central Park Five,"" a group of African American men convicted of rape as teenagers but cleared by DNA evidence years later.

California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter admits he's taken photo with dead enemy,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/california-gop-rep-duncan-hunter-admits-he-s-taken-photo-n1010596,"SAN DIEGO — Rep. Duncan Hunter of California acknowledged taking a photo with a dead combatant during his time as a Marine as he defended a Navy SEAL charged with multiple war crimes, including killing a teenage fighter. The Republican congressman, who was re-elected last November as he faces corruption charges, made the comments during a town hall Saturday in his San Diego-area district, the Union-Tribune reported.
Hunter has advocated for a pardon for Edward Gallagher, who's charged with stabbing to death a teenage Islamic State fighter under his care in Iraq in 2017 and then holding his reenlistment ceremony with the body.
Will Trump pardon accused war criminals? May 21, 2019 07:34 Prosecutors said the Navy SEAL chief texted a photograph of himself next to the dead fighter and wrote he ""got him with my hunting knife."" He's also accused of shooting two civilians in Iraq and opening fire on crowds.
Hunter said he also posed for a photo next to a dead combatant but said he did not text it or post it to social media. The congressman said ""a lot of us have done the exact same thing,"" referring to fellow service members in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hunter called the military justice system ""corrupt,"" saying it is run by lawyers and bureaucrats intent on pursuing ""war fighters."" His offices didn't return calls and emails seeking comment Monday.
Gallagher's lawyers have said he did not murder anyone and that disgruntled SEALs made the accusations because they wanted to get rid of a demanding platoon leader.
Dozens of Republican congressmen say Gallagher an innocent war hero being unfairly prosecuted. President Donald Trump got him moved from the brig to better confinement in a military hospital with access to his lawyers and family.
Trump says he is considering pardons for several American military members accused of war crimes.
Gallagher's court-martial is set to begin this week at Naval Base San Diego. Gallagher has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.
At the town hall, Hunter declined to comment on his own pending court case.
Hunter and his wife, Margaret, were indicted in 2017 on federal charges of illegally converting more than $250,000 in campaign contributions for personal living expenses. Both have pleaded not guilty and have their next court hearing scheduled for July 29. Trial is set for later this year.

The 64-year-old father had fallen asleep on their boat and awoke believing he was at home, Troup County Sheriff’s Sgt. Stewart Smith confirmed Monday.
Deputies with the Troup County Sheriff's Office were dispatched to West Point Lake under the Cameron Mill Road bridge regarding a possible drowning. Google The father, who was not identified, tried to go to the bathroom and fell into the lake where the boat was tied up to a bridge, Smith said.
The man’s son, Jeremiah Israel, 34, of Jonesboro, jumped into the water to save him, Smith said in a news release.
Authorities were dispatched to the scene shortly after midnight Monday.
Other boaters at West Point Lake who saw the incident helped pull the father from the water, Smith said. He was later taken to a hospital and released.
Israel never emerged from the lake. His body was recovered shortly before 11:00 a.m. Monday, Smith said.
In the release, he said Israel’s death appeared to be a “tragic accidental drowning.”

Meredith sells Sports Illustrated to Authentic Brands Group for $110 million,www.nbcnews.com,Variety,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/meredith-sells-sports-illustrated-authentic-brands-group-110-million-n1010611,"LOS ANGELES — Sports Illustrated over the decades has chronicled stellar match-ups, blow-outs, squeakers, sudden deaths and photo finishes. Now it's getting ready to take on a whole new kind of game. Publisher Meredith Corp. has sold for $110 million the intellectual property around the venerable sports-news outlet to Authentic Brands Group, the brand-development company that manages Juicy Couture, Nautica, and elements of the Muhammad Ali and Elvis Presley estates, among others. Meredith took on Sports Illustrated as part of its purchase of Time Inc. in January of 2018 for $1.85 billion plus debt.
Under terms of the deal, Authentic Brands acquires the rights to market, develop and license Sports Illustrated and its kids' edition as well as its swimsuit and ""Sportsperson of the Year"" franchises, along with the magazine's photo archive. Meredith will pay a licensing fee to operate the editorial operations of Sports Illustrated in print and in digital for a minimum of two years. Editor Chris Stone and Publisher Danny Lee will continue to lead Sports Illustrated at Meredith.
""We felt this was the best outcome for the brand, and gave it the greatest future growth potential,"" says Jon Werther, president of Meredith's national media group, in an interview. With the new pact as a foundation, he says, Meredith can move to sell ads for Sports Illustrated along with its other media holdings. The company had kept the magazine separate from its other properties because of its hopes for a sale. Meredith has no plans to change the magazine's frequency, Werther says, or the circulation it guarantees advertisers.
The pact suggests owners of long-standing print-focused brands may find monetizing non-core assets easier than the traditional business. As audiences migrate to digital screens - and advertisers follow them - wringing profit from magazines and newspapers continues to be a difficult task. SI's overall print and digital audience for March was off by 9.2%, according to the Association of Magazine Media, a trade organization.
But the brand's new owner expects to forge into new areas. ""Sports Illustrated is not just a magazine. It's really a platform and it really stands for something that is hard - when you're building brands - to get: It has authenticity. It has authority. It has respect,"" says Jamie Salter, founder, chairman and CEO of Authentic Brands, in an interview. ""To earn that with a consumer, it's not easy, right? Consumers are tough.""
In a wide-ranging discussion, Salter envisioned possibilities ranging from Sports Illustrated medical clinics and sports-skills training classes to a gambling business and better use of the magazine's vast photo library. ""We always stay close to the DNA and the heritage of the brand,"" he says. ""Granted, we will go beyond, but we will always remember sort of how we go there.""
Known since 1954 as a gold standard for sports journalism, Sports Illustrated has over the years vied with an array of upstarts, most notably Walt Disney's ESPN, which was able to create a TV-and-video business for sports coverage that SI's previous owner, Time Warner, was not. The market for sports journalism and discussion around it has fragmented further in the digital age, with the rise of sites such as WarnerMedia's Bleacher Report; Bill Simmons' The Ringer; The Chernin Group's Barstool Sports; and the independent Awful Announcing. Indeed, ESPN said in April it would shut down its flagship print magazine, which was no longer profitable.
The sale moves Meredith close to the end of its effort to sell various Time Inc. assets, once some of the biggest media brands in the sector. Meredith has sold Time and Fortune to entrepreneurs, while folding Money's print operations. The company is still working to sell Fansided, a network of sports and entertainment sites, according to a person familiar with the matter and is seeing offers in the $30 million range for the property.

"42 inmates killed in Brazil jails, prison officials say",www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/42-inmates-killed-brazil-jails-prison-officials-say-n1010616,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Forty-two inmates were killed at three prisons in the capital of Brazil's northern Amazonas state Monday, authorities reported, a day after 15 died during fighting among prisoners at a fourth prison in the same city. The Amazonas state prison agency said all 42 prisoners found dead in Manaus on Monday showed signs of asphyxia.
The killings across the city's prisons recalled early 2017 when more than 120 inmates died at the hands of other prisoners during several weeks of fighting among rival crime gang members at prisons in northern states. Many of those victims had their heads cut off or their hearts and intestines ripped out .
On Sunday, 15 inmates were killed during a riot at Manaus' Anisio Jobim Prison Complex, where 56 prisoners died in the violence two years earlier.
Local authorities said prisoners began fighting among themselves before noon Sunday, and security reinforcements were rushed in and managed to regain control within 45 minutes.
Little information was released about Monday's killings.
Brazil's justice and public security ministry said it was sending a federal task force to help local officials handle the situation.
""I just spoke with (Justice) Minister Sergio Moro, who is already sending a prison intervention team to the State of Amazonas, so that he can help us in this moment of crisis and a problem that is national: the problem of prisons,"" Amazonas state Gov. Wilson Lima said.
Several drug-trafficking and other criminal gangs in Brazil run much of their day-to-day business from prisons, where they often have wide sway. The 2017 slayings were largely gang-related, prompting authorities to increase efforts to separate factions and frequently transfer prisoners.
Authorities have not yet said whether gang wars were behind the latest blood-letting.
Moro had to send a federal task force to help tame violence in Ceara state in January that local officials said was ordered by crime gang leaders angered by plans to impose tighter controls in the state's prisons."
Trump wishes troops 'happy Memorial Day' as he heads home from Japan,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-wish-troops-happy-memorial-day-he-heads-home-japan-n1010631,"ABOARD THE USS WASP — President Donald Trump on Tuesday wished “happy Memorial Day” to U.S. service members aboard an American assault ship docked in Japan. They shouted “U.S.A. U.S.A.” Trump called them a “tough bunch of people” and dubbed them “daring and mighty warriors in the Pacific.”
The president treated his appearance aboard the USS Wasp as a Memorial Day event because it was still Monday in the United States when he addressed hundreds of members of the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet.
“I have to wish you all a very happy Memorial Day,” Trump said. “On this Memorial Day evening in the United States, Americans are concluding a sacred day of remembrance, reflection and prayer.”
Before appearing on the USS Wasp, Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited a Japanese destroyer, the J.S. Kaga, docked nearby. Standing alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump delivered the same “happy Memorial Day” message to the Japanese forces.

Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images Some veterans and their families don’t like the phrase “Happy Memorial Day.” They say they prefer that the federal holiday remain a somber occasion for the nation to honor those who gave their lives in service to the United States.
“Our republic endures because of brave men and women who are willing to lay down their lives to defend us all,” Trump said. “Our freedom is earned through the blood and sweat and toil and sacrifice of great American patriots just like you.”
On Memorial Day, volunteers plant flags on the Boston Common to honor fallen soldiers from MA May 27, 2019 02:00 Trump has come under sharp criticism for skipping ceremonial visits to cemeteries to honor America’s war dead on designated national holidays. Since then, the White House has been careful to show the public that he is marking occasions like Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Before leaving for Japan, Trump placed small U.S. flags near headstones at Arlington National Cemetery.
Service members aboard the USS Wasp, docked at the mouth of Tokyo Bay, welcomed Trump with loud cheers and applause. Several wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Trump and the words: “Make Aircrew Great Again” — a play on his campaign slogan.
Trump’s helicopter trips to both ships capped his four-day state visit to Japan . He became the first head of state to meet Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, since his May 1 ascension to the throne.
The visit also allowed Trump and Abe to spend hours of time together on the golf course, at a sumo wrestling match and in meetings discussing trade, North Korea’s nuclear program, Iran and other bilateral issues.
Trump was scheduled to return to the White House on Tuesday."
"Teens still commonly prescribed opioids, study finds",www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/teens-still-commonly-prescribed-opioids-study-finds-n1009786,"Opioid prescriptions remain common for teens and young adults, a new study finds. From 2005 to 2015, nearly 15 percent of teens and young adults received an opioid prescription during an emergency room visit, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics. That’s compared with 3 percent among those who were seen in an outpatient clinic.
What’s more, ER visits for dental issues resulted in an opioid prescription nearly 60 percent of the time.
“ Adolescents and young adults are such a high-risk population for opioid misuse and future addiction,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Joel Hudgins, a clinical instructor at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “We found the rates of opioid prescriptions were pretty high, at 15 percent, which is right in line with adult data.”
CDC warns deaths soaring from third wave of opioid epidemic March 21, 2019 01:22 In 2016, nearly 400,000 young adults, ages 18 to 25 had an opioid-use disorder in the previous year, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . And it's estimated that one in eight deaths in teens and young adults is linked to opioids, according to an editorial published alongside the new study.
To get a sense of how many teens and young adults, ages 13 to 22, were receiving prescriptions for opioids in the ER and outpatient clinics —and for what conditions — Hudgins and his colleagues turned to two nationally representative databases: the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.
The raw samples from 2005 through 2015 from those databases included 47,159 visits to ERs and 31,271 visits to outpatient clinics. Extrapolating those numbers to the entire U.S. population would represent 197 million visits to an ER and 801 million visits to an outpatient clinic.
While opioid prescriptions might be understandable for collarbone fractures and certain other types of bone breaks, Hudgins and others were perplexed by others, including those for sore throats, for which opioids were prescribed at 12.5 percent of visits, urinary tract infections, prescribed at 16.7 percent of visits and dental problems, prescribed at 57.9 percent of visits.
Hudgins was particularly struck by the numbers relating to dental issues. “The actual recommendation for this is for Tylenol or ibuprofen, not opioids,” he told NBC News.
That may be so, but it appears that U.S. dentists also prescribe a lot of opioids . A separate study, published on Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open , found that in 2016, the proportion of prescriptions for opioids written by U.S. dentists was 37 times greater than the proportion written by British dentists.
Opioids, adolescents and young adults What’s most concerning is that the prescriptions for opioids discussed in the new research are being written for adolescents and young adults, said Dr. Deanna Wilson, an addiction specialist and an assistant professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
“This reiterates what I see,” Wilson told NBC News. “The vast majority of young adult and adolescent patients using fentanyl and heroin started with a prescription for opioids.”
People have to remember that adolescents are especially vulnerable to addictive drugs because their brains haven’t finished developing, Wilson said. “My favorite analogy is to think of it as a car that has a gas pedal but the brakes aren’t fully developed,” she added.
Part of the solution to the problem may be more education for both physicians and the public, said Dr. Christopher Hammond, an assistant professor of psychiatry and medical director of the Co-occurring Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults Program at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
“I think [the new study] frames an area that future public health initiatives and training should be targeting: how to reduce opioid prescriptions in these ER settings and how to use non-opioid pain medications and other pain approaches in the acute care setting,” Hammond told NBC News. “The antecedents for opioid misuse start in adolescence and early adulthood .”
Indeed, doctors need to look beyond opioids for pain control, said Dr. C. Anthoney Lim, director of pediatric emergency medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“Physicians should be suggesting NSAIDs, like Motrin, unless there is a counter-indication. And parents should be told to give the NSAID time to work. If after that the pain is uncontrollable, you can use [less-strong opioids such as] Tylenol-Codeine or Percocet.”
Ultimately, it may be up to parents to combat the problem for teens, Lim told NBC News, adding “it’s important for parents to ask about [non-opioid pain medications] and alternative approaches to pain control.”

About 68,000 households and businesses in the state were without power Tuesday morning.
Mayor Jeffrey Hazel of Celina, Ohio, about 80 miles north of Dayton, said in a news conference Tuesday that Melvin Delhanna, 81, died when the storm pushed a vehicle into his home.
Mercer County Emergency Management Director Mike Robbins told NBC affiliate WDTN that at least 12 people were injured in the wake of the storms and extensive damage. The Ohio Department of Transportation used snow plows to remove debris off Interstate 75.
""We probably have more than a handful of tornadoes that we need to look at on the ground throughout the region, maybe even more,"" said John Franks, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Wilmington, Ohio.
Ohio tornadoes: Sheriff details 'extensive' damage in communities May 28, 2019 02:05 The weather service issued 36 tornado warnings overnight Monday across the region, he added.
The National Weather Service confirmed a ""large and dangerous"" tornado on the ground near the Dayton suburb of Trotwood in Montgomery County just after 11 p.m.
Dayton resident Tenley Taghi told NBC News the tornado left her street in ruins, adding that she didn't hear any warning sirens.
Heavy tornado damage near Interstate 75 in Dayton, Ohio, on Monday night. Jordan Lynn Freshauer via Facebook “I saw the clouds spin backwards and the trees began to sway uncontrollably and we took shelter,"" she said. ""I was standing on the porch that is no longer standing.”

— NWS Wilmington OH (@NWSILN) May 28, 2019 Trotwood Mayor Mary McDonald said on Facebook that power lines and trees were down across the city of 25,000 residents.
""It’s like out of a movie,” Trotwood resident Nathan Mann told NBC affiliate WDTN . ""You can never prepare for something like this.""
Four shelters offering food and water opened in Montgomery County overnight. One shelter lost power not long after opening and had to close.
Because of a power outage at water plants and pump stations, Dayton officials said in a news conference Tuesday morning that they are issuing a boil-water advisory.
At least 1 killed, multiple injured in Ohio tornadoes May 28, 2019 02:39 In Mercer County, at least seven people were taken to hospitals for injuries sustained during the storm, according to officials. They did not detail the extent of the injuries.
WDTN reported that many trees were down and that numerous homes had been damaged in and near Celina, a town of 10,000 people in Mercer County that is around 72 miles northwest of Dayton.
The Mercer County Emergency Management Director says that emergency crews are focusing their efforts on search and rescue. Residents are asked to stay off roadways if possible. https://t.co/9GbvD8CyM9

A four-day school week? Teachers and kids give it an 'A.' Parents are less enthused,www.nbcnews.com,Adam Edelman,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/four-day-school-week-teachers-kids-give-it-parents-are-n1009506,"BRIGHTON, Colo. — Emma Cable, a junior at Eagle Ridge Academy in this working-class suburb north of Denver, spends her Mondays at volleyball practice and volunteering at a seeing-eye dog organization. Isabelle Jaramillo, a third grader at Northeast Elementary, spends hers at the local Boys & Girls Club, while Angelica Gallegos, a sixth grader at Vikan Middle, and her brother, Paul, a fourth grader at Pennock Elementary, go with their mother to Barr Lake State Park. Different grades, different activities and one thing in common: None of these students spend that day in class.
That's because their school district, 27J Schools in Adams County, Colorado, switched to a four-day school week at the start of this school year as part of an effort to recruit and retain better teachers. With 28 schools and about 18,000 students, it was the first district in a major metropolitan area and the largest school district in the United States to make the change, though it's been a growing trend among rural districts .
Now, at the end of the experiment's first year, those affected gave it mixed reviews. While kids and teachers relished the regular long weekends, parents did not. Those with younger kids worried about child care, and those with older children worried about the unstructured free time.
Paul, 9, and Angelica Gallegos, 12, use their Mondays to volunteer at Barr Lake State Park. Rachel Woolf / for NBC News But 27J Schools, whose teachers are the lowest paid in the Denver metro area despite numerous attempts to increase local taxes to fund raises, could still be a model for other major urban and suburban districts facing funding and staffing challenges and looking for creative ways to attract quality educators. So far, the district — which has committed to the shortened schedule for at least another two school years — has seen increased and more promising teacher applicants and lower staff turnover.
“We weren't going to compete in the current system. You just can’t be dead last in funding, last in starting teacher salaries, last in average teacher pay and expect you’ll attract the best folks,” 27J Schools Superintendent Dr. Chris Fiedler told NBC News in a recent interview.
Making a four-day week happen In most states, including Colorado, minimum instructional requirements for public schools are governed by hours in the classroom, not days. As a result, resource-strapped districts like 27J can cut a day from the school week but still comply with requirements by extending the length of the other four school days.
Under their revised schedule, elementary school days were extended 40 minutes, while middle and high school schedules implemented longer eight-hour days. Mondays were dropped.
“Unlike Friday, Monday is a day for kids and teachers to prepare for the week,"" Fiedler said.
“We went into this with idea that teachers are the most important factor in a child’s education,” said 27J Schools Superintendent Dr. Chris Fiedler. “And now we’re finally giving teachers the time to do all the work we have asked them to do. Professional development, class prep, lesson planning.” Rachel Woolf / for NBC News Teachers in 27J Schools have mandatory professional development one Monday morning a month, while administrators have two. And the new schedule was rolled out with other initiatives administrators felt would help keep students connected to the classroom on their days off, including providing every student with a Chromebook laptop and the launch of a comprehensive digital curriculum.
To address day care concerns for parents of young children, the district expanded its existing offerings to include an all-day option on Monday for $30 per day. 27J also enlisted the Shopneck Boys & Girls Club, in Brighton, to provide all-day Monday care for $20 for families that could afford it, and at no cost for those who could not.
Teachers and parents give it a grade For single parents like Jessica Lore, who works full-time for a local sales company and has no family in the area, the four-day schedule was not a welcome change.
“I don't like it one bit, and I feel like the district didn’t take seriously my worries about child care,” she told NBC News as she picked up her three children from the Boys & Girls Club on a recent Monday.
If it weren't for that free service — Lore’s kids receive a scholarship because she can't afford to pay — “I’d have been out of a job,” she said.
Even for parents who can afford to have someone at home or who can enlist nearby family to help, the change wasn’t universally well received.
Jessica Lore with her children Isabelle, 9, left, David, 8 and Juleun, 2, at the Shopneck Boys and Girls Club. Rachel Woolf / for NBC News Brody Mathews, who has two children at Thimmig Elementary, wasn't thrilled about the longer school days. And while child care wasn’t an issue — he and his wife run a business out of their home — a work-related move to Golden, Colorado, will put his kids back in school for five days a week.
“I’ll be relieved that they’ll be back on a five-day schedule. It’s what pretty much every human on earth works or goes to school for,” he said.
Owen Mathews, 5, after his preschool graduation. Owen's family is leaving the area and his father is looking forward to returning to a five-day schedule. Rachel Woolf / for NBC News On the other hand, students and teachers loved the shortened week.
Kids said they enjoyed having more time for play, rest and even homework, while high schoolers tended to pick up extra shifts at their part-time jobs, or volunteer to boost their college prospects.
Alec Alvarez, a third grader at Thimmig Elementary, said he felt the new day was ""kind of long"" but that it was ""worth it"" so he could spend his Mondays at his grandmother's house ""playing outside.""
Zach Felker, a junior at Prairie View High, said he works up to 11 hours on Mondays at a nearby Buffalo Wild Wings to earn money to pay for college.
Teachers, meanwhile, cited having long weekends they can use to prep for the week while still having time for much-needed relaxation.
Ally Hyatt, a seventh-grade science teacher at Vikan Middle, had spent the first four years of her career in Denver Public Schools, and applied for a job last summer specifically in 27J Schools when she learned about their new schedule.
“It was attractive to me because I was essentially working that long of a day in DPS anyway. Here, I could just do it four days week,” she said in an interview in the teachers' lounge at Vikan. “It's been amazing for my personal life, and I love that I have more time to actually plan lessons on Monday and get everything ready for the week.”
Shelby Yuan, a second-grade teacher at Thimmig Elementary, said “the three-day weekend is great. It’s nice to have the opportunity to recuperate from the weekend while also having time to get ready for the week.” Rachel Woolf / for NBC News Signs of success That fondness among teachers has, so far, produced for 27J Schools what Fiedler hoped it would. Several school teacher positions that tended to attract just a handful of of applicants have netted more than 100, he said — including ""harder vacancies"" like special education and secondary math jobs.
He noted applicant quality has been higher, too, with more candidates possessing master's degrees and English as a Second Language certifications. The district’s teacher turnover rate also declined from 21 percent last year to 13 percent this year.
The most meaningful data, however, aren't yet available. State test results and official graduation rates — which will help gauge the new schedule's impact on student performance — won’t be ready until later in the fall.
And while the district says it's received a number of calls from other schools near and far inquiring about what worked and what didn’t, no additional ones will make the change next year.
To help students acclimate to the new schedule every student received a Chromebook laptop computer. At least 560 school districts in 25 states have already trimmed their school weeks to four days, according the National Conference of State Legislatures — although most of the total are in rural areas of Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and Montana. Rachel Woolf / for NBC News As a result, curious superintendents will be at the mercy of a thin and contradictory body of research on the effects of the four-day week. A 2015 study showed improved academic performance for fourth- and fifth-grade students on the four-day week in rural Colorado districts. A 2017 study found that the four-day week had a detrimental effect on reading and math scores of third through eighth graders in rural Oregon districts, with “minority, low-income, and special education students” being more adversely affected.
And a 2018 study found that in rural Colorado districts on the four-day schedule, juvenile crime jumped 20 percent. (Brighton police said they haven’t noticed any uptick in juvenile crime this school year).
Until more evidence is available, even proponents like Fiedler are warning that only districts similar to his own — ones looking to recruit and retain quality educators despite a funding crisis — should give it a go.
“If you have the money, you should pay your teachers,” he said. “But for us, it's a significant differentiating factor that makes us really competitive.""

Look over here! Democratic candidates struggle for recognition in outsize field,www.nbcnews.com,Alex Seitz-Wald,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/look-over-here-democratic-candidates-struggle-recognition-outsize-field-n1010556,"WASHINGTON — Outside the handful of best-known candidates, the rest of the 2020 Democratic field risks melting together into an indistinguishable blob in the summer heat. Candidates kept jumping into the largest presidential primary field in history because voters kept telling pollsters they wanted fresher faces and gave no one a commanding lead like the one Hillary Clinton enjoyed heading into the 2016 primary.
But former Vice President Joe Biden's stronger-than-expected start suggests voters might not have wanted so many options and may be more comfortable picking a familiar face after all.
Full coverage: NBCNews.com candidates page
The race is still wide open — front-runners Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., together have less than half the vote. That leaves the rest of the pack praying for a breakout moment, needing to capture the attention of increasingly distracted Americans by competing not only with one another and President Donald Trump, but also with Netflix and Candy Crush and everything else trying to monetize our time.
Democratic primary voters might be suffering what social scientists call ""choice overload,"" which can turn much of the field into background noise.
Barry Schwartz, a psychologist who wrote the best-selling book ""The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less,"" said research from the world of consumer goods shows how buyers become overwhelmed by having too many options and often gravitate toward brands they know best, glancing right over the rest.
Lesser known candidates trying to build name recognition, but on their own terms May 7, 2019 05:56 ""Instead of choosing on the basis of policies or past performance, which are hard to evaluate, people may choose on the basis of something that is easy to evaluate — like familiarity,"" Schwartz told NBC News. ""So, yes, I'm guessing that Biden benefits from such a large field.""
While Schwartz cautioned the research does not come from the world of politics, some social scientists have argued this dynamic helped explain Trump's victory in the crowded 2016 GOP field.
And it's easy to see why Democratic primary voters would be overwhelmed by a field that remains largely unknown to them .
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who traveled to early voting states before ultimately deciding against entering the 2020 field as a little-known underdog, said it's ""just human nature to go with who we're familiar with and who we trust"" — and that's Biden.
""Voting for president is like voting for a parent. You want somebody who's strong, you want somebody who you can complain to and who'll be sympathetic,"" Garcetti said. ""I think Joe is somebody that people feel has been a part of their family. He's been in their living room on TV, he's been that uncle, as he calls himself.""
That leaves lesser-known candidates working overtime to try to carve out a niche for themselves and accepting almost every interview request that comes their way to try to catch fire and stand out.
They are aware of their predicament.
When a Twitter user jokingly conflated Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, with Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., two 40-something white men running underdog presidential bids, Moulton responded with self-deprecating humor.
""No Derek, this is New York City Mayor Eric Swalwell,"" Moulton said, intentionally mixing up New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
No Derek, this is New York City Mayor Eric Swalwell. https://t.co/GqqH4ltUfj
— Seth Moulton (@sethmoulton) May 18, 2019 Still, it can be a frustrating predicament for accomplished senators, governors, members of Congress and mayors who think they have something to offer, especially when a candidate like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has shown it is at least theoretically possible to go from being a no-name to the top of the pack virtually overnight.
Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who also seriously considered a long-shot 2020 bid, pointed to Buttigieg and said candidates have to try to find some way to grab the attention of the political press.
""If you look back in time, there's always magical moments that the press then picks up and builds,"" Merkley said. ""That's what the other candidates are looking for. Because they don't have the money to do big advertising now, so they have to capture the imagination of America. And to capture the imagination of America, they have to capture the imagination of the press.""
""Some are trying to do it through policy ideas,"" he added. ""Some are trying to do it by going places you wouldn't necessarily expect a Democrat to go. Some are just trying to do it by message.""
But first, they'll have to justify why they want to be president in the first place, a hurdle some campaigns think their candidates are better positioned to clear than others.
Related Politics Politics 2020 Democratic candidate declaration tracker Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, noted that his most recent poll showed some barely known candidates with surprisingly high unfavorability ratings.
""The field is too big. You wonder if some candidates are getting negative ratings simply as a result of voters questioning whether they really should be running,"" Murray said.
Other campaigns have been surprised by Biden’s surge in polls and and suggest that it's soft, driven largely by Democratic and particularly African American voters' residual good feelings for the Barack Obama era.
They hope it will run its course as other candidates make their case and as voters get exposed to some of the less flattering aspects of Biden's record. But that will require someone to go after Biden and none have shown an eagerness to do that at this point, although that could change at the first debate , which will air June 26 and 27 from Miami, sponsored by NBC.
Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, who is watching from the sidelines as many of his friends compete with one another for a promotion, said the debates will be key for bottom-of-the-heap candidates, since it will be a rare moment that will focus voters' attention on the race and place backbenchers on the same platform as the stars.
""The debates become the moment for candidates to break out,"" Schatz said. ""It'll be a little like Hollywood Squares ... but I just feel like voters are going to watch this thing with fresh eyes.""
Still, no one really knows, he added with a laugh, recalling his unsuccessful first congressional run: ""I was in a 10-person race and I didn't do well.""

Malaysia to send back plastic waste to Western countries,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/malaysia-send-back-plastic-waste-western-countries-n1010651,"PORT KLANG, Malaysia — Malaysia will send back some 3,300 tons of non-recyclable plastic waste to countries such as the U.S., U.K., Canada and Australia in a move to avoid becoming a dumping ground for rich nations, Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said Tuesday. Yeo said Malaysia and many developing countries have become new targets after China banned the import of plastic waste last year . She said 60 containers stacked with contaminated waste were smuggled in en route to illegal processing facilities in the country and will be sent back to their countries of origin.
Ten of the containers are due to be shipped back within two weeks, she said, as she showed reporters contents of the waste at a port outside Kuala Lumpur.
The displayed items included cables from the U.K., contaminated milk cartons from Australia and compact discs from Bangladesh, as well as bales of electronic and household waste from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia and China. Yeo said the waste from China appeared to be garbage from France and other countries that had been rerouted after a ban imposed by China.
Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin shows a plastic waste shipment in Port Klang, Malaysia, on Tuesday. Vincent Thian / AP ""This is probably just the tip of the iceberg (due) to the banning of plastic waste by China,"" Yeo told a news conference. ""Malaysia will not be a dumping ground to the world ... we will fight back. Even though we are a small country, we can't be bullied by developed countries.""
In one case alone, Yeo said a U.K. recycling company exported more than 55,000 tons of plastic waste in about 1,000 containers to Malaysia over the past two years.
Related World news World news Organized crime gangs prompt return of moats in Britain The government has clamped down on dozens of illegal plastic recycling facilities that had mushroomed across the country, shuttering more than 150 plants since last July. Earlier this month, the government also sent back five containers of waste to Spain.
Yeo said China's plastic waste ban had ""opened up the eyes of the world to see that we have a huge garbage and recycling problem.""
Citizens in rich nations diligently separate their waste for recycling but the garbage ended up being dumped in developing nations where they are recycled illegally, causing environmental and health hazards, she said.
""We urge the developed countries to review their management of plastic waste and stop shipping the garbage out to the developing countries,"" she said, calling such practices ""unfair and uncivilized.""
Yeo vowed to take action against Malaysian companies illegally importing used plastic, calling them ""traitors to the country's sustainability."""

Austria's youthful leader Kurz ousted as scandal engulfs ex-ally,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/austria-s-youthful-leader-kurz-ousted-scandal-engulfs-ex-ally-n1010656,"VIENNA — Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was ousted by parliament in a no-confidence vote Monday, paving the way for a new election. The young leader defiantly vowed that he and his center-right People's Party would return to power with increased strength.
The vote capped a week of turmoil at the top in Austria that started when Kurz pulled the plug on his coalition with the far-right Freedom Party after a video emerged showing that party's leader appearing to offer lucrative government contracts to a purported Russian investor.
A new election is already planned for September, and President Alexander Van der Bellen now needs to appoint a caretaker government to serve until then.
Putin dances at Austrian foreign minister's wedding Aug. 19, 2018 01:03 Less than three hours after losing his job, Kurz appeared before a cheering crowd outside party offices in Vienna, pledging that ""the changes that we began two years ago will not end today."" He said he looked forward to helping the interim government ensure stability in the coming months, and would fight to win back his position.
""In the end the people will decide in September, and I'm happy about that,"" he said to chants from the crowd of ""Chancellor Kurz.""
No-confidence votes are common in Austrian politics, but this is the first one to have succeeded in its modern history. The result makes Kurz the shortest-serving chancellor since 1945 with 525 days in office, according to the Austria Press Agency.
Related World news World news The world's spying capital tilts toward Putin's Russia Kurz remains popular and his center-right party finished first in Sunday's European Parliament election with 34.9 percent support, a gain of almost 8 percentage points over 2014.
The 32-year-old became Europe's youngest leader when he was sworn in just before Christmas 2017. He told the body that he was ""proud and satisfied with the work we have done as a government in the past year and a half"" and pledged to work constructively with the caretaker government.

Child abusers groom victims and their families. That's why this new Olympic abuse prevention policy is so flawed.,www.nbcnews.com,Dani Bostick,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/child-abusers-groom-victims-their-families-s-why-new-olympic-ncna1010186,"""Every parent thinks their child will tell them if someone touched them inappropriately,"" Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an Olympic athlete and CEO of Champion Women, recently told me. ""But by the time that happens, the child is well-groomed, and it is too late. Research shows that children do not tell their parents."" And, since most survivors of child sexual abuse do not disclose the abuse, abusers often continue to enjoy the trust of their victim’s family, and continue to abuse. As documentaries such as ""Leaving Neverland"" and ""Abducted in Plain Sight"" showed, abusers do not just groom individual victims, they also groom entire families and even communities. Parents do not intentionally expose their children to harm, but often feel honored that a respected adult has taken a special interest in their child. Once predators have secured their trust, parents believe that they are providing a positive experience for their child with a person they consider safe. This part of the process of grooming enables abuse and hinders disclosure.
In the context of the Olympic movement and children’s dreams of gold, the special attention of experts in the sport is often welcomed by parents and children alike, interpreted as a sign that a child has exceptional athletic potential. When perpetrators have the trust of parents and the community — as serial sexual predator Larry Nassar did — they have unquestioned and unencumbered access to their victims, often when those children are far from home or help.
Related Opinion Opinion Gymnastics culture is rotten to the core. Larry Nassar is just the beginning. This is why experts agree that limiting one-on-one interactions between child athletes and adults affiliated with the sports is key to limiting — or hopefully eliminating — abuse.
And yet, on June 23, the U.S. Center for SafeSport, an independent organization tasked with preventing abuse in sports, will require the national governing bodies that manage individual Olympic sports to adopt their incredibly flawed Minor Athlete Abuse Prevention Policies .
The major flaw in the rules is that, with parental permission, coaches can travel alone with children. Even worse, this policy allows coaches to interact with children outside of program activities, including at their homes, restaurants and other locations, if parents provide permission.
Related Opinion Opinion Why we treat Larry Nassar's victims differently than Jerry Sandusky's No policy should allow for the possibility of uninterrupted time alone, especially in the context of travel; everything we have learned in the past few years shows that sexual predators quite often obtain parental permission. Requiring parental permission for these activities might prevent kidnapping, but it does not prevent abuse. The fact is that many abusers do not have to kidnap their victims in order to have one-on-one access, simply because their victims’ parents have trusted them.

According to Darkness to Light , 90 percent of children who are sexually abused know their abusers; 30 percent of abusers are related to their victims, while 60 percent are nonrelatives who have gained the trust of the children’s families.
And a list of red flags for potential abusers from Stop It Now! includes: “Insists on or manages to spend uninterrupted time alone with a child.” For this reason, many school districts have explicit policies prohibiting staff from spending time alone with students outside of school activities, which includes providing transportation to students in nonemergency situations.
California swim coach Dia Randa told me, “Never, ever should one-on-one travel be allowed with a minor. This is the context for some of the most insidious abuse in the sport of swimming.”
Debra Denithorne Grodensky, a survivor of abuse in swimming, explained to me, “That policy could not be more detrimental to athletes and parents. My parents were groomed just as much by my swim coach as I was.”
Though the new rules do require abuse-prevention training for adults and minors — again with parental permission — it fails to limit the role of the adult or address the power imbalance between the adult and minor, a cornerstone of abuse prevention policies. Instead, the SafeSport document claims that, “Policies concerning one-on-one interactions protect children while allowing for these beneficial relationships.”
Related Opinion Opinion New report suggests culture that enabled Larry Nassar and my abuser still exists But strong policies are not simply comprised of lists of prohibitions and exceptions; they frame the terms of professionalism, set ethical standards and include overarching principles that help stakeholders understand healthy boundaries and appropriate relationships between adults and minors in a specific context. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, for example, defines boundaries as “limits which protect the space between the professional’s power and the client’s vulnerability.”And Spokane Schools prohibits “singling out a particular student or students for personal attention and friendship beyond the professional staff-student relationship.”
Not only do the new rules fail to prohibit this type of grooming behavior, they do not give parents, coaches or other stakeholders any information about an appropriate adult-athlete relationship in the context of sports. In the absence of clear guidance from SafeSport, governing bodies like USA Swimming have developed their own materials that actually promote poor boundaries by framing the coach as a mentor in whom children can confide about “anything weighing on your mind.” Yet, a Queensland College of Teachers’ document on professional boundaries, lists “offering advice on personal matters” as a breach of professional boundaries. And, the Ropes and Gray report into Larry Nassar identified this exact kind of personal attention as a way Nassar groomed his patients, “Nassar groomed his patients by acting as a caring ‘friend’ in the often harsh world of competitive gymnastics.”
Related Opinion Opinion Michael Jackson's fans don't want to think he hurt kids. But hardly anyone does. But perhaps the most insidious problem with SafeSport’s Minor Athlete Abuse Prevention Policies is that, by virtue of their existence and promotion, parents and guardians will reasonably assume that these policies are effective and comprehensive. Dr. Julia Rudolph, an expert in sexual abuse prevention and researcher at Griffith University, told me, “I think that parents do need information about perpetrator modus operandi, for example, what incentives they use and the relationship they develop with the child and the parents. They need to know the script of sexual offending and then protective behaviors need to be tailored exactly to those things.”
Reducing boundaries and abuse prevention to a list of prohibited behaviors does not equip parents and other adults to recognize warning signs nor convey the appropriate role of the adult in the child’s life. This policy would not have prevented the abuse described in ""Finding Neverland"" or in the Ropes and Gray report on Nassar. Parents and children deserve strong, effective policies against abuse from a highly decentralized and unregulated system of youth programs — and especially from an organization that calls itself SafeSport.

"Texas GOP election chief resigns after questioning citizenship of 100,000 voters",www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/texas-election-chief-resigns-after-questioning-citizenship-100-000-voters-n1010676,"AUSTIN, Texas — The embattled Texas elections chief who questioned the citizenship of nearly 100,000 people resigned on Monday ahead of being forced out of office. Secretary of State David Whitley never received a confirmation vote for his post before the Texas Legislature gaveled out for two years. It was a quiet end to an unusually mild five months in the Capitol that for a decade has been a battlefield of culture wars and bare-knuckled conservatism.
Republicans in gun-friendly Texas even quietly went around the National Rifle Association before going home, setting up a test for Abbott on whether he will veto a $1 million public safety campaign for gun storage.
Abbott publicly kept up hopes for Whitley until the end, refusing to rule out just hours before Monday's deadline that his hand-picked elections chief might hang onto his job. He said the state Senate had ""fought hard"" for his nominee.
But Whitley's fate had appeared all but sealed for months. Democrats blocked a vote on his nomination after Whitley's office led a botched scouring of voter rolls in January that misidentified scores of people as non-citizens, set off questions from Congress and led to the state settling a federal lawsuit.
Whitley did not address the flubbed voter search in his resignation letter to Abbott.
""Working alongside the employees in the secretary of state's office, county elections officials, and representatives of our #1 trading partner, Mexico, has been my distinct honor and privilege,"" Whitley wrote, according to a letter obtained by local media.
Democrats for months have said Whitley lost their trust and resisted appeals to reconsider.
""He seems like a great person. But not for secretary of state, especially concerning the issues the secretary of state has to deal with as it relates to voting, more particularly as it relates to 2020. You've got to have a secretary of state that will be fair and balanced and not pre-judge voters with suppression-type issues,"" Democratic Sen. Royce West said.
Texas is one of the nation's biggest recurring battlegrounds over voting rights. Those tensions reignited as Whitley's office claimed that 58,000 of the voters flagged were shown to have voted in at least one election since 1996, prompting President Donald Trump to renew unsubstantiated claims of rampant voter fraud.
But the data used was deeply flawed and, within days, Whitley's office began walking back the numbers. The ensuing uproar threatened to cause another heated legislative session on the heels of passing some of the nation's toughest abortion restrictions, immigration crackdowns and a failed effort in 2017 to pass a ""bathroom bill"" targeting transgender people.
But the tone in the GOP-legislature sharply changed after Republicans lost more than a dozen seats in the 2018 midterms. Democrats would need to flip nine more seats in 2020 to take control of the Texas House for the first time since 2001, a tall task but one that Democrats say isn't impossible in a highly-charged presidential year.
Rather than waging partisan battles, a weakened GOP majority instead poured an extra $4.6 billion into classrooms and took measures to slow rising property taxes. Abbott is also expected to sign $1.6 billion in teacher raises in Texas, where teachers make about $7,000 below the national average.
Republican House Speaker Dennis Bonnen said the focus will now soon turn to keeping a GOP majority.
""Well, let me answer it this way, I hope so, but that wasn't why we did what we did,"" Bonnen said. ""I think you saw an extraordinary commitment from Republicans and Democrats working in such a harmonious respectful way on these big issues. I think what it really does though is it helps every member of Texas House get re-elected."""
Search continues for missing 5-year-old Utah girl as uncle refuses to cooperate with police,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/search-continues-missing-5-year-old-utah-girl-uncle-refuses-n1010666,"Authorities in Utah will spend a fourth day Tuesday searching for a 5-year-old girl, whose uncle is suspected in her disappearance but is not cooperating with investigators, police said. Elizabeth Shelley, of Logan, was last seen at about 2 a.m. Saturday when her mother went to bed, according to the Logan Police Department.
When Elizabeth's mother woke up, her daughter was gone along with the young girl's uncle Alex Whipple, 21, who was visiting the family.
Elizabeth Shelley Logan City Police Department When police started searching for Elizabeth, they found items nearby connected to both Elizabeth and Whipple and to the home they vanished from. Whipple was found at about 3 p.m. Saturday, according to police.
Whipple refused to identify himself and tried to run, but police determined he was wanted for violating probation on recent charges of receiving stolen property and driving under the influence. He was also in possession of drug paraphernalia and arrested on that charge and his previous warrant, police said.
He was also in possession of a metal baseball bat at the time, according to NBC affiliate KSL . Other items he had with him have since been forensically tested and are connected to Elizabeth, according to police.
The 21-year-old was ""uncooperative"" when detectives interviewed him, according to police. He ""made several inconsistent statements at the very beginning and lied about his whereabouts which were already known.""
Alex Whipple Logan City Police Department ""We have no reason to believe anything he told us was accurate,"" Logan Police Capt. Tyson Budge said.
Elizabeth's family said in a statement that they are ""overwhelmed, scared and sad at the recent tragic events that have touched our lives. We are grateful for all those who continue to search and help.""
More than 200 officials with local and federal agencies continue to search for the missing girl. Logan police are asking that anyone who saw either Elizabeth or Whipple on Saturday contact the department. They also appealed to people in Logan who have security cameras to share their footage and check their properties for anything that seems out of place.
Elizabeth was last seen wearing jeans and a red tank top. She is 3 feet 6 inches tall, with shoulder-length curly brown hair with bangs, and has brown eyes.

Netanyahu political crisis centers on requiring ultra-Orthodox to serve in the military,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/netanyahu-political-crisis-centers-requiring-ultra-orthodox-serve-military-n1010686,"JERUSALEM — Israel was in an unprecedented political impasse Tuesday as parliament pressed forward with legislation to dissolve itself in a high-stakes showdown that could lead to another snap election. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had appeared to have secured a fresh mandate to rule after last month's election, with a clear path to build a coalition government with his traditional political partners.
But a shocking crisis with his longtime ally and erstwhile rival Avigdor Lieberman has thrust the country into unchartered territory.
Netanyahu has until late Wednesday to present his new coalition or else Israel's largely ceremonial president can task someone else with the job. But the prime minister seems to have no intention of letting that happen and is threatening another election instead.
Backed by Netanyahu, the first of three motions required to dissolve parliament passed early Tuesday with a 66-44 majority, and a tentative election date was set for Sept. 17.
Negotiations are expected to continue right up till the final deadline. But if no compromise is found, Israel will likely go to elections for the second time this year — something that has never happened before.
Though Netanyahu's Likud party increased its power to 35 seats in parliament in the Apr. 9 vote, it cannot muster a 61-seat majority without Lieberman's Yisrael Beiteinu party.
The Likud has assailed Lieberman in recent days for undermining the people's will of a right-wing government and accused him of acting out of personal spite for Netanyahu. The prime minister himself said Lieberman would be fully responsible for dragging the country to an ""expensive, wasteful"" election and his people have vowed to aggressively go after Lieberman's core supporters in response.
But the mercurial Lieberman seems to be holding his ground.
""The only motivation of Yisrael Beiteinu is to stand by our principles and our commitments,"" he said in a Facebook post. ""We are not looking to topple Netanyahu and are not looking for an alternative candidate, but we will not compromise.""
The crisis ostensibly revolves around Lieberman's insistence that current legislation mandating that young ultra-Orthodox men be drafted into the military, like most other Jewish males, run its course.
Ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo, fearing that military service will lead to immersion in secularism. They insist that years of exemptions that have generated widespread resentment among the rest of Jewish Israelis remain in place.
A stalemate on the issue was one of the factors that shortened the term of the previous coalition government, but the assumption was that a creative compromise would be found this time around. Instead, Netanyahu finds himself on the precipice of having to call new elections that could once again put his lengthy rule in peril.
The crisis shines a spotlight on the 60-year-old Lieberman, one of the most influential and unpredictable politicians in Israel. The tough-talking, Moldovan-born Lieberman started out as a top aide to Netanyahu during his first term in office in the 1990s before embarking on a political career of his own. Since then, he has known his ups and downs with his former boss in stints in various ministries, including as foreign minister and defense minister.
A staunch nationalist, he has faced long-standing accusations of racism for branding Arab lawmakers as enemies of the state and advocating for population swaps in a future peace deal that would leave many Arab citizens outside Israel's borders.
But Lieberman, who still speaks in a thick, monotonous Russian accent, also champions a secular agenda aimed toward his political base of immigrants from the former Soviet Union and has pledged to confront efforts of ultra-Orthodox parties to coerce religion on a secular majority.
And despite his fiery rhetoric and strongman persona, he has shown signs of pragmatism such as once suggesting he'd be willing to dismantle his own West Bank settlement if Israel's final borders were redrawn. Mostly he has emerged as an iconoclast in a right-wing bloc that has largely blindly bent to the will of Netanyahu in recent years. It's made him an unlikely savior in the eyes of some anti-Netanyahu forces.
""He is insisting on a matter of principle. True, we look at the spectacle and can scarcely believe it,"" said Ben-Dror Yemini, a columnist for the Yediot Ahronot daily, which is highly critical of Netanyahu.
""Lieberman's very act of abiding by the principles with which he is identified is a refreshing change in the political scene,"" Yemini added.

Trump sides with an authoritarian — again,www.nbcnews.com,Chuck Todd,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/trump-sides-authoritarian-again-n1010701,"WASHINGTON — Out of everything that took place over the Memorial Day weekend, this might have been the biggest political news: President Trump once again sided with an authoritarian leader over allies, and he took aim at a domestic rival in the exact same breath. And even more significantly was the extent to which the political world, especially the conservative media, shrugged its shoulders.
“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump tweeted on Saturday . “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”
Trump, Japan's prime minister at odds over North Korea May 28, 2019 02:00 Afterward, reporters asked Trump why he isn’t concerned about North Korea’s missile tests.
Trump: Very importantly, there has been no nuclear testing for two years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high like 10, 12, 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing. And or the last two years, it had zero and zero. I am very happy with the way it is going. And intelligent people agree with me.
Question: You're not bothered at all by the small missiles?
Trump: No I am not. I am personally not.
One person who was bothered by the missile tests — the man standing next to Trump at the news conference, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe . (Also, we’re old enough to remember when Trump said the Iran nuclear deal was flawed because it failed to address ballistic missiles.)
This isn’t the first time Trump has praised/affirmed/sided with an authoritarian figure in his first two-and-half years in office.
""I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today"" [that Russia interfered in the 2016 election], Trump said in Helsinki last year. “Viktor Orbán has done a tremendous job in so many different ways. Highly respected. Respected all over Europe. Probably, like me, a little bit controversial, but that’s okay,” Trump said in the White House earlier this month . “We’ve had a great relationship,” Trump said of the Philippines’ Duterte in 2017 . And what continues to stand out from Trump’s remarks on North Korea/Biden is the lack of outrage, as well as the message it sends to other world leaders.
That message: Trash my domestic political opponents, and I’ll say nice things about you.
“She’s got a plan for that.” But is that enough? NBC’s Ali Vitali takes a look at Elizabeth Warren’s policy-heavy campaign.
“The Massachusetts Democrat has churned out a consistent stream of policy proposals since getting in the president race, with more than a dozen in-depth plans ranging from leveraging public lands in the fight against climate change to student loan debt forgiveness. While other candidates have worked to increase their name ID, Warren is pushing to make her name synonymous with having ‘a plan for that’ — the thing that could differentiate her from the Democratic field of more than 20 contenders.
The question, however, is if Democratic voters want MORE than policy specifics from their presidential nominee.
Can policy beat Trump? Especially policy that might have little chance for passage in today’s divided Congress?
2020 Vision: Working hard? Or hardly working? Over the Memorial Day weekend, the Washington Post wrote about Joe Biden’s campaign activity – or lack thereof.
“[A]fter a short burst of activity in the early primary states, his schedule the past two weeks or so has mostly involved fundraisers, which — while publicly announced and attended by a pool reporter — are far different from open campaign event,” the Post said.
More: “Since entering the race four weeks ago, Biden has held 11 public events, according to his campaign. Former congressman Beto O’Rourke of Texas held nearly four times that number in the same period, according to schedules. And Gillibrand, who is lagging in the polls, planned 11 stops in Iowa just over the holiday weekend.”
And: “Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has shown her face to the public at 27 events in the four weeks since Biden entered the race. [Cory] Booker has had at least 27 events scheduled in the same time span, and Sanders has had at least 17 announced engagements.”
To be fair, whatever Biden’s been doing lately has been working – given his lead in the polls. And there’s nothing wrong with pacing yourself when it comes to a very long campaign.
But if he does end up losing in Iowa and New Hampshire in February, we’ll look back at this Post story.
Biden DOES have one event today – he attends a teachers’ union town hall in Houston at 5:30 pm ET.
On the campaign trail today: In addition to Biden’s town hall in Houston, Steve Bullock campaigns in Iowa… Bernie Sanders stumps in New Hampshire… Cory Booker is in Nevada… Seth Moulton is in Massachusetts… And Kamala Harris participates in a town hall with MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell in South Carolina at 10:00 pm ET.
Data Download: The number of the day is … 12 out of 12 That’s the ratio of economic models Moody Analytics’ Mark Zandi has looked at that forecast a re-election victory by President Trump based on current economic performance, per Steven Rattner in the New York Times .
“If the election were held today, Trump would win according to the models and pretty handily,” Zandi said a couple of months ago . “In three or four of them it would be pretty close. He’s got low gas prices, low unemployment and a lot of other political variables at his back. The only exception is his popularity, which matters a lot.”
Tweet of the day I'd be far more sold on the idea that the economy was going to carry Trump to victory in 2020 if he had an approval rating above ~42% with what most observers would argue is a good economy.

"In Venezuela, criminals feel the pinch of an economic crisis",www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-criminals-feel-pinch-economic-crisis-n1010696,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The feared street gangster El Negrito sleeps with a pistol under his pillow and says he's lost track of his murder count. But despite his hardened demeanor, he's quick to gripe about how Venezuela's failing economy is cutting into his profits. Firing a gun has become a luxury. Bullets are expensive at $1 each. And with less cash circulating on the street, he says robberies just don't pay like they used to.
For the 24-year-old, that has all given way to a simple fact: Even for Venezuelan criminals it's become harder to get by.
""If you empty your clip, you're shooting off $15,"" said El Negrito, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition he be identified only by his street name and photographed wearing a hoodie and face mask to avoid attracting unwelcomed attention. ""You lose your pistol or the police take it and you're throwing away $800.""
Officials of President Nicolás Maduro's socialist administration stopped publishing statistics charting crime trends long ago.
But in something of an unexpected silver lining to the country's all-consuming economic crunch, experts say armed assaults and killings are plummeting in one of the world's most violent nations. At the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a Caracas-based nonprofit group, researchers estimate homicides have plunged up to 20% over the last three years based on tallies from media clippings and sources at local morgues.
The decline has a direct link to the economic tailspin that has helped spark a political battle for control of the once-wealthy oil nation.
Soaring inflation topped 1 million percent last year, making the local bolivar nearly useless even though ATM machines have been unable to dispense more than a dollar's worth of scrip anyway. The severe scarcity of food and medicine has driven some 3.7 million to seek better prospects in places like Colombia, Panama and Peru — the majority of them young males from whom gangs recruit. And workdays are frequently curtailed due to nationwide strikes.
Related News News A street dog leads a Venezuelan family to a new home in Colombia But as the country descends into a state of lawlessness, many Venezuelans who turn to crime find themselves subject to the same chaos that has led to a broader political and social meltdown.
Critics blame 20 years of the socialist revolution launched by the late President Hugo Chávez, who expropriated once-thriving businesses that today produce a fraction of their potential under government management.
Earlier this year, opposition leader Juan Guaidó launched a bold campaign with the support of the U.S. and more than 50 nations to oust Maduro, who succeeded Chávez. However, Guaidó has yet to make good on his promises to restore democracy, spark a robust economy and make the streets safer.
As a result of the chaos, crime has not so much disappeared as simply morphed in form. While assaults are down, reports of theft and pilfering of everything from copper telephone wires to livestock are surging. Meanwhile, drug trafficking and illegal gold mining have become default activities for organized crime.
When night falls, streets in Caracas clear as most residents abide by an undeclared curfew out of fear for their safety. Despite the significant drop in killings, Venezuelans tend not to gaze at their cellphones in the streets. Many leave gold and silver wedding rings in secure places at home, while others have grown accustomed to checking whether they are being followed.
""Venezuela remains one of the most violent countries in the world,"" said Dorothy Kronick, who teaches political science at the University of Pennsylvania and has carried out extensive research in Caracas' slums. ""It has wartime levels of violence — but no war.""
El Negrito leads for-hire hoodlums called the Crazy Boys, a band that forms part of an intricate criminal network in Petare, one of Latin America's largest and most feared slums. The gangster, who agreed to an interview with two associates at their hillside hideout in Caracas, said his group now carries out roughly five kidnappings a year, down considerably from years past.
Such express abductions are big business. Typically, a victim is nabbed and held hostage for up to 48 hours while loved ones scramble to gather as much cash as they can find, with kidnappers focused on speed and a quick return rather than on the size of the payout.
El Negrito said the ransom they set depends on what a victim's car costs, and a deal can turn deadly if demands aren't met.
But like many of his associates, he has considered leaving the trade in Venezuela and emigrating.
He said some people have quit the world of crime and sought more honest work abroad, fearing stiff penalties in other countries where laws are more enforced.
While explaining that he struggles to support his wife and young daughter, El Negrito passed a silver pistol between his hands. A Bible lay open to Proverbs on a dresser as a breeze turned the pages.
Robert Briceño, director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, said the decline in homicides is a matter of basic economics: As cash becomes scarce in Venezuela, there is less to steal.
""These days, nobody is doing well — not honest citizens who produce wealth or the criminals who prey on them,"" he said.
One associate of the Crazy Boys, who gave only his nickname, Dog, said he has no trouble finding ammunition for his guns on the black market. He said the challenge is paying for them in a country where the average person earns $6.50 a month.
""A pistol used to cost one of these bills,"" he said, crumbling up a 10 bolivar bill that can no longer be used to buy a single cigarette. ""Now, this is nothing.""

MacKenzie Bezos, an author of two books and the founder of the anti-bullying organization Bystander Revolution, said in the settlement that she was giving Jeff Bezos all of her interests in The Washington Post, which he owns.
She also said she was going to give him her interests in his space exploration company, Blue Origin, as well as 75 percent of their Amazon stock, along with voting control of her shares.
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said she was retaining roughly 4 percent of Amazon's outstanding common stock, worth about $35.6 billion.
The settlement made MacKenzie Bezos the fourth-richest woman and the 22nd wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , which profiles the 500 wealthiest people on the globe. Based on the index, Bezos has a net worth of about $36.6 billion.
Jeff Bezos remains the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $114 billion. He's followed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates , who once said he will only leave his children a ""minuscule portion"" of his estimated $102 billion worth. Buffett, who has a net worth of around $83.2 billion, is the fourth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

"Animals will 'downsize' over the next century, new study says. Here's why.",www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/animals-will-downsize-over-next-century-new-study-says-here-ncna1009321,"In the animal kingdom, it seems big is out and little is in. New research suggests that large long-lived birds and land mammals will face extinction over the next century as small insect-eating animals that reproduce quickly and die young will predominate. Among the likely losers in the emerging world will be rhinos, hippos, gorillas, giraffes and caribou as well as large birds like eagles, condors and vultures.
The likely winners? Rodents and songbirds.
The research, described in a paper published May 23 in the journal Nature Communications, points to several causes of the looming shift in the world's fauna, including climate change, deforestation, hunting and increasing urbanization and agriculture. As their world changes, large birds and land mammals — which are known to be less adaptable to changing conditions than their smaller peers — will seemingly have a hard time surviving.
""By far the biggest threat to birds and animals is humankind — with habitats being destroyed due to our impact on our planet,"" Rob Cooke, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Southampton in England and the leader of the research, said in a statement.
The downsizing of the world's animals might sound like welcome news if you're fond of teensy creatures like dwarf gerbils and the white-browed sparrow-weaver — not so welcome if you're particular to rhinos and other ""charismatic"" species . But since big mammals often ""engineer"" their habitats in important ways — think of elephants uprooting trees to create open areas and condors scavenging carcasses that might otherwise spread disease to other species — their loss might put other animal species in jeopardy.
""If we lose these 'engineers,' other species that depend on them might also go extinct,"" Cooke said in a conversation with NBC News MACH. ""It's great to have the diversity of life on the planet that we have,"" he added. ""The idea of losing it ... is kind of scary.""
William Ripple, a professor of ecology at Oregon State University in Corvallis who was not involved in the new research, echoed Cooke's concerns about the loss of large animals. ""It's important for us not just to think about the extinctions by themselves, but we should start thinking about the niches that these species have and their interactions with other species,"" he said. ""And especially the ecological services that they provide to humans,"" such as the wide dispersal of seeds that help important plants regenerate their numbers.
Ripple called the research ""important"" and added that the looking loss of biodiversity could be even greater. “These authors only examined [the] imperiled situation for birds and mammals, but we are finding similar threats to amphibians, reptiles and fish,"" he said.
For the research, Cooke and collaborators from the University of Southampton and Memorial University of Newfoundland considered all 15,484 species of birds and land mammals and looked at five characteristics for each: body mass, diet, breadth of habitat, typical number of offspring and the length of time between generations. They used this information along with data from a widely recognized list of threatened species and ran hundreds of computer simulations showing various extinction patterns and how they would affect global biodiversity.
The simulations showed that the average body mass of mammals will likely fall by 25 percent over the next century, a number that reflects the loss of bigger birds and animals. That might not sound like a big number, but the researchers say in their paper that mammals' average body mass fell just 14 percent over the last 130,000 years.
Related Environment Environment 1 million species under threat of extinction because of humans, report finds Of course, the projected downsizing of the world's animals reflects a ""business as usual"" approach to human activity. The outlook for large species could improve if we took aggressive steps to rein in climate change and the other factors that will put big birds and animals under increasing pressure.
""We need a groundswell of support from the public to put pressure on policymakers so they will do what we need to protect the species"" from excessive hunting, trapping, fishing and other examples of overexploitation, Ripple said.
""These extinctions haven’t happened yet,"" Cooke said. ""They can still be stopped. It's not a done deal.""

Supreme Court upholds Indiana abortion law requiring fetal remains be buried or cremated,www.nbcnews.com,Pete Williams,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-upholds-indiana-abortion-law-requiring-fetal-remains-be-n1010736,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld Indiana's law requiring abortion providers to bury or cremate fetal remains, but left lower court rulings intact that invalidated a broader measure that would prevent a woman from having an abortion based on a fetus's gender, race or genetic disorder. Passed in 2016 and signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, the law prohibited what the state called discriminatory abortions — those sought because of characteristics of the fetus, including gender, race or a diagnosis of Down syndrome or other congenital condition. Supporters of the measure said the law responded to medical developments that were not contemplated at the time of Roe v. Wade.
Lower courts blocked that discriminatory provision, and the Supreme Court left those rulings intact, which means the state cannot enforce that part of the law.
Supreme Court leaves lower court ruling intact, invalidating broader abortion restriction in Indiana May 28, 2019 01:07 The court's brief order Tuesday said it ""expresses no view on the merits"" of that issue. But because only one federal appeals court has ruled on the question, ""we follow our ordinary practice of denying petitions insofar as they raise legal issues that have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals.""
Curtis Hill Jr., Indiana's attorney general, said the state Legislature passed that provision of the law in response to ""the alarming trend of disability-selective abortions"" and with the goal of ""protecting children with Down syndrome and other disfavored characteristics from invidious discrimination.""
Planned Parenthood challenged it as an unconstitutional restriction on abortion rights, and lower courts agreed, preventing the law from taking effect. The Supreme Court left those rulings in place that invalided that part of the law.
But the Supreme Court allowed Indiana to enforce another provision of the law that requires fetal remains to be disposed of by burial or cremation rather than as medical waste. A total of 18 states had urged the Supreme Court to hear Indiana's appeal.
In its unsigned order, the court said opponents had never argued that the disposal provision created an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion. Indiana's appeal ""does not implicate our cases applying the undue burden test to abortion regulation.""
In previous cases, the order said, the court acknowledged that the states have a legitimate interest in proper disposal of fetal remains. Indiana's law, the court said, is rationally related to that interest, ""even if it is not perfectly tailored to that end.""
Pence, now the vice president, said he was proud to have signed the laws and cheered the court's order regarding the disposal of fetal remains as a ""victory for life!""
As Governor of IN I was proud to sign a law that requires remains of aborted babies be treated w/dignity & respect and blocks groups like Planned Parenthood from the horrific practice of selling fetal tissue. Today’s decision by the Supreme Court was a victory for life!
— Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) May 28, 2019 In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas said nothing in the Constitution or the court's prior rulings ""prevents a state from requiring abortion facilities to provide for the respectful treatment of human remains.""
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the only member of the court to note a dissent, saying the court applied the wrong standard in upholding that part of the Indiana law. ""The case implicates the right of a woman to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the state.""

Mexico president López Obrador vows to fix medicine shortages,www.nbcnews.com,Reuters,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-president-lopez-obrador-vows-fix-medicine-shortages-n1010711,"MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed on Monday to alleviate a medicine shortage in public hospitals, pledging to shop abroad for essential drugs if necessary and blaming the situation on companies upset about his crackdown on overpricing. The government promised on Friday to release about $126 million (2.4 billion pesos) to help alleviate shortages at Mexican public hospitals. The head of the largest public health system resigned last week citing budget cuts, a complaint echoed by several hospital directors.
In its first budget in December, the government reduced funding for several ministries as it sought to centralize spending, fight public sector corruption and honor a campaign pledge to implement fiscal austerity.
López Obrador argues that the problems in healthcare are the result of his clampdown on overpricing that he says was rife in the health system under the last government, with a small group of companies benefiting from government purchases and charging excessive prices.
Health Minister Jorge Alcocer said at Lopez Obrador's regular morning news conference that the problem was not a shortage of money to pay for pharmaceuticals, but that some companies, which he did not name, had not responded to government tenders for drugs.
Previous governments acquired medicines through ten suppliers that provided 80% of the country's total drugs at premium prices, Lopez Obrador said at the news conference.
Last month, he said three Mexican companies would be excluded from future public tenders for medicine. Critics say that decision hit patient care.
""I ask citizens to help us, because we are cleaning the house, the pigsty that they left. It can be an inconvenience that some medicines are really unavailable, but the problem will be resolved, and the health service will be improved.""
""We apologize for the inconvenience,"" he said.
López Obrador said if shortages continue, the government could seek medicines directly from overseas pharmaceutical companies, rather than from Mexican intermediaries.
Under the veteran leftist's administration, which took office in December, purchases have been centralized through the Finance Ministry, as part of a broader push to combat corruption, he said.
Alcocer backed up his points by saying that Mexico previously paid the most of any country in Latin America for antiretrovirals to treat almost 100,000 patients living with the HIV virus.

Dianne Feinstein wants races to stop after a thoroughbred named Kochees was put down Sunday, the 26th such death at the famous Southern California course since Christmas. Horses race at the Santa Anita Horse Park in Arcadia, California, on March 29, 2019. Allen J. Schaben / LA Times via Getty Images file Breaking News Emails May 28, 2019, 2:59 PM UTC By David K. Li U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called for the famed Santa Anita Park outside of Los Angeles to be temporarily shut down after another horse died at the course over the weekend, the 26th such thoroughbred fatality there since Christmas. California's senior senator urged the drastic action after Kochees, a 9-year-old gelding, was euthanized Sunday, marking the third horse death in just nine days. ""How many more horses must die before concrete steps are taken to address what is clearly an acute problem?"" a statement from Feinstein said. She said track conditions and the history of each of the horses' medications have to be carefully scrutinized. ""We need a thorough investigation of practices and conditions at the track before any more races are held,"" Feinstein said. ""I believe we need to carefully review what medications horses are given and under what circumstances, as well as take a close look at the issue of overrunning horses, which may be contributing to deaths."" Representatives for Santa Anita and the track's owner in Canada, the Stronach Group, declined immediate comment Tuesday. But reps for the industry's advocacy group, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA), said Santa Anita shouldn't be forced, even temporarily, out of business. The track's owners and California regulators ""are addressing Sen. Feinstein’s concerns regarding the practices and conditions at Santa Anita Park,"" according to a statement by NTRA CEO Alex Waldrop. In the latest incident, Kochees was injured during the track's sixth race Saturday. Jockey Mario Gutierrez detected a problem following the far turn and Kochees was eased out of running before reaching the top of the stretch. The 26 deaths matches the same number of fatalities from Santa Anita's 2017-18 season. But last year's total came after a full season of 758 races and 5,960 starts by horses, according to the California Horse Racing Board. This year's 26 deaths at the Arcadia track came after just 626 races and 4,636 starts, the regulation body said. Feinstein suggested that horse racing could be on its last legs in the United States. “Tracks in the United States have significantly higher rates of death than tracks overseas,"" according to Feinstein. ""We need to determine what we’re doing wrong in this country and fix it. If we can’t, we need to consider whether horse racing has a future here.” The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has been calling for Santa Anita's shutdown since the start of this run of thoroughbred deaths. PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo renewed that call after Kochees' death. ""Santa Anita and all California tracks must suspend racing until the ongoing investigation by the district attorney is complete and the new rules have been strengthened,"" Guillermo said. ""Nothing short of a zero-fatality rate is acceptable."" The track has said earlier that it has done everything possible to account for track conditions, including a weekslong shutdown in March as authorities studied the racing surface and investigated whether heavy rains this past winter might have weakened the course. Races resumed after the state horse racing board approved a series of safety measures, including limits on certain types of medications administered to horses. ""We need to give these safety reforms the chance to succeed,"" according to Waldrop, the NTRA's CEO. Santa Anita is set to play host to the Breeders' Cup races Nov. 1-2. David K. Li"

San Diego Fire-Rescue was called with a report of a mountain lion attack from Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve at about 2:30 p.m. on Monday.
The boy was with a group of 11 people during the attack. Everyone scattered, except for the boy's father who ""fended off the animal,"" said California Department of Fish and Wildlife Lt. Scott Bringman on Tuesday.
Bringman said the boy was ""extremely lucky.""
""An 80 pound lion could really do some damage, and luckily the dad was there and fended off the animal,"" he said.

The cat was then euthanized and will be tested to confirm the mountain lion was the animal that attacked the boy.
Bringman said animals in the preserve are used to humans because there's so much foot traffic, with some people trying to take pictures with and feed the animals, which is discouraged. The last mountain lion attack there was more than two decades ago.

Supreme Court won't hear challenge to school transgender policy,www.nbcnews.com,Pete Williams,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-won-t-hear-challenge-school-transgender-policy-n1010766,"The U.S. Supreme Court said Tuesday that it will not hear an appeal from Pennsylvania students who claimed a high school's transgender policy violated their privacy, leaving a policy in place that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms matching their gender identity. “This is an enormous victory for transgender students across the country,"" said Ria Tabacco Mar, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.
It's the second time the issue has evaded Supreme Court review. Two years ago, the justices dropped a case that raised the question after the Trump administration canceled an Obama-era policy that would have required schools to accommodate transgender students.
In the case denied Tuesday, students from Boyertown Area School District in central Pennsylvania went to court after the high school began allowing their transgender classmates to use locker rooms and restrooms based on gender identity. One of those bringing the legal challenge, identified in court papers only as Joel Doe, said he felt embarrassed by the policy, stopped changing his clothes in gym class, and eventually left the school entirely.
Five other students joined him in the lawsuit, saying the policy violated their constitutional right to bodily privacy and access to equal educational benefits. But lower courts rejected their claims. The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia, found that the policy served an important interest in preventing discrimination against transgender students, and the Supreme Court left that ruling intact.
""Boyertown’s schools chose to be inclusive and welcoming of transgender students in 2016, a decision the courts have affirmed again and again,"" said the ACLU, which defended the school district's policy in the case. ""This lawsuit sought to reverse that hard-won progress by excluding transgender students from school facilities that other students use. That would have increased the stigma and discrimination that transgender students already face.""
In effect, the legal dispute was about who should be required to use single-user restrooms — transgender students or other students who said the policy made them uncomfortable.
""Forcing a teenager to share a locker room or restroom with a member of the opposite sex can cause embarrassment and distress,"" violating their right to privacy, a court brief filed by the student challengers said.
Opening those areas to transgender students could cause others to feel harassed, violating a federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex, they also argued.
Although the students were named with aliases in court documents, Alexis Lightcap has since graduated. ""My privacy shouldn't depend on what others believe about their own gender,"" she said.
But the school district said no student is required to change clothes in the view of others because privacy safeguards are in place and single-user restrooms are available. Students typically do not undress fully in common areas, few of them shower after gym class, and the school has replaced its community showers with individual shower stalls with curtains, it said.
""The district has a compelling interest in not discriminating against transgender students by excluding them from facilities that match their gender identity,"" the ACLU brief said. It told the story of some of the transgender students. One of them, Aiden DeStefano, was elected to the homecoming court as a boy. When he was allowed to use the boys' locker room, he said, ""I am finally one of the guys, something I have waited for my whole life.""
The Pennsylvania Youth Congress Foundation, which advocates for LGBTQ rights, said only four transgender students at Boyertown High School had been allowed to use restrooms or locker rooms matching their gender identity by the end of the 2016-2017 school year. Because single-use facilities were available, ""No one is required to share a restroom or locker room with a transgender student — or anyone else — if he or she does not want to do so,"" the group said."

They shouted “U.S.A. U.S.A.” Trump called them a “tough bunch of people” and dubbed them “daring and mighty warriors in the Pacific.”
The president treated his appearance aboard the USS Wasp as a Memorial Day event because it was still Monday in the United States when he addressed hundreds of members of the U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet.
“I have to wish you all a very happy Memorial Day,” Trump said. “On this Memorial Day evening in the United States, Americans are concluding a sacred day of remembrance, reflection and prayer.”
Before appearing on the USS Wasp, Trump and first lady Melania Trump visited a Japanese destroyer, the J.S. Kaga, docked nearby. Standing alongside Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump delivered the same “happy Memorial Day” message to the Japanese forces.

Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images Some veterans and their families don’t like the phrase “Happy Memorial Day.” They say they prefer that the federal holiday remain a somber occasion for the nation to honor those who gave their lives in service to the United States.
“Our republic endures because of brave men and women who are willing to lay down their lives to defend us all,” Trump said. “Our freedom is earned through the blood and sweat and toil and sacrifice of great American patriots just like you.”
On Memorial Day, volunteers plant flags on the Boston Common to honor fallen soldiers from MA May 27, 2019 02:00 Trump has come under sharp criticism for skipping ceremonial visits to cemeteries to honor America’s war dead on designated national holidays. Since then, the White House has been careful to show the public that he is marking occasions like Memorial Day and Veterans Day. Before leaving for Japan, Trump placed small U.S. flags near headstones at Arlington National Cemetery.

Trump’s helicopter trips to both ships capped his four-day state visit to Japan . He became the first head of state to meet Japan’s new emperor, Naruhito, since his May 1 ascension to the throne.
The visit also allowed Trump and Abe to spend hours of time together on the golf course, at a sumo wrestling match and in meetings discussing trade, North Korea’s nuclear program, Iran and other bilateral issues.

6 exercises that improve posture and reduce back pain,www.nbcnews.com,Stephanie Mansour,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/6-exercises-improve-posture-reduce-back-pain-ncna1005036,"If you’re sitting at your desk right now — like you do every day for eight-plus hours — there’s a strong chance you feel a twinge of discomfort somewhere. Maybe it’s your lower back that starts to ache . Or your neck and shoulders get stiff by mid-afternoon.
Wherever the pain creeps up, it's may be a sign that prolonged sitting is having an adverse effect on your body. Poor posture may also be to blame.
By now we’ve all heard about the importance of proper posture. It’s good for your muscles, bones, balance, internal organs, and effective in minimizing back pain.
Poor posture and a weak core are two of the underlying causes of back pain — and it's often hard to avoid if you spend a lot of time behind a desk. You may not be able to ditch your desk, but there are simple movements you can do throughout the day to improve your posture to reduce back pain .
Related Stretch it out Stretch it out Back pain? These simple yoga stretches can help We’ve created three types of posture exercises: Seated exercises (that you can do right at your desk), standing exercises (you can perform anywhere in the office — even the elevator) and floor exercises (perform these when you wake up in the morning or get home at night). Each group of exercises focuses on two things: strengthening the upper back to keep the shoulders pulled back and prevent slouching, and stretching exercises to open up the front of the body, specifically the chest. Strengthening the upper back provides the support needed to keep the chest open, so the two work in tandem to help keep you upright (and reduce stress on the back).
Exercises that improve posture and ease back pain Standing exercises These moves can be done when you’re in an elevator, waiting in line or while you’re standing in the office kitchen waiting for your lunch to heat up in the microwave.
Reverse High Five
While standing tall, shrug your shoulders up towards your ears and then relax them down. Turn the palms to face the back of the room. Press the hands back as if you’re trying to give someone a double high five. Pulse 10 times and then rest.
Chest Opener
To stretch the front of the body, clasp your hands behind your back and push down towards the ground while reaching the arms away from the back of your body. Open your chest and lift your head up to feel a stretch across your chest. Hold for 5 breaths, and then release.
Seated exercises These exercises are perfect for the office! You can sit at your desk in an upright chair and perform these stretch and strengthening exercises.
Goalpost Squeeze
While sitting upright, lift your arms up into a goalpost position with your elbows bent at a 90 degree angle even with your shoulders. Relax your shoulders down, and then pull the elbows towards the back of the room. Imagine that you’re squeezing a marble in between your shoulder blades as you work the upper back. Release. Repeat 10 times.
Armpit Opener
To open up the chest, reach the arms out to the sides and up and overhead, clasp the hands at the top. Stretch the arms up, and then bend the elbows towards the back of the room to stretch the chest and armpits. Hold for a breathe, and then straighten the arms back up. Repeat 10 times.
Related Work your core Work your core Ab exercises that are better for your back (and body) than crunches Floor exercises These exercises can be performed in the comfort of your home on a yoga mat, rug or even in bed!
Mini Cobra
Lying down on your stomach, place your hands flat on the ground under your shoulders. Pull your naval in towards your spine, and squeeze your inner thighs together. Rest your forehead down on the ground. This is the starting position. Pretend that you’re pushing a marble forward with your nose, and bring your head forward and up as you press down through your palms to lift your shoulders and chest off the ground. Keep the elbows bent. Squeeze your shoulder blades together to work your upper back even more. Then, slowly lower back down to the ground resting your forehead down. Repeat this 10 times.
Arm Roll Stretch
Lying down on your stomach, reach your right arm out to the right directly in line with your shoulder. Place your left hand on the ground under your left shoulder and use it to gently push your body to the right, rolling towards the right arm (while it remains on the ground). You can bend your left knee and place your left foot flat on the ground behind your right knee for stabilization. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds or 5 deep breaths. Feel the stretch in the front of the chest and in the armpit of the right side. Then repeat to the left side.

Amazon removes books promoting dangerous bleach 'cures' for autism and other illnesses,www.nbcnews.com,Brandy Zadrozny,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/amazon-removes-books-promoting-dangerous-bleach-cures-autism-other-illnesses-n1010861,"Internet Amazon removes books promoting dangerous bleach 'cures' for autism and other conditions The books focus on chlorine dioxide, which doctors and federal regulators say amounts to industrial bleach and can cause permanent harm. Amazon confirmed the removal of the books Tuesday but declined to give details. Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images Breaking News Emails May 28, 2019, 3:56 PM UTC By Brandy Zadrozny Amazon has removed more than a dozen books that unscientifically claim a homemade bleach, chlorine dioxide, can cure conditions ranging from malaria to childhood autism. The books include directions for making and ingesting the concoction, which doctors and federal regulators have warned is dangerous. Amazon confirmed Tuesday that it was no longer selling the books on the topic of chlorine dioxide — a hazardous mix of sodium chlorite and an acid activator such as citric acid, also marketed as Miracle Mineral Solution, or MMS. The Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers that the so-called cure amounts to industrial bleach, has no possible health benefits and can cause permanent harm. The shelved titles include “MMS Health Recovery Guidebook” and “Introducing MMS,” both written by Jim Humble, a former Scientologist and the self-appointed archbishop of a religion devoted to chlorine dioxide. For years, he has claimed the bleach could cure AIDS, cancer, diabetes and almost every other disease. NBC News was unable to reach Humble for comment. Anti-vaccination advocate Andreas Kalcker’s “Forbidden Health,” which promotes chlorine dioxide as an autism cure, was also removed. Kalcker did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move comes a week after an NBC News report on parents who use chlorine dioxide in a misinformed effort to reverse their children’s autism, a developmental disorder with no known cure. In March, after a critical report in Wired, Amazon banned two autism “cure” books, which included Kerri Rivera’s “Healing the Symptoms Known as Autism,” a guide in which she introduced Humble’s bleach recipe to parents of autistic children. Amazon, Facebook and YouTube have scrambled in recent months to answer calls from lawmakers and public health advocates to curtail the spread of anti-vaccination and other health misinformation on their sites. In April, Facebook deleted several chlorine dioxide pages and groups with thousands of members, citing a policy against content that promotes illegal drugs. That same month, YouTube deleted scores of videos and channels with millions of views dedicated to chlorine dioxide, explaining that they violated standards against “content intended to encourage dangerous activities that have an inherent risk of physical harm.” A spokesman for Amazon declined to provide details on Tuesday’s takedown, or whether it may be part of a larger effort to clean up health misinformation on its marketplace.

New Michael Wolff book says Mueller drafted Trump obstruction indictment; special counsel denies,www.nbcnews.com,Dartunorro Clark,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/new-michael-wolff-book-says-mueller-drafted-trump-obstruction-indictment-n1010856,"In a new book, author Michael Wolff says that special counsel Robert Mueller drew up a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against President Donald Trump before deciding to abandon it, the Guardian reported Tuesday. The Guardian said it obtained a copy of the book, ""Siege: Trump Under Fire,"" which has a June 4 release date. The paper also reported that it had reviewed the documents on which Wolff bases his claim that Mueller's team drafted the indictment.
A spokesman for the special counsel's office denied any indictment had been drafted. “The documents that you've described do not exist,"" Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, told NBC News. Carr also gave the same denial to the Guardian.
NBC News has not obtained a copy of the book or reviewed the documents supporting Wolff's claim. ""Siege"" is the sequel to Wolff's best-selling ""Fire and Fury,"" which was published in 2018 and covered the first year of Trump's presidency. The Guardian didn't say whether it had authenticated the documents or if it attempted to do so.
In an author's note, Wolff writes that his findings on the Mueller investigation are ""based on internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel,"" according to the Guardian.
Wolff says that Mueller drafted the indictment under the title, ""United States of America against Donald J Trump, Defendant."" He alleges in the book that the document sat on Mueller’s desk for almost a year, the paper reported.
Eventually, Wolff wrote, Mueller concluded that ""the truth of the matter was straightforward: that while the president had the support of the majority party, he had the winning hand,"" the Guardian said. The paper reported: ""Caught, Wolff says, between wanting to use his full authority and worrying that he had no authority, Mueller went against the will of many of his staff when he chose not to attempt to force Trump to be interviewed in person. Ultimately, he also concluded he could not move to prosecute a sitting president.""
The Guardian says the first count charged the president with corruptly — or by threats of force or threatening communication — influencing, obstructing or impeding a pending proceeding before a department or agency of the United States. The second count charged Trump with tampering with a witness, victim or informant. The third count charged the president with retaliating against a witness, victim or informant.
Wolff says that there were extensive deliberations by Mueller's team over whether to charge the president and whether Trump had the power to fire him or then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the special counsel probe, the paper reported.
In addition to the indictment, the paper reported that Wolff also obtained a draft memorandum of law prepared by Mueller's team opposing an expected motion to dismiss the indictment. The paper reported that the memo obtained by Wolff argues that the law does not say a president cannot be indicted and that the president is no different than other federal officials, all of whom can be indicted, convicted and impeached.
In his 448-page report, Mueller identified 10 episodes that could be considered potential obstruction of justice. He reached no conclusion about whether Trump had obstructed justice, but he did cite the long-standing opinion from the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. Mueller said that his team ""accepted OLC's legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction.""
Barr, in a March letter to Congress sent before the redacted report was made public in April, said that he had decided that Trump did not obstruct the probe. Barr said that they didn't amount to illegal activity by the president and that he disagreed with some of Mueller's legal theories on whether those episodes amounted to obstruction ""as a matter of law.""
Wolff noted that the special counsel probe spawned more than a dozen other investigations that Mueller referred to various prosecutors and resulted in plea deals from former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, Trump ally David Pecker, the head of American Media and Trump Organization official Allen Weisselberg, the paper reported.
""The Jews always flip,"" Wolff claimed Trump said about the plea deals, the paper reported.

Watch Mona Lisa come to life in startling 'deepfake' videos,www.nbcnews.com,"Mindy Weisberger, Live Science",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/watch-mona-lisa-come-life-startling-deepfake-videos-ncna1010871,"The enigmatic, painted smile of the ""Mona Lisa"" is known around the world, but that famous face recently displayed a startling new range of expressions, courtesy of artificial intelligence (AI). In a video shared to YouTube on May 21, three video clips show disconcerting examples of the Mona Lisa as she moves her lips and turns her head. She was created by a convolutional neural network — a type of AI that processes information much as a human brain does, to analyze and process images.
Researchers trained the algorithm to understand facial features' general shapes and how they behave relative to each other, and then to apply that information to still images. The result was a realistic video sequence of new facial expressions from a single frame. [ Can Machines Be Creative? Meet 9 AI 'Artists' ]
For the Mona Lisa videos, the AI ""learned"" facial movement from datasets of three human subjects, producing three very different animations. While each of the three clips was still recognizable as the Mona Lisa, variations in the training models' looks and behavior lent distinct ""personalities"" to the ""living portraits,"" Egor Zakharov, an engineer with the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, and the Samsung AI Center (both located in Moscow), explained in the video.
Related Science Science These robots were built to be punched, stabbed and cursed. Here's why you might want to oblige them. Zakharov and his colleagues also generated animations from photos of 20th-century cultural icons such as Albert Einstein , Marilyn Monroe and Salvador Dali. The researchers described their findings, which were not peer-reviewed, in a study published online May 20 in the preprint journal arXiv .
Producing original videos such as these, known as deepfakes, isn't easy. Human heads are geometrically complex and highly dynamic; 3D models of heads have ""tens of millions of parameters,"" the study authors wrote.
What's more, the human vision system is very good at identifying ""even minor mistakes"" in 3D-modeled human heads, according to the study. Seeing something that looks almost human — but not quite — triggers a sensation of profound unease known as the uncanny valley effect .
AI has previously demonstrated that producing convincing deepfakes is possible, but it required multiple angles of the desired subject. For the new study, the engineers introduced the AI to a very large dataset of reference videos showing human faces in action . The scientists established facial landmarks that would apply to any face, to teach the neural network how faces behave in general.
Then, they trained the AI to use the reference expressions to map movement of the source's features. This enabled the AI to create a deepfake even when it had just one image to work from, the researchers reported.
And more source images delivered an even more detailed result in the final animation. Videos created from 32 images, rather than just one, achieved ""perfect realism"" in a user study, the scientists wrote.

Last abortion clinic in Missouri expects to be shut down this week,www.nbcnews.com,,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/last-abortion-clinic-missouri-expects-be-shut-down-week-n1010876,"The last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri says it expects to be shut down this week, which would effectively end legal abortion in the state. Unless a court intervenes, the closing would make Missouri the only state in the country without an abortion clinic, according to Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood said the state health department ""is refusing to renew"" its St. Louis clinic's license to provide abortions. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which wants to require several doctors who perform abortions at the center to submit to questioning as a condition of renewing the license, did not immediately return a request for comment.
""This is not a drill,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. ""This is not a warning. This is a real public health crisis.""
Planned Parenthood representatives said the organization filed a lawsuit in state court Tuesday asking for a restraining order after the license expires Friday. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.
""If Planned Parenthood’s St. Louis health center cannot provide abortion care, this will be the first time since 1974 that safe, legal abortion care will be inaccessible to people in an entire state,"" Wen said.
Wen said the closure would have an impact on more than 1 million women of reproductive age in Missouri.
""This has nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with politics,"" Wen said.
The expected closure comes amid a wave of anti-abortion laws being passed by state legislatures.
On Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill that criminalizes abortions in the state after eight weeks of pregnancy.
Under the Missouri law that is set to take effect Aug. 28, doctors who violate the eight-week cutoff — which is often before many women are aware they are pregnant — could face five to 15 years in prison. Women who terminate their pregnancies cannot be prosecuted.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri is seeking a statewide vote on the new law. The ACLU said Tuesday that it has submitted a referendum petition to the secretary of state's office as a first step to block and potentially repeal the law that Parson signed last week.
If the petition is approved for circulation, the ACLU would need to gather more than 100,000 signatures to block the law from taking effect and force a referendum in 2020.

By Elisha Fieldstadt A mountain lion suspected of attacking a 4-year-old boy in San Diego was euthanized after the child was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said Tuesday. San Diego Fire-Rescue was called with a report of a mountain lion attack from Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve at about 2:30 p.m. on Monday. The boy was with a group of 11 people during the attack. Everyone scattered, except for the boy’s father who “fended off the animal,” said California Department of Fish and Wildlife Lt. Scott Bringman on Tuesday. Bringman said the boy was “extremely lucky.” “An 80 pound lion could really do some damage, and luckily the dad was there and fended off the animal,” he said.
A reported Mountain Lion attack Rancho Penasquitos Canyon Reserve in California. KNSD The child was taken to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego with non-life-threatening injuries as officials searched for the cat. They found tracks nearby and then encountered a cat with “little fear of humans, which is abnormal behavior for a mountain lion,” according to a statement from the fish and wildlife department. The cat was then euthanized and will be tested to confirm the mountain lion was the animal that attacked the boy. Bringman said animals in the preserve are used to humans because there’s so much foot traffic, with some people trying to take pictures with and feed the animals, which is discouraged. The last mountain lion attack there was more than two decades ago. A call to Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve on Tuesday led to a recording that said the trails there were closed “due to a wildlife issue.” Bringman said the trails would be closed until the animal they euthanized is confirmed to be the one responsible for the attack People who live near the trails said they often see signs posted that warn of wild cats, according to NBC San Diego . Still, people in the area were spooked. “We walk in this canyon all the time, so it is a bit scary that you can get attacked like that,” nearby resident Marcela Reices said. Elisha Fieldstadt "

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., objected to a request Tuesday to pass the disaster aid bill by unanimous consent during a pro forma session. Bill Clark / CQ-Roll Call/ Getty Images Share this — May 28, 2019, 2:35 PM ET / Updated May 28, 2019, 3:05 PM ET By Rebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp V WASHINGTON — For the second time in less than a week, the House on Tuesday failed to pass the Senate-approved $19 billion bill providing disaster aid funding to parts of the United States hit by hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes and wildfires after a Republican lawmaker objected. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., objected to a request to pass the measure by unanimous consent during a pro forma session. If the bill had passed, it would have gone straight to President Donald Trump’s desk for his signature. Most lawmakers are back home in their districts this week for a weeklong Memorial Day recess. ""The speaker of the House should have called a vote on this bill before sending every member of Congress on recess for 10 days, and I object,"" Massie said on the floor. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters afterward that the chamber will again attempt to pass the bill by unanimous consent Thursday. If it's blocked once again, the full House would be poised to pass the bill when lawmakers return the week of June 3. ""House Republicans need to immediately end this shameful sabotage, and allow the House to pass the bill that the bipartisan Senate has finally agreed to,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. ""How many more communities need to suffer before Republicans end their political games?” Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., slammed Massie's move Tuesday on Twitter, calling it an example of a politician ""putting their own self-interest ahead of the national interest."" On Friday, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, objected during a similar vote, saying the bill didn't address the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border and that it was not paid for. ""Our nation is strong enough, and compassionate enough, to have a responsive and fiscally responsive approach to help people who are hurting in the wake of natural disasters,"" he said. The Senate passed the bill last Thursday in a 85-8 vote after a deal was struck among negotiators. Trump signed off on the parameters of the agreement Thursday afternoon, which excludes $4.5 billion in border funding that the White House and the Republicans kept demanding. The bill would provide about $900 million to Puerto Rico, which was ravaged by Hurricane Maria in 2017. That money would go toward nutrition assistance and a community development block grant, both of which were key Democratic priorities. Funding for Puerto Rico had long been a sticking point in negotiations because Trump was opposed to giving the territory more aid. In April, he falsely claimed on Twitter that “Puerto Rico got 91 billion dollars for the hurricane "" when the federal government had only allocated $40 billion for the island's recovery and most of it hasn't yet arrived.

Biden campaign slams Trump for North Korea comments,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/biden-campaign-slams-trump-north-korea-comments-n1010951,"Former Vice President Joe Biden's 2020 campaign hit back at President Donald Trump on Tuesday after the commander in chief Quote: d North Korea's criticisms of Biden while in Japan over the weekend. ""The President’s comments are beneath the dignity of the office,"" Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement released shortly after Trump returned to the United States. ""To be on foreign soil, on Memorial Day, and to side repeatedly with a murderous dictator against a fellow American and former Vice President speaks for itself.""
""And it’s part of a pattern of embracing autocrats at the expense of our institutions — whether taking Putin’s word at face value in Helsinki or exchanging 'love letters' with Kim Jong Un,” Bedingfield continued, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the North Korean leader.
Trump and Kim held a summit in Singapore in 2018 to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Another summit followed in February 2019 in Hanoi but was cut short without an agreement.
On Saturday, Trump tweeted about recent North Korean missile tests , saying that he is confident in his relationship with Kim and quoting an editorial published by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency that derided Biden with a series of insults, including that he has a ""low IQ.""
""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" Trump tweeted. ""I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?""
North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 The Trump campaign on Tuesday called the Biden campaign's response to the president's tweet ""rich"" given Biden's remarks criticizing the administration's policies while in Germany earlier this year.
""But unlike the Obama-Biden administration, which failed to make any progress with North Korea, President Trump has actually increased pressure and gotten them to the negotiating table,"" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""If you want an example of ‘siding with a murderous dictator,’ how about the disastrous Iran nuclear deal? Or failing to follow through on the ‘red line’ with Syria? From the Iraq war to the Russia reset, Joe Biden has been wrong on virtually every foreign policy call in the last four decades. Just ask former Obama Defense Secretary Robert Gates.”
Trump also responded later Tuesday, saying he was really ""sticking up"" for Biden because his phrasing in the tweet was ""softer"" than the terms used by the Korean Central News Agency.
""Kim Jong Un called him a 'low IQ idiot,' and many other things, whereas I related the Quote: of Chairman Kim as a much softer 'low IQ individual.' Who could possibly be upset with that?"" the president tweeted.
I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a “low IQ idiot,” and many other things, whereas I related the Quote: of Chairman Kim as a much softer “low IQ individual.” Who could possibly be upset with that?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2019 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday that both Trump and Kim ""agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden.”
“I think they agree in their assessment of former Vice President Joe Biden,” Sanders said, speaking from Japan, where she accompanied the president. “The president doesn't need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden. He's given his own assessment a number of times. I think you've seen it. I'm sure you've covered it on your program. The president watched him and his administration with President Obama fail for eight years.”
During his campaign launch in Philadelphia earlier this month, Biden criticized Trump for his relationships with Kim and Putin. He asked the crowd, “Are we a nation that embraces dictators and tyrants like Putin and Kim Jong Un?”
Days later, the Korean Central News Agency blasted Biden for “rhetoric slandering the supreme leadership"" of North Korea, and claimed the former vice president “has gone reckless and senseless, seized by ambition for power.”
“What he uttered is just sophism of an imbecile bereft of elementary quality as a human being, let alone a politician,” the state-run news agency said.
Biden and Trump have sparred since the former vice president entered the 2020 race. Biden has called Trump the “divider-in-chief,” and Trump has sent out numerous Twitter missives aimed at Biden, whom he has called “SleepyCreepy Joe.” Trump also called Biden a ""low-IQ individual"" in a March tweet.
Some Republican members of Congress criticized the president for quoting North Korea's insults of Biden over the holiday weekend.
""Wrong for @POTUS Trump to criticize @JoeBiden in Japan and to agree with Kim Jong-un,"" New York Rep. Pete King tweeted Monday. ""Politics stops at water’s edge. Never right to side with murderous dictator vs. fellow American.""
Wrong for @POTUS Trump to criticize @JoeBiden in Japan and to agree with Kim Jong-un. Politics stops at water’s edge. Never right to side with murderous dictator vs. fellow American.
— Rep. Pete King (@RepPeteKing) May 27, 2019 ""It’s Memorial Day Weekend and you’re taking a shot at Biden while praising a dictator,"" Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted Sunday. ""This is just plain wrong.""
It’s Memorial Day Weekend and you’re taking a shot at Biden while praising a dictator. This is just plain wrong. https://t.co/2ONOGEmy39
— Adam Kinzinger (@RepKinzinger) May 26, 2019 Trump's comment on Saturday was part of a string of tweets aimed at Biden over the holiday weekend. On Monday, Trump criticized Biden, former Democratic senator from Delaware, for his role in passing the 1994 crime bill as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
“Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you,” Trump tweeted Monday. “I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!”
“Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing,” Trump wrote in a second tweet . “That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!”
Biden has claimed the bill did not spur mass incarceration, as critics of the legislation contend. But former President Bill Clinton, who signed the bill into law, said in 2015 that it “made the problem worse.""
Earlier this month, another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, took issue with Biden's claim about the legislation, saying it ""encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three-strikes law.""
“It funded the building of more prisons in the states,"" she said. ""So I disagree, sadly.”

By Gwen Aviles - Advertisement - Shaving for the first time is a special occasion for many, but for Samson Bonkeabantu Brown, the experience was particularly significant — and public. The Toronto-based transgender artist had what appears to be his very first shaving experience recorded and posted to the Facebook page of Gillette . It’s the razor and shaving cream maker’s first ad featuring a transgender man. “Growing up, I was always trying to figure out what kind of man I wanted to become,” Brown says in the video’s opening. “I always knew I was different. I didn’t know there was a term for the type of person that I was.” Just before the video cuts to Brown holding a razor, he says, “I’m glad I’m at the point where I’m able to shave.” With shaving cream on his face, Brown nervously holds the razor as his father guides him. “Now don’t be scared,” Brown’s father says. “Shaving is about being confident.” The video — which has been viewed over a million times since its launch Thursday — ends with Gillette’s slogan: “The best a man can get.” When asked about the ad, a Gillette spokesperson said the company supports “everyone in their journey to looking, feeling and acting their best every day.” “Gender conversations are happening all around us and we believe brands play a role in influencing culture and have a responsibility to use their voice to champion issues of great relevance to both the brand and our customers,” spokesperson Corey Manuel said in an emailed statement. In a public post on his personal Facebook page, Brown said he wanted to include his father in the video since his dad has been one of his main supporters throughout his transitioning process. “I’m keenly aware of how blessed I am to be able to exist in this world being supported by my family in ways that all too often many of my trans brothers, sisters, and siblings who exist outside the binary are not always as fortunate,” Brown wrote. The ad has received widespread, positive feedback — especially from transgender individuals who see themselves represented onscreen. “This commercial made me cry,” Asher Shaun Jensen wrote on Facebook. “You have videos on how to shave on your YouTube which helped immensely as my dad does not support me. You’re making a difference, and I appreciate it greatly.” “My first shave was made with my husband because my dad passed away years before I started to transition last year and thank you! This makes me feel so good this morning at work,” Lee Stephens wrote on Facebook. Brown said he hopes the ad will continue to inspire people. “I am confident that this ad will encourage many of my trans siblings and fill them with the knowledge that our existence in this world can be filled with the love and support we deserve,” he wrote on his Facebook page.
