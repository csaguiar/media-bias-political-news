American Tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and Tour Guide Jean Paul Mirenge Reportedly Found Alive in Uganda,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau) Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/american-tourist-kimberly-sue-endicott-and-tour-guide-jean-paul-mirenge-reported-found-in-uganda,"04.07.19 1:11 PM ET ISAAC KASAMANI/Getty
Kimberly Sue Endicott, the American tourist from Costa Mesa, California, who was kidnapped along with her tour guide on a safari in Uganda were rescued alive, according to local authorities.
“She has been located and rescued unharmed,” Uganda military spokesman Brigadier Richard Karemire told Reuters . Police said on Twitter that the Endicott and her Congolese tour guide “are in good health” and “in the safe hands” of security officials.
Citing a spokesperson for Wild Frontiers Uganda and authorities, ABC News reported that Endicott and her Congolese tour guide were returned to a lodge at Queen Elizabeth National Park. Uganda’s police force said the pair was “rescued” but did not provide specifics. The kidnappers have reportedly escaped .
Endicott, who reportedly owns a small skin-care shop and is in her mid-50’s, has been missing since Tuesday when four kidnappers stopped the safari group at gunpoint in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Endicott reportedly has a daughter and a granddaughter.
Her 48-year-old driver, Jean-Paul Mirgene Remezo, was also taken in the kidnapping. Two elderly tourists with the group were left in the safari jeep.
Local police say the kidnappers used Endicott’s mobile phone to demand a $500,000 ransom. Cops believe the motive behind the kidnapping was financial, mainly because the men quickly made their demand for the money using Endicott’s cellphone.
The kidnappers have reportedly been trying to negotiate her release. It was not clear if any money was exchanged and, if so, how much.
Kidnappings of this nature are rare in Uganda, Reuters reports. The most recent high-profile kidnapping occurred in 1999, when eight tourists and four guides were killed in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, just south of Queen Elizabeth National Park. READ THIS LIST"
"The Rise And Fall Of ""Oil Trading God"" Andy Hall | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-07/rise-and-fall-oil-trading-god-andy-hall,"0 SHARES
Andy Hall is arguably the most successful oil trader of his generation. His career spanned nearly 45 years and he amassed himself a fortune while earning a reputation for being on the right side of some of the largest price swings in the market's history (at least until the last one). He also helped play a role in creating the modern oil trading industry. Despite rarely talking to the press, he made headlines when, during the financial crisis, he fought for a $100 million bonus at Citigroup.
Hall recently told the Financial Times : “I always thought speaking to the press would be an act of hubris. Whenever you start reading about people on the front page of the Financial Times or Wall Street Journal, it’s usually the top. So, I just thought, one way of avoiding that is just to avoid any publicity and, also, who needs it?” Hall at Oxford in the 70's (Photo: FT)
Hall is now less worried about jinxing himself by talking to the press, two years after shutting down his hedge fund. At the annual FT commodities summit, he finally opened up about the oil market and some of his biggest trades.
One of his most memorable trades earned him the nickname ""God"" among his peers and took place during 1991 , when Iraq was planning to invade Kuwait. Hall was working at commodity trader Phibro at the time. Oil prices were down and tension among OPEC members was high. Hall was working on using the low price to pioneer a method of trading that's now common: loading up tankers at seas to store crude, while locking in higher prices for later delivery in the futures market.
Hall said of his strategy while at Phibro: “It was a no-brainer but people weren’t set up to do this. We [however] had probably the biggest chartering operation in the world at that time.”
And this was exactly the strategy he employed: “I don’t know exactly how many tankers we had. But I know I got a call from John Gutfreund [chief executive of Salomon, Phibro’s then-parent group] saying, ‘Hey, Andy, you guys never normally use any capital, and they’re telling me you’ve got hundreds of millions of dollars of working capital usage this month.’”
After sitting on tons of cheap oil, Hall recognized that Saddam Hussein was likely going to invade Kuwait and realized he had the potential for a career defining trade. He removed a portion of his hedges against the trade, leaving his cargoes fully exposed to the volatility in oil prices. The losses would have been astronomical if he was wrong.
But he wasn't. And Hall recalled the catalyst playing out in front of his eyes: “And, then, he invaded. I remember the night very well. I got a call at one o’clock in the morning from either our Tokyo office or our Singapore office saying there are Iraqi tanks in Kuwait City. ‘So, what’s the oil market doing?’ And, he said, ‘Well, there are bids $6 a barrel above New York’s close.’ ‘And where are the offers?’ ‘There aren’t any offers.’ ” Hall and his wife (Photo: FT)
Oil jumped 10% the next day in New York. Within months, it had doubled. By the time it fell, Phibro and Hall were long gone from the trade.
15 years later, Hall's Phibro, now a part of Citigroup, had become its own institution. Hall once again decided to bet big around the turn of the century: he saw China's economy and its 1.4 billion consumers as an opportunity. Seeing that new demand was going to need to be met, Hall bought hundreds of millions in long dated oil contracts, believing the price would rise.
The trade was another grand slam. Between 2003 and the summer of 2008, oil went from $25 to an all-time peak of $147. Hall nearly top ticked the trade, cashing out at about $140, just as the financial crisis was becoming clear.
“It’s all very well identifying the point to get in, but then you’ve also got to identify the point to get out,” he told FT.
And Hall continued to be successful despite the fact that Citigroup needed a $45 billion bailout from the government. He bought back into the market around $30 in early 2009, before crude rebounded to $80. But the $100 million bonus Hall had earned from his success during the austere environment of the crisis wound up backfiring and turning him into a target.
Hall was unrepentant about his bonus and fought for his $100 million from Citigroup, which he got:
“The problem for them was that I had a contract with Citigroup and there was no obvious way for Citigroup to break it, and I think Ken Feinberg was smart enough to figure that out. So he came up with a sort of nifty solution to the problem which was, ‘All right, well, Mr Hall can get his money because he’s contractually entitled to it but, you, Citigroup, are going to have get rid of Mr Hall and the company he runs.’ I’m a relatively wealthy person but I will tell you this, I doubt whether many people of my wealth have paid as much in taxes as I have.”
Citi ultimately wound up selling Phibro to Occidental Petroleum in 2010, a move that impinged on the freedom Hall was accustomed to.
“Frankly, after 20-odd years of benign neglect, to suddenly have a weekly management call, I think, was killing me,” Hall recalls. At the same time, Hall was managing a hedge fund for Blackstone, Astenbeck Capital, which he helped grow to $4 billion.
But then, as it eventually happens to everyone, Hall's luck ran out. In 2017, Hall shocked the market one last time: he hung up his ""oil trading spurs"" and shut down his flagship Astenbeck Master Commodities Fund II after it was creamed 30% through June of the year. Hall told his investors in July 2017 that the global crude market had ""materially worsened"" and blamed his poor performance on the fact that OPEC had little control of the oil markets.
“If I was put in a time machine, would I choose to do it all again? Probably not. I guess I should have built a computer in my parents’ garage. Or perhaps become an art dealer in my late twenties. I guess I enjoyed it, though. At times it was quite stressful. But it allowed me to pursue my passions. But I’m not looking back. I’m looking forward. I’ve got a lot more things to do. I don’t see my career as over by any means."" Tags "
GOP Rep. Introduces the 'Green Real Deal' • Mateus Kadesh • iPatriot,ipatriot.com,Mateus Kadesh,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://ipatriot.com/gop-rep-introduces-the-green-real-deal/,"Flip
Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) is tired of the fantasy world that socialist Democrats seem to be living in.
In an effort to help them maintain their grip on reality he recently introduced his “Green Real Deal” as a realistic response to Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s work of science fiction called the “Green New Deal.”
History will judge harshly my Republican colleagues who deny the science of climate change. Similarly, those Democrats who would use climate change as a basis to regulate out of existence the American experience will face the harsh reality that their ideas will fail. Latest: Pro-Life Movie 'Surprises' Hollywood Haters
Today along with other members of Congress, I’ll be filing a Green Real Deal, a common sense rebuttal to the Green New Deal. The Green Real Deal rejects regulation as the driving force of reform, and instead unlocks the unlimited potential of American innovation and ingenuity. The question for America is pretty simple, either we want a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington telling us what we can’t do, or we empower American innovators to unlock things that we can do. take our poll - story continues below Should Trump go on the offensive after Mueller vindication? Should Trump go on the offensive after Mueller vindication? Should Trump go on the offensive after Mueller vindication? * Yes, he should go after all of the dirty Democrats. No, he's in the clear.

Do we really believe that if we outlaw cows, cars, planes, and buildings that the rest of the world will follow? Of course, they won’t, they will laugh at us…
Unilaterally disarming the American economy through crushing regulations will empower Washington but few others. Our rise in global leadership on climate must be fueled by American innovators and I have a plan to support them.
The Green Real Deal establishes four platforms for American innovators to utilize, exploit, and deploy for their success…
Look, I’ll look for support anywhere I can take it. I was pitching these ideas to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez a few minutes ago, there are some that I think we agree on and some that we don’t. Right now we have a Congress that won’t even have a serious debate about the way to address climate change because we’ve got either focus on frivolous other attacks on the president or we’ve got too many Republicans who deny the science of climate change.

Glaciers blanketed the globe all the way to the equator in one of the mysterious “Snowball Earth” events geologists think occurred at least twice in Earth’s ancient past. Now, scientists have found that the final snowball episode likely ended in a flash about 635 million years ago—a geologically fast event that may have implications for today’s human-driven global warming. The ice, which built up over several thousand years, “melted in no more than 1 million years,” says Shuhai Xiao, a paleobiologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg who was part of the team that made the discovery. That’s the blink of an eye in our planet’s 4.56-billion-year history, suggesting the globe reached a sudden tipping point, Xiao says. Although the team doesn’t know for certain what caused it, carbon dioxide emitted by ancient volcanoes may have triggered a greenhouse event, causing the ice sheets to thaw rapidly.

Archaeologists Solve Mystery of Terracotta Army’s Pristine Weapons,lunaticoutpost.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://lunaticoutpost.com/thread-120773.html,"Archaeologists Solve Mystery of Terracotta Army’s Pristine Weapons Advertisement The world-famous Terracotta Army of Xi’an is an array of life-sized, realistic ceramic figures representing warriors, stationed in three large pits within the mausoleum of Qin Shihuang (259-210 BCE), the first emperor of a unified China. Over two thousand ceramic warriors have been excavated so far, and it is estimated that several thousand more remain buried. These warriors were armed with fully functional weapons made primarily of bronze — dozens of spears, lances, hooks, swords, crossbow triggers and as many as 40,000 arrow heads have all been recovered. The preservation of the bronze is remarkably good overall, with many of the weapons displaying shiny, almost pristine surfaces and sharp blades. A new study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, reveals that the chemical composition and characteristics of the surrounding soil, rather than the chrome plating (once thought to be the earliest form of anti-rust technology), may be responsible for the weapons’ preservation power.

Pacifici on Apr 7, 2019
BoingBoing : “ Sharon Ringel and Angela Woodall have published a comprehensive, in-depth look at the state of news archiving in the digital age , working under the auspices of the Tow Center at the Columbia Journalism Review; it’s an excellent, well-researched report and paints an alarming picture of the erosion of the institutional memories of news organizations. Ringel and Woodall find that news organizations are cavalier, even negligent, about archiving their news, and contrast this with the heyday of newspapers where dedicated librarians staffed a “morgue” of carefully clipped and cross-referenced print articles. By contrast, today’s news organizations rely primarily on their CMSes, the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, reporters’ personal Google Docs accounts, and social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to store their articles, social media posts, and other materials.Although the Internet Archive has done yeoman service in this field, Ringel and Woodall are rightfully skeptical that a single institution should be entrusted with being the sole entity recording our collective history — not least because the Archive only saves pages it discovers in its crawls, and cannot traverse paywalls (let alone recording alternative headlines, associated social media posts, comments, personalized layouts shown to logged-in users, etc)…”"

But it was weird - I could look at it through a camera and it wasnt too bright.
It was made out of black lines, all intermingling with each other.
Parts of the sun were escaping and leaving the sun and it was getting smaller.
What does this dream mean?"

As local elections draw near, Green Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid is entering into his final weeks of office. In his typically irreverent style, Magid entertained councillors at his last full council meeting as Lord Mayor, getting them to dance to Somali music:
https://twitter.com/MagicMagid/status/1113518347495387136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw
But he also had some serious messages this week before his tenure comes to a close. In a farewell statement to the Mayoralty, Magid spoke of the importance of young people in politics. He said :
Whether you graced the Town Hall with your visits or if we stood shoulder to shoulder, demanding urgent change, for the sake of your future and the future of our planet. You should know that you are now and forever my real inspiration.
You are my real fuel to keep fighting for a better world, without fear, without holding back. Your passion empowers us, and your sense of priorities and urgency keep us in check. I am, and will be, eternally grateful.
I’m not a hero or perfect in any way. But I hope I’ve used this platform well enough to get you thinking more critically about politics, and how it affects everything and everyone.
I may not be lord mayor for much longer, but the battle to save the world will not end anytime soon.
From my end, I make a pledge to fight by your side, to carry you with me wherever I go and in every decision I make, with your best interests at heart.
Subsequently, residents of Sheffield have been sharing their tributes to the outgoing Lord Mayor. One person said:
I personally think he’s had a great term. His title gives him little power in the grand scheme of things so his role is to engage with the community. He’s raised loads for charity and engaged some of the younger generation in Sheffield in politics. Hats off.
With Magid now setting his sights on potential European parliamentary elections, it’s unlikely we’ve seen the end of his career at the forefront of Green politics just yet.
Scottish Green Party conference takes place in Edinburgh The Scottish Green Party has hosted its spring conference in Edinburgh this weekend. Held at a turbulent time for politics in Scotland and across the whole of the UK, the party used the opportunity to set out its vision for Scotland, and its responses to the challenges of the day.
Speaking to the press at the conference, Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie called for the SNP to make clear its timeline for holding a second Scottish independence referendum. The Scottish Greens are in favour of independence, and are calling for a fresh vote in light of the chaos caused by Brexit. Speaking to the BBC, he said :
I understand why some in the SNP want to wait for clarity on Brexit before they decide on the timing of the independence question in the future.
The trouble is that clarity may not be coming around the corner. If there’s an extension even of months, possibly longer, then that clarity won’t be emerging, and we may miss the window of opportunity in this session of the Scottish Parliament.
I don’t want to see that opportunity missed, and the reality is there has already been a material change of circumstances in Scotland.
I think we very clearly do need some clarity from the Scottish Government about what’s going to happen with the timing of an independence referendum. We need to have the time to pass legislation through the Scottish Parliament to ensure that that’ll happen, and we have a majority for that at the moment.
But we also need in principle a clear defence of the fact that Scotland has the right to make this decision.
Elsewhere at the conference, Maggie Chapman – the party’s other co-convener – gave a powerful speech , also heavily contextualised by Brexit. But she also focused on the wider political framework in which Brexit is situated, hitting out at neoliberalism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher.
Chapman said:
We have had 40 years of an economic system, propped up and enabled by a pathetic yet oppressive political system that has alienated people, marginalised communities, and destroyed so much of the planet. Neo-liberalism, with Thatcherism and its continuation in New Labour Blairism, has acted like a cancer.
It has eaten away at the very essence of what it means to be human. It refuses to accept that there is intrinsic value in caring for others, in being creative, and in cooperating with each other rather than competing for everything.
It has spread its tentacles into every aspect of our lives. It is destroying the NHS south of the border and the welfare state, commodifying education and culture, inflating housing bubbles and creating crippling debt.
And while it knows the price of everything, it understands the value of nothing. It exploits human labour, decimates non-human species, and pollutes our life support systems.
Chapman also set out a message of hope that can shift society away from neoliberalism. She highlighted the work of social movements, and in particular congratulated the work of the school climate strikes:
We’ve had 40 years of failed top-down approaches to tackling climate breakdown. The school strike movement is a real example of social movement driven change. I’ve said before that now is the time to be radical. This is what I mean by that. This is important because it’s exactly what we need right now.
Greens speak out against Sultan of Brunei Image credit: Twitter screengrab
Chapman’s speech to the Scottish Green Party conference wasn’t her only prominent intervention this week. She was also vocal in her condemnation of the Sultan of Brunei, over the country’s recent law change which would see homosexuality punished with the death penalty by stoning .
Alongside her role in the Scottish Greens, Chapman is also the Rector of Aberdeen University. And this week she used her position to call for the university to strip the Sultan of Brunei of an honour the institution had bestowed upon him.
Chapman said:
Honorary degrees are given in recognition of great achievement, of great work, but we cannot as an institution say that those are not affected by broader concerns.
The recent changes to the law in Brunei against people who identify as different sexualities is just completely unacceptable.
We really, really have to take a stand on this, and stand in solidarity.
She was also joined by other Greens. LGBTIQA+ Greens [of England and Wales] co-chair and London Assembly list candidate Benali Hamdache was involved in coordinating a protest in London against the new homophobic laws.
Hamdache was interviewed at the protest by Sky News, in which he described how the world has reacted in “horror” to the developments in Brunei:
Me on Sky earlier. It's really clear it's time to #BoycottBrunei
Our government also has to act. @MarkFieldUK the Sultan of Brunei is not a ""Great Friend"" to UK. @Jeremy_Hunt you must make it clear that if Brunei does not change course, they will be kicked out the Commonwealth pic.twitter.com/PVo0fV6fXd

Amelia Womack achieves best ever Green vote in Newport West Image credit: Rosie Rawle
In a by-election in the South Wales constituency of Newport West, Ruth Jones held the seat for Labour. The seat was reasonably safe, having previously been held by the popular and much loved MP Paul Flynn.
However, Green Party of England and Wales Deputy Leader Amelia Womack fought hard to increase the Green vote in the by-election. In doing so, she successfully delivered the highest ever Green vote share in Newport West in history. At 3.9% , this was more than three times higher than the vote share received by the party in the 2017 General Election. Womack also received almost double the number of votes Greens won last time, despite turnout having nearly halved.
Scottish Greens seek to oust UKIP MEP Creative Commons: Ric Lander
As the UK looks ever more likely to be participating in the forthcoming European Parliamentary elections, the Scottish Green Party has made clear its intentions. It wants to remove UKIP MEP David Coburn.
Writing in the National , Scottish Green Party Co-Convener Patrick Harvie said:
The Scottish Greens would jump at the chance to help Scotland unburden itself of its bizarrely incoherent far-right MEP, and to elect someone who can make the case in Europe for the Green New Deal Scotland needs.
An MEP who will advocate for an urgent and radical shift away from the oil and gas industry and into clean energy, and ending our reliance on arms manufacturers and corporate tax dodgers, in favour of an economy that puts the public interest first, working in partnership as part of the European family we belong to.
In the last European Parliament elections , the Scottish Greens came just 2.4% behind UKIP, who picked up the final seat in the Scotland constituency. Had just 40,000 SNP, Labour or Liberal Democrat voters lent their votes to the Greens, they could have stopped UKIP electing an MEP, while not harming their preferred party’s representation.
Caroline Lucas faces off with aviation industry on BBC debate Commons: GPEW
Green MP Caroline Lucas was in Bristol this week, appearing on an episode of Radio 4′ s Any Questions? . Also appearing on the show was Labour’s Barry Gardiner, Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng and a member of aviation company Airbus’ senior management.
In a heated segment on the show, Lucas hit out at the aviation industry and its role in driving climate change. She alleged that aviation contributes around eight to nine percent of greenhouse gas emissions.
She went on to explain the urgency of the need to take action on climate change and to invest in decent public transport:
we’ve got 11 years in which to halve global climate emissions. I mean, that is a really extraordinary deadline in a way – it’s incredibly close. And you can’t kind of bargain with the climate. It doesn’t matter that you might be trying your best or you’re making planes a bit more efficient… Of course flying is a wonderful thing to be able to do, but why on earth are we celebrating the fact that just down the road, they’re now starting flights between Heathrow and Newquay in Cornwall? Why aren’t we investing in a decent rail service that people can depend on?
London Green Party announce candidates for potential European Parliament elections This week, London Green Party announced its slate of 8 candidates to fight the elections.
The candidates are as follows:
Scott Ainslie Gulnar Hasnain Shahrar Ali Rachel Collinson Eleanor Margolies Remco van der Stoep Kirsten de Keyser Peter Underwood In the event the elections do take place, Ainslie will be fighting to secure a Green seat in London to replace Jean Lambert as the outgoing MEP.
The announcement of the London list comes after the North West announced their candidates last week .

Brexit decisions week for Britain…..,politicaldog101.com,jamesb,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://politicaldog101.com/2019/04/brexit-decisions-week-for-britain/,"Brexit decisions week for Britain….. April 7, 2019
Maybe?
This whole thing could go on for months and even YEARS it looks like…. It’s crunch week. Britain is due to leave the EU without any kind of deal on Friday — an outcome only the most extreme Brexiteers want. Between the lines: Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar summed up the sentiment on Friday. “None of us want a no-deal next week,” he said. “I know the UK doesn’t want it, and Europe doesn’t want it either.” At the same time, as the second deadline approaches (March 29 has already been and gone), Varadkar was adamant that “we don’t want to have a rolling cliff-edge” with extension after extension. Brexit has already cost the U.K. 2.5% of GDP since the referendum, or about $40 billion per year, according to an estimate from Goldman Sachs, and that’s while the nation was still part of the EU. The cost to the rest of the EU has been significant too, largely driven by uncertainty. While almost no one wants the U.K. to leave the EU, Europe’s willingness to tolerate the deafening chaos from across the channel is shrinking to zero, especially in France. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May did give Remainers a glimmer of hope on Friday. Writing an official letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, she for the first time admitted that she was willing and able to hold European Parliament elections on May 23. Her party hates the idea of contesting European elections, but her government is now making all necessary preparations for that vote. May added that she would prefer to leave the EU before that date and cancel the election, but Parliament has repeatedly voted down all her attempts to do so….

It’s NOT really a big fight…
With a new House majority?
Democrats in the House are not in any mood to give it away…
While Progressive/Lefties in the party may want things to be wide open for anybody?
Common sense means you protect those who enable you to even have a majority…
THAT mean’s party unity over pure ideology ….
THAT means the party doesn’t go running headlong to the left for EVERYBODY….
‘Different Strokes for Different Folks’….
What works in a pure Democratic district is NOT gonna work in a district that was won from aa Trump Republican last November….
Liberal’s beating a moderate in a primary only to get blown out in the election is kinda stupid….. The House Democratic campaign arm is on the verge of open warfare with the party’s rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard-fought campaign next year to preserve the party’s shaky majority. Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge, went so far as to encourage her 3.8 million Twitter followers to “pause” their donations to the campaign committee in protest. Ms. Bustos’s rule prohibits Democratic consultants and vendors working for a primary challenger to an incumbent from receiving work from the committee. It comes as ardent liberal organizations such as Justice Democrats, emboldened by a pair of high-profile wins in 2018 — Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez — are aggressively gearing up to challenge centrist or old-line Democrats with liberal candidates. In the latest swipe in a fight that has erupted into open hostilities, a coalition of progressive groups on Friday introduced an online database of go-to vendors for insurgent candidates emblazoned with the heading, “Despite the D.C.C.C.’s bullying, we’re still going to work on primaries.” One group, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Friday that it was exploring a challenge against Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, because he has not committed to holding hearings on the single-payer health care system known as “Medicare for all.” At the helm of that panel, Mr. Neal has been on the front lines of conducting oversight on President Trump’s finances, and last week requested six years of his personal tax returns. “We reject the D.C.C.C.’s attempt to hoard power, which will only serve to keep that talent pool — and Congress itself — disproportionately white and male,” María Urbina, the national political director for Indivisible, a progressive grass-roots group, said of the campaign committee. “Incumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldn’t fear primaries and shouldn’t rely on the national institutions like the D.C.C.C. to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say.” Party leaders and the campaign arm have stood by Ms. Bustos’s moves, arguing that the committee’s mandate is to protect the new majority by protecting incumbents — and that putting a longstanding rule in writing simply increases transparency. Primary challenges, even in solid Democratic districts, harm the mission of holding the majority, they argue, because incumbents fighting a primary challenge cannot raise money and help other Democrats in more marginal districts. “I support the notion that the primary purpose of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is to elect Democrats in tough districts, so we can either win the majority or hold the majority,” said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 Democrat…..

She’s THAT confident….Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is guaranteeing that Democrats will keep control of the House in the 2020 elections.
Pelosi said in an interview with The Washington Post published Sunday that she will secure the majority by this November, a full year before the elections. “I’m going to have our races won by this November,” she said. She added that, by Thanksgiving, possible GOP challengers will “think twice” about running against Democrats. She also warned Republicans in swing seats that “some of you are vulnerable.” “It’s going to cost you millions of dollars, to win or lose. And if you win — say you win — you’re in the minority,” Pelosi added. Her remarks come after Democrats regained control of the House in the 2018 midterms with a net gain of 40 seats in the elections."

Daniel, a video led me to look for something that that led me to find something I read just before watching your video. At the end of your video it asks the question, ""have proponents of man-made global warming been proven correct?"" Then it states, ""In times past, people understood that the human mind and states of collective human experience influence cosmic and earthly phenomena.""
I think ""collective human experience"" most likely did not cause at least most of what we saw in your video. As I said, just before watching your video I read an article. It was titled ""The Ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction: ""Owning the Weather"" for Military Use."" I found there are many articles on ""Weather Weapons."" The article fits perfectly for explaining the so many severe ""weather events"" in your video for events in just March this year.
I think it is weather weaponization. And, I think it will only get much worse. Global warming? I am beginning to think it might well be a creation using weaponized weather.
Let me know what you think. I have only read the Global Research article but I will read some of the others I found when searching on ""Weather Weapons.""
Is it possible ""they"" have duped us into thinking that only CO2 is to blame for global warming so they can manipulate us into going along with things like Agenda 21 and whatever else?

Why didn't Boeing do it right? Why isn't Facebook protecting user passwords? Why is Phillip Morris allowed to promote vaping? Why hasn't Wells Fargo reformed itself? Why hasn't Monsanto (now owned by Bayer) recalled its Roundup weed killer?
Answer: corporate greed coupled with inept and corrupt regulators.
These are just a few of the examples in the news these days of corporate harms inflicted on innocent people. - Advertisement -
To be sure, some began before the Trump administration. But Trump and his appointees have unambiguously signaled to corporations that they can now do as they please.
Boeing wanted to get its 737 Max 8 out quickly because airlines want to pack in more passengers at lower fuel costs (hence the ""max""). But neither Boeing nor the airlines shelled out money to adequately train pilots on the new software made necessary by the new design.
Nonetheless, Trump's Federal Aviation Administration certified the plane in March 2017. And after two subsequent deadly crashes, the United States was slower to ground the planes than other countries. - Advertisement -
Last month, Facebook admitted to storing hundreds of millions of Facebook users' passwords in plain text that could be searched by more than 20,000 Facebook employees. The admission came just a year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Facebook shared the personal data of as many as 87 million users with a political data firm.
In reality, Facebook's business model is based on giving personal data to advertisers so they can tailor their pitches precisely to potential customers. So, despite repeated reassurances by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the firm will continue to do what it wants with personal information.
The Federal Trade Commission has the power to force Facebook to better guard users' privacy. But so far Trump's FTC has done nothing not even to enforce a 2011 agreement in which Facebook promised to do just that.
Altria (Phillip Morris) was losing ground on its sales of cigarettes, but the firm has recently found a future in vaping. Because inhaling nicotine in any form poses a health hazard, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wanted to curb advertising of vaping products to teenagers.
Gottlieb thought he had Altria's agreement, but then the firm bought a major stake in the vaping company Juul of San Francisco. Its stock has already gained 14 percent this year. What happened to Gottlieb? He's out at the FDA, after less than two years on the job.
Wells Fargo has publicly apologized for having deceived customers with fake bank accounts, unwarranted fees and unwanted products. Its top executives say they have eliminated the aggressive sales targets that were responsible for the fraud. - Advertisement -
But Wells Fargo employees told the New York Times recently that they're still under heavy pressure to squeeze extra money out of customers. Some have witnessed colleagues bending or breaking internal rules to meet ambitious performance goals.
What has Trump's Consumer Financial Protection Agency done about this? Nothing. It's been defanged."
Why Many 2020 Swing States Will Produce Recount Headaches,www.opednews.com,Steven Rosenfeld,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Why-Many-2020-Swing-States-by-Steven-Rosenfeld-2020-Elections_Green_Laws_Recount-190407-503.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
If the 2020 presidential election hinges on recounts in the closest battleground states, there could be a crisis even greater than the 2000 election where the U.S. Supreme Court ended a Florida recount in its infamous Bush v. Gore ruling.
That's because the laws and timetables governing recounts in many swing states differ widely and aren't necessarily geared toward transparent granular counting -- and that's apart from President Trump's habit of attacking election outcomes he doesn't like by claiming they were stolen.
""I see what the states have put out there. They have not proven realistic,"" said Matthew Weil , senior associate director of the Democracy Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center, speaking of the policies and legal landscape that unfold after election night. The BPC is soon expected to issue a report on the topic. ""It would be very helpful to really look at what a realistic and rational policy would be, and we can work toward that goal."" - Advertisement -
Should presidential recounts occur, it appears that history will not repeat what happened in 2016 -- when courts shut down two of the three recounts filed by the Green Party: in Michigan and Pennsylvania but not Wisconsin. But the chances of voters seeing a convincing process may prove as frustrating as 2016.
""By conventional standards, the 2016 presidential recount was close, but not by recount standards,"" said Chris Sautter, a nationally known lawyer specializing in post-Election Day procedures. ""Nonetheless, a truly accurate recount to fully verify the results was not possible in any of the three states because laws in those states didn't permit meaningful recounts, and because even had the laws permitted proper recounts, most of Pennsylvania and a few counties in Wisconsin did not use election equipment that produced paper records of each vote.""
In 2016, three purple states tipped the Electoral College and made Trump president. Millions of Americans were stunned. The Green Party's presidential nominee, Jill Stein, stepped into the ""what happened?"" void, raising $7.3 million and filing for recounts in the states with the three closest margins: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. - Advertisement -
The recounts accomplished little of what recounts are supposed to do -- validate or update the earlier results. They were blocked in Michigan, stopped in Pennsylvania after barely beginning, and, in Wisconsin, where they were completed after revealing inconsistencies in some vote-counting machinery, Trump emerged with several hundred more votes. Instead of resolving ambiguities and bringing legitimacy to the results, the narrative was dogged by suspicions of hacked machinery, slash-and-burn political rhetoric, contentious court battles and rulings, resistance to re-examining count votes by some local officials and wide media ridicule. These factors did little to satisfy Americans seeking answers.
Since 2016, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have updated some laws or counting protocols in response to the recount, but not all of those revisions are intended to open up the process. Looking more widely, most possible 2020 swing states each have different post-Election Day rules, counting timetables and deadlines, some of which are hard to meet without squeezing in a thorough recount.
With the possible exception of Florida , most of the several dozen recount-related bills now in legislatures were not from likely presidential battleground states, heading toward passage, nor involved big changes. Or, as in Arizona, there's a proposed bill to make it more expensive to file for a recount if it's not automatic -- a deterrent to recounting.
Many voters do not realize that elections don't end on election night, where the reported totals are unofficial and incomplete. After all of the ballots are collected and machinery is packed up, a process called the canvass begins. This involves elected officials and civil servants, typically at the county level, compiling and reconciling the totals from their various voting options (early, at precincts, etc.) and still-arriving mailed-in votes. This process typically concludes seven or 10 days later with local certification of winners. State certification follows soon afterward.
If the top contenders are less than 1 percent apart (this slightly varies state-by-state), a recount will be triggered. Depending on the margins, the government or candidates will pay for this. Recounts also follow differing rules depending on the state. Some, like in Florida, only count problematic ballots -- with no votes or too many votes. (Election audits are generally not part of this phase , but occur after the election is officially over.)
To choose the president, states have to finish this process before the Electoral College meets about six weeks later. But post-election timetables vary. In Michigan, the process can take no more than 40 days. In Ohio, it's 31 days. In Wisconsin, 24 days. In Nevada and Pennsylvania, it's 21 days. In Florida, it's 14 days -- although there is legislation to add five days. These timelines were set years ago, before large numbers of voters started voting by mail, which takes time to process, and Congress created the provisional ballot safeguard (for people not on voter lists), which also must be verified before counting. - Advertisement -
What can follow close contests can appear confusing and not inspire confidence. Before three simultaneous statewide recounts were triggered in Florida last fall, including for U.S. senator and for governor, the results kept changing as mail-in ballots came in. In Broward County, Republicans rallied outside of county offices and loudly accused the election workers inside of rigging the results. In Broward County, Palm Beach County and elsewhere, officials didn't finish in time, which meant under law that the earlier unofficial results stood. Michigan has a similar law on the books.
""It's very weird, from a government-administration perspective, to be putting out unofficial totals, and then people are seeing them shift,"" Weil said. ""We now see a lot of concern -- i.e., 'Is something going on if these numbers are shifting?' Obviously, that's a part of the process, but I do think we need to evaluate some of those reporting policies."""
Netanyahu and Gantz are two sides of the same coin,www.opednews.com,Jonathan Cook,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Netanyahu-and-Gantz-are-tw-by-Jonathan-Cook-Benjamin-Netanyahu_Election_Israel_Likud-190407-278.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
Israel's election campaign, now in its last days, must be the first in which a sitting Israeli prime minister has sought to win over voters by boasting about how much he insulted a president of the United States. One of the last campaign videos by Benjamin Netanyahu spliced together media clips of US analysts voicing disbelief back in 2011 at the Israeli prime minister's public humiliation of Barack Obama.
The ad not only described Netanyahu as ""lecturing"" Obama, but showed him visibly angering the US president by berating him for chasing ""illusions"" in his pursuit of peace talks with the Palestinians. It closed with Likud's campaign slogan: ""Netanyahu. Right-wing. Strong.""
Netanyahu's electioneering has rarely been subtle. But after Israel's attorney general announced during the campaign that the prime minister faced corruption indictments, Netanyahu has had every incentive to plumb new depths. - Advertisement -
His officials have stated that his main rival, Benny Gantz, a general he once appointed as military chief of staff, is mentally unstable. One Likud video showed Gantz's head emerging from a cuckoo clock.
The character assassination has been aided by the leaking of a recording of an off-guard Gantz saying that, if he could have done so, Netanyahu would have had him killed.
Netanayhu's team also exploited, and possibly leaked, a claim that Gantz's mobile phone was hacked by Iran. ""If he couldn't protect his own phone, how will he protect our country?"" Netanyau has said. - Advertisement -
Innuendo has suggested that compromising information on the phone could be used for blackmail.
Gantz, who heads the Blue & White party, hardly emerges spotless, either. He has steeped himself in dubious military glory with ads showing footage of the devastation in Gaza that he presided over, a bombing spree that killed more than 500 children. The video bragged about his sending the enclave ""back to the Stone Age"".
Blue & White, which includes two other high-powered generals, is the Israeli security establishment's effort to oust Netanyahu, who is seen as having squandered international goodwill with his public intransigence on peacemaking.
The generals are no less opposed to Palestinian statehood. They understand the Israeli public's mood: a recent survey shows that more than 40 per cent of Israelis favour some form of annexation of the West Bank.
Pandering to these sentiments, Netanyahu said at the weekend he would extend Israeli sovereignty to the West Bank during his next term.
Gantz has shown no inclination to stray far from this consensus. In his inaugural campaign speech, he said he would ""strengthen the settlement blocs"" as well as ""retain control of security in the entire land of Israel"", which includes the West Bank and Gaza. - Advertisement -
He has repeatedly evaded questions about what solution he proposes for the Palestinians.

"""Assange Is Not A Journalist!"" Yes He Is, Idiot.",www.opednews.com,Caitlin Johnstone,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Assange-Is-Not-A-Journali-by-Caitlin-Johnstone-Journalism_Julian-Assange_Media_Wikileaks-190407-187.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
As we discussed yesterday , whenever Assange is in the news and people are defending him you always see a bunch of hyper-emotional empire loyalists running around online trying to manage the narrative about him. One of the most common talking points which comes up is that Assange is ""not a journalist.""
The reason this talking point comes up, of course, is because the WikiLeaks founder is besieged by powerful forces who are attempting to imprison him for publishing inconvenient facts about them, and his defenders often voice their concerns about what this means for the future of press freedoms. The completely baseless claim that Assange is ""not a journalist"" is used in an attempt to defuse the argument that his prosecution by the US government could lead to the same fate for any news media outlet which publishes leaks on the US government anywhere in the world. If he's not a journalist, then his prosecution sets no precedent for real journalists.
This argument, if you can call it that, is fallacious for a number of reasons. For starters, as The Intercept 's Glenn Greenwald explained last year , there's not any legal distinction in the US Constitution between news media outlets like the New York Times and an outlet which solely focuses on publishing leaks. If you set the precedent with any publisher, you're necessarily setting it for all of them. Greenwald writes the following: - Advertisement -
""To begin with, the press freedom guarantee of the First Amendment isn't confined to 'legitimate news outlets' whatever that might mean. The First Amendment isn't available only to a certain class of people licensed as 'journalists.' It protects not a privileged group of people called 'professional journalists' but rather an activity : namely, using the press (which at the time of the First Amendment's enactment meant the literal printing press) to inform the public about what the government was doing. Everyone is entitled to that constitutional protection equally: there is no cogent way to justify why the Guardian, ex-DOJ-officials-turned-bloggers, or Marcy Wheeler are free to publish classified information but Julian Assange and WikiLeaks are not.""
Secondly, anyone with a functioning brain can see that Julian Assange is indeed a journalist. Publishing facts so that the citizenry can inform themselves about what's going on in their world and what's happening with their government is the thing that journalism is. Duh. The need for an informed citizenry is the entire reason why press freedoms are protected so explicitly under the US Constitution, and publishing facts about the most powerful institutions on earth indisputably does create a more informed citizenry.
You can look at any conventional dictionary definition of the word and come to the same conclusion. Merriam-Webster offers ""the public press"" and ""the collection and editing of news for presentation through the media."" The Oxford English Dictionary offers ""The activity or profession of writing for newspapers, magazines, or news websites or preparing news to be broadcast."" Your Dictionary offers ""The work of finding, creating, editing and publishing news, or material written and presented for a newspaper, magazine or broadcast news source."" These are activities that WikiLeaks is undeniably involved in; they collect and publish newsworthy information to be circulated by themselves and other news sources. The fact that they do their part differently (and better) than other outlets doesn't change that. - Advertisement -
Which explains why the WikiLeaks team has racked up numerous awards for journalism over the years, including the Walkley Award for Most Outstanding Contribution to Journalism (2011), the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism (2011), the International Piero Passetti Journalism Prize of the National Union of Italian Journalists (2011), the Jose Couso Press Freedom Award (2011), the Brazillian Press Association Human Rights Award (2013), and the Kazakstan Union of Journalists Top Prize (2014).
The claim that Assange is ""not a journalist"" is both an irrelevant red herring and a self-evident falsehood. It is made, not by people with an interest in maintaining a small and specific linguistic understanding of what the word journalism means, but by people who want to see Julian Assange imprisoned by the same government which tortured Chelsea Manning because he made them feel emotionally upset. It's a fact-free argument made entirely in bad faith for inexcusable motives: the desire to see a journalist imprisoned for telling the truth.
When someone says ""Assange isn't a journalist,"" they aren't telling you what Assange is. They're showing you what they are."
What Do Leading Democrats Believe In?,www.opednews.com,LA Progressive,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/What-Do-Leading-Democrats-by-LA-Progressive-Beliefs_Democrats_Election_Power-190407-113.html,"Details DMCA - Advertisement -
Give me five minutes, and I can tell you exactly what Bernie Sanders believes in. Single-payer health care for all. A $15 minimum wage. Higher taxes on the richest Americans. College education that doesn't bankrupt families and leave students with crushing debt. Criminal justice reform. Investment in infrastructure and renewable energy. He gives specifics, and he's walked a principled walk for decades.
But what does the Democratic Partly leadership believe in? As this article at Truthdig put it, "" Nancy Pelosi Believes In Nothing ."" Of course, she does believe in something: her own power and privilege, which she seeks to maintain and expand. But principles like those held by Bernie Sanders? Forget about it.
I've been reading Matt Taibbi's ""The Great Derangement,"" a terrific book that came out in 2008, and Taibbi nails it in this passage (pages 243-4): - Advertisement - ""The Democrats' error was in believing that people wouldn't notice this basic truth [that the party's ideology is driven by power and nothing more] about their priorities. They were wrong on that score. In fact, a Quinnipiac poll taken around that time [2007] found the approval rating of Congress had fallen to 23 percent. Other polls saw the number plummet to the teens. The rating of the Democratic Congress was even lower than [George W.] Bush's, and it was not hard to see why. Bush was wrong and insane, but he stood for something. It was a fucked-up something, but it was something. The Democrats stood for nothing; they viewed their own constituents as problems to be handled, and even casual voters were beginning to see this.""
If you substitute Trump's name for Bush's in the above quotation, it makes even more sense. ""[Trump] was wrong and insane, but he stood for something. It was a fucked-up something, but it was something.""
This is the biggest issue for corporate Democrats: What do you stand for? For so many in the establishment, what they stand for is themselves. The perpetuation of their own power and privilege. This is the biggest reason why Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. It was always all about her.
Another quotation from Matt Taibbi made me laugh out loud even as I winced at the harsh truth of it (page 190): - Advertisement - ""You don't elect politicians to commit crimes; you elect politicians to make your crimes legal. That is the whole purpose of the racket of government.""
In this case, the ""you"" in question are all the banks, corporations, and other vested interests that essentially buy our politicians. Until we get big money out of politics, this corruption will persist.
Bernie Sanders doesn't take corporate money. Neither does Tulsi Gabbard. But most of the current batch of Democratic candidates for president in 2020 do take money from big corporate and financial donors. And that should tell you what they believe in: their own power and privilege, and little else.
Speaking of Bernie Sanders, I recently read a depressing article in the Nation by Eric Alterman who argued Bernie can't win in 2020. Why? Supposedly because Americans won't elect a socialist, and also because Trump and the Republican attack machine will convince Americans he's simply too radical.
WTF? Americans are desperate for leaders who believe in something rather than nothing. That's why Trump won in 2016. Again, in the spirit of Taibbi, Trump may be batshit crazy, but he does take a stand, e.g.,""Build the wall."" The best way to defeat Trump in 2020 is to go bold: to nominate a candidate with strong core beliefs. A candidate who connects with young and old and who inspires enthusiastic participation. That's Bernie.
But perhaps Jimmy Dore , the comedian/political commentator, is right: establishment Democrats like Pelosi would rather defeat Progressives like Bernie Sanders than win the presidential election against Trump in 2020. Because if Trump wins, they can continue to serve (and profit from) corporate interests while posing as being anti-Trump, i.e., they can continue life as they know it, with all the power and privilege that comes with it.
As my wife quipped today, ""They don't let their beliefs get in their way, do they?"" Which is another way of saying they really have no beliefs at all. - Advertisement -"
We go where we are led.,www.opednews.com,Paul o'Dowd,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/We-go-where-we-are-led-by-Paul-o-Dowd-Agenda_Blind_Corporate_Corporations-190407-782.html,"By Paul o'Dowd (Page 1 of 2 pages) (# of views) 14 comments Herd of sheep Details DMCA - Advertisement -
We go where we are led. It's just what we do. We are a herd animal of the absolute highest order. Once in lockstep with our leadership we just go and go and go. It doesn't seem to matter where we are being led, even if we can clearly see the folly of our trajectory. Even as we march beneath the towering fiery arches, sure, we will whine and bleat about our leaders for marching us through the gates of Hell, but still we will follow. It's inexplicable and bizarre. But there it is. It's how we roll. The fields of organizational psychology and game theory, have demonstrated that if you are devoid of morals and are smart enough to stay out of jail, then any competitive interaction you have is likely to turn out in your favour simply due to the fact of your vastly diminished rule-set compared to your morally constrained competition.
The consequence of this dynamic is that high functioning psychopaths, people who are biologically incapable of moral cognition, become actively concentrated at the top of our most competitive and rewarding hierarchies, from where they determine the fate of the rest of the world at large. There are many steps along the way at which these human pustules could have been winnowed from the process due to their morally problematic approach to life. But they weren't. This is because they are very useful in certain circumstances.
They will do whatever it takes to get things done, if it suits them. They have no qualms about destroying their competition whilst ingratiating themselves to those who can facilitate their ascent. Once they gain influence over an organization, they seek out and populate its inner workings with their own kind or those too weak or compromised to resist them. - Advertisement -
The biggest financial firms use state of the art diagnostic tools to diagnose and recruit psychopaths to drive their most profitable and regulation sensitive machinery.
I know this because I've interviewed organizational psychologists, including individuals employed by the biggest financial institutions on Earth who administer these tests for their Wall St. employer's HR departments.
One such corporate HR shrink, explained it to me thus; ""In the time it takes for a ""neurotyp"" (someone with a healthy mind) to get over the moral implications of a questionable trading decision, an algorithm has just cleaned up all the shares and the boss misses out on millions"". - Advertisement -
People who push the buy or sell button without hesitation, get to keep their job. Those who miss a trading opportunity due to vassilating over moral quandaries simply can't compete. These same companies also employ highly paid in-house regulatory overseers, compliance officers, some of whom describe themselves as ""Corporate Cops"", who in their own words; ""make sure that no-one is breaking the law and that ethical standards are maintained"". When I interviewed a compliance officer from the same company as the aforementioned HR shrink, I mentioned the firm's HR practices and the active quest for psychopaths. He expressed no surprise, in fact he beat me to the punchline, saying ""Yeah, they recruit them to the trading floor...""
""You know about that??"" I exclaimed"" He replied, ""We all know about that, everyone knows that..."" When asked to comment on the irony of working as a compliance officer for a company that strategically recruits diagnosed psychopaths into the most regulation sensitive underbelly of their operation, the self description of ""Corporate Cop"" evaporates"" ""You wanna know what I really do?"" he said to me, as his Wall St. Corporate Cop facade slumped visibly with his shoulders... ""I run around putting out the f#*!ing dumpster fires"". Organizational culture is the product of the characters that populate the workplace. Under psychopathic leadership an organization's priorities are skewed in ways that morally guided individuals find intolerable, and many just quit. This generates a strong natural attrition amongst those who's psychological normality might prove inconvenient when it comes to pursuing questionable agendas. The remaining, ""off message"" employees can be further winnowed by targeted abuse or career stagnation strategies.
Once moral objection has been effectively suppressed, the organization openly exhibits psychopathic traits.
It becomes overtly, criminally parasitic.
It becomes toxic.
It becomes a scandal factory and behaves in clearly undisciplined ways. - Advertisement -
Organizations in competition with each other are quickly forced into similar recruitment practices because to not do so is perceived as a fatal disadvantage in a cut-throat world. The smartest and most ruthless, end up climbing into the upper executive of these institutions from where they jump onto the ""Revolving Door"" into government. From here their malevolence becomes concentrated into the executive fabric of society itself.
Moving freely between the control centers of wealth creation and public policy, they quickly strip away any remaining impediments to their complete entrainment of the wheels of society.
In this way whole industries and sectors of the economy and ultimately, entire societies become captive to the scourge of psychopathic leadership."
Trump Administration Intensifies Aggression Against Venezuela With Impunity,www.opednews.com,Michael Hughes,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Trump-Administration-Inten-by-Michael-Hughes-Trump-Warmonger_Venezuelan-Coup-190407-229.html,"Details DMCA
Most U.S. lawmakers and mainstream media outlets have fully embraced the Trump administration's reckless economic war against Venezuela, a poor Latin American country that poses no threat to the United States. Meanwhile, as the White House escalates its campaign to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, the establishment has adeptly convinced most Americans that Venezuela can only be saved by a U.S. puppet leader.
On Friday, April 5, after Vice President Mike Pence announced another round of sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil sector, a senior administration official told reporters that the White House was ""seriously"" considering the military option. - Advertisement -
The United States accusing Maduro of starving his own people while, at the same time, trying to weaken Venezuela's economy with crippling sanctions might seem like cognitive dissonance until one realizes it is obviously all part of the script. U.S. policymakers have, quite accurately, predicted nobody will notice or care.
In late January, shortly after U.S.-backed opposition figure Juan Guaido illegally proclaimed himself interim president, the United States seized billions of dollars' worth of Venezuelan oil assets. Maduro, in response, accused Washington of trying to orchestrate a coup to install Guaido as a puppet - one beholden to the United States - in order to control Venezuela's energy resources. Based on the aforementioned developments, Maduro's characterization seems about right.
Warmongering lawmakers like Senator Marco Rubio are not even trying to hide the fact they are dying to invade Venezuela. In February, Rubio went so far as to tweet photos from 2011 of a bloodied and battered Gaddafi - suggesting that Maduro will face the same fate. - Advertisement -
Rubio's stunt is quite instructive because it illustrates the utter inability of U.S. politicians to learn from past failed military excursions. The Obama administration's intervention in Libya transformed the once stable country into a terrorist slave-trading state. Before Gaddafi was ousted Libya ranked 111th on the Fragile States Index . Now, according to the same index, Libya is the 28th most unstable country in the world.
Even the Trump-hating mainstream media has applauded the president's policy on Venezuela. The New York Times editorial board on January 24 hailed Guaido as a ""fresh young"" savior. Less than a week later, the Times allowed the pretender to pen an op-ed in which he tried to blackmail Venezuela's military leaders to throw Maduro under the bus in exchange for amnesty.
Around the same time, in playing the media's proper role of skeptical watchdog, reporters Dan Cohen and Max Blumenthal published a brilliant piece of investigative journalism on Guaido. The report exposed Guaido as an American operative with ties to the National Endowment for Democracy, an ""NGO"" founded by the CIA.
Guaido also has links to the so-called Chicago Boys, the notorious University of Chicago economic experts who helped Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet eradicate the socialist policies of the CIA-ousted Allende government.
And for all of his condemnations of Maduro's human rights abuses, Guaido too has blood on his hands from his days with the anti-government "" guarimbas.""
""Guaidó's Popular Will party formed the shock troops of the guarimbas that caused the deaths of police officers and common citizens alike. He had even boasted of his own participation in street riots,"" the report said. - Advertisement -
There have been a few lone voices in the wilderness opposing this madness. A group of former U.S. intelligence officials warned the Trump administration that intervening militarily in Venezuela could lead to war with Russia, which has backed Maduro from the beginning. The former U.S. officials argued that Moscow's support for Venezuela has not come close to crossing any Monroe Doctrine ""red line,"" as Trump national security adviser John Bolton insinuated in early March.
""We realize that some in the media are trying to egg you on into taking forceful action, perhaps even of a military nature, to punish Russia,"" the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) said in a statement to Trump on April 4. ""We urge you not to fall into this trap. This is not 19th century Latin America, and it is a far cry from the Cuba missile crisis of 1962.""
Other rare voices include a group of progressive House Democrats who last month urged Trump to ""change course"" entirely on Venezuela. In addition, Senator Bernie Sanders has warned Trump not to effect any more regime change in Latin America where the U.S. has ""meddled"" in the internal affairs and/or overthrown the governments of more than a dozen countries since the 1930s."

Trump should heed the sage advice of South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has much more riding on this peace process than Trump does by 0 Comments

When President Moon Jae-in of South Korea meets with President Donald Trump at the White House this week, he may find himself fighting the urge to pour cold water all over Trump, because that’s what Trump did to the Korea peace process when he met with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. Moon has staked his presidency on advancing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and Trump has staked his bloated ego on the interconnected goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Moon has staked his presidency on advancing permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, and Trump has staked his bloated ego on the interconnected goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Moon’s task in upcoming and future talks with Trump can be adequately simplified as painting a glamorous picture of the promised land, wherein Trump can claim his largely undeserved credit for a peaceful, denuclearized Korea—but only, Moon may suggest, if Trump embraces the more incremental, reciprocal negotiating posture that diplomacy needs to succeed. After reminding Trump of all he has to gain from a comprehensive nuclear agreement with North Korea, a relatively easy task, Moon could try to convince Trump that the administration’s current maximalist approach is doomed to fail. It is doomed because North Korea knows the storied past of U.S. regime change, in particular the story of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi, who negotiated away his country’s nuclear program only to be brutally murdered by rebels in the wake of a U.S.-backed NATO bombing campaign designed to remove him from power. It is doomed because North Korea’s leaders know that if they don’t secure irreversible security guarantees, they could meet a similar fate. It is doomed because North Korea will not disarm without those security guarantees and without sanctions relief that its people desperately need, all of which will require incremental diplomacy to secure. Next, Moon could try to turn Trump against one of his own. National Security Advisor John Bolton was widely blamed for torpedoing the Hanoi talks, where he reportedly pushed for an all-or-nothing style agreement . Among other unrealistic demands, Bolton insisted that North Korea sweeten the deal that working groups had all but finalized ahead of the summit by throwing in full disclosure of its chemical and biological weapons stockpiles. Of course, disclosure and eventual dismantlement of those programs are worthwhile goals, and are not unreasonable asks within a broader process of reciprocal diplomacy. But as eleventh-hour demands at the tail end of a high-stakes summit, they look more like torpedoes than goals. Even a cursory look at Bolton’s track record reveals his disdain for diplomacy, and underscores the danger of giving him a seat at any negotiating table. Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement as well as his planned withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty can both be traced back to Bolton. So can the demise of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which froze North Korea’s nuclear program in place for the better part of a decade before collapsing on the Bush administration’s watch. Writing in his memoir, Bolton shamelessly recalled that North Korea’s efforts to secure a uranium enrichment capability were “the hammer I had been looking for to shatter the Agreed Framework.” In other words, rather than seeking to address North Korea’s troubling activities by strengthening the agreement, Bolton swung his hammer. Anyone who takes such pride in destroying hard-won arms control agreements should have no role in negotiating them. Finally, Moon could try to convince Trump that he can employ the incremental approach needed to make any real progress while still claiming credit for a major agreement with North Korea. Ironically, the perfect template for the structure of such a deal already exists. The Iran nuclear agreement , also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), evolved from an interim agreement called the Joint Plan of Action (JPOA). The interim deal, signed in November of 2013, was a huge deal in and of itself, freezing Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for partial sanctions relief. Notably, it took until April of 2015 for negotiators to secure a framework agreement, the outlines of the final deal, and then until July of 2015 to sign the final agreement, so Moon may also need to extol the virtues of patience to his decidedly impatient counterpart. Ahead of the Hanoi summit, negotiators appeared to have lined up a series of agreements that, taken together, could well have been billed as an interim agreement, or in Trumpian terms, a terrific deal that no one else could have negotiated—if only Bolton hadn’t brought his trusty hammer. The agreements on the table included the opening of joint liaison offices in Pyongyang and Washington, D.C.; partial sanctions relief in exchange for closure of a centerpiece of North Korea’s nuclear program, the Yongbyon facility; the return of more U.S. service member remains from the Korean War; and last but not least, a declaration of the end of the Korean War, an important step toward signing a long-overdue peace agreement to formally end the Korean War and toward meeting North Korea’s desire for security guarantees. Between the photo ops and fanfare, Moon will likely be urging Trump to put Humpty Dumpty back together again—to go back to the table with North Korea and trust his working level diplomats to give him a similar package of agreements that can be touted as a big deal in its own right, and as a critical step toward a comprehensive deal, which it would be. Trump should heed the sage advice of President Moon, who has much more riding on this peace process than Trump does.

Trump's Tropical Trauma,www.opednews.com,Wayne Madsen,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/Trump-s-Tropical-Trauma-by-Wayne-Madsen-Bolsonaro-The-Latin-American-Trump_Caribbean-Islands_Community-Of-Latin-American-And-Caribbean-States-C_Latin-America-190407-104.html,"Become a Fan (16 fans) In return for their invitation to Mar-a-Lago the Caribbean Five took steps to bring their policies on Venezuela in line with those of Trump Details DMCA - Advertisement -
In a blatant attempt to unravel the bloc of Venezuela's Caribbean allies formed nurtured by Venezuela's late president, Hugo Chavez, Donald Trump and his foreign policy team of neo-conservative war hawks has accomplished to divide the 15-member Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to a degree not seen since 1983. That year saw President Ronald Reagan order the US invasion of CARICOM member Grenada, an event that saw CARICOM split on supporting the move. Among the CARICOM members, Bahamas, Belize, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago opposed the US invasion, while other states either participated in the military occupation of CARICOM member Grenada or voiced support for it.
Trump's recent hosting of Prime Minister Allen Chastanet of Saint Lucia, President Danilo Medina from the Dominican Republic, Prime Minister Andrew Holness of Jamaica, President Jovenel Moise of Haiti, and Prime Minister Hubert Minnis of the Bahamas at Trump's Mar-a-Lago billionaire's club in Palm Beach, Florida had only one purpose: to peel away Venezuela's supporters in the Caribbean region. Apart from the Dominican Republic, all the leaders at Mar-a-Lago are members of CARICOM. The Dominican Republic holds observer status in the organization. All five leaders who made the pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago support Juan Guaido, the unelected US pretender to the presidential palace in Venezuela.
Dr. Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, called the failure by the United States to only invite Saint Lucian Prime Minister Chastanet as the only representative of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States was ""insulting."" Gonsalves also said that Chastanet, Holness, Moise, and Minnis, all leaders of CARICOM nations, would have to ""answer to their countries."" Gaston Browne, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said of the leaders who went to Mar-a-Lago, ""I feel embarrassed for those weak-minded leaders, who allowed themselves to be used, by carrying out the agenda of others."" - Advertisement -
In return for their invitation to Mar-a-Lago, the Caribbean Five took steps to bring their policies on Venezuela in line with those of Trump. The Bahamas rejected the credentials of the Maduro government's ambassador to Nassau. Jamaica ordered the Venezuelan embassy in Kingston closed. Saint Lucia applied visa restrictions on visitors from Venezuela. The Trump administration is pushing for the Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia, and Haiti to sever all diplomatic and economic links with the Maduro government, particularly their involvement in Venezuela's PetroCaribe energy and investment fund for the Caribbean states. Under pressure from Washington, in January of this year Jamaica bought back Venezuela's 49 percent share in PetroJam, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company. Holness's visit to Mar-a-Lago drew sharp repudiation from the opposition in Jamaica.
The leader of the Jamaican opposition People's National Party, Dr. Peter Phillips, condemned the move by Holness, saying it betrayed an old friend of Jamaica. Before parliament, Phillips said, ""The fact is, we have never expropriated the property of any investor in Jamaica before. It is a dangerous precedent for us to set. If we don't behave honorably to our friends, we soon won't have any friends.""
The current CARICOM chairman, Saint Kitts and Nevis Prime Minister Dr. Timothy Harris, wants the Caribbean region to remain a ""zone of peace."" Harris, who was not invited to the Mar-a-Lago meeting, insists on CARICOM being of one voice on the Venezuela situation. It remains the intention of Trump and his two neocon chief meddlers in Caribbean and Latin American affairs national security adviser John Bolton and Elliott Abrams, the ""special envoy"" for ""regime change"" in Venezuela to pry away all of CARICOM's allies of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Harris had his delegate to the Organization of American States (OAS) abstain on a US-sponsored resolution in support of the Guaido puppet government. In Trump world, there can be no abstentions and the Saint Kitts and Nevis abstention earned Harris a non-invitation, as both prime minister and CARICOM rotating chairman, to the Mar-a-Lago meeting. Also abstaining were Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago. Rejecting the US resolution were Dominica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname. Particularly vexing to the Trump crowd is the fact that the CARICOM Secretariat in Georgetown, Guyana continues to accredit the observer mission from the Maduro government, rejecting an attempt by the Guaido rump regime to assume control of the observer mission. - Advertisement -
Chastenet replied to the criticisms of his attendance at the Mar-a-Lago confab by saying that he felt no need to explain his decision to the other CARICOM leaders. Holness said he went to Mar-a-Lago in the belief that the Trump administration would increase investment in the region. If Trump's decision to cut off all US assistance to Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras is any indication, the ""Caribbean Five,"" who went ""hat-in-hand"" to Trump's Mar-a-Lago throne room, will be sorely disappointed. Haiti's Moise came in for heated criticism from his own nation, as well as from across the Caribbean. It was not long ago when Trump referred to Haiti as a ""sh*t hole"" country. That was followed by the arrest in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital, of armed US mercenaries with ties to the former Blackwater firm of Erik Prince, the brother of Trump's Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos.
In fact, the only Caribbean ""investments"" Trump understands are his own failed resort properties in some of the islands, including an abandoned hotel, casino, and golf resort on Canouan, one of the Grenadines that was once called ""Trump Island""; the abandoned Cap Cana hotel and golf resort in the Dominican Republic; the bankrupt Trump International Golf Club in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico; the 70-floor Trump Ocean Club in Panama City, which shed its Trump brand after allegations of fraud lodged against the Trump Organization; and Trump's unsold and largely unwanted Le Château des Palmiers villa in St. Martin.
Prime Ministers Gonsalves and Browne are well-aware of the pitfalls of negotiating any financial agreements with Donald Trump. They witnessed Trump's mishandling of hurricane relief and reconstruction assistance for Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. They and other CARICOM heads of government must have also shaken their heads over Saint Lucia's Chastanet's participation in the Mar-a-Lago meeting.
The last time Chastanet was in the United States was a hurried trip to Dallas in September 2018. A Saint Lucian national, 26-year-old Botham Shem Jean, was shot to death after a Dallas police officer entered his apartment, believing it was her own. Jean was an employee of the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. His mother, Alison Jean, was a permanent secretary of Saint Lucia and participating as a delegate of her nation at a United Nations conference in New York at the time of her son's murder. While in Dallas, Chastanet spoke out against the anti-immigrant fervor sweeping the United States, saying that many immigrants ""entering the United States were fearful for their lives."" Yet, Chastanet, a former Tourism Minister and manager of his family's Coco Palm Hotel, traveled to the Mar-a-Lago royal court of Trump to pay fealty to the man almost singularly responsible for the xenophobia sweeping the United States.
Chastanet's support for the Guaido ""government"" and Trump has brought about political troubles at home. In January of this year, Chastanet survived a no confidence vote in the Saint Lucia parliament. Former Saint Lucian Foreign Minister Alva Baptiste, a member of the opposition Saint Lucia Labour Party, castigated Chastanet for aligning himself with the ""Lima Group,"" a right-wing bloc of nations intent on forcing Maduro from office. Baptiste, speaking in parliament, said that Chastanet was ""making Saint Lucia a pappyshow."" Pappyshow is a Caribbean English colloquial term for ""buffoon"" or ""fool."" Baptiste also reiterated that the OAS Charter specifically states that no member may ""directly or indirectly for any reason whatsoever in the internal affairs of any other state.""
As far as the Lima Group is concerned, Baptiste said, ""Saint Lucia should never be part or be a member of the renegade mongoose gang like the Lima Group."" Baptiste's use of the term ""mongoose gang"" is particularly instructive. From 1970 to his ouster in a 1979 coup, Prime Minister Eric Gairy of Grenada was protected by his own thuggish private militia, called the ""Mongoose Gang."" The right-wing and pro-US Gairy, who once asked the United Nations General Assembly to investigate the UFO phenomenon, was ousted by the Marxist-led government of Maurice Bishop, a government that remained in power until the 1983 US invasion. The people of the Caribbean have long memories and Baptiste's reference to the mongoose gang regarding the anti-Venezuela Lima Group has important historical underpinnings. - Advertisement -
In return for their invitation to Mar-a-Lago, the Caribbean Five took steps to bring their policies on Venezuela in line with those of Trump. The Bahamas rejected the credentials of the Maduro government's ambassador to Nassau. Jamaica ordered the Venezuelan embassy in Kingston closed. Saint Lucia applied visa restrictions on visitors from Venezuela. The Trump administration is pushing for the Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia, and Haiti to sever all diplomatic and economic links with the Maduro government, particularly their involvement in Venezuela's PetroCaribe energy and investment fund for the Caribbean states. Under pressure from Washington, in January of this year Jamaica bought back Venezuela's 49 percent share in PetroJam, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company. Holness's visit to Mar-a-Lago drew sharp repudiation from the opposition in Jamaica.
The leader of the Jamaican opposition People's National Party, Dr. Peter Phillips, condemned the move by Holness, saying it betrayed an old friend of Jamaica. Before parliament, Phillips said, ""The fact is, we have never expropriated the property of any investor in Jamaica before. It is a dangerous precedent for us to set. If we don't behave honorably to our friends, we soon won't have any friends.""
Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Dr. Keith Rowley has been feuding with the US ambassador in Port-of-Spain, Joseph Mondello, a longtime Republican shady party operative from Levittown, New York and a Republican convention Trump delegate in 2016. Mondello has infuriated the Trinidad and Tobago government by working with the opposition United National Congress (UNC) and its leader, former Prime Minister Kam­la Per­sad-Bisses­sar, to press Rowley to join the Lima Group. Rowley responded to Mondello's intervention in Trinidad and Tobago politics by pressing CARICOM to avoid being drawn into the Lima Group of reactionary right-wing regimes in backing regime change in Venezuela. The UNC, which largely represents the interests of Trinidad's East Indian and corporate community, was always opposed to the Bolivarian Revolution of Chavez in Venezuela. Rowley wore his being uninvited to Mar-a-Lago by Trump as a badge of honor. He said, ""We have nev­er stood taller or stood proud­er. If it is we're be­ing blanked or snubbed for stead­fast­ly stand­ing for the prin­ci­ples of the Unit­ed Na­tions Char­ter, his­tory will ab­solve us."""

This is something related to your article called the Delphi technique or method.
""The goal of the Delphi technique is to lead a targeted group of people to a predetermined outcome, while giving the illusion of taking public input and under the pretext of being accountable to the public.""
Are You Being Delphied?
The Rand Corporation in the early 1960s developed the Delphi technique for the purpose of maneuvering segments of the public into accepting predetermined government policies. In the 1970s and '80s, it was ideally used to convince land owners of the merits of accepting joining and general plan maps. Now it is being employed to persuade the public to accept outcome-based education and the licensing of all employees, via endorsements in the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) programs, a.k.a. school-to-work.
The goal of the Delphi technique is to lead a targeted group of people to a predetermined outcome, while giving the illusion of taking public input and under the pretext of being accountable to the public. For the Delphi to work, it is critical that the targeted group be kept away from knowledgeable people who could lead them away from the Delphier's predetermined outcome.
One variation on the Delphi technique is to use a series of meetings. The attendees are often given a number or a colored card when they enter the room, to determine at which table they are to sit. The purpose of this is to break up the groups of potentially knowledgeable people who arrive together so that they will be sitting with strangers and therefore be subdued.
Typically, at each table is a facilitator, someone who will know which way to help ""steer"" the group. Usually the people at each table are instructed to answer among themselves some of the questions and arrive at a table consensus. Someone is chosen to speak for the table, most of the time it is the person who has been secretly pre-briefed about the desired Delphi outcome. The table spokesperson is the only one allowed to address the podium and the others have little opportunity to address the podium or the crowd directly.
Anyone knowledgeable enough, or brave enough, to speak out in opposition will not be welcomed. Often they are told from the podium, ""We don't have time to discuss that now,"" or ""We discussed that on another date,"" or ""We can discuss that after the meeting."" They will attempt to quiet, isolate, and discredit dissenters. After attending the Delphi meeting, participants may feel uneasy that they are in disagreement with the apparent majority. The Delphi technique is often successful in bluffing people into submission. Don't let them succeed. Call their bluff.
The Delphi technique often uses a series of surveys to bring about ""consensus."" The surveys are promoted as information gathering regarding the wishes of the targeted public, but in reality they are designed to manipulate the desired outcome. The survey will sometimes use a grading like, ""agree all of the time,"" ""agree most of the time,"" ""agree some of the time,"" ""agree not much,"" ""agree never."" Or, the survey grading will ask the respondents to use ratings like ""most important,"" ""moderately important,"" ""least important.""
The questions are typically ""loaded"" questions. An example is the question asked of Oregon teachers on a Delphi technique survey: ""Do you agree or disagree that the following elements of H.B. 3565 [Oregon's Education Act for the 21st Century] will lead to improved student learning if implemented?"" The survey listed such items for the teachers to agree or disagree with; ""site councils,"" ""increased accountability for school site and districts,"" ""full funding for preschool programs to enable all students to enter school ready to learn,"" ""extended school year,"" ""certificate of initial mastery,"" etc. The question is patently ""loaded."" For example, site councils are not charged with improving student learning. Their function is to implement the state law, dole out professional development courses and money to selected teachers, and apply for grants from foundations and the federal government. For the teachers to answer, ""agree"" or ""disagree"", that the site councils will lead to improved student learning is misdirecting the respondent.
The Delphi surveys serve to ""educate"" the people taking the survey. After the first survey is taken, the respondents are given an analysis and told that most people agreed or somewhat agreed on the predetermined outcome. Then usually they are given another survey and asked if they can be flexible and try to rethink the ""few remaining"" areas of disagreement. When the series of surveys are accomplished, the respondents are told that the majority of respondents achieved ""consensus"" with whatever direction the pollers wanted in the first place.
These techniques were developed decades ago. The Rand Corporation has more recently been developing games that groups of business people, site council members, organizations, etc., can use to help ""sell"" people on collectivism, consensus vs. majority rule, etc.
Never, ever compromise when it comes to ""right and wrong."" With the right attitude you shouldn't care what people think, as long as you are standing up for what is right. Accept persecution gratefully. Submitted on Monday, Apr 8, 2019 at 3:49:19 PM"
U.S. poised to designate Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terror group,www.opednews.com,Abdus-Sattar Ghazali,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.opednews.com/articles/U-S-poised-to-designate-I-by-Abdus-Sattar-Ghaza-Cruz_Iran_Iraq_Obama-190407-891.html,"(8 fans) - Advertisement -
The Trump administration is preparing to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, the Wall Street Journal Friday quoted U.S. officials as saying.
The WSJ said this step that would vastly escalate the American pressure campaign against Tehran but which has divided U.S. officials.
The decision, which could be announced as early as Monday following months of deliberation, would mark the first time that an element of a foreign state has been officially designated a terrorist entity, according to the WSJ.
The designation will be accompanied by an alert to U.S. forces to warn of possible retaliation the WSJ also said. - Advertisement -
Iran warned Saturday that it could respond in kind, listing the US military as a terror group.
""If the Revolutionary Guards are placed on America's list of terrorist groups, we will put that country's military on the terror blacklist next to Daesh [Islamic State],"" Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the head of the Iranian parliament's national security committee, tweeted.
In 2017 IRGC chief Mohammad Ali Jafari had said such action by Washington would lead the Guards to ""consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world."" - Advertisement -
The Wall Street Journal said that the Pentagon and the CIA had reservations about the move, saying it would increase risks for US troops without doing much more to damage the Iranian economy.
The impending decision to designate the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization comes after a surprise announcement from the State Department's Brian Hook last week , who revealed that Iran is responsible for the deaths of more than 600 American service members in Iraq, higher than the previous estimate of 500, according to Washington Examiner.
A spokesman for the Defense Department told the Washington Examiner the exact figure is 603.
Commander Sean Robertson said the casualties were from improvised explosive devices, rockets, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small-arms and sniper attacks by Iranian-backed militants.
Republican Senator Ben Sasse spoke in support of the move, saying ""A formal designation and its consequences may be new, but these IRGC butchers have been terrorists for a long time.""
A GOP aide told the Washington Examiner that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ""is well-known to be planning an even broader set of sanctions against the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for this Congress that will build on his last effort, in which redundant sanctions for their activities would be layered on."" - Advertisement -
Cruz has been a prominent voice pushing for the Revolutionary Guard to be designated a terrorist group, introducing bills during both the Obama and Trump administrations. Cruz first introduced the IRGC Designation Act in 2015, saying that ""for more than three decades, Iran's IRGC has been a leading proponent of radical Islamic terrorism around the globe."" He introduced it again in 2017, saying: ""It is time to call this enemy by name and speak with clarity and moral authority.""
Cruz had also pushed the Pentagon for answers on this issue. A spokesperson for Cruz told the Washington Examiner: ""Sen. Cruz has been fighting for years to get Americans as much information as possible about the hundreds and hundreds of Americans killed by Iran in Iraq. The Obama administration downplayed the scope and nature of these murders in the interest of promoting its diplomacy with Iran, including the Obama nuclear deal.""
The Obama administration entered into the Iran deal in 2015, to much criticism from Republicans. Following the U.S.'s withdrawal from the deal in 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained the Trump administration's reasoning by labeling Iran an ""outlaw regime"" that couldn't be trusted and saying that ""the Iranian regime will do whatever it takes to maintain its grip on power and spread its revolutionary ideology."""

Writing is the best of times and the worst of times. Writing is tremendously difficult, attempting to write with meaning is as difficult and as dangerous as wielding a sword.
""The pen is mightier than the sword.""
The sentiment is true. And the metaphor expands when one understands what it means to wield a sword. Great care must be taken with lengthy sharpened steel and the same care must be taken with communicating sharpened observations. Writing is the best when your presentation is read and it refreshes like the sunshine of a Spring day. Writing is the worst when your presentation is read and it disturbs like a bright flashlight shined in the slumbering dark. Everything I have written of import does both -at the same time. - Advertisement -
I have proceeded to follow several simple rules to writing all of them to doldrums of recognition so they may not be effective. One rule I have followed despite the cost of awakening grumpy trolls is to conceptualize that which people imply should be better left unsaid and moreover unconsidered. I would advise writers -journalists and poets alike- to write about the concepts which cause you to think 'I shouldn't write about that.' The exactness of love, the taboos, the unconsidered, the political correctness that is incorrect, the immorality of religions, the oligarchy of democracies, and such similar subjects are the exact controversial material people want to read and the exact topics that need to be explored.
The world today is flipped completely upside down. Right is wrong and wrong is right. Quantity and stupidity has all but replaced quality and thoughtfulness. Idiocy and materialism rules over depth of near any sort pertaining to near any subject. Well, I'm an Indigo and I always have been so I am about to flip the script and my pen may wake you and agitate.
I am an Indigo. For me Indigos flip it, always, in a lot of different ways. I am an independent individual seeking individuation for my myself and the collective. I am an independent minded individual seeking ascension toward higher thinking just as symbolized by the indigo colored layer in the chakra system. That is why I am an Indigo, and I am here to flip it upside right. Indigos are sometimes supported for flipping situations and often challenged. Either way an aspect of the Indigo state of mind is to abide by the Indigo Rule as presented by Mark Twain.
""Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."" ~Mark Twain
The world today has adopted lower gross thinking and in doing so has been captivated by further and lower basic thinking without realizing it. The world is complicated and the consciousness of people is captivated by complication and greedy oligarchical motivation.
Utilizing Wu Wei toward engaging observations has enabled me to make more refined observations without the fettering of irrational and timely concepts. Wu Wei is a Daoist idea which essentially means maximum grace, efficiency and beauty in minimum complication. The world today is primarily complicated because no one seeks to simplify for such operations are often not as profitable as expansive complications. Applying Wu Wei philosophy to observations simplifies and balances the subtle and the overt. When we complicate was simple when we upend sensibility of simplicity we end up confused in situations where there was once no confusion. - Advertisement -
As I relate in The Metaphysics of Monotheism monothematic religion in total and monotheism specifically are consciousness confinement constructs. Today because of religious institutional influence being subjugated by corporate and political influence differing consciousness confinement constructs are put forth to create discomfort and increase sales and ultimately hold back consciousness from individual individuation and unity of humanity. Instead institutional enhancement is the norm, divisiveness is celebrated, and the natural inclination for development is flipped and stagnated. Individual consciousness and humanity in general has degraded to the point we are allowing total censorship of oppositional and even contrasting views. This is monothematic, basic, crude and gross thinking.
Let's consider some of the most basic concepts that have been flipped and twisted today in order to instill comprehension of our consciousness and the ascension symbolism we can shift toward and embody.

"Booker raises $5 million, below other White House hopefuls",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Hunter Woodall, The Associated Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/07/dems-follow-all-compass-directions-to-make-pitches-to-voters/,"By Hunter Woodall, The Associated Press — Apr 7 2019
Cory Booker's early fundraising numbers are well behind those posted by other major Democratic candidates in the race to challenge President Donald Trump.
The New Jersey senator, who campaigned Sunday in New Hampshire, said he raised over $5 million in the two months since he entered the 2020 primary, and has over $6.1 million cash on hand.
Booker announced the figure in an email to supporters. The sum puts him near the back of the pack in fundraising with roughly 10 months left before the start of Democratic primary voting. Of those candidates that have announced their figures, only entrepreneur Andrew Yang announced raising less than Booker.
Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke raised $6.1 million during his first 24 hours of presidential campaigning beginning March 14, edging Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' $5.9 million over the same period to top the Democratic field.
Booker said Sunday he feels ""incredible"" about the fundraising haul.
""Money is important, but it is definitely not going to be the barometer with which people make their decisions over who's going to be the next president of the United States,"" Booker said. ""And I'm happy that we have the resources we need to be in this race.""
On the policy front, Booker on Sunday promoted a program known as baby bonds. It calls for newborns to get a savings account. The government would contribute up to $2,000 to the account annually until the child is 18. The amount would depend on their parents' income.
Booker's campaign says it's expected that one in 10 kids in New Hampshire would receive the full $2,000 contribution annually. He said the plan would let kids use the fund to get training, to go to college, to start a business or to buy a home. Booker said the idea is to ""create a fair playing field where everybody has a stake in this economy.""
Elsewhere in campaigning Sunday:
PETE BUTTIGIEG
The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, defended his experience ahead of an expected run for president, saying he isn't someone who has ""been marinating in Washington"" for a long time.
Asked on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" about his qualifications, he said he would ""stack up my experience against anybody,"" though he acknowledged ""it's not as traditional.""
The Democratic field is full of senators and members of the House.
Buttigieg said ""being a mayor of a city of any size means that you have to deal with the kinds of issues that really hit Americans.""
Buttigieg would not confirm that he plans to announce his candidacy at an event next Sunday in South Bend but said ""the kind of thing we're going to announce is the kind of thing you only get to announce once.""
Buttigieg was campaigning in New Hampshire this weekend.

MICHAEL BENNET
The Colorado senator was in New Hampshire, days after he made his prostate cancer diagnosis public. Bennet said earlier this weekend that he wasn't dwelling on the diagnosis and spoke to voters about health care and partisan divides in Washington.
He also told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he hopes to announce a run for president ""as soon as I can,"" depending on his health.
""I have got to go through a procedure at the beginning of the upcoming recess,"" Bennet said. ""That starts later this week. And then it's going to be a couple of weeks for recovery. But I would like to get on with this.""
He added that he's ""looking forward to running in 2020.""
""This obviously was unexpected,"" Bennet said. ""But we caught it early. It's something that I think we're going to be able to treat. And I don't think it should keep me off the trail.""

More cases of women who received labour-inducing drug emerging: lawyer,www.nationalnewswatch.com,The Canadian Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/07/more-cases-of-women-who-received-labour-inducing-drug-emerging-lawyer/,"By The Canadian Press — Apr 7 2019
MONCTON, N.B. — A lawyer retained by women who suspect they were improperly given a labour-inducing drug says the number of alleged victims of a Moncton nurse's inappropriate treatment is growing.
The Horizon Health Network has publicly confirmed there were ""at least two"" pregnant women who had to receive emergency intervention after receiving the drug inappropriately from the registered nurse.
A spokeswoman has also said 40 more women had come forward as of Tuesday seeking information from the Moncton Hospital about their treatment.
The health agency declined further comment on Sunday, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the RCMP.
However, John McKiggan, a medical malpractice lawyer based in Halifax, says he and the Moncton firm Fidelis Law have been asked to represent ""dozens"" of women who suspect they were also treated by the nurse.
The lawyer said more than two women have told him the Moncton Hospital has informed them they were also victims of the inappropriate administration of oxytocin by the nurse.
""I know for sure there are more than two because the hospital has told women that they were a victim of this nurse,"" McKiggan said, though he said he is unclear on the total numbers.
Oxytocin is a drug given to women to induce and speed up labour by causing the uterus to contract.
Hospitals normally have strict policies in place requiring pregnant woman receiving the drug to be closely monitored for adverse effects from the sudden contractions, as they may lead to a reduction of oxygen flow to the baby.
""It's a terribly dangerous drug and one you have to carefully monitor. And it would be shocking that a nurse could have access to oxytocin without a hospital knowing that, and it being administered without anyone else being aware of it,"" said McKiggan.
The Halifax-based lawyer says women who were hooked up to an IV and who started suffering strong contractions shortly after receiving the IV have been contacting the hospital and his office.
He said the hospital should be providing women with more information, as in some instances the mothers aren't being told if the registered nurse being investigated was involved in their treatment.
The hospital ""should be acknowledging their responsibility for what happened and offering whatever information they can to mothers who were concerned about whether or not they were victimized,"" he said in an interview.
""I spoke to one mom this week who called the hospital to try and find out if the nurse involved was part of her labour and delivery team ... but the hospital refused to tell her whether the nurse was on the team.""
Horizon Health spokeswoman Emely Poitras referred The Canadian Press to a prior posted comment by the hospital which invites women ""who experienced quick onset labour"" to contact the health agency and discuss their medical concerns.
The Moncton Hospital has confirmed that the unidentified nurse had been fired after at least two pregnant women were allegedly given the drug oxytocin inappropriately.
Dr. Ken Gillespie, the hospital's chief of staff, has said the pregnant women required emergency intervention but added the mothers and their babies were not harmed.
RCMP have confirmed they are investigating the case, but were unavailable for further comment on Sunday.
Some research has suggested oxytocin can cause the uterus to tear, with potentially catastrophic consequences.
Horizon Health operates the Moncton Hospital and 11 others, along with more than 100 medical facilities and clinics in New Brunswick.

Gov. Gen. Julie Payette visits Rwanda to mark 25th anniversary of genocide,www.nationalnewswatch.com,The Canadian Press,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/07/gov-gen-julie-payette-visits-rwanda-to-mark-25th-anniversary-of-genocide/,"By The Canadian Press — Apr 7 2019
KIGALI, Rwanda — Gov. Gen. Julie Payette laid a wreath at a memorial in Rwanda's capital on Sunday to mark 25 years since the start of a genocide that left an estimated 800,000 people dead.
Payette, who is leading a Canadian delegation on a four-day visit to the east African country, visited the Kigali Genocide Memorial that is the final resting place of roughly 250,000 victims of the genocide.
She told The Canadian Press in a phone interview that the ceremony served a dual purpose: to pay tribute to the victims, while bringing in a ""sense of renewal"" to what she described as an energetic, vibrant country.
""Twenty-five years is a good time to start thinking about the future,"" she said, noting that an estimated two-thirds of the country's population is under the age of 30.
""Many of them weren't born during the genocide, so there is an absolute necessity to not forget ... but also to move forward. And they seem to be doing that, which is amazing.""
Sunday marked the 25th anniversary of the start of the ethnic slaughter that mainly targeted members of the Rwanda's Tutsi minority.
The mass killing was ignited on April 6, 1994, when a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down and crashed in Kigali, killing the leader who, like the majority of Rwandans, was an ethnic Hutu.
The Tutsi minority was blamed for downing the plane, and bands of Hutu extremists began slaughtering the Tutsi, with support from the army, police, and militias.
Canada had a peacekeeping force in Rwanda during the mass bloodshed.
Ethnic reconciliation has been a cornerstone of the rule of Paul Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader since the genocide ended in July 1994 and the country's president since 2000.
Payette said the Canadian delegation was particularly touched by the unity on display during Sunday's commemoration.
""They've decided not to retaliate. They've decided to work together and to reunite, reconcile and forgive. And I tell you, not every society can do that, and that's a model,"" she said.
In a statement earlier in the day on Twitter, Payette offered Canada's sympathies to Rwandans as well as peacekeepers from Canada and elsewhere who she said ""lost so much"" in the massacre.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also released a statement marking the solemn anniversary of what he called ""one of the darkest chapters in recent history.""
He said the genocide showed the ""unconscionable cost of division and hatred,"" and urged Canadians to take time out of their days to remember the victims.
""We can honour them by fighting hate, protecting the most vulnerable, and working to make our world a better one,"" Trudeau said.
In Montreal on Saturday evening, several hundred people attended a ceremony at a library in memory of the victims of the genocide, the city said.
Another ceremony on Sunday was to take place in the city's Old Port area, to be followed by a march and wreath-laying in solidarity with the victims and their loved ones.
About 5,000 Rwandans live in Quebec, 3,000 of them in Montreal, the city said in a news release.

Canadian team mainstay Kelly Olynyk hopes coaching decision comes soon,www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Lori Ewing, The Canadian Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/07/canadian-team-mainstay-kelly-olynyk-hopes-coaching-decision-comes-soon/,"By Lori Ewing, The Canadian Press — Apr 7 2019
TORONTO — Kelly Olynyk knows Canada has a crucial coaching decision to make — and he hopes it comes soon.
""Hopefully they figure it out sooner rather than later so that we have a little time to get things rolling,"" Olynyk said Sunday morning.
Seated at his locker ahead of Miami's matinee against the Raptors on Sunday, the Heat forward and a cornerstone of Canada's national basketball team admitted he had more urgent matters on his mind — Miami's push for a playoff spot. But he's also keeping an eye on what's become a controversial search for a head coach for this summer's World Cup squad.
Sportsnet recently reported that the search is down to two candidates: Roy Rana, who guided Canada to gold at the U19 world championships in 2017, and Gord Herbert, who's coached in Europe for the past 20 years.
According to the report, Ettore Messina, a longtime assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs who was believed to be the front-runner for the job, had recently withdrawn his name from consideration. Messina's departure came shortly after longtime Canadian coach Jay Triano pulled out of the hiring process.
Olynyk, who had six points and four rebounds in Miami's 117-109 ovetime loss to the Raptors, said he would have had no issues with Triano leading the team in China.
""I thought he did a great job,"" said Olynyk. ""We came up short but it was nothing to do with him or who was there.
""We should have won when we lost against Venezuela.""
Olynyk was referring to Canada's one-point loss in the FIBA Americas qualifying tournament that sent Venezuela to the 2016 Olympics. Canada eventually lost to France in a last-chance qualifying tournament.
The Canadians will make their first World Cup appearance since 2010 when the FIBA tournament tips off Aug. 31 in China.
Rowan Barrett, Canada Basketball's general manager of the men's team and father of Duke freshman star R.J. Barrett, plus the national organization's CEO Glen Grunwald, are running the hiring process, and had planned to announce a new head coach by the end of March.
That deadline has come and gone, and Barrett reportedly wants to keep looking.
A Canada Basketball official told The Canadian Press that neither Barrett nor Grunwald would comment on the process until a head coach is hired.
Rana, Herbert and Triano all coached the team during a lengthy qualifying process that saw Canada finish 10-2 — Rana coached eight games, while Herbert and Triano coached two apiece.
The Canadian men's team has been criticized in previous years for the players who have been unwilling to commit to the national program.
Canada Basketball will ask players to commit six weeks of this summer. The World Cup ends Sept. 15, a couple of weeks before NBA training camps open.
Can a coach make a difference in who wants to play and who doesn't?
""You never know, it could, it couldn't,"" Olynyk said. ""Guys will have their reasons for playing and for not playing and you have to respect them.
""I don't think a coach is super influential on those reasons, but obviously guys want to play for some people, and other guys maybe other people aren't as attractive a situation. I don't know if it deters anybody, maybe it's just not as attractive. You never know what's going through guys' heads.""
What would the 27-year-old centre like to see in a coach? While knowledge of the international game is important, it's more about the ability to create the right chemistry.
""We have a lot of good players so you need to be able to bring those guys together and get the most out of everyone's talents,"" Olynyk said.
""It's a lot like an NBA team. A lot of teams have a lot of talent, but if you make the team greater than the sum of it's parts then you're going to be real good, and we have the talent, we have the people to fill those roles, we just need someone to bring us together and kind of guide and help us achieve our goals.""
Expectations will be huge on a Canadian team that should boast the best collection of talent to ever suit up for Canada. Featuring likely eight or so of the country's top NBA players, plus players who bring a wealth of international talent, competition for spots on the team alone could be fierce.
The World Cup is also the main qualifier for the 2020 Olympics, with the top seven finishers punching their ticket to Tokyo.
The Canadian men haven't played in the Olympics since Triano coached a squad led by Steve Nash to a 5-2 record and seventh-place finish in 2000 in Sydney.

"Scheer urges PM to follow through on libel threat over SNC, testify in court",www.nationalnewswatch.com,"Joan Bryden , The Canadian Press",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2019/04/07/scheer-promises-to-release-new-documents-related-to-snc-lavalin-affair/,"By Joan Bryden , The Canadian Press — Apr 7 2019
OTTAWA — Andrew Scheer is challenging Justin Trudeau to follow through on a threat to sue him over his assertion that the prime minister politically interfered with the criminal prosecution of Montreal engineering giant SNC-Lavlin.
The Conservative leader revealed Sunday that he received a letter on March 31 from Trudeau's lawyer, Julian Porter, threatening a libel suit.
""I stand by every single criticism I have made of Mr. Trudeau's conduct in regards to this scandal, including those Mr. Trudeau's lawyer cites in his letter,"" Scheer told a news conference.
""If Mr. Trudeau intends to pursue this course of legal action, if he believes he has a case against me, I urge him to do so immediately. This is an urgent matter of public interest and it deserves to be heard in a legal setting where Liberals do not control the proceedings.""
Scheer said he looks forward to Trudeau testifying ""for hours"" under oath in open court.
That said, Scheer made it clear he believes Trudeau is bluffing. He called the threatened lawsuit ""a bullying attempt"" to prevent the official Opposition from doing its constitutional duty to hold the government to account and a continuation of Trudeau's attempts to ""silence those who stand up to Justin Trudeau and who seek the truth"" — just as he tried to silence former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould, Scheer said.
In a statement, the Prime Minister's Office said Scheer and his party ""have repeatedly made false and defamatory statements. We put him on notice that there are consequences for making completely false and libellous statements.""
Wilson-Raybould maintains she was inappropriately pressured last fall by the Prime Minister's Office to stop criminal proceedings against SNC-Lavalin on bribery charges related to contracts in Libya. She believes she was moved to Veterans Affairs in a mid-January cabinet shuffle as punishment for refusing to override the director of public prosecutions, who had decided not to negotiate a remediation agreement, a type of plea bargain, with the company. She resigned from cabinet a month later.
Last week, Trudeau expelled both Wilson-Raybould and fellow former cabinet minister Jane Philpott from the Liberal caucus. Philpott had resigned from cabinet in early March, citing a loss of confidence in the government's handling of the SNC-Lavalin case.
At issue in the threatened libel suit is a statement Scheer issued on March 29 in which he said documentation provided by Wilson-Raybould to the House of Commons justice committee — including a surreptitiously recorded phone conversation with the clerk of the Privy Council, Michael Wernick — is ""concrete evidence that proves Justin Trudeau led a campaign to politically interfere with SNC-Lavalin's criminal prosecution.""
Porter called the statement ""highly defamatory.""
""The prime minister supports wide-ranging and vigorous political debate on matters of public policy,"" he said in his letter to Scheer. ""However, your statement, in its entirety, is beyond the pale of fair debate and is libellous of my client personally and in the way of his occupation as prime minister.""
Porter said it's ""entirely false"" to say Trudeau interfered in the SNC prosecution, which has not been halted, or that he personally directed Wilson-Raybould to ""break the law"" and ""fired"" her when she refused. It's also entirely false to suggest Trudeau was aware of Wilson-Raybould's concern that he was politically interfering in the SNC case but lied to Canadians about it, Porter said.
Scheer's statement that the affair amounts to ""corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption"" was meant to suggest that Trudeau ""had engaged in dishonest and corrupt conduct that would contravene the Criminal Code,"" a crime deserving of up to 14 years in prison, Porter said. That too was ""entirely false.""
Undeterred, Scheer repeated that phrase twice during his news conference Sunday.
While Conservatives have embraced every other aspect of Wilson-Raybould's testimony as the absolute truth, they have not accepted her conclusion that nothing illegal occurred.
""That was her opinion on that,"" said Scheer, noting that he's asked the RCMP to investigate whether any laws were broken. He said he's not heard anything from the RCMP other than an acknowledgment of his Feb. 28 request for an investigation.
Scheer's lawyer, Peter Downard, wrote back to Porter on Sunday, saying that Scheer ""will not be intimidated."" If Trudeau is serious about suing, Downard said he must immediately take steps to preserve all relevant documents and to notify all members of his government, past and present, who've been involved in the SNC-Lavalin matter that they can expect to be called to testify.
If Trudeau does not proceed with the threatened lawsuit, Downard said Scheer will conclude that Trudeau ""has properly acknowledged that Mr. Scheer's statements were appropriate and grounded in evidence before the Canadian people.""

""The prime minister supports wide-ranging and vigorous political debate on matters of public policy,"" he said in his letter to Scheer. ""However, your statement, in its entirety, is beyond the pale of fair debate and is libellous of my client personally and in the way of his occupation as prime minister.""
Porter said it's ""entirely false"" to say Trudeau interfered in the SNC prosecution, which has not been halted, or that he personally directed Wilson-Raybould to ""break the law"" and ""fired"" her when she refused. It's also entirely false to suggest Trudeau was aware of Wilson-Raybould's concern that he was politically interfering in the SNC case but lied to Canadians about it, Porter said.
Scheer's statement that the affair amounts to ""corruption on top of corruption on top of corruption"" was meant to suggest that Trudeau ""had engaged in dishonest and corrupt conduct that would contravene the Criminal Code,"" a crime deserving of up to 14 years in prison, Porter said. That too was ""entirely false.""
In response, Scheer's lawyer, Peter Downard, wrote back Sunday that Scheer ""will not be intimidated"" and is simply performing his ""constitutional duty"" to hold the government to account.
If Trudeau is serious about suing, Downard said he must immediately take steps to preserve all relevant documents and to notify all members of his government, past and present, who've been involved in the SNC-Lavalin matter that they can expect to be called to testify.
If Trudeau does not proceed with the threatened lawsuit, Downard said Scheer will conclude that Trudeau ""has properly acknowledged that Mr. Scheer's statements were appropriate and grounded in evidence before the Canadian people.""

"Nunes Hints At Criminal Referrals He’ll Send Barr, Including A ‘Global Leak Referral’ – Talking Points Memo",talkingpointsmemo.com,Matt Shuham,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/nunes-hints-at-criminal-referrals-hell-send-barr-including-a-global-leak-referral,"By Matt Shuham April 7, 2019 5:13 pm
As he awaits a response to his lawsuit against @DevinCow and others, Trump ally and House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes (R-CA) on Sunday hinted at criminal referrals he said he was prepared to send to Attorney General William Barr.
“There’s only two or three reporters involved in this, and so it wouldn’t be hard to get to the bottom of,” Nunes said of the what he called a “global leak referral” he’d send to Barr, one out of a total of eight referrals he detailed in an interview on Fox News’“Sunday Morning Futures.”
He said five separate referrals would address “specific” alleged criminal violations based on “lying, leaking, and misleading Congress,” and that two more would address alleged conspiracies, one for “FISA abuse and other matters,” and another for “manipulation of intelligence.”
Nunes implied in the interview that he’d waited two and a half years to send the referrals to the Justice Department because there wasn’t “a grown-up” leading the department.
“We’ve been working so hard for two and a half years, waiting for a real attorney general, which we have now in attorney general Barr, a grown-up is finally in the room, which is why we’re prepared to do a lot of cleanup here,” he said.
Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions resigned on Nov. 7, 2018 — though he recused himself from Russia-related matters much earlier, in March 2017 — leaving Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to lead the department until the Senate confirmation of current Attorney General William Barr in February .

You can never read 1984 Part 3, Chapter 3 enough. O'Brien explains the Modern Left.
http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/19.html
The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.
Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?'"
