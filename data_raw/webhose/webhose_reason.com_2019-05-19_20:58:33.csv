Ontario’s Glacial Booze Reforms Aren’t Enough,reason.com,Baylen Linnekin,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/20/ontarios-glacial-booze-reforms-arent-enough/,"In Canada, a new Ontario provincial budget released last week proposes to loosen alcohol consumption rules in the province, including allowing licensed establishments to start serving alcohol at 9 a.m., legalizing tailgating, letting local governments set rules that would allow people to consume alcohol in public parks, and letting breweries, wineries, and distilleries serve more than mere samples. Other proposed changes include plans to allow convenience stores to sell beer and wine, legalizing happy hour advertisements, and postponing a new wine tax that was set to take effect this month.
The proposals come after the provincial government recently sought public comment on its plans to ""moderniz[e] the rules for the sale and consumption of alcohol in Ontario.""
""The cornerstone of putting people first is consumer choice and convenience,"" Finance Minister Vic Fedeli said of the plans. ""This is why our government is taking steps to modernize the way we sell, distribute and consume alcohol in Ontario.""
Three things appear to be true of Ontario's alcohol laws. First, they're in great need of reform. Second, people such as Fedeli are talking openly about the need for changes. Third, the first and second points above are true largely due to decades of inadequate half-measures masquerading as real reform.
A 1997 article by the Mackenzie Institute, a Canadian think tank, lists a host of inane provincial booze laws throughout recent history, including that, ""until about 1970, Ontario's bars were required to have a separate Ladies entrance and a room where escorted gentlewomen might enjoy a beverage with a respectable male companion."" More recently, in 2011, it was a pretty big deal when Ontario alcohol deregulation measures allowed licensed establishments to give you a free drink on your birthday. Yay.
The elephant in the room is Ontario's liquor control board, known as the LCBO, which has long been reviled both as the heart of the province's booze-law problem and a powerful obstacle to reform.
Much of the hatred toward the LCBO comes from the ""quasi-monopoly"" it enjoys over alcohol sales. Another facet of the LCBO that Ontarians detest is the strong LCBO union that uses its power to head off competition from private sellers.
""Our prohibition-era alcohol system is not about protecting drinkers or maximizing revenues for the government,"" wrote Candice Malcolm, of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, in a 2014 piece in the Toronto Sun . ""It is about power and control, particularly for government-sector unions.""
Ontario's awful alcohol rules have consequences. Toronto is the province's—and Canada's—largest and most international city. But Toronto is also derided as boring. And when someone paints Toronto as un-fun, bad booze laws usually get the blame.
"" To be fair, much of Toronto's lameness comes from the fact the city happens to be located in Ontario,"" wrote Benjamin Boles at blogTO in a great 2014 post that details the city's and province's rich history of terrible alcohol laws, including temperance laws that stayed on the books in Toronto into at least the late 1990s. ""The province's liquor laws are legendarily strict and often bizarre. ""
But Ontario's bad alcohol laws don't exist in a vacuum. To be clear, Canada has some pretty rotten alcohol laws in force around the country.
Those that restrict the movement of alcohol across provincial borders are some of the worst. Unfortunately, the country's Supreme Court chose to uphold those laws last year.
The national government has also seen fit to adopt new and highly intrusive and draconian steps to combat drunk driving.
One such measure , which took effect nationwide in December, gives police the terrifying ""power to demand a breath sample at the roadside, without reasonable grounds."" Critics have assailed the measure as a frontal assault on civil liberties.
"" The country has been tending towards a police state for some time,"" columnist Arthur Weinreb wrote last year. ""Nowhere are the losses of individual rights accepted by so many people as when these rights are taken away in order to combat drinking and driving. "" Weinreb reveals that a police officer used the law to pull over a 70-year-old man who'd dropped off a variety of empty beer cans and the like at a recycling center.
Yet a police spokesman said officers would use to law to target ""cars leaving licensed establishments or leaving the downtown,"" the Guelph Mercury Tribune reports .
""The officer told him the three cases of empties were a lot, he was obviously a drinker and he was then asked when he last had a drink,"" Weinreb writes. ""[The man] said he last drank around midnight the day before."" The police officer then demanded the elderly man take a breathalyzer test.
While the national government has made the country's booze laws fodder for columnists, the prospects for disentangling the Ontario government from alcohol sales appear largely to be a welcome development among the same crowd.
"" I strongly dislike [center-right Ontario Premier Doug] Ford and pretty much everything he's done, both in and out of office, but I'm simply not hyperpartisan enough to argue that his booze proposals are inherently bad ideas,"" writes columnist Emma Teitel. ""They're not. Ford is a crappy leader—the kind who values populist gobbledygook over research and whose education minister believes neglect promotes resilience—but even crappy leaders have decent ideas sometimes.""
Consider me a fan, then, of good ideas from crappy leaders."
All the Top Democrats Running for President Favor Legalizing Marijuana,reason.com,Matt Welch,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/20/all-the-top-democrats-running-for-president-favor-legalizing-marijuana/,"""Marijuana legalization,"" declared a Vox headline last month, ""is winning the 2020 Democratic primaries."" A quick scan of the field indeed shows how far we've come since even 2011, when "" Choom gang "" alum Barack Obama was still cracking down on state-legal medical marijuana outfits and laughing off suggestions that prohibiting a popular, non-lethal plant was perhaps not the wisest public policy.
In fact, the top 11 highest-polling declared Democratic presidential candidates (plus a bunch in the lower tiers, notably Rep. Tulsi Gabbard [D–Hawaii]) have all backed some form of ending the federal prohibition of marijuana, fewer than four years after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) became the first major-party candidate in history to do so. Several in fact have become legislative leaders on this issue, especially Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), plus former congressman Beto O'Rourke.
As popular opinion and state law speeds toward legalizing recreational weed, and a tough-on-crime Republican president frees prisoners and advances criminal justice reform, former drug warriors are scrambling to catch up with the times. The last holdout here may be still-undeclared candidate Joe Biden , who invented the office of the drug czar, spearheaded some of the very worst criminal justice laws of the past four decades, and said while vice president that legalization is a ""mistake"" because marijuana is a "" gateway drug .""
Still, as senior editor and longtime drug policy journalist Jacob Sullum told Nick Gillespie on Wednesday's Reason Podcast , virtually all major-party presidential candidates this year are pretty damned good on pot legalization. This not only is unprecedented, it was also unthinkable very recently.
So with a big assist from our friends at Marijuana Moment , and taking advantage of Reason 's new-and-improved search engine, here's a survey of post positions among the highest-polling Democrats to declare:
1) Bernie Sanders
Legalize it! : Sanders in October 2015 became the first major-party presidential candidate to come out in favor of legalizing marijuana. Since then he introduced the Senate's first bill to repeal federal prohibition and has made ending the war on drugs one of his central issues .
Other bills/concepts backed : Co-sponsored (as did many 2020 competitors) Cory Booker's Marijuana Justice Act , which would expunge possession arrests from people's records, allow current pot prisoners to be resentenced, and withhold federal funding from states that crack down too vigorously on weed. Thinks ""small business people in the African American [community] deserve to be part of"" the corporate marijuana market.
Prohibition disconnect : Has questioned why non-marijuana cigarettes should be legal.
Inhaling status : ""Didn't do a whole lot for me. My recollection is I nearly coughed my brains out, so it's not my cup of tea .""
2) Beto O'Rourke
Legalize it! : O'Rourke was earlier than 99 percent of elected Democrats to the legalization issue, pushing the El Paso City Council in 2009 to at least study it, co-writing a 2011 book advocating legal weed, and successfully primarying an eight-term prohibitionist in 2012. He not only wants to remove federal prohibition, he'd also like the federal government to declare the plant legal across all 50 states, and then lead the international fight to ""end the global war on drugs.""
Other bills/concepts backed : As congressman, introduced a bill to end the federal government's policy of withholding highway funds to states unless they suspend the driver's licenses of drug convicts. Also co-sponsored various bills to seal criminal drug records, protect legal-weed states, allow doctors to prescribe pot to veterans, and remove possession convictions as a barrier to federal student aid.
Prohibition disconnect : Thinks a good way to combat opioid overdoses is by jailing pharmaceutical executives .
Inhaling status : ""Pot, yeah, there was definitely , you know….There was, uh, I don't know how to put this, but yeah. People smoked pot, but not habitually.""
3) Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.)
Legalize it! : Now , sure. But before gearing up to run for president? Ugh .
Other bills/concepts backed : The Marijuana Justice Act. Beyond that , ""Harris has only co-sponsored one other cannabis-related bill: the SAFE Banking Act, which would protect banks that work with marijuana businesses from federal punishment.""
Prohibition disconnect :
Inhaling status : ""I inhaled ….It gives a lot of people joy, and we need more joy.""
4) Pete Buttigieg
Legalize it! : ""I think even in Indiana, criminal justice reform, including marijuana [legalization], we're probably there….I really think a state-wide campaign in Indiana would do well, especially on the criminal justice stuff. To find common cause between the younger, libertarian right that's not so sure about the Republican Party as an institution, and a more traditional, progressive coalition—I think you can get there on drugs .""
Other bills/concepts backed : Well, the South Bend mayor is only 37 years old. Has talked favorably about commuting sentences and rehabilitating ex-cons once drug laws are changed.
Prohibition disconnect : Approved ""an ordinance in 2017 that prohibited businesses in the city from selling synthetic cannabinoids.""
Inhaling status : ""I was standing outside my dorm. I was on my way home from a party or something….I ran into a friend and he had an acquaintance with him, and we were chatting, and at some point I noticed that she was smoking a joint. And just out of curiosity — there was like a little bit left — I was like 'Oh, is that…' And she handed it to me .""
5) Elizabeth Warren
Legalize it! : Since 2017, yes, though as recently as 2016 she declined to endorse a Massachusetts recreational initiative (which she then later lied about ); and in 2013 she was out-and-out tarring her Republican opponent as being soft on pot .
Other bills/concepts backed : Was the main Democratic sponsor of a bipartisan 2018 bill to removal federal prohibitions in states where marijuana is legal. Co-sponsored the Marijuana Justice Act, plus bills to deschedule weed, legalize pot-related banking, and conduct research aimed at getting veterans medicinal access.
Prohibition disconnect : Warren would like to create a huge new federal Office of Drug Manufacturing , which wouldn't necessarily start as the nationalized pot pusher-man, but….
Inhaling status : "" No .""
6) Cory Booker
Legalize it! : Cory Booker is the most far-reaching pro-legalization Democrat in the United States Senate, frequently joining with the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul (R–Ky.) on all manner of criminal justice reform. Has made his Marijuana Justice Act a centerpiece of his presidential run, and busted johnny-come-latelies like Kamala Harris for making jokes about the herb while people still rot in prison. Like O'Rourke, he was railing against the drug war in local politics more than a decade ago.
Other bills/concepts backed : Co-sponsored the landmark CARERS Act, which would protect state-legal marijuana operations from federal law enforcement. Would "" absolutely "" back mass marijuana-related pardons as president.
Prohibition disconnect : Has repeatedly expanded a law enforcement approach to the opioid crisis.
Inhaling status : ""I have never smoked marijuana , I have never smoked a cigarette, I have never eaten marijuana, I have never tried another drug, I have never drank alcohol . I think the most alcohol I have had may be a sip of beer to get my friends off my back, or maybe the church wine.""
7) Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)
Legalize it! : ""I support the legalization of marijuana and believe that states should have the right to determine the best approach to marijuana within their borders,"" she said in 2019. Twenty years ago it was a much different story .
Other bills/concepts backed : Co-sponsored the Booker/Warren Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States ( STATES ) Act. Has backed measures to expand cannabis research and remove pot from the Controlled Substances Act.
Prohibition disconnect : As Hennepin County (Minneapolis) Attorney from 1999-2006, Klobuchar doubled the number of drug convictions. "" We must keep a focus on drug dealers ,"" she said in 2004. As senator, she has been one of the leading proponents of civil-liberties-restricting ""sex trafficking"" legislation.
Inhaling status : Unclear .
8) Julián Castro
Legalize it! : ""Colorado and other states have shown we can sensibly legalize marijuana with reasonable controls.""
Other bills/concepts backed : In favor of expunging drug-possession arrests from criminal records.
Prohibition disconnect : ""Under his leadership, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) published a 2014 memo clarifying that owners of federally assisted housing facilities are required to deny entry to people who use marijuana, even for medical purposes in accordance with state law.""
Inhaling status : ""It's unknown if Castro has ever consumed cannabis, though he did write in his book that he hung out in college with a 'Jeff Spicoli' type.""
9) Andrew Yang
Legalize it! : In one of the better campaign stunts in recent memory, the tech entrepreneur and robot-pessimist announced earlier this month that, ""I would legalize marijuana and I would pardon everyone who's in jail for a non-violent, drug-related offense….I would pardon them all on April 20, 2021, and I would high five them on their way out of jail."" Later, he clarified that this pertained only to marijuana-related convictions, but still—4/20 clemency day!
Other bills/concepts backed : Decriminalizing opioid use and possession.
Prohibition disconnect : Yang has some of the weirdest policy sets out there, including providing ""guardrails to keep technology from corroding our mental and emotional well-being, particularly for young people,"" because smartphones are having a ""devastating"" impact on children.
Inhaling status : ""No, no, I'm not really"" a weed smoker, he said in a radio interview this month. ""You know, I was a pretty geeky Asian dude.""
10) Kirsten Gillibrand
Legalize it! : ""The senator, who has an A grade from NORML, has become one of the most vocal advocates for federal marijuana reform in Congress, co-sponsoring multiple pieces of legislation and frequently talking about the issue in speeches and on social media. However, she did not start off her political career supporting cannabis reform.""
Other bills/concepts backed : Marijuana Justice Act, CARERS Act, the Booker/Warren Respect States Act, expanding research, expunging records, giving access to veterans.
Prohibition disconnect : Hoo boy. Gillibrand last month proposed a seven-day limit to pain prescriptions, which is one of the worst policy ideas in recent memory.
Inhaling status : Unknown.
11) John Hickenlooper
Legalize it! : The former Colorado governor ""may be best known nationally as the guy who opposed marijuana legalization in his state but ultimately decided it was not the disaster he feared it would be.""
Other bills/concepts backed : Supports the STATES Act , and further says that the laboratories of democracy should be able to decriminalize cocaine and heroin (and sex work!), which is unusually bold. Favors expunging non-violent convictions.
Prohibition disconnect : Even after his big policy turn, Hickenlooper signed a ban on pot gummy bears and animal-shaped edibles, and a reduction on the number of pot plants people can have in their homes. He vetoed a bill allowing for marijuana tasting rooms .
Inhaling status : ""He wrote in his book about how his mother caught him attempting to grow marijuana during high school, how cannabis 'slowed me down and made me kind of silly' and how he 'got a little high' and took a nude selfie as part of a project for an advanced photography class in college."""
CBD Is Still Banned in States With Legal Weed – Reason.com,reason.com,Alexis Garcia,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/video/cbd-is-still-banned-in-states-with-legal-weed/,"As more states legalize recreational marijuana use, another part of the cannabis plant has found a market niche. CBD, short for cannabidiol, is a molecule that can be derived from hemp or cannabis. It doesn't contain THC, so it won't get you high.
The compound has become a common ingredient in trendy wellness products because of its purported therapeutic benefits.
""I became really like obsessed with CBD,"" says Jonathan Eppers, founder of Vybes beverages. ""I always tell people it's like liquid yoga.""
Eppers, whose company makes CBD drinks that are sold in nearly 250 U.S. grocery stores , coffee shops, and hotels, says that he launched the beverage startup in 2017 after using CBD oils to treat his own anxiety. But the products that he sells are illegal—even in states like California where recreational marijuana is now widely available.
""I didn't really didn't think too much about the regulations around CBD because CBD oil was being sold in grocery stores here in LA,"" Eppers says. ""But once I got into it we sort of realized we were in a gray area with CBD.""
In January 2019, Eppers said officials from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) showed up to one of his Los Angeles warehouses and confiscated $140,000 worth of Vybes beverages. Eppers says state officials put an embargo on his product and went after a company that helps package his products in Northern California.
""Basically for two months, we haven't been able to sell Vybes which is costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" states Eppers.
California is just one of many states where CBD sales are legally murky. The law clearly allows for the sale of cannabis-derived CBD products, but items that contain the hemp version of the molecule are prohibited.
""The Department of Public Health here is of the view that CBD can't be put in foods, beverages, animal foods you name it,"" says Griffen Thorne, a cannabis lawyer with Harris Bricken . ""It is kind of interesting that you have marijuana, which is still federally illegal and there's a path towards sales for companies that want to actually make and sell marijuana products. Whereas CBD is derived from a plant that's no longer federally illegal and there are a ton of roadblocks and there's zero clarity on how to do it for many products.""
Just months after Eppers launch his company, the CDPH released an FAQ document that echoed the Food and Drug Administration's stance on CBD, stating that products containing the compound could not be sold by unlicensed retailers. But the document contained no guidance for enforcement, and many retailers—unaware of the state's stance on CBD—have continued selling the product to consumers.
""I was confused because CBD had been sold in California for several years and it's only getting bigger,"" Eppers says. ""And all of a sudden they were coming out and saying we couldn't put this in food and beverages. So it was like what changed?""
While continuing to sell his product, Eppers asked the state for legal clarification. He was hopeful that passage of the 2018 U.S. Farm Bill , removing hemp from the Controlled Substances list, would establish that his products are fully legal. But he soon discovered that wasn't the case.
""It wasn't until after the Farm Bill passed that California became a lot more aggressive and actually [started] going after companies here in California that were producing CBD products,"" says Eppers.
Kenny Morrison, a cannabis industry veteran who runs VCC Brands and serves as president of the California Cannabis Manufacturers Association , sees parallels between today's CBD market and the early days of recreational marijuana.
""It's all just layovers from prohibition,"" Morrison states. ""The retail model of cannabis being sold at a storefront, in order for that to become accepted and commonplace people had to sort of break the law or interpret the law in a new way. And we're seeing that with CBD as well. So it's kind of ironic that now cannabis is super regulated and CBD isn't. Yet cannabis paved the way for CBD.""
With consumer sales of CBD products projected to top $2 billion by 2020 , lawmakers in several states, including California, are pushing for bipartisan legislation that would legalize the use of CBD in food, beverage, and cosmetic products.
California's CBD bill, AB 228 , is currently making its way through the statehouse, a move Eppers and others hope will clean up the regulatory mess left over from prohibition.
""What's happened with the state kind of clamping down on this is it's really brought the industry together,"" Eppers says. ""The state will fix this legislatively.""

Five Environmental and Human Trends Worth Celebrating This Earth Day,reason.com,Ronald Bailey,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/22/five-environmental-and-human-trends-worth-celebrating-this-earth-day/,"To celebrate the 49th Earth Day, below are some global trends indicate that the state of humanity and the natural world is on course to dramatically improve by the end of this century.
Peak Population : The world population will likely peak at 9.8 billion people at around 2080 and fall to 9.5 billion by 2100 in the medium fertility scenario calculated by demographer Wolfgang Lutz and his colleagues at the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis.
Alternatively, assuming rapid economic growth, technological advancement, and rising levels of educational attainment for both sexes—all factors that tend to lower fertility—Lutz projects that world population will more likely peak at around 8.9 billion by 2060 and decline to 7.8 billion by the end of the 21st century. Global population stands at about 7.7 billion now.
Other global trends such as steeply falling child mortality rates, increased urbanization, rising incomes, and the spread of political and economic freedom all strongly correlate with families choosing to have fewer children. Instead of having many children in the hope that a few might survive, more parents around the world now at aim at providing those few that they do have with the skills and social capital that will enable them to flourish in a modern economy.
Forest Expansion : Global tree canopy cover increased by 2.24 million square kilometers (865,000 square miles) between 1982 and 2016, reported researchers at the University of Maryland in a September 2018 study in ​ Nature ​.
Using satellite data to track the changes in various land covers, they found that gains in forest area in the temperate, subtropical, and boreal climatic zones are offsetting declines in the tropics.
Tree canopy in Europe, including European Russia, has increased by 35 percent—the greatest gain among all continents. The researchers attribute much of that increase to the ""natural afforestation on abandoned agricultural land,"" which has been ""a common process in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union."" The tree canopy in the U.S. and China has increased by 34 and 15 percent respectively.
Simon Resource Abundance Index : Data for 50 foundational commodities covering energy, food, materials, and metals was collected by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund between 1980 and 2017. Adjusted for inflation, the prices for 43 commodities declined, two remained equally valuable, and five commodities increased in price. On average, the real price of 50 commodities fell by 36.3 percent.
Between 1980 and 2017, the inflation-adjusted global hourly income per person grew by 80.1 percent. Therefore, in terms of the amount of work required, commodities became 64.7 percent cheaper . Put differently, commodities that took 60 minutes of work to buy in 1980, took only 21 minutes of work to buy in 2017.
U.S. Air Pollution Trends : The Environmental Protection Agency reports that between 1980 and 2017, U.S. gross domestic product increased 165 percent, vehicle miles traveled increased 110 percent, energy consumption increased by 25 percent, and U.S. population grew by 44 percent. During the same period, emissions of carbon monoxide fell by 72 percent; lead by 99 percent; nitrogen oxides by 61 percent; compounds from automobile exhaust associated with ozone by 54 percent; sulfur dioxide by 89 percent, and particulates by 61 percent. During the same time period, total emissions of the six principal air pollutants dropped by 67 percent.
Peak Farmland : Global arable land (annual crops like wheat and corn) and permanent crops (such as coffee and cocoa) were planted on 1,371 million hectares in 1961. That rose to 1,533 million hectares in 2009. Rockefeller University researcher Jesse Ausubel and his co-authors project a return to 1,385 million hectares in 2060, thus restoring at least 146 million hectares to nature. This is an area two and a half times that of France or the size of ten Iowas. While cropland has continued to expand slowly since 2009, the World Bank reports that land devoted to agriculture (including pastures) peaked in 2000 at 4,918 million hectares and had fallen to 4,862 million hectares by 2015. This human withdrawal from the landscape is the likely prelude to a vast ecological restoration over the course of this century.
Happy Earth Day!"
What Did Libertarians Learn from the Mueller Report?,reason.com,Matt Welch,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/podcast/what-did-libertarians-learn-from-the-mueller-report/,"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media.blubrry.com/reason_podcast/p/reasontv-video.s3.amazonaws.com/reasontv_audio_8001695.mp3 Download What Did Libertarians Learn from the Mueller Report? Now that the smoke has cleared from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Donald Trump's suspected (and now-disregarded) criminal conspiracy with Russia and his potential obstruction of the investigation thereof, there are many questions that still remain, including: Should we be alarmed by the role that counterterrorism-investigation leaks played in kickstarting this investigation? Are there specific trims to government power that this whole episode suggests, and if so why aren't they being discussed? Is it useful to have conversations about having conversations about conversations?
All of these riddles and more are hotly debated on this week's Editors' Roundtable edition of the Reason Podcast , betwixt Katherine Mangu-Ward , Nick Gillespie , Peter Suderman , and Matt Welch . The episode also features a name-that-Democratic-candidate pop quiz, a quick round of Biden-kicking, and—yes, nerds ( sigh )—some discussion of that television show from last night.

Social Security Will Be Insolvent in 16 Years – Reason.com,reason.com,Eric Boehm,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/22/social-security-will-be-insolvent-in-16-years/,"Social Security will be insolvent and unable to pay the full value of promised benefits by 2035—that's one full year later than previously expected —and Social Security's costs will exceed its income by 2020, according to a new report published Monday by the program's trustees.
At the end of 2018, Social Security was providing income to about 67 million Americans . About 47 million of them were over age 65, and the majority of the rest were disabled. If nothing changes, the Social Security Trust Fund will be fully depleted by 2035 and the program would impose across-the-board cuts of 20 percent to all beneficiaries. That may sound like it's a long way off, but 51-year-old workers today will be just hitting retirement age when the cuts kick in. Some current retirees will still be younger than 80.
By that point, some parts of Medicare will already be unable to cover the full cost of benefits.
The trustees' report released Monday shows that the trust fund for Medicare Part A, which covers hospital and nursing home costs, will be gone by 2026. Medicare Part B, which covers routine medical care like visits to the doctor, and Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs, are on more solid footing and will remain solvent ""indefinitely.""
It is important to remember that insolvency is not the same as bankruptcy. By 2026 and 2034, respectively, Medicare and Social Security will not have enough money to pay the full cost of their obligations, but that's not the same as saying they'll have no money at all.
It's also important to keep in mind that these projections are constantly shifting based on economic data, demographic trends, and actuarial projections. Last year, Social Security was supposed to hit insolvency in 2034. The year before, the trustees said insolvency wouldn't hit until 2037. It's a moving target, but time keeps on slipping and ignoring the looming crisis won't make it go away.
Still, Congress could be spurred to action by the threat that Social Security will post losses in just two years. The last time that happened, in 1982, it provided an impetus for federal policymakers to make several changes, including an increase to the payroll tax, that kept the federal old-age pension program solvent. Without policy changes, the new report shows that Social Security would start losing money in 2020 and would continue to operate in the red for decades to come—long past the point when the program would be able to fund its promises to retired Americans.
Right now, there's not much evidence that federal policymakers are ready for that challenge. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised not to touch Social Security while he's in office, while Democrats in Congress are eyeing Medicare for All proposals that would likely pile massive new obligations onto a federal entitlement program that's already struggling under its own weight.
""That fact that we now can't guarantee full benefits to current retirees is completely unacceptable, and it should be cause enough for every policymaker to rally around solutions to restore solvency to those programs,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that advocates for balanced budgets, in a statement. ""Certainly we should be focused on saving Social Security and Medicare before we start promising to expand these programs.""
What's really needed is a complete reconsidering of the relationship between older Americans and those entitlement programs. Both Social Security and Medicare were designed more than half a century ago for an entirely different workforce and population. When Social Security launched in 1935, the average life expectancy for Americans was 61 —that means the average person died four years before qualifying for benefits.
Meanwhile, demographics are blowing up the basic premise of how Social Security is funded. There were 2.8 workers for every Social Security recipient in 2017 . That's down from 3.3 in 2007, and that's way down from the 5.1 workers per beneficiary that existed in 1960.
Today, the two programs function mostly as a giant conveyor belt to transfer wealth from the young and relatively poor to the old and relatively rich , allowing the average person (who now lives to be 78) more than a decade of taxpayer-funded retirement.
When and if Congress gets around to doing anything, both programs should be restructured to ensure they take care of the truly needy, rather than being benefits for anyone who has reached an arbitrary age. As Reason 's Nick Gillespie and Veronique de Rugy wrote in a still-very-relevant 2012 feature on the future of America's entitlements, ""Focusing on those truly in need instead of automatically shoveling out larger and larger amounts to well-off senior citizens is the best way to avert looming fiscal catastrophe and restore some morality to an indefensible system.""
Those entitlement programs are also the primary drivers of our national debt, which just hit $22 trillion and is on pace to reach levels not seen since World War II by the end of the next decade.
""Every day that passes, the problem gets bigger and the solutions become more difficult to implement,"" said MacGuineas.
About the only way Congress will get off the hook is if climate change kills everyone in the next 12 years ."
Elizabeth Warren’s Plan To Cancel College Debt Is a Giveaway to the Well-Off and Well-Connected,reason.com,Peter Suderman,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/23/elizabeth-warrens-plan-to-cancel-college-debt-is-a-giveaway-to-the-well-off-and-well-connected/,"Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic primary's foremost Game of Thrones recapper , styles herself a staunch defender of the little guy. In her campaign announcement, for example, the Massachusetts senator declared that millions of American families are currently ""struggling to survive in a system that's been rigged, rigged by the wealthy and the well-connected."" She's a true champion of the struggling middle class, the sort of grounded and relatable politician who knows what it's like to be 29 years old and still sharing your parents' HBO GO password.
To prove her commitment to fighting a system that is rigged by and for the wealthy and well-connected, Warren yesterday announced a new plan (with Warren, there's always a plan) that would … provide more than a trillion dollars in aid to the wealthy and well-connected.
In addition to ending tuition at public colleges, Warren wants to cancel the vast majority of outstanding student loan debt. The idea is to eliminate debt up to $50,000 for people with household incomes under $100,000, and offer more limited debt cancellation for households making between $100,000 and $250,000. By her own estimates, the full plan, which also includes funds for Pell Grants and historically black colleges, would cost about $1.25 trillion, which she says she would pay for with a tax on wealth that she announced earlier this year.
On the surface, Warren's idea might sound like another expensive federal benefit for struggling families. But the nature of college attendance and student loans means that Warren's loan forgiveness plan is a massive giveaway to relatively well-off people.
In the U.S., only about a third of people over 25 have a college degree, making them a comparatively elite group whose elite status is reinforced by, among other things, the connections they make while at college.
On average, college graduates earn about $1 million more during their lifetimes than non-college graduates, according to a Georgetown University study. A separate study from Pew found that college graduates typically earn about $17,500 more annually than people who only had high school degrees.
College graduates aren't, for the most part, super rich. But generally speaking, they are far more comfortable than the majority who lack such degrees. And the rich, however you define that word, are a class comprised almost entirely of people who graduated from college (with, yes, a handful of notable exceptions). This is a plan that provides a rather large benefit for them.
Warren's defenders might respond that it's still a downward transfer, since the whole thing will be paid for by a new tax on the super wealthy. There are, however, a few problems with this as a financing mechanism.
The first is that the tax might not be constitutional. Even if it is, the second problem is that it's likely to raise far less money than projected, which is one of the reasons that most countries that have tried similar sorts of taxes over the last two decades have abandoned them .
The third, as the Washington Examiner 's Philip Klein points out , is that Warren has suggested that this same tax could be used to help pay for a whole slew of other progressive policy ideas, including Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and subsidized child care, which, all together, would cost so much it's barely even worth estimating. (Okay, fine: about $42 trillion , give or take the GDPs of a few mid-sized nations.)
This is a little like finding a $20 bill on the street and using it to run up five $20 bar tabs. On the campaign trail, where inspirational speeches are more important than math, you can spend your imaginary wealth tax revenue however many times you'd like. In reality, you can only spend the money once.
I am always hesitant to label policies as class warfare, but here, it's hard to avoid the description. Warren wants to impose an essentially punitive tax on the rich to fund a program for the merely well-off. And she wants to use the revenue it hypothetically generates not to pay for social programs targeting the poorest and neediest, but to fund debt forgiveness for the comfortable, college-educated upper middle class—which is to say, the sort of people who spend a lot of time reading New York magazine essays about Game of Thrones . This is a different, and more expensive, sort of pandering than an essay about why Warren loves Daenerys Targaryen, but it's pandering all the same.
I am not without sympathy for those who have racked up tens of thousands in burdensome college debt, and, in the process, helped fund the installation of those august tools of higher learning, campus water parks. The higher education system has become far too dependent on federally-backed loans that encourage colleges to raise tuition, while also encouraging prospective students to borrow ever larger amounts, often to their own long-term detriment. That system should be dismantled. National Review 's Kevin Williamson has some ideas as to how , which may include modest amounts of debt forgiveness.
But Warren is not looking to attack the systemic faults of higher education so much as to replace and expand them with an even more sweeping system of federal intrusion.
As a policy proposal, her plan will no doubt find supporters. But as a campaign gambit, I suspect it won't be enough. Despite her pedigree and preparedness, Warren is underperforming in this race. Once recent poll found her trailing behind Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden—who hasn't even officially announced yet—in the state of Massachusetts. Elizabeth Warren, you may recall, is a senator from Massachusetts.
Yes, the race is still early, and she still has time to release another $42 trillion or so worth of policy proposals. But somehow I doubt that her student loan plan will be the one that moves her to the front of the pack. Warren has a plan for everything, except how to turn around her campaign."
Terminal Patients Got Drugs Without FDA Approval. It Added Years to Their Lives.,reason.com,Zach Weissmueller,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/video/terminal-patients-got-drugs-without-fda-approval-it-added-years-to-their-lives/,"When Marc Hayutin was 69, he was diagnosed with squamous cell thymic carcinoma, a deadly cancer that affects the lymphatic and endocrine systems. His doctor told him he likely had months to live.
That was six years ago.
He survived thanks to an experimental drug that rapidly shrank his tumors and eased his pain. What's particularly noteworthy about Hayutin's recovery was that the drug that saved his life hadn't been approved for commercial use by the FDA. That would come six years later, at which point Hayutin probably would have been long dead.
He was able to take the medicine anyway thanks to Right to Try—a legal movement that has led to the passage of laws in 41 states allowing doctors to prescribe experimental drugs (ones that haven't been approved by regulators yet) to patients suffering from life-threatening illnesses. Right to Try was engineered by the Goldwater Institute, a free-market research and litigation organization in Arizona.
In May of 2018*, President Trump signed a Right to Try bill into federal law. It was championed by Vice President Mike Pence, who had signed a version of the legislation as governor of Indiana in 2015.
Right to Try is a shot across the bow at the FDA's core mission. But what does it mean for the future of medicine?

The 26 Words That ‘Created the Internet’—and Why They May Be on the Chopping Block,reason.com,Nick Gillespie,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/podcast/the-26-words-that-created-the-internet-and-why-they-may-be-on-the-chopping-block/,"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/media.blubrry.com/reason_podcast/p/reasontv-video.s3.amazonaws.com/reasontv_audio_8001934.mp3 Download The 26 Words That 'Created the Internet'—and Why They May Be on the Chopping Block Psst…do you want to know the 26 words that, in the opinion of today's guest on the Reason Podcast, ""created the internet?""
No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
That's part of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that was passed in 1996, as part of a larger piece of legislation updating telecommunications regulations. Section 230 grants broad immunity to websites and internet service providers from legal actions such as being sued for libel and defamation. It's the reason why Reason can't be sued for libelous or defamatory content posted in our comments section (though the authors of such comments can be).
Section 230 is the law that has enabled the internet to become driven by user-generated content, from YouTube videos to Yelp reviews to basically all of Twitter. You get rid of Section 230 and all that—and much more—is toast. In its first decade, Section 230 was mostly celebrated for allowing free expression and new economic models, but these days it is under attack from conservative Republicans such as Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and from liberal Democrats such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, all of whom have expressed interest in ripping up Section 230 and regulating social media.
Today's guest Jeff Kosseff is sweating bullets over all this. A former journalist who has been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, he t eaches law and cybersecurity at the United States Naval Academy and is the author of the urgent new book, The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet. In a wide-ranging conversation, Kosseff tells Nick Gillespie about the unlikely partnership between a conservative Republican (former Rep. Chris Cox of California) and a liberal Democrat (future Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon) in the mid-1990s that gave rise to Section 230; why today's internet is ""unimaginable"" without it; how the European Union's approach to online speech is incompatible with America's; and why we might be witnessing the death not just of Section 230 but of the free speech ethos of the internet and World Wide Web. Kosseff tells Gillespie that he started out writing ""a biography"" of Section 230 but is now worried that he in fact has written ""an obituary"" for it.

"Mueller Report Shows a Weak President, Not a Weakened Presidency",reason.com,Eric Boehm,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/23/mueller-report-shows-a-weak-president-not-a-weakened-presidency/,"Despite what the MAGA memes and lefty conspiracy theories might suggest, President Donald Trump is not a particularly muscular chief executive. He's not an omnipotent, swaggering presence bending the country to his will—no matter how many times he points out that, yes, he won the election.
There are many things to be gleaned from the 448-page report released last week by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller (my colleagues have noted many of the most important details already ), but one of the most under-appreciated might be just how weak Trump appears to be, even within his own administration. In incident after incident in the Mueller report, Trump's underlings and subordinates ignore or contradict his direct orders—and may have saved the president from committing serious crimes in the process.
""The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests,"" the report states.
Consider two telling examples from the Mueller report. When Trump was trying to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation, Trump called Cory Lewandowski—a private citizen, not a member of the administration—into the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Sessions. Lewandowski, apparently unwilling to deliver the message directly to Sessions, set up a meeting with another White House official, Rick Dearborn, and asked him to pass the message along to Sessions instead.
""The message 'definitely raised an eyebrow' for Dearborn, and he recalled not wanting to ask where it came from or think further about doing anything with it,"" according to the Mueller report. ""Dearborn also said that being asked to serve as a messenger to Sessions made him uncomfortable. He recalled later telling Lewandowski that he had handled the situation, but he did not actually follow through with delivering the message to Sessions.""
Or consider what happened in June 2017, when Trump reportedly sought to fire Mueller. Rather than calling Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein with the order to terminate the investigation, Trump called then-White House Counsel Don McGahn at his home and insisted that McGahn tell Rosenstein to fire Mueller.
""McGahn was perturbed by the call and did not intend to act on the request,"" the Mueller report states. ""To end the conversation with the President, McGahn left the President with the impression that McGahn would call Rosenstein. McGahn recalled that he had already said no to the President's request and he was worn down, so he just wanted to get off the phone.""
Instead of following the order, McGahn drafted a letter of resignation.
There are other incidents in the Mueller report that follow the same basic outline. They give the impression of a president who is weak both personally and professionally—unable to summon the testicular fortitude to directly confront his own attorney general, for example, while also being routinely ignored by those lower down on the chain of command. That conclusion can be drawn not only from the Mueller report but from other accounts of the inner workings of the administration—including an incident documented in Bob Woodward's book, Fear, in which Gary Cohn, economic adviser to the White House, literally stole a letter off of Trump's desk to prevent the president from signing it and thereby terminating a U.S.-South Korea trade deal.
This is not a new observation. Conservative New York Times columnist Ross Douthat has called Trump "" extraordinarily weak "" and has authored multiple columns detailing the president's inability to assert himself ""against restraints imposed by his allies or advisers."" Reason 's Jesse Walker has highlighted how federal institutions have constrained Trump in some ways even as they have been empowered by him in others. ""Power isn't flowing to the executive so much as it's flowing to whole swaths of the executive branch,"" Walker wrote in the Los Angeles Times last year.
But the release of the Mueller report freshly underlines the extent to which the Trump administration functions despite the president, not because of him.
Libertarians and others who are concerned about the power of the executive branch might consider all of this a point in Trump's favor. After all, wouldn't we prefer a president who is little more than a leader in name only?
But it's important not to conflate a weak president, like Trump, with a weakened presidency. Indeed, it's quite clear that the presidency has lost none of its robust, liberty-threatening powers under Trump. On trade, immigration, the ongoing wars in Syria and Yemen, and plenty of other policy areas, the Trump administration has been as powerful as any other in recent history.
""When we consider how many of this president's abuses, attempted or accomplished, were based on powers his predecessors had already seized, we should consider ourselves lucky things haven't gone worse,"" writes Gene Healy in the May issue of Reason .
The sunny view is that Trump's aides have somehow discerned the best outcome for the country and are selectively obeying or disobeying the president as a means of steering executive power towards that result.
The most realistic take is that the executive branch of the United States government—the mightiest branch of the most awesomely powerful state in world history—is increasingly run by unelected, unaccountable individuals. Even without considering the implications of what that would mean in the event of a major international crisis, this is a potentially problematic arrangement. It also raises worrying questions in the long run. After Trump is gone, will the executive branch continue to operate in this way? Could a stronger leader with fewer subordinates willing to openly defy his commands do more damage?
Preventing that requires weakening not the president but the presidency. That, in turn, would mean returning to Congress the power to make war and set trade policy. It would mean shutting down swaths of executive branch agencies and returning their regulatory functions to the states.
Getting there would require a determined effort by a committed executive with an electoral mandate and a clear-eyed vision about the appropriate role for his or her office. It would require a president whose strength rested on personal humility and an understanding of the principles that underpin the American government. Trump is not that person, as he demonstrates on an almost daily basis.
And, indeed, one of the primary benefits of a weaker presidency would be that the personal character and political strength of the president would not matter as much.
That the institutions and individuals within the executive branch have corralled some of Trump's worst impulses is, for now, a small comfort. His personal and professional weaknesses may eventually render Trump little more than a figurehead within his own administration—but the office of the president will survive Trump's tenure and will remain as potent as ever."
"Federal Court: Chalking Tires Is Trespassing, Not Police Work",reason.com,Zuri Davis,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/23/federal-court-chalking-tires-is-trespassing-not-police-work/,"When an overzealous parking enforcer chalks the tires of a car, a federal court ruled this week, that action counts as trespassing, not as law enforcement.
The ruling came in the case of Taylor v. Saginaw . In 2017, Alison Patricia Taylor sued the city of Saginaw, Michigan, and a parking enforcer named Tabitha Hoskins. Hoskins chalked the tires of Taylor's car 15 times between 2014 and 2017. This was done to determine if Taylor had driven her vehicle away from the parking spot and later returned to it, or stayed parked for longer than the permitted time. The multiple markings resulted in numerous citations. Taylor's suit argued that the chalking of her tires was an unreasonable search that violated the Fourth Amendment. Hoskins maintained that she had qualified immunity.
On Monday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled in favor of Taylor. According to the court's decision , the city failed to prove how Taylor's car being parked in a certain spot for a certain amount of time threatened an orderly parking system. Because of this, the chalking of Taylor's car did not qualify for an exemption from the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.
As for the trespassing aspect, the court maintained that the act of chalking the car fit the definition of ""common-law trespass upon a constitutionally protected area."" A common-law trespass is defined here as physical contact with property that belongs to someone else.
As The Volokh Conspiracy 's Orin Kerr has observed , the allegations in this case are pretty uncommon. But it's likely that the court's decision here applies broadly to all car owners, not just Taylor.
Could this ruling set a new legal precedent for otherwise run-of-the-mill city operations? Only time, and more lawsuits, will tell."
Nabbing Robert Kraft Helped Florida Prosecutors Get Headlines. Now Kraft and Other Orchids of Asia Customers Are Fighting Back – Reason.com,reason.com,Elizabeth Nolan Brown,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/23/nabbing-robert-kraft-helped-florida-prosecutors-get-headlines-now-kraft-and-other-orchids-of-asia-customers-are-fighting-back/,"On Tuesday morning, Florida Judge Leonard Hanser agreed to temporarily seal the footage of New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft visiting Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter, Florida.
More than two months have now passed since the headline-grabbing busts there and at several Southeast Florida massage parlors, places police insisted on national TV were dens of sexual slavery. Since then, authorities have been forced to admit that their claims were unfounded and have had their use of hidden cameras challenged by both men charged with soliciting prostitution and massage customers not accused of illegal activity.
That Kraft was one of the men charged by Florida prosecutors helped propel this story across national news and give it sticking power. But it's also assured that there's a defendant with resources and a reason to fight back—and in turn, that the press has remained interested in the case. (It's a beautiful bit of irony, all told.) Kraft rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors and has pleaded not guilty.
He's also fighting the disclosure of footage from secret video cameras police installed for days at Orchids of Asia. And there seems to have been a ripple effect, with lawyers for other solicitation defendants fighting back, too.
Last month, 15 of the men charged with solicitation in Jupiter filed a joint motion seeking to prevent the public release of imagery from the hidden cameras. Although defendants ""dispute the position of the prosecutors that there may be a 'victim' of any offense at issue in these cases, that mere possibility provides an additional basis for maintaining the confidentiality of the materials,"" states their motion.
A court hearing on the video issue was last held April 12. At that hearing, Assistant State Attorney Greg Kridos said neither state prosecutors nor Jupiter Police opposed release of the video and in fact were planning to release pixelated versions.
Kridos also defended the use of cameras in the first place, saying that they had initially suspected human trafficking may have been at play. He admitted, however, that no such trafficking horrors had actually been found.
""There was nothing approaching the showing of necessity that the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires,"" argued Kraft's lawyers in a March 28 motion. Police ""did not seek (or receive) a probable cause finding regarding any human trafficking crimes under Florida law,"" and ""any suggestion of human trafficking being suspected was unfounded and irresponsible. Indeed, law enforcement peddled these falsehoods to try and manufacture a patina of necessity here, where none exists."" What's more, information told to a judge to get the warrant for video surveillance relied on ""descriptions of statements made by a health inspector, Ms. Herzog"" that were in direct contradiction with what Herzog herself said in a signed report, they say.
Kraft's lawyers call the video evidence ""the fruits of an unlawful sneak-and-peek search warrant"" and condemn authorities for resorting ""to the most drastic, invasive, indiscriminate spying conceivable by law enforcement—taking continuous video recordings of private massages in which customers would be stripping naked as a matter of course—in order to prosecute what are at most (according to Florida's own allegations) misdemeanor offenses.""
Opposing Kraft and the other defendants on this issue are the Associated Press, ESPN, Gannett Co. , GateHouse Media, ABC, the McClatchy Company, The New York Times Company, Orlando Sentinel Communications Company, Sun-Sentinel Company, and TEGNA (owner of local TV stations WTSp-TV and WTLV/WJXX).
""Defendants have made no valid justification for preventing access to records made public by [Florida's constitution and law],"" states a March 26 motion from the media companies. ""The surveillance videos are no different than other records and become public once turned over in discovery. Any purported privacy concerns do not, and cannot, prevent disclosure.""
During the April 12 hearing, Kraft attorney William Burck pointed out that they have not sought to review the video evidence themselves as part of the discovery process, since that would make the videos public record.
A lawyer for the media companies fired back that that doesn't matter, since the state did not exempt the video from public disclosure. ""It's a public record right now unless and until this court finds another reason that it should be held back,"" Dana J. McElroy said.
That court did just that, at least temporarily. In his ruling today , Judge Hanser wrote that Kraft's ""right to a fair trial requires the disputed videotape be withheld…for a limited duration""—until a jury is sworn in, a pleas deal is accepted, or prosecutors drop the case.
""Law enforcement and the state have receded from [the] position"" that human trafficking was involved, noted the judge. And everyone acknowledges that the events in question are described fully in police reports. ""Clearly, these videotapes are not being sought for the purpose of assistance to identify and apprehend a perpetrator,"" Hanser continued, finding ""that preventing access at this time to the videotapes sought by the [media groups] is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to justice.""
Meanwhile, men and women who visited Orchids of Asia and were not charged with any crimes have brought their own federal class-action lawsuit against Florida law enforcement. The 31 Jane and John Does are seeking unspecified damages, saying their privacy rights were violated by Jupiter Police Department's filming them stripping down and getting massages.
Hua Zhang and Lei Wang, a massage-business owner and manager arrested as part of the operation, have also been seeking to prevent widespread release of the surveillance video. Zhang and Wang's lawyers say some footage was already leaked and is being shopped around to media."
The Trial Court “Did Not Consider American Law and Fundamental Precepts of Due Process” – Reason.com,reason.com,Eugene Volokh,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/24/the-trial-court-did-not-consider-american-law-and-fundamental-precepts-of-due-process/,"Tanveer Basith and Abuzaffer Basith were married in India in 1979. In September 2017, Tanveer sought a divorce, in Illinois court; she says that the parties are Illinois residents. (All the facts and quotes here are drawn from In re Marriage of Basith , decided last week.)
Abuzaffer moved to dismiss the divorce petition, ""assert[ing] that the parties' marriage had already been dissolved in India on May 10, 2017, and that Tanveer had accepted a financial settlement of … about $447. Because she had accepted the financial settlement, Abuzaffer argued that Tanveer's action was barred by res judicata ."" Tanveer responded, ""assert[ing] that she was never properly served with notice of the petition for dissolution filed in India, nor did she consent to the entry of that judgment.""
… Abuzaffer filed a reply. He asserted that Tanveer had requested a divorce. Therefore, pursuant to their culture and religion, he went to India in order to grant her request and obtain a divorce.
Abuzaffer further stated that as he and Tanveer were pious Muslims, his actions complied with sharia law that governs aspects of Islamic life for pious Muslims. As the trial court had the right to consider sharia law, Abuzaffer requested that the Indian divorce decree be upheld and Tanveer's action be dismissed….
Abuzaffer's attorney acknowledged that Tanveer ""didn't have formal notice that we talk about in our country [ i.e. , the United States]"" regarding the dissolution proceedings in India. Nonetheless, Abuzaffer's attorney argued that Tanveer's petition should be dismissed anyway. The trial court [Lake County Judge Raymond D. Collins] agreed and dismissed Tanveer's petition. The trial court made the following comments that reflected its reasoning:
""Well, when they were married in India, are there certain restrictions and guidelines that they need to follow? That's what I don't know. If [and] when they get married there, the marriage is valid if they follow certain rules, and I'm assuming they're religious about getting divorced, then they would have jurisdiction, if she accepted the jurisdiction of the country when they got married there….
""But my question is, when they got married in India, there were certain things that they signed and agreed to when it comes to getting divorced. And, again, I'm assuming that's religious in nature that they have to agree to, then they would have jurisdiction. So because it's inequitable, that's not a reason to dismiss it….
""[T]hey were following strict Muslim religion when they got married and he was following it when they got divorced[.]
""Well, it may be egregious in that the disposition of property may not have been equitable, but I don't think I have any choice but to dismiss under 2-619 [presumably the part providing that a case should be dismissed if ""the cause of action is barred by a prior judgment""-EV].""
The Appellate Court reversed:
Comity has been defined as the ""recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to the international duty and convenience and to the rights of its own citizens who are under the protection of its laws."" Under the doctrine of comity, Illinois courts may choose to recognize orders issued by foreign courts, although recognition may be withheld where the foreign court lacked jurisdiction over the cause and the parties….
Here, the trial court abused its discretion in granting comity to the Indian divorce decree. This was because Tanveer was never afforded the opportunity to appear, present her case, and be heard before the Indian tribunal. Thus, that tribunal never obtained personal jurisdiction over her.
Moreover, the trial court's decision constituted an abuse of discretion because the Indian tribunal's decision violated the laws and public policy of this state. The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act provides that marital property must be divided in ""just proportions"" considering all relevant factors. The Act also provides that maintenance should be awarded if it is just and equitable. Here, the Indian tribunal awarded all of the marital assets to Abuzaffer except for approximately $447 that it awarded Tanveer. The Indian tribunal also did not award Tanveer any maintenance despite Tanveer earning substantially less than Abuzaffer during the parties' more than 37 years of marriage. As the Indian tribunal's decision was inconsistent with Illinois concepts of fairness and equity, the trial court should not have granted it comity….
Finally, we note that we find the trial court's ruling troubling. The trial court's comments reflect that, in dismissing Tanveer's petition, it did not consider American law and fundamental precepts of due process such as the right to notice and the right to defend one's interests. Rather, the trial court's reasoning indicates that its decision was based on what it assumed the law was in India for pious Muslims…. We therefore strongly encourage the trial court to be more cognizant of the parties' fundamental rights and controlling case law before dismissing an action….
Sounds right to me; for more on this general topic, see Religious Law (Especially Islamic Law) in American Courts and Foreign Law in American Courts .

The Jurisdictional Nexus Act,reason.com,Stephen Sachs,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/24/the-jurisdictional-nexus-act/,"The Department of Justice recently raised some eyebrows by announcing that it wouldn't appeal a ruling striking down 18 USC § 116, the federal ban on female genital mutilation (FGM). The Solicitor General's explanatory letter ""condemns this practice in the strongest possible terms."" But it also argues that the FGM ban lacks a sufficient connection to Congress's powers under the Constitution, and it suggests that Congress enact a new ban with a clear jurisdictional nexus—for example, forbidding conduct that takes place within D.C. or federal territories, or conduct using the channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce.
This is a perennial problem for Congress, which often writes broad legislation without too much attention to the limits on its powers. So maybe Congress should supply a nexus, not just for the FGM statute, but for every statute at once .
Imagine a Jurisdictional Nexus Act, added to Title 1, Chapter 2 of the U.S. Code, that says something like the following:
Sec. 115. Jurisdictional Nexus
A criminal offense established by act of Congress that would otherwise exceed the powers of Congress in at least one of its applications shall be construed, with respect to such applications, to extend only to offenses committed by means of at least one act or omission of any person—
(a) within the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, or the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;
(b) involving the use of a means, channel, facility, or instrumentality of, or occurring in or otherwise affecting, interstate or foreign commerce; or
(c) who is, or to the injury of a person who is, protected under Sections 351, 1114, or 1751 of Title 18 [ e.g., federal officers and employees, including the uniformed services—ed. ].
This is a back-of-the-napkin version, but a real statute like this would have several advantages:
1. As a background rule of construction, along with much of the rest of Title 1, the statute can do its job even when a future Congress forgets about it. Like other legal rules of interpretation —RFRA, the Dictionary Act, the general savings statute (1 U.S.C. § 109), and so on—it silently amends past statutes and changes the effect of future ones, until a future Congress indicates otherwise. So Congress can keep on passing bills in general terms, without putting quite so much pressure on the courts to uphold them (or else to let bad actors go free).
2. The statute would only matter for offenses that fail for lack of constitutional power, not offenses that directly abridge constitutional rights. The key language here is the word ""otherwise."" A law banning Methodism might exceed the powers of Congress (""Congress shall make no law…""), but limiting it to Methodists in D.C. and the territories wouldn't help. The offense wouldn't "" otherwise exceed"" those powers, as compared to a world with the Nexus Act in place. So the Nexus Act would leave the Methodism law to fail on its own.
3. The statute would leave constitutional applications of existing statutes alone. Suppose that a statute can be applied in fifty-three ways, fifty of which are constitutionally fine, but three of which would exceed the powers of Congress. Using the Nexus Act to limit the whole statute would be inappropriate, especially because some of those fifty ways might be justified by other powers not listed above (the patent power, the counterfeiting power, etc.). Instead, the Act deals specifically with a statute's otherwise-unconstitutional applications. It offers a rule of construction only "" with respect to such applications ,"" so we don't have to spend much time thinking about the constitutional ones.
4. Although the statute might have the effect of expanding the reach of the criminal law (preserving offenses that would otherwise be struck down), it doesn't actually criminalize more conduct than Congress intended to reach. The statute acts only by limiting the scope of a criminal law, providing that the government can secure certain convictions only if it goes on to prove various additional elements. So it helps achieve Congress's goals, while also fitting well with a preference for lenity.
5. When the constitutional issues are murky, a statute like this still offers an easy procedural means of satisfying its requirements. Suppose we're not sure whether a given prosecution under a given statute is constitutional. If it is, everything proceeds as normal. If it isn't, the Nexus Act applies, and additional elements are needed. So whenever the government expects a constitutional challenge, it can simply draft the indictment to include one of the listed elements (which usually aren't very hard to prove).
This would have the effect of curing any error based on the absence of congressional power. When the court draws up the jury instructions, the defendant would have a choice: (1) to insist on the jury's finding that the nexus exists, or (2) to waive the issue by asking for the instructions to leave the nexus out. In the first case, if the jury convicts, we don't need to decide whether a nexus-less prosecution could have succeeded on its own; the government will already have proved any additional facts it might need. And in the latter case, the defendant would hardly be heard to complain of a constitutional violation, having just won a ruling that the charged conduct was constitutionally punishable as written and that no additional elements needed to be proved. Only if the government couldn't prove the additional nexus—or didn't want to try—would we have to consider the hard constitutional questions.
6. By setting out a list of individual jurisdictional hooks, instead of relying on all of Congress's powers all at once, the statute avoids a potential vagueness challenge. By contrast, imagine a ""Minimal Nexus Act"":
Any criminal statute that violates the Constitution shall be narrowly construed until it doesn't.
Defendants faced with a general statute like that would be entirely in the dark as to what portions of their conduct were actually criminal, or what power might some day be pulled out of a hat to justify their prosecution. (The Treaty Clause? The Twenty-Sixth Amendment enforcement power?) Instead, the grounds listed above cover a very large proportion of the categories the federal government would actually want to go after, without leaving us guessing about the scope of our criminal code.
7. For the same reasons, the statute avoids what might otherwise be a complex severability analysis. To use an example that Will Baude and I have batted around, suppose that Congress just chose to ban shoes, giving no jurisdictional nexus or even any explanation. (""It is hereby unlawful to possess shoes."") Assuming that the statute is severable, how exactly would you sever it? Does it apply to shoes moving in interstate commerce or through the U.S. mails, shoes worn on military bases or post offices or national parks, shoes possessed by federal officers or employees or contractors or by members of the unorganized militia or by 501(c)(3) nonprofits or by persons applying for Medicare reimbursements or federal research funds or federally guaranteed student loans…?
This might have been one reason why the Court in Lopez just struck down the relevant provision of the Gun-Free School Zones Act instead of searching, Salerno -like, for some grounds on which it might have been constitutionally applied. (For example, on the ""self-insurance"" argument well-beloved of the ACA's defenders, perhaps Lopez was engaged in the self-provision of security services , for which he might alternatively have contracted on the interstate market.) As Scott Keller and Misha Tseytlin have discussed , the Court hasn't always been clear about when it will allow a facial challenge—or when it thinks an as-applied challenge is required, with other applications of the statute to be preserved. The Nexus Act does some of this work for us, providing a safe harbor for certain applications even after a successful constitutional challenge to others.
8. Finally, a Nexus Act would allow for focused debate on the scope of Congress's powers and the appropriate range of federal criminal law. For those who take, say, a somewhat narrower view of the Commerce Power , one problem in implementing this view is the sheer number of statutes that might need to be revised if it were correct. Having a Nexus Act in place would allow those statutes to ""fail gracefully,"" diminishing the legal turmoil from the courts' adopting a different view.
A Nexus Act would also help members of Congress to act without waiting for the courts to go first. If Congress thinks that a criminal offense exceeds its lawful powers, it can always repeal or amend it. But instead of having to dig through the code and amend thousands of statutes piecemeal, members of Congress could simply amend the Nexus Act, which would automatically narrow the scope of a variety of statutes. And in debating over the Nexus Act, they might have to articulate their views of the Constitution—which, one might think, is already part of their job.
UPDATE 4/25: One more advantage! A statute like this, if passed, might eventually be used as a standard off-the-shelf cross-reference in other statutes. Right now, criminal laws often make reference to the ""special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States,"" a term defined in 18 U.S.C. § 7 to include a variety of strange places: forts and arsenals, U.S.-flagged vessels on the Great Lakes, guano islands, American spacecraft (but only while in flight), etc.
Once passed, the Nexus Act might serve a similar purpose. Statutes might be written to punish various types of conduct ""in the circumstances described in section 115 of Title 1, U.S. Code."" That'd make it yet easier for Congress to fine-tune its approach to constitutional power, automatically propagating any changes to the Nexus Act to a variety of substantive statutes."

In her previous book, Expecting Better , Oster blew up the conventional wisdom around pregnancy using her training as an economist to dig into the academic literature on questions about what pregnant women can safely eat and drink, along with a variety of other hot-button topics. She was hailed (and occasionally vilified) for her finding that the occasional glass of wine or order of sushi did not pose a mortal danger to most uterus-dwellers.
In her new book, Cribsheet , the Brown University economist examines the evidence on best practices for babies and toddlers. Her advice for parents of the 0–3 crowd on breastfeeding, swaddling, toddler discipline, and more offers the same level of data-driven chill her fans have grown to expect.
In a wide-ranging podcast with Editor in Chief Katherine Mangu-Ward, Oster explains how to tell a good study from a bad one and why she thinks it's important to help people make the best decisions for their families rather than assume there's a single right answer.
As a bonus, she also breaks down that much-publicized study about eggs and offers some reassuring evidence that it's OK to keep having those omelets for breakfast, no matter what you might have heard.

Can the Roberts Court Save Donald Trump from an Impeachment?,reason.com,Keith Whittington,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/24/can-the-roberts-court-save-donald-trump-from-an-impeachment/,"President Donald Trump is a nearly inexhaustible source of constitutional puzzles. I've practically organized a class around it. One never knows what new gifts he is going to bestow on us. Today, in his morning tweetstorm , he offers us the thought that he could appeal an impeachment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Can he do that? One would think not, but I suppose hope springs eternal. There are both legal and political reasons for thinking the Court would stay out.
Legally, the text of the U.S. Constitution specifies that the House of Representatives possesses the ""sole"" power to impeach and the Senate possesses the ""sole power to try all impeachments."" When Judge Walter Nixon tried to appeal his impeachment and conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court on the grounds that the procedures that the Senate followed were defective, the Rehnquist Court unanimously rejected that effort.
The parties do not offer evidence of a single word in the history of the Constitutional Convention or in contemporary commentary that even alludes to the possibility of judicial review in the context of the impeachment powers.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist even speculated about the problem of judicial review of a presidential impeachment.
We agree with the Court of Appeals that opening the door of judicial review to the procedures used by the Senate in trying impeachments would ""expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of chaos."" . . . This lack of finality would manifest itself most dramatically if the President were impeached. The legitimacy of any successor, and hence his effectiveness, would be impaired severely, not merely while the judicial process was running its course, but during any retrial that a differently constituted Senate might conduct if its first judgment of conviction were invalidated.
The modern Court does not often seem inclined to invoke the political question doctrine, but here at least the justices were willing to admit that the Constitution had committed this question into the hands of the legislature, not the judiciary.
Perhaps there are circumstances that might tempt the justices to assert judicial supremacy over impeachments as well. After all, the Court is fond of reminding us that it is emphatically a judicial task to say what the law is , and what if Congress seemed to be riding roughshod over the Constitution in how it used the impeachment power? Imagine a Congress willing to impeach a president on grounds that no reasonable person could think constitutes an impeachable offense. Donald Trump apparently prefers to eat his steaks well-done with ketchup . To be sure, this is a grievous offense, but presumably no one thinks it is a high crime or misdemeanor. Imagine further that two-thirds of the Senate is willing convict such a president with no semblance of a trial. ""Convict first, go through due process second,"" declares the Senate majority leader. The Court might well think that such a Congress has badly abused its constitutional powers and is not even making a pretense of adhering to a good-faith interpretation of the Constitution. Maybe a Court confronted with such a runaway Congress would be tempted to ride to the president's rescue and discover the limits to the political question doctrine.
But that's when politics comes into play. A Congress willing to impeach and remove a sitting president on the pretext that he routinely dishonors his steaks could hardly be trusted to sit idly by while the justices attempted to reinstall that president in the White House. If a Court were to attempt to intervene in such a scenario, the justices might well find themselves next on the chopping block. The justices might at this point recall the words of Chief Justice Salmon Chase when the Court was asked to order the president not to enforce the Reconstruction Acts in Mississippi after the Civil War.
Suppose the bill filed and the injunction prayed for allowed. If the President refuse obedience, it is needless to observe that the court is without power to enforce its process. If, on the other hand, the President complies with the order of the court and refuses to execute the acts of Congress, is it not clear that a collision may occur between the executive and legislative departments of the government? May not the House of Representatives impeach the President for such refusal? And in that case could this court interfere, in behalf of the President, thus endangered by compliance with its mandate, and restrain by injunction the Senate of the United States from sitting as a court of impeachment? Would the strange spectacle be offered to the public world of an attempt by this court to arrest proceedings in that court?
""These questions answer themselves,"" Chase observed. Indeed. Sorry, Mr. President, you are on your own on this one."
"California Politicians Hiked Gas Tax, Now Demand Investigation Into State’s $4 Per Gallon Gas Prices – Reason.com",reason.com,Christian Britschgi,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/24/california-politicians-hiked-gas-tax-now-demand-investigation-into-states-4-per-gallon-gas-prices/?utm_medium=email,"As lieutenant governor, Gavin Newsom supported a 2017 bill increasing the state's gas taxes. When running for governor in 2018, he opposed a ballot initiative that would have repealed that same increase. It's 2019, and Newson, now the state's governor, is demanding an investigation into why the state's gas prices are so high.
On Tuesday, the governor sent a letter to the California Energy Commission (CEC) asking that the state agency investigate the Golden State's roughly $4.03 per gallon gas prices, currently the highest in the country (and well above the national average of $2.86 per gallon).
""Independent analysis suggests that an unaccounted-for price differential exists in California's gas prices and that this price differential may stem in part from inappropriate industry practices,"" wrote Newsom in his letter to the CEC. ""These are all important reasons for the Commission to help shed light on what's going on in our gasoline market.""
Newsom is not alone in wanting answers to this difficult head-scratcher.
In January, 19 state legislators— 17 of whom had voted in favor of that 2017 gas tax increase, while the other two had only entered office in 2018— sent a letter to State Attorney General Xavier Becerra demanding that the state's Department of Justice (DOJ) investigate the ""unexplained gasoline surcharge"" that was estimated to cost Californian families $1,700 a year.
California currently imposes the second-highest gas taxes in the country. A state excise tax currently adds $.417 per gallon, a rate that will increase to $.473 come July. On top of that, the state imposes a 2.25 percent gasoline sales tax.
In addition, California has adopted a low-carbon fuel standard and a cap-and-trade scheme for carbon emissions which together increase the state's gas prices by $.24 per gallon above the national average, according to a 2017 state government report .
That same report maintained that, even after all these state-imposed costs were tallied up, California's gas prices remained above the national average, a finding that both those 19 state legislators and Newsom are using to justify their demands for an investigation.
Newsom, as mentioned, alleged there may be ""inappropriate industry practices"" at play. State lawmakers, in their January letter, suggested the state's retail gasoline market might lack ""robust competition"" leading motorists to pay more at the pump.
However, a lot of the higher, non-government-imposed prices Californians are paying currently could plausibly be chalked up to normal supply and demand.
Local media reports point to the twin effects of increasing demand and springtime maintenance at the state's refineries as contributing to the price hikes.
The late March shutdown of a Valero refinery in the Bay Area added to the price hikes. Something similar happened in 2015, when an explosion at the Torrance refinery in Los Angeles County caused the facility, then responsible for refining 10 percent of the state's gas, to close for over a year.
Prior to that 2015 explosion, California's ""gasoline price premium tracked closely with our higher taxes and production costs,"" wrote Severin Borenstein, a professor at University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business in a blog post.
After the Torrance explosion, prices spiked, and then slowly began coming down over the next year, although they to this day remain higher than they were prior to that incident.
Industry representatives maintain that any difference in the state's gas prices can be explained by normal market forces, and of course all those taxes and regulations.
""The petroleum industry on the West Coast has been subject to dozens of independent investigations by government agencies, all of which concluded the dynamics of supply and demand are responsible for movements in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel,"" said Kevin Slagle, a spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), in a statement, adding that ""state programs, such as cap-and-trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, impact fluctuations in energy markets.""
It should be pointed out too that high levels of taxation and regulation and a lack of competition in the state's fuel sector are not mutually exclusive explanations. Government fees and red tape often have the effect of squeezing out marginal producers and retailers, giving remaining firms greater ability to raise prices.
And regardless of any ""mystery surcharge"" on California gas, the fact remains that state government polices are a huge component of the final price everyone is paying at the pump.
Indeed, in the case of the state's cap-and-trade scheme—where the state caps the amount of allowable carbon emissions, and then auctions off emission credits—the explicit purpose is to raise the cost of emitting carbon, and thus burning gasoline.
Absent these policies, the state's gas prices would be lower.
Clearly, for many of California's politicians, the benefits of state policies aimed at producing cleaner air quality, mitigating climate change, and generating more revenue for road maintenance and light rail expansions surpass the costs of higher gas prices.
If that's the case, however, Newsom and others should make that case to voters directly and explicitly instead of trying to appease motorists' anger by pointing their fingers at industry.

Jose Biden Officially Enters the Presidential Race,reason.com,Christian Britschgi,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/jose-biden-officially-enters-the-presidential-race/,"Joe Biden officially announced his presidential bid this morning, promising that he could save the country from Donald Trump and the forces of white supremacy.
""We are in a battle for the soul of this nation,"" the former vice president says in a video released today, which focuses heavily on 2017's deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Who we are. I cannot stand by and watch that happen,"" says Biden.
Biden's entry into the already crowded Democratic primary field is hardly a surprise. Now that he's in, the former vice president has a lot of things going for him. First and foremost are his poll numbers. Biden consistently leads the pack nationally, and he's doing very well in the early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
The latest University of New Hampshire poll has Biden as the second most preferred Democratic candidate in that state, garnering support from 18 percent of likely Democratic primary voters. That places him second only to progressive darling Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont (who sits at 30 percent). And Biden is cleaning up in Iowa, where the latest Monmouth University poll shows him winning support of 27 percent of likely caucusgoers. Sanders is pulling 16 percent in Iowa, while South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg is trailing in third place, with 9 percent.
That said, we're a long way off from any actual voting. As Reason 's resident poll expert, Stephanie Slade, likes to remind people , polls at this stage are hardly predictive.
Indeed, that aforementioned University of New Hampshire poll found that only 9 percent of respondents had ""definitely decided"" on a candidate, while another 14 percent were only ""leaning toward someone."" A full 77 percent were ""still trying to decide.""
In short, a lot can happen between now and the Democratic National Convention in July 2020.
The New York Times notes that Biden is entering the race with little money and no ready base of small dollar donors.
Then there's his record. Biden has taken any number of stances that are anathema to today's more progressive Democratic Party.
The former vice president is the only candidate in the race to have voted in favor of the Iraq war. When he was a senator from Delaware, Biden supported most every tough-on-crime policy you can imagine, from mandatory minimums to civil asset forfeiture to an expanded death penalty. He was one of the chief architects of the 1994 crime bill that helped usher in an era of mass incarceration.
More recently, Biden has raised progressive eyebrows for praising the wealthy ("" just as patriotic as poor folks "") and current Vice President Mike Pence("" a decent guy ""). He's also been known to invade the personal space of women at public events.
He has so far declined to endorse several policies beloved by progressives, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Such positions make Biden vulnerable to attack from other primary candidates running to his left.
That said, it's fair to ask how much his less-than-progressive record will matter to most primary voters. Another Times article from early April found a wide gulf between the majority of Democratic voters and the party's smaller progressive base. The former was much less active online—and much less concerned about the kind of social-justice issues that get a lot of attention on Twitter.
Biden's announcement video from earlier today shows one way he might try to split the difference between these two camps, focusing like a laser on Trump and white supremacists while declining to mention many policy specifics.
Should he win the nomination, Biden would pull his party back from the left, but not necessarily bring it much closer to supporting individual liberty. He has little interest in running on a platform of expanded, budget-busting entitlements, but—his recent criticism of occupational licensing notwithstanding—he is in no way a small-government guy. His legacy is almost uniformly one of expanding the power of the federal government, whether to prosecute the drug war or go after sexual assault on campus.

‘Some People Might Say That Ricky Fell Through a Crack in the System. This Is Not a Crack. This Is the System.’,reason.com,Joe Setyon,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/some-people-might-say-that-ricky-fell-through-a-crack-in-the-system-this-is-not-a-crack-this-is-the-system/,"Before being locked up on murder charges 23 years ago, Ricky Kidd says he was ""naive"" about how the criminal justice system worked.
""I didn't know that innocent people go to prison,"" Kidd, now 44, says by phone from the Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri. He told anyone who would listen, starting with the detectives who first took him into custody, that he didn't do it. ""I needed,"" he says ""to be believed.""
In May 1996, Kidd was charged in the double murder of George Bryant and Oscar Bridges in Kansas City, Missouri. The evidence against him was weak, his alibi was solid, and the case in his favor has only grown stronger since Kidd and his co-defendant, Marcus Merrill, were convicted of the murders in March 1997 and sentenced to life without parole. Kidd nevertheless remains locked up.
There's no simple explanation for why he's still in prison. A combination of factors, including an inadequate public defense system, alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and a court system where innocence isn't always enough, has contributed to what Kidd describes as a ""horrible nightmare.""
This week, Kidd has a hearing for habeas corpus relief under Rule 91, a state law that allows convicted inmates to allege unlawful imprisonment even if their prior appeals have been unsuccessful.
After more than two decades of legal battles, this is Kidd's ""best last bite at the apple,"" says Sean O'Brien, a law professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City. He has represented Kidd since 2006. Today he is co-counsel along with the Midwest Innocence Project (MIP), a nonprofit that works to exonerate wrongfully convicted inmates.
""While I may fall in the cracks of legal terms or certain legal impediments, my facts will hold up,"" Kidd says. ""I'm certain of that.""
***
On February 6, 1996, Alvin Brooks, a former Kansas City cop who was then running a nonprofit called AdHoc Group Against Crime, got a call from a man who said he'd witnessed a shooting. The caller claimed he'd seen three men drive off afterward, Brooks recalls. He told the man to send in a tip to police.
At 11:50 a.m., police were dispatched to the scene. They found Bryant, who was known around the neighborhood as a drug dealer, lying outside his home in a pool of blood. Bridges' body was discovered in the basement.
Kidd, who was 21 at the time of the murders, had a pretty good alibi . He said he was awakened early that morning by his sister, Nikki, who had stayed with him the previous night and wanted to drive his 1993 Toyota Corolla to work.
By mid-morning, Kidd said he and his stepfather had successfully started his other car, an unreliable white 1981 Oldsmobile Delta 88. Taking Nikki's young son D.J. with them, Kidd and then-girlfriend Monica Gray drove the Delta to Nikki's work, where Kidd said he retrieved his Corolla keys.
After picking up the keys at around 11:30 a.m. or noon, Kidd said they took the Delta home. Then Kidd, his girlfriend, and his nephew drove together in the Corolla to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office at Lake Jacomo so Kidd could get a gun permit for a .357 revolver he had his eye on. The sheriff's office was a roughly 30-minute drive from Kidd's residence, says Gray.
Kidd said he filled out an application but was told he'd have to wait a few days for a background check. After stopping to see his ex-girlfriend Kelley Magill and daughter Jasmine, Kidd said he took Gray to her aunt's home, picked his sister Nikki up from work, and drove to his grandmother's house. That's where he learned that Bryant had been killed.
That's quite a few witnesses. But the prosecution argued that sequence of events occurred on a different day than the murders. At trial, Jackson County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Michael Buffalow said the form Kidd filled out, which is dated February 6 and was processed that day and the next, could have been mailed in or turned in by hand prior to that date.
But a 2007 deposition from Susan Jordan, the Jackson County Sheriff's deputy who processed the form, revealed that mail-in applications were exceedingly rare, and that applications were nearly always completely processed either the day they were received or the day after.
Kidd's defense team has taken the straightforward position that since his application was dated February 6 and processed on February 6 and 7, it's unlikely he turned it in on another date.
The dated application serves as a crucial part of Kidd's alibi, but it also suggests a more basic, common-sense defense of his innocence. Why would a killer try to legally obtain a firearm within 24 hours of committing murder? As Brooks, the former cop who got that eyewitness call about the shooting points out: ""Even the dumbest of criminals probably wouldn't have done something like that.""
***
So why was Kidd charged with the murder in the first place?
A drug dealer before going to prison, Kidd acknowledges he hasn't always been entirely truthful. He lied to police about owing Bryant $500 at the time of his death. More important, though, he failed to reveal a crucial conversation with one of the other men implicated in the killing.
While considerable evidence connects Kidd's co-defendant Merrill to two of his cousins—Gary Goodspeed Sr. (a.k.a. Abu-Rahman Saad Muwwakkil) and his son Gary Goodspeed Jr. (a.k.a. Rahib Muwwakkil)—neither was charged.
Merrill and his cousins resided in Georgia, but all three were in Kansas City at the time of the murders. While he was in town, Goodspeed Sr. rented a white Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera that matched witnesses' descriptions of the three suspects' car.
The three men had similar alibis for February 6. After spending time together at the Adam's Mark Hotel, they said they went to see Henrietta Bynum, Goodspeed Sr.'s ex-wife and Goodspeed Jr.'s mother, with whom the victim, Bryant, was rumored to have had a romantic relationship.
""They had more of a motive at that moment in their life than Ricky did,"" Teresa Anderson, Kidd's former public defender, says of the Goodspeeds. ""Independently of them, I don't think he had any grudge with anybody.""
Kidd, who was first named in connection to the crime by anonymous tips, is the ""odd man out,"" his current attorneys claimed in a 2015 petition for writ of habeas corpus.
And at a 2009 federal hearing, Merrill confessed to the murders and furnished crucial additional information to the courts. In his confession, Merrill described how the Goodspeeds met him at a friend's house the morning of February 6 and drove him to Bryant's home. Goodspeed Sr. and Merrill were both armed with handguns, the friend, Eugene Williams, testified—Goodspeed Sr. with a .45-caliber and Merrill with a Glock .9 millimeter. Both kinds of shell casings were later found at the crime scene.
Bryant's 4-year-old daughter Kayla, who was home when her father was killed, told investigators she had seen the perpetrators at the house before. Goodspeed Jr. told police he and Merrill had visited Bryant a few days prior.
""Daddy's brother shot Daddy,"" Kayla told police. She also reported that one of the men tried to comfort her.
Her account makes more sense in context. Goodspeed Jr. was friends with Bryant and shared a physical resemblance to him. Bryant would sometimes refer to Goodspeed Jr. as ""little brother,"" Merrill testified. He also said he ignored Goodspeed Sr.'s directive to kill Kayla, instead telling her everything would be OK and firing a bullet through the wall.
Goodspeed Sr. shot Bryant and took Bridges, who was remodeling the house, down to the basement, said Merrill. Bryant later got up and ran into Merrill, who shot him again.
Why did Merrill confess so long after the fact? Kidd and Merrill exchanged a series of letters while both were incarcerated, with Kidd trying to convince Merrill to admit his guilt and exonerate Kidd. His efforts were largely unsuccessful until Kidd asked Merrill if the Goodspeeds were doing anything to take care of Merrill's daughter, perhaps implying that Merrill was protecting them in exchange for nothing.
""You could look at it as a crisis of conscience,"" says O'Brien. ""Gary Sr. was the one who killed both of these guys, and Marcus is effectively doing Sr.'s time."" Having unsuccessfully appealed his own conviction, Merrill also hopes for a shot at parole if the case is reopened and he testifies against Goodspeed Jr.
Kidd was a one-time roommate and former close friend of Goodspeed Jr. And this was the other key information he initially withheld from police: On February 5, Goodspeed Sr. asked if he wanted to help rob Bryant, Kidd testified in 2009. During their February 7 meeting, Goodspeed Sr. confessed to killing Bryant, Kidd said. He was afraid to volunteer this information, ironically, because he didn't want to be connected to the crime.
***
The witness who placed Kidd at the crime scene was the person who telephoned Brooks, a man by the name of Richard Harris. Harris told police he was walking home after visiting his neighbor when he saw Bryant run out of the garage, yelling for help.
One of the suspects, who Harris identified as Goodspeed Jr., dropped a garbage bag containing what he assumed was cash and drugs, pursued Bryant, and tackled him. Then another man came out of the garage and shot Bryant with a .45, Harris claimed. While Harris identified the killer as Kidd, in his 2009 confession Merrill said it was actually Goodspeed Sr.
While Harris was the prosecution's key witness in its case against Kidd, he's never been able to get his story straight. ""He has said virtually everything about everything,"" Kidd's lawyer O'Brien says, wryly.
Harris told police he had started running away by the time Bryant was shot. But at trial, he said he saw the killer ""stand over"" Bryant and shoot him.
Harris claimed to have been standing in front of Bryant's house at the time. His now ex-wife, Letha Jones, testified in 2009 that Harris told her he was at his mother's house, about 100 feet or more away from Bryant's home. Another neighbor who witnessed the shooting, Phyllis Davis, testified that she could not recall seeing Harris.
In a 2007 deposition and again at the 2009 hearing, Harris said Bryant's killer had long hair and was wearing a red do-rag. But Kidd was bald around that time.
Harris was also not the casual bystander he initially made himself out as. He later admitted to buying drugs from Bryant on multiple occasions, even though he initially told police they were just neighbors.
Harris may have testified against Kidd because he was scared the Goodspeeds would kill him, according to Brooks. ""Since then, he called me,"" says Brooks of Harris, and ""he said why he did what he did.""
Little else should have implicated Kidd. ""There is no physical evidence tying him to the crime scene that I recall,"" said Amy McGowan, Jackson County's lead prosecutor on the case, in a 2017 deposition . McGowan, who declined to be interviewed for this story, said her ""personal belief"" is that Goodspeed Jr. was one of the men responsible. She suspected Goodspeed Sr. was involved as well, but claimed she didn't have enough evidence to go after either man.
Brooks thinks the police deserve blame. ""They really did a poor job of that case,"" he says, pointing to investigators' failure to build a strong case against the Goodspeeds based on the similarities between their rental and the getaway car. ""They didn't follow up,"" he adds.
All of which means the prosecution had just two people who implicated Kidd: the unreliable witness Harris and the contradictory testimony of 4-year-old Kayla Bryant.*

Lacking the resources for private representation, Kidd's case was handled by a public defender at a time when Missouri's public defenders were utterly unable to devote the resources to Kidd's case that might have led to his exoneration.
A 2012 audit found that Missouri's public defense caseload grew 70 percent since 1990. The office, however, has only expanded by 58 percent. After the findings were released, auditor Tom Schweich said that public defenders have relied for decades on outdated 1970s standards for appropriate caseloads. This has gradually led to more overworked lawyers with less time to spend on each case.
""Everybody deserves to have the best defense that they can have,"" says Anderson, Kidd's old public defender, who understands this better than anyone.
That right was clearly established for the first time by Clarence Earl Gideon who radically changed the face of the American judicial system with nothing but a pen and prison paper. Gideon was accused of felony breaking and entering, but since he was poor, he was left to defend himself in court. After being convicted, Gideon took his case all the way to the Supreme Court and won. In 1963, the Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the Sixth Amendment guarantees every citizen the right to counsel.
While the case expanded civil liberties, the divide between rich defendants and poor defendants remained. While those lacking funds now have access to counsel, many judicial systems, including Missouri's, struggle to ensure access to adequate counsel.
A serious lack of resources cheats Missouri public defenders out of the chance to provide the best defense. Lawyers in an office on a shoestring budget are expected to go up against well-funded prosecutors, despite dealing with heavy caseloads and a lack of information.
One fed-up director of the public defender's office even assigned a case to then-Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon (D), who was attorney general at the time of Kidd's conviction, as an act of protest in 2016.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal class action lawsuit in 2017 claiming that Missouri's public defender system was a ""constitutional crisis."" It is not unheard of for poor defendants to spend months in jail waiting for a trial. Once they're finally able to see a public defender, their lawyer only has a short amount of time to review their case before entering the courtroom.
""Some people might say that Ricky fell through a crack in the system,"" O'Brien says. ""This is not a crack. This is the system.""
Anderson and O'Brien agree that a lack of resources in the public defender's office contributed to Kidd's problems. And at this stage in his appeals process, Kidd no longer even has the right to counsel. For inmates like him, access to adequate representation is largely determined by one's ability to pay for it.
While O'Brien doesn't keep time on Kidd's case, he estimates that exonerations normally cost between $500,000 and $1 million of a lawyer's time. Most attorneys can't devote that much time to a pro bono case. There have been about 2,400 exonerations in the United States since 1989, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. It's difficult to ascertain the exact nationwide wrongful conviction rate, though the MIP's website says it could be between 2 and 5 percent or as high as 7 percent.
***
As Gideon v. Wainwright changed the face of American defense, Brady v. Maryland changed the face of American prosecution.
John Brady had been charged with murder by the prosecution, even though his robbery partner, Charles Boblit, previously confessed to the actual killing. The Supreme Court ruled in 1963 that the prosecution's suppression of Boblit's confession during Brady's trial violated his right to due process.
Kidd experienced firsthand how the suppression of key information can seal a terrible fate. In the 2015 habeas petition, Kidd's attorneys identified some of the missteps taken in the trial, including the prosecution's failure to correct false evidence presented in court.
Kate Ladesh, the lawyer representing Marcus Merrill in the joint trial, attempted to divert the blame from her client to Kidd by saying Kidd's fingerprint was found in a vehicle. Kidd's fingerprint was indeed found in a vehicle: His own.
Ladesh never made an effort to clarify this fact, leaving the court to believe that Kidd's fingerprint was discovered in the getaway car. His lawyers think this key omission helped paint Kidd as the guilty party.
McGowan had a legal duty to correct Ladesh's fingerprint claim, according to Kidd's attorneys. They believe Supreme Court cases like Berger v. United States and Giglio v. United States set the legal precedent that McGowan should have done everything in her power to convict Kidd without the use of false evidence.
But rather than correct the record about Kidd's fingerprint, she allowed Ladesh to present her misguided argument without challenge, ultimately helping her own case against Kidd. Additionally, McGowan went so far as to bring up Kidd's fingerprint in her argument without accurate citation of context.
Kidd's attorneys have also claimed McGowan engaged in unfair tactics by pressuring young Kayla Bryant to identify Kidd as one of the suspects. The girl twice denied in court that one of the suspects was in the room, so the prosecution turned to an alleged out-of-court identification she made of Kidd.
Kayla Bryant had previously failed to identify Kidd several times in a photo array, which was captured on video. Police coaxed a flimsy positive identification from her after showing Kidd once again in a video lineup. Kidd's lawyers said that introducing Kidd's image multiple times was a form of suggestive procedure, which made the lineup more likely to end in a misidentification .
Kidd's defense team also argues the prosecution failed to disclose the Goodspeeds' depositions, which were not taken until the Friday before the trial. Anderson says she was not made aware of the depositions despite searching for the Goodspeeds before the trial.
Prosecutors are obliged to ""present all of the evidence per the rules of evidence in a fair manner,"" Anderson says. ""And if you have the evidence that someone's guilty, that's what the jury will determine. If you have to shade the evidence in a way to make your case better, you're not doing your job.""
McGowan would eventually become a prosecutor in Douglas County, Kansas. But in 2013 , the Kansas Supreme Court found her at fault for misconduct and trial errors due to improper comments made during a sentencing hearing. The sentence was vacated as a result. Four other cases were also appealed on similar grounds, and some of her other cases were redistributed among other prosecutors.
Kidd's claims of innocence have earned him the support of a different former Jackson County prosecutor, Cindy Dodge, who's now on his legal team. She told KSHB in 2016 that her own investigation into Kidd's case led her to believe he's innocent. ""I wouldn't be working on this and spending hundreds of hours of free time,"" she said at the time.
McGowan's actions, meanwhile, mean that a guilty man in Goodspeed Jr. is still walking the streets, Kidd's supporters say. And in cases of prosecutorial misconduct, there's often no accountability.
O'Brien says it's ""pretty rare"" for prosecutors to be disciplined by bar associations for sitting on evidence. After running through a handful of examples, O'Brien jokes that he may have named all of the cases where prosecutors have faced repercussions.
One of the most well-known disbarments in recent history occurred more than a decade ago. Durham County prosecutor Mike Nifong was disbarred after withholding exculpatory DNA evidence in the controversial 2006 Duke University lacrosse rape case. He was sentenced to one day in jail after lying about giving the DNA evidence to defense attorneys.
***
This week in Missouri's 43rd Judicial Circuit, Kidd's lawyers are invoking Rule 91 , a state law that gives inmates their last chance for habeas corpus relief in court. It's the latest in a decades-long series of legal fights.
""It's an uphill battle trying to prove your innocence,"" says Kidd. He believes he'll win, though his optimism arises partly out of necessity. ""Surrendering just isn't an option,"" he says.
O'Brien shares those sentiments. ""I should be really cynical after doing this shit for 30 years,"" he says. ""But I'm not, because if you give into it—if the lawyers think you're going to lose—you're going to lose.""
Kidd's current legal team argued for years that ineffective counsel, particularly during his trial, violated his Sixth Amendment rights. That claim has been procedurally barred because Kidd's public defenders failed to adequately pursue it during his prior appeals, O'Brien says.
Instead, Kidd's attorneys are now alleging prosecutorial misconduct on the part of McGowan, who they believe committed Brady violations, particularly by withholding the Goodspeeds' depositions. Kidd's lawyers must prove the transcripts of those depositions would have caused a jury to doubt his guilt.
They're also claiming actual innocence. But because Kidd is not on death row, that might not be enough. The Missouri Supreme Court granted habeas relief in 2003 to another wrongfully convicted O'Brien client, Joseph Amrine. But Amrine was a death row inmate and the rejection of a subsequent case suggested the court is inclined to limit this remedy only to those condemned to die.
If the circuit court rules against Kidd, he can appeal to the district court and even the Missouri Supreme Court. And then that's it—he will have exhausted his legal options, with the exception of executive clemency.
Kidd and his supporters believe a court system where asserting innocence on appeal is unduly difficult has contributed to his continued incarceration. The public defender on his direct appeal, for instance, didn't even try to argue his actual innocence. ""We have a system that values finality over fairness,"" says Tricia Bushnell, the MIP's executive director and one of Kidd's attorneys.
After O'Brien took the case, he unsuccessfully petitioned for federal habeas corpus relief. The since-deceased Judge Scott Wright of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, who denied the petition, nonetheless said at Kidd's 2009 hearing that ""for [Goodspeed Sr.] to get off free would just be awful."" Goodspeed Sr. has since died.
""On the federal level in the United States, it's an open question of whether or not being innocent entitles you to be released from prison,"" says Bushnell.
""We're here asserting his actual innocence, but we get stuck in these arguments of procedure,"" Bushnell says. ""What if we just agreed that the court should hear the evidence, and just decide it on the merits?""
""They don't engage the facts,"" Kidd says of the state's attorneys, ""so they nickel over the technicalities of the law.""
Kidd compares the experience of losing time and again in court to taking a gut blow during a boxing match. ""Suddenly, all the air has left your lungs,"" he says. ""While you're waiting for them to fill back up, you can imagine yourself gasping for air and enduring extreme pain all at the same time.""
***
""I'm going to walk a testimony of faith and transformation.""
Kidd wrote these words in ""I Wanna Be Like My Father,"" a play recently performed by his fellow inmates. Their performance was captured and shared on YouTube . The play focuses on a man trying to choose between a life of God and peer pressure.
Religious themes are often present in Kidd's plays, poetry, and books. So is the legal system. If exonerated, Kidd hopes to bring another play, ""Justice, Where Are You?"" to the stage.
His writing, he says, has helped him throughout the last 23 years.
""I use pen and paper to express myself,"" Kidd says. ""Writing has been instrumental as a coping tool or a coping mechanism for me. Bottled emotions and expressions not properly channeled, shaken up, can cause a mess.""
But like Clarence Earl Gideon , Kidd's writing has done more than offer personal solace. When he was first incarcerated, he wrote hundreds of letters proclaiming his innocence to people on the outside. While his fellow inmates laughed, Kidd kept going. For years following his conviction, his efforts were largely to no avail. But eventually, thanks to Kidd's unrelenting labor, the cavalry did come.
And this week, the court may join the growing number of people who have come to believe in Kidd's innocence. If that happens, it will be because Kidd didn't abandon his struggle. ""All I know to do is fight,"" he says. ""The opposite is not an option.""
*CORRECTION: This article originally stated that three people implicated Kidd: Richard Harris, Kayla Bryant, and Marcus Merrill. In fact, Merrill did not implicate Kidd and never accused him of the crime. We regret the error."
The Trump Administration Seals Escape Doors After Turning Yemen Into Hell,reason.com,David Bier,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/the-trump-administration-seals-the-escape-doors-after-turning-yemen-into-hell/,"The war in Yemen has taken a devastating toll. More than 85,000 babies and toddlers have starved to death, according to a 2018 Save the Children report . Another roughly 80,000 people—civilians and combatants—have died in the war. The United States is a party to this carnage, because it has aided Saudi Arabia's military strikes against this small Middle Eastern country. Yet last week President Donald Trump vetoed a congressional resolution to end U.S. involvement in the war.
What has the United States done to relieve the humanitarian catastrophe that it has had a hand in causing? It has blocked Yemenis trying to escape to America.
The Trump administration has yet to accept any Yemeni refugees this year. It has banned nearly all permanent immigration from the country, including for immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and it has stopped issuing most temporary visas. For good measure, last year it decided to make many Yemenis subject to deportation when their temporary visas expire by withholding Temporary Protected Status (TPS) from them.
The United Nations Group of Regional and International Eminent Experts on Yemen has concluded that the ""coalition air strikes have caused most direct civilian casualties"" in Yemen and ""hit residential areas, markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and even medical facilities."" A 2018 Human Rights Watch report warns U.S. officials that they could face ""legal liability for war crimes"" if they continue indiscriminate support for the Saudi campaign, through refueling jets, providing military supplies, and other means.
Even as the war crimes proceed, the United States has resettled no refugees since January 1, 2019. In 2018, the State Department resettled two Yemeni refugees. While we might expect this from the notoriously anti-immigrant Trump administration, President Barack Obama was hardly better, resettling just 42 Yemenis from 2015 to 2016.
Moreover, Trump's travel ban has indefinitely suspended almost all legal immigration from Yemen, except in very exceptional cases.
Because of America's family-focused immigration system, the ban disproportionately affects immediate Yemeni relatives of U.S. citizens. As of January 2019, the administration had already barred more than 1,700 American citizens— American citizens— from bringing over their Yemeni spouses and minor children. About 3,500 Yemeni kids are thus being separated from their American parents. (Apparently, the administration's family separation policy isn't limited to migrants at the Mexican border.) Thousands of parents of adult U.S. citizens are also being denied green cards that could save their lives.
In 2015, then-Rep. Steve Russell (R–Okla.) related the story about a Syrian interpreter who had served with him in Iraq and become a U.S. citizen. The interpreter's mother died in that country's civil war while awaiting a visa. There must be countless tragedies just like this one that we don't hear about; this one only received attention because it personally affected a congressman.
The travel ban also prevents Yemenis from receiving temporary visas for business or tourism purposes. They thus cannot request asylum, because that requires being on American soil.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has refused to redesignate Yemen for TPS. This would provide temporary legal status and work authorization to people holding expiring or expired visas if going home would mean going to disaster zones. Haitians received TPS, for example, after a devastating earthquake hit Haiti in 2010.
Yemen has been hit by a man-made disaster of even greater proportions. The Obama administration protected Yemenis who arrived during its time in office, making its final redesignation in January 2019. Yet the Trump administration has declined to allow Yemenis who have entered since then to apply for TPS, leaving them vulnerable to deportations to the war zone.
The United States doesn't have an obligation to put out fires everywhere in the world. But it shouldn't pour gas on them, as it has in Yemen by supporting the Saudi assaults. And it certainly shouldn't then slam shut the fire escapes, leaving the residents to burn."
Joe Biden Officially Enters Presidential Race,reason.com,Christian Britschgi,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/joe-biden-officially-enters-the-presidential-race/,"Joe Biden officially announced his presidential bid this morning, promising that he could save the country from Donald Trump and the forces of white supremacy.
""We are in a battle for the soul of this nation,"" the former vice president says in a video released today, which focuses heavily on 2017's deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. Who we are. I cannot stand by and watch that happen,"" says Biden.
Biden's entry into the already crowded Democratic primary field is hardly a surprise. Now that he's in, the former vice president has a lot of things going for him. First and foremost are his poll numbers. Biden consistently leads the pack nationally, and he's doing very well in the early-voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
The latest University of New Hampshire poll has Biden as the second most preferred Democratic candidate in that state, garnering support from 18 percent of likely Democratic primary voters. That places him second only to progressive darling Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont (who sits at 30 percent). And Biden is cleaning up in Iowa, where the latest Monmouth University poll shows him winning support of 27 percent of likely caucusgoers. Sanders is pulling 16 percent in Iowa, while South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg is trailing in third place, with 9 percent.
That said, we're a long way off from any actual voting. As Reason 's resident poll expert, Stephanie Slade, likes to remind people , polls at this stage are hardly predictive.
Indeed, that aforementioned University of New Hampshire poll found that only 9 percent of respondents had ""definitely decided"" on a candidate, while another 14 percent were only ""leaning toward someone."" A full 77 percent were ""still trying to decide.""
In short, a lot can happen between now and the Democratic National Convention in July 2020.
The New York Times notes that Biden is entering the race with little money and no ready base of small dollar donors.
Then there's his record. Biden has taken any number of stances that are anathema to today's more progressive Democratic Party.
The former vice president is the only candidate in the race to have voted in favor of the Iraq war. When he was a senator from Delaware, Biden supported most every tough-on-crime policy you can imagine, from mandatory minimums to civil asset forfeiture to an expanded death penalty. He was one of the chief architects of the 1994 crime bill that helped usher in an era of mass incarceration.
More recently, Biden has raised progressive eyebrows for praising the wealthy ("" just as patriotic as poor folks "") and current Vice President Mike Pence("" a decent guy ""). He's also been known to invade the personal space of women at public events.
He has so far declined to endorse several policies beloved by progressives, including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. Such positions make Biden vulnerable to attack from other primary candidates running to his left.
That said, it's fair to ask how much his less-than-progressive record will matter to most primary voters. Another Times article from early April found a wide gulf between the majority of Democratic voters and the party's smaller progressive base. The former was much less active online—and much less concerned about the kind of social-justice issues that get a lot of attention on Twitter.
Biden's announcement video from earlier today shows one way he might try to split the difference between these two camps, focusing like a laser on Trump and white supremacists while declining to mention many policy specifics.
Should he win the nomination, Biden would pull his party back from the left, but not necessarily bring it much closer to supporting individual liberty. He has little interest in running on a platform of expanded, budget-busting entitlements, but—his recent criticism of occupational licensing notwithstanding—he is in no way a small-government guy. His legacy is almost uniformly one of expanding the power of the federal government, whether to prosecute the drug war or go after sexual assault on campus.

The Clean Slate Act’s Record-Sealing Provisions Go Further Than Cory Booker’s Marijuana Justice Act – Reason.com,reason.com,Jacob Sullum,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/the-clean-slate-acts-record-sealing-provisions-go-further-than-cory-bookers-marijuana-justice-act/,"The Clean Slate Act, reintroduced this week by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D–Del.), should help advance the conversation about what the government owes to victims of marijuana prohibition, who face long-lasting burdens even after they have completed their sentences. In that respect, Blunt Rochester's bill goes further than the Marijuana Justice Act, which Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a presidential contender, reintroduced in February.
While Booker's bill requires expungement of records related to ""marijuana use or possession offense[s],"" Blunt Rochester's applies to ""any Federal nonviolent offense involving marijuana."" That's an important difference, because almost all simple possession cases are prosecuted at the state level, while federal cases typically involve manufacture or distribution.
The Clean Slate Act requires sentencing courts to issue record-sealing orders that take effect one year after ""the covered individual fulfills each requirement of the sentence."" For cases that predate the law, the bill requires the attorney general to create a process for sealing records of nonviolent marijuana offenses.
Once sealed, the records would not be available to the general public, although they could still be accessed by courts and by law enforcement agencies ""for investigatory or prosecutorial purposes."" Under the bill, people with federal marijuana convictions ""shall not be required to disclose such information"" and will not be subject to civil or federal penalties for failing to do so, except when testifying in court, when interviewed by law enforcement agencies in connection with new criminal investigations, or as part of background checks for law enforcement or national security jobs or other ""high-risk, public trust"" positions. Otherwise ""a sealed record of a covered individual shall not be included in any background check conducted on the covered individual.""
In addition to requiring automatic sealing of marijuana records, the Clean Slate Act would create a process for sealing records related to other nonviolent federal offenses. People convicted of nonviolent offenses could petition a court to seal their records if at least one year has passed since they completed their sentences. The burden would be on the government to convince the judge that the public interest in keeping the records open outweigh the petitioner's interest in having them sealed. People convicted of sexual offenses, more than two nonviolent felonies, or crimes ""related to treason, terrorism, access and transmission of sensitive defense information, or other national security related convictions"" would not be eligible.
That provision is also a big deal, because under current federal law there is no way to seal or expunge criminal records. Even a presidential pardon does not seal or expunge records, although it can restore certain rights, such as the right to own a gun.
The 2018 version of the Clean Slate Act attracted 20 cosponsors , all of them Democrats, and never got a hearing. This time around, Blunt Rochester has a Republican cosponsor, Rep. Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania, and Democrats are in control of the House, so the bill's chances of advancing should be better."
Jared Kushner Makes the Case for Merit-Based Immigration,reason.com,Billy Binion,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/25/jared-kushner-makes-the-case-for-merit-based-immigration/,"White House adviser Jared Kushner says he will present a plan to President Donald Trump making the case for a merit-based immigration system that prioritizes highly skilled immigrants over those with family ties to the United States.
Speaking at the TIME 100 Summit on Tuesday, Kushner said the U.S. should take a cue from Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, all of which employ a complex points system to determine who is eligible for entry. This, he suggested, would ""unify people"" around strong American wages, a secure border, and humanitarian values.
""I do believe that the president's position on immigration has been maybe defined by his opponents by what he's against as opposed to what he's for,"" Kushner said.
That Trump's opponents have been more instrumental in branding his views on immigration than Trump himself is a dubious claim, as the president has consistently cast migrants as ""criminals"" and ""rapists."" He's also flipped on the subject more than once—just this year he said that he wants immigrants to come ""in the largest numbers ever,"" but later claimed that ""our country's full."" (It isn't.)
But just what would a merit-based system look like here in the States, and how would it accomplish Kushner's ambitious end-game? The answer to that question is about as easy to pin down as is Trump's immigration stance.
Take Canada, for instance, which utilizes a multifaceted 100-point selection factor grid that considers language skills, education, age, work experience, arranged employment in the country, and adaptability. The latter category is quite broad, accounting for spousal factors, professional experience in Canada, as well as family ties to the area. (Although Kushner's plan has yet to be revealed, he seemed to imply that family ties and merit are mutually exclusive.)
That difference notwithstanding, it's likely that Kushner's proposal will look similar to Canada's. But our northern neighbor's approach is anything but a one-size fits all solution—it has one-tenth the population of the U.S., after all, with more people living in California than in all of Canada.
With a workforce that currently hovers around 130 million full-time employees—more than 300 percent of Canada's total population—it's impossible to expect the government to accurately predict a superlative economic balance, particularly if we're using Canada as the gold standard. The country has toggled back and forth between emphasizing labor market needs (which, with ineffective models, led to immigrant underemployment ) and demand-driven factors (which brought an influx of immigrants who were considered to be unskilled).
If anything, Canada's experiment shows the unfeasibility of determining the optimal immigration level, particularly with varying interests at play. And these biases couldn't be clearer with Kushner's guest worker proposal, which he says will provide temporary visas to those seeking work in agriculture, hospitality, and a slew of other seasonal jobs (and which the Trump administration has already considered increasing in recent weeks). In other words, Kushner and Trump both tacitly acknowledge the economy's dependence on low-skilled immigrants, particularly as the country adds more jobs than it can fill.
Kushner's plan follows on the heels of the reintroduction of the RAISE Act, a bill spearheaded by Sen. Tom Cotton (R–Ark.) and backed by Sens. David Perdue (R–Ga.) and Josh Hawley (R–Mo.). Also a merit-based proposal, it aims to cut legal immigrants in half. Kushner has called his bill ""neutral"" in closed-door meetings, per Axios , meaning that it will neither raise nor lower legal immigration levels overall.
Although comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely with a divided House and Senate, Kushner said at the TIME 100 Summit that he has the approval of both Stephen Miller, President Trump's hawkish immigration adviser, and Kevin Hassett, the pro-immigration Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
""If I can get Stephen Miller and Kevin Hassett to agree on an immigration plan, then Middle East peace will be easy by comparison,"" he said."

The country has toggled back and forth between emphasizing labor market needs (which, with ineffective models, led to immigrant underemployment ) and demand-driven factors (which brought an influx of immigrants who were considered to be unskilled).
If anything, Canada's experiment shows the unfeasibility of determining the optimal immigration level, particularly with varying interests at play. And these biases couldn't be clearer with Kushner's guest worker proposal, which he says will provide temporary visas to those seeking work in agriculture, hospitality, and a slew of other seasonal jobs (and which the Trump administration has already considered increasing in recent weeks). In other words, Kushner and Trump both tacitly acknowledge the economy's dependence on low-skilled immigrants, particularly as the country adds more jobs than it can fill.
Kushner's plan follows on the heels of the reintroduction of the RAISE Act, a bill spearheaded by Sen. Tom Cotton (R–Ark.) and backed by Sens. David Perdue (R–Ga.) and Josh Hawley (R–Mo.). Also a merit-based proposal, it aims to cut legal immigrants in half. Kushner has called his bill ""neutral"" in closed-door meetings, per Axios , meaning that it will neither raise nor lower legal immigration levels overall.
Although comprehensive immigration reform is unlikely with a divided House and Senate, Kushner said at the TIME 100 Summit that he has the approval of both Stephen Miller, President Trump's hawkish immigration adviser, and Kevin Hassett, the pro-immigration Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
""If I can get Stephen Miller and Kevin Hassett to agree on an immigration plan, then Middle East peace will be easy by comparison,"" he said.

Hail Satan? A New Documentary Depicts Devil Worshipers as Unlikely Defenders of the First Amendment,reason.com,Todd Krainin,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/video/penny-lane-satanic-temple/,"""The Satanic Temple is a new religious organization that was founded in 2013, kind of as a prank, but very quickly gained a huge amount of authentic followers,"" says Penny Lane , director of Hail Satan? , a documentary premiering at select theaters this week.
Headquartered in Salem, Massachusetts, the Satanic Temple began by organizing theatrical stunts designed to shock people. As its membership grew, political activism became central to the Temple's mission. It challenged Christian monuments on public land and opposed the teaching of religion in public schools, making enemies of politicians, television pundits, and pastors across the country.
So what do followers of the Satanic Temple believe? ""You do find a range of political views within this religious organization,"" Lane says. ""But when your religious tenets are about rebellion against authority, checking your beliefs against our best evidence…autonomy, freedom, liberty—yeah, you certainly see a large overlap with a libertarian point of view.""
In this interview, Lane talks about what makes the Satanic Temple tick and what its struggles with Christians, politicians, and the mainstream media say about religion in America today.

The Telegraph Was America’s First Singularity,reason.com,Anthony Comegna,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/27/the-telegraph-was-americas-fir/,"The years from 1815 to 1845 are usually called the Jacksonian Era, but no one person can define the lives of millions. If someone could, the better icon for that age might be Samuel Morse, who invented the most transformative, revolutionary device of the entire century. Even the railroads pale in comparison to Morse's telegraph.
It was a time of decentralized and dispersed but consequential activities. Innumerable tinkerers worked in shops littered across the land, and every day some new machine hit the market—some contraption to repair clothing, protect your hats, heat your home, cook, clean. Undergirding it all was the revolutionary system of cheap and efficient communications: first the steam presses and cheap newspapers, then telegraphy.
It was America's first singularity.
In geometry, a singularity is the point on a curve beyond which a fixed viewer can no longer see the curve. Imagine you're on the street looking at a circular building. There will be points at either end where the shape of the curve prevents you from seeing around the bend.
In astrophysics, black holes are singularities. Their gravitational wells are so strong that literally nothing—not even light—can escape. Approach one closely enough and the singularity will never let go. Gradually, it will pull you into itself, distorting your body, breaking it apart into one long strand of atoms. The black hole turns you into a piece of human spaghetti, sucking you up into its own mass.
In modern computing, the singularity is sometimes spelled with a capital s and takes on the flavor of a religion. The believers think our singularity will be the point at which artificial intelligence becomes indistinguishable from human intelligence. Machines could then improve themselves at dramatically increased rates, the costs of creating more intelligence would fall dramatically, and the explosion of intelligence would change everything.
For most people, the very prospect of a technological singularity is probably terrifying. But Americans have lived through one before, and they not only survived it but emerged to snatch global economic and political leadership from Great Britain. The Jacksonian singularity set the United States on track to become a superpower, the leading edge of global prosperity.
Decisions made during a time of singularity are perhaps the most important decisions human beings ever face, because they remake the world. Americans during the Jacksonian singularity both charted the nation's course toward a brilliant future and made titanic mistakes along the way. We now find ourselves in a historical situation analogous to theirs, but we do not have the luxury of making their mistakes anymore.
As the pace of change quickened in the 1820s and '30s, a great threat to entrenched power came from an unlikely source: the post office. Delivery of the mail was far and away the most significant single duty of the national government, and the postal service employed more people than all the other federal bureaucracies combined. Even the farthest-flung places in America had post offices, and access was considered a universal, equal right for all citizens.
Because the post was a government monopoly, it was also an early focal point of conflict over slavery. In the 1830s, abolition societies organized themselves into formal social networks and used the postal system and steam-driven presses to flood Southern mail with abolitionist literature. This activism helped spur the cheap postage movement championed by Lysander Spooner and Barnabas Bates; it also prompted a fierce Southern backlash, complete with mobs burning abolition mail. The more the price of communications fell, the more abolitionists reached out to their fellow beings, touched their hearts, opened their minds, and transformed society.
Yet as Spooner understood, slaveholders could easily co-opt the pliant state monopoly, bending it to serve their interests. President Andrew Jackson's postmaster general, Amos Kendall, set the standard: When Charlestonians mobbed their post office to burn abolitionist literature in 1835, he ignored it and refused to protect equal rights to the mail. Rather than censuring Kendall and Jackson or reforming the postal service, Congress passed the infamous ""Gag Rule"" to prevent Northern members from considering abolitionist petitions. So Spooner and Bates attempted more radical methods of reform. Spooner established the American Letter Mail Company to directly compete with the postal monopoly, which it did with great success until the government shut it down. Bates diligently lobbied both Whigs and Democrats to lower postage rates in keeping with the British two-cent model. Both men now compete for philatelic recognition as the father of cheap postage in America.
Publishers benefited from privileged prices set by the postal service. Editors across the country exchanged free copies with one another and clipped the choicest articles from distant or significant places to share directly with their audiences. By 1822, more people read newspapers in the United States than anywhere else in the world, though no single paper circulated to more than 4,000 readers. Steam-driven presses and ""penny papers"" extended the drama even further. In New York City from 1832 to 1836, the circulation of daily papers shot from 18,200 to about 60,000.
Americans became the most literate people in world history. Information flowed across the land as never before and nowhere else on the planet—enough to send anyone reeling.
One randomly selected issue of the New York Daily Plebeian (July 11, 1843) contains advertisements for ""marine and fire insurance,"" British steamship lines, the Staten Island Ferry, the New York and Erie Railroad, the Housatonic Railroad, the express train to Pittsburgh, and the Daily Express train, which went upstate and then out to Chicago and ""the Canadas."" There is an ad for luggage, for a new common school, and for cheap groceries ""to suit the times"" from Merritt's Wholesale and Retail Grocery, which offered free delivery to any part of town. There is a very long testimonial praising Sand's Sarsaparilla and its ability to ""throw off…chronic constitutional diseases."" (The copywriter recognizes that ""this is sometimes termed quackery"" but insists that plenty of ""medical profession[als], ministers of the Gospel, officers of justice, and numerous private citizens"" swear by it.) If old-timey root beer–like products are not your thing, maybe you'd like to follow in the footsteps of Thomas Parr, ""who lived to the unusual and patriarchal age of 182 years…solely attributable to his temperate habits, and…Parr's Life Pills."" Or you could buy Dr. Hunter's Red Drop, ""warranted to cure in any and all cases of disease of a private nature"" (possibly gonorrhea). For my part, I'd rather turn to the next ad and buy some Rock Spring Gin.
After flipping through the news (an uneasy peace between Mexico and Texas), you'll find that French's Hotel has expanded. You can follow the shifting values of European currency and then check in on prices to travel with the Northern and Western Emigrant Passage Office. In the ""Amusements"" section are 50-cent tickets to Niblo's, which get you a peek at performances by ""The astonishing ravel family"" of pantomimes and tight rope walkers, including a burlesque show, contortion, and ""the Comic Pantomime of Enchantment."" P.T. Barnum's American Museum features Tom Thumb, ""The Prince of all Dwarfs."" At Vauxhall Garden Saloon, you can witness ""Chinese Divertisements, with golden balls, rings, plates, spears, &c.,"" singing European and ""Negro"" songs alike, and the ""Corpuscular Feats"" of Mr. E.H. Conover. If you're willing to trek across the river to Hoboken, New Jersey, you can visit the Elysian Fields and see more astounding tight rope walking and magic tricks. Perhaps horse racing is more your speed—try the Beacon Course.
There are lease notices for residential and commercial properties, including ""a cotton factory of 1500 spindles…in complete working order."" There is an ad for someone named John Brown's ""New Hot Air Cooking Stove""; for a salesman willing to hawk engravings of General Jackson; for ""a collection of Wax Figures, large as life, representing distinguished characters."" There is a long set of mortgage sale notices and a section full of legal notices, from the sale of a deceased client's goods to declarations of debtor insolvency.
One single paper from one single city offers an absolutely bewildering array of information and material wealth. That's how deeply interconnected New York City's citizens were by 1843. And in almost every city of appreciable size, you'll find similarly formatted papers bursting with advertising and news.
Even so, the real singularity was still ahead. Once the telegraph arrived—aided by the ever-growing network of rail lines and steamer companies—cities, states, and regions became connected to one another as if they were neighborhoods in and around Manhattan.
In March 1843, while the Daily Plebian was hawking Parr's Life Pills, Congress finished mulling over an interesting proposition. Samuel F.B. Morse—a former art professor, failed painter, and amateur technologist—had petitioned it for funds to build a magnetic telegraph from Washington to Baltimore. Packed with development-hungry Whigs and backed by a slaveholding president who fully understood the value of centralized communications, Congress appropriated $30,000.
The first line failed: It went underground but was too poorly insulated. The next line went up on poles. Construction was not yet completed when Morse and his partner, Alfred Vail, sent their first proper message: After Henry Clay won the nomination at the Whig Party's national convention in Baltimore, Vail sent word to Washington from the Annapolis Junction train station between the two cities. Even without a full connection, the telegraph helped spread the news to the capital an hour and 15 minutes before the usual methods of communication.
If the government had monopolized the telegraph, pro-slavery figures like Andrew Jackson would likely have stayed in command, continuing their policy of censoring abolitionist messages more effectively than ever.
That was May 1, 1844. By May 24, the full line was ready for its first official demonstration. Standing at his machine in the United States Supreme Court, Morse tapped out 21 characters from the Book of Numbers: ""what hath god wrought."" About one second later, in Baltimore, Vail's machine began moving. It recorded the message on paper tape, and the world was immediately and profoundly different. Just like that.
Editorial and news correspondents flocked to Washington and Baltimore to report on Morse's amazing invention. Probably hoping to inspire as much as inform its audience, the Baltimore Patriot published a long technical description mixed with political warnings. Among the more interesting details is an explanation of how the mechanisms on either end convert the electrical signals into motion and, ultimately, into marks on a continuous paper tape that can be read by the operator or even cyphered for secret communications: ""A merchant in New York may write to his correspondent in Philadelphia, without the possibility of its being intelligible to any one except the individual to whom it is addressed. Not even the writer upon the instrument in New York or the attendant in Philadelphia decipher it. With perfect ease the key can be changed every day, or at every 10 words of correspondence. This mode of secret correspondence is more sure and safe than that of ordinary ciphers used for that purpose.""
The Patriot concluded with a call for a state monopoly over the telegraph and government advancement of the new industry: ""May this Government foster it with all her care, and give to the Union this bond of her perpetual stability.""
It wasn't the only voice calling for government control. Just a few days before, the New York Herald had endorsed an open-ended amount of federal support for spreading Morse's telegraph around the country. ""Even amidst the effect of the negligence, bad passions, and folly of both Houses of Congress, we are after all not without some hopes, that such an important project as this will receive some attention,"" it editorialized. ""The erection of a line of such telegraphs from New York to Washington, [Boston, and New Orleans,] with all the intermediate points, would at once connect the whole of the chief cities of the Union in one magnetic embrace—make them one vast metropolis as it were, producing incalculable benefits in business, government movements, and popular results, and forming a bond of union which nothing could dissever. We do trust that Congress will pass [legislation] on this subject without any delay.""
Some voices warned that if such an important and revolutionary technology were monopolized by the already powerful few, they could control the flow of information and use it to master their fellow human beings. While Morse was still building his first line, the media began warning of a secret cabal of business elites who supposedly already had a working telegraph between Philadelphia and New York. The Philadelphia Gazette reported on this ""startling discovery"" on June 22, 1844: ""No little excitement has just been created in the Stock Board and among the whole circle interested in the Stock business, by the discovery of a telegraphic communication between this city and New York . We remember that the New York correspondent of the North American , several months ago, put the public on its guard against this mode of immediate dispatch practiced by certain parties in both cities. The fact, then doubted, is proved now beyond any question. We need not say that a combination of this sort is entirely at variance with the safe transaction of business by parties not in the secret "" (emphases added).
There was indeed an optical telegraph system combining semaphore and cryptography between New York and Philadelphia going back to 1840, and it was reserved for the exclusive use of its businessmen funders. But this was hardly a secret—these networks were the telegraph's most immediate precursors. Morse's genius was to replace a long string of semaphore interpreters with cables and electricity, but the skeptics recognized that the line's owners and operators still functioned as gatekeepers. Many worried that unless the government monopolized the telegraph and built lines to each city as part of the postal service, private actors could usurp control of the nation's communications for their own benefit and ruthlessly exploit markets or influence elections.
For slaveholders and their allies, of course, the most dangerous private actors were abolitionists, some of whom seemed rich and crazy enough to create a telegraphic version of William Lloyd Garrison's Liberator or Spooner's American Letter Mail Company. If the government monopolized the telegraph, then pro-slavery figures like Kendall and Jackson would likely stay in command, continuing their censorship policy more effectively than ever. The free flow of information is the greatest enemy a planter ever knew, and Southern laws routinely restricted intellectual and social life, protecting the slave system. It was only reasonable to extend the same practices to new technological frontiers as they opened.
To tame the flow of information, slaveholders would need a government monopoly over the medium, just like Washington's monopoly over the mail. In the ironically named New Orleans Jeffersonian Republican , the editor warned portentously of ""many of the disadvantages and even injuries which may be visited upon the mass of the community if the sole use and control of the Magnetic Telegraph communication be vested in individuals or private companies."" The exclusive right to own and operate a telegraph should ""be transferred to the Government, which excludes any monopoly for improper or speculative purposes."" The Republican cited the New York Commercial , which argued that ""responsible officials"" should manage the industry ""in such a manner as to secure the public against the danger of any monopoly of this channel of information."" Telegraphy ""in private hands"" was unlikely to produce profits or benefit anyone but stock speculators who ""could afford to pay larger sums for the nominal monopoly of its use."" Once this happened, the public would surely rise in class revolt and ""extinguish it.""
Northern readers of the Commercial saw this kind of class revolt in the 1837 New York City flour riots. Southerners saw it in Nat Turner's rebellion and the abolition mail campaign of 1835.
The Jacksonian Era was, in fact, the United States' greatest period of political violence, setting aside the Civil War. Historian David Grimsted studied over 1,200 riots from the 1830s to the 1850s and concluded that they were indeed ""a piece of the ongoing process of democratic accommodation, compromise, and uncompromisable tension between groups with different interests."" In the pro-slavery South, this meant a political culture so insistent on protecting white supremacy that ""it demanded the cessation of white freedom where it touched that issue: petition, speech, press, assemblage, religion, and—in the 1850s—democratic majoritarianism.""
Fortunately, Congress saw no way to profit from telegraphy and thus passed on the chance to monopolize the industry, to the great benefit of humanity.
As all this social and economic ferment was underway, the locofoco and Young America movements emerged. They developed in tandem in mid-1830s New York City, in the minds and lives of many of the same people, for many of the same purposes. Both movements were partially realized thanks to telegraphy, and they represent the era's greatest lasting contributions to American life.
Public domain Locofocoism was the libertarianism of its day. It began in the Workingman's Party circles of the late 1820s and early 1830s, and it grew into its own when that Charleston mob burned the abolitionist mail in 1835. After one of New York's leading young radical editors, William Leggett, began voraciously consuming anti-slavery literature and defending activists' equal rights to the mail, he was ""excommunicated"" (his word) from the Democratic Party. Leggett's work sparked a local rebellion against Tammany Hall and the powers that dominated the state Democratic Party. By taking over their city's politics, the radicals hoped to force a reformation of the national party and a recommitment to the universal equal rights Leggett defended in the Evening Post . The history of locofocoism is far too detailed for adequate coverage here, but the locofocos did partially retake the Democratic Party, reshaping its policy positions and philosophy. They also inspired two generations of young activists and visionaries in the Young America movement.
Young America began in the private meetings of an informal club called the Tetractys Group led by New York City publisher Evert Duyckinck. The members were publishers, editors, artists, and critics who wanted to create and promote an authentic American national culture distinct from its European antecedents, especially Great Britain. From visual artists like Thomas Cole and Asher Durand to poets like Walt Whitman and novelists like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, Young Americans had already been transforming American culture for a decade before Morse sent his famous messages. They were not all locofocos, but they did imbibe the locofocos' romantic respect for republicanism, their emphasis on the class nature of U.S. politics and economics, and much of their sense that America's national destiny depended on strict adherence to liberal moral principles.
Their most serious problem, from a libertarian point of view, was their romantic nationalism, which often reads like naive optimism. Committed locofocos such as Whitman believed politicians such as James K. Polk when he voiced support for free trade, free banking, and free government across the world. Polk was elected quite literally on the strength of about 5,000 locofoco Young American votes in New York, and as soon as he assumed office he betrayed them by rewarding that state's conservatives and cooking up the slaveholders' war on Mexico. The anti-slavery Whitman was horrified. He lashed out like Leggett before him, he was fired from the Brooklyn Daily Eagle , and he emerged from the Mexican War both humbled and radicalized.
The Mexican War divided Young America into two movements: one that supported liberal reform and one that was perfectly willing to make the United States into an empire to advance its political goals. In the 1830s, it was easy to see the groups as allies. When Morse invented the telegraph as part of his own Young American quest to unite the nation's people into a single great culture, it was at once the opening act in the world's peaceful new republican destiny and an essential precondition for continental, imperial expansion. Young Americans and locofocos of all stripes could see in the telegraph the fulfillment of their grandest, most astounding dreams, and they ran positively headlong into the unknown future—Mexican War, Civil War, and all.
In Pittsburgh, the radical editor of The Loco-Foco was typical of his peers. Clipping from the New York Herald, he fed his eager campaign-season audience on hearty helpings of jubilant futurism: ""We are in the midst of a revolution in society and government on both continents, and one which will produce the most important changes…in the physical and moral world.…The possibility—nay, the practicability of uniting vast communities in one firmly united republic, and the rapid triumph of the social and political system of the United States over all others throughout Europe, are great truths which have for several years past been sinking deep into the minds of civilized man.""
The United States was already ""neck and neck"" with Great Britain, the Loco-Foco editor wrote, and destined soon to surpass its former overlord. The ""extraordinary and wonderful"" telegraph now presented the ""wonderful spectacle…of a vast continent, as consolidated and united, and possessed as much, nay, in a greater degree, of the means of rapid communication, as the city of New York."" In true Young American language, he continued: ""It will tend to bind together with electric force the whole Republic, and by its single agency do more to guard against disunion, and blend into one homogeneous mass, the whole population of the Republic, than all that the most experienced, the most sagacious, and the most patriotic government could accomplish.""
""Every doubt"" that constitutional republics could also be continental empires ""will now be removed,"" the editor exulted. American imperialism now seemed ""as natural, justifiable, and safe as the extension of New York to the Harlem river."" Thanks to Morse's telegraph, ""we are indeed on the dawn of a greater era in the history of human progress on this continent than, perhaps, even enthusiasm itself has dreamed."" With the tremendous strength of railroads, steam ships, and vast lands at our backs, ""we may, indeed, bid defiance to all enemies.""
The grandest dreamers of all expected that telegraphy would help us conquer death itself. In the late 1840s, one of my favorite 19th century libertarians, a locofoco and Young American named Frances Whipple, was living in Pomfret, Connecticut, when she encountered a man named Samuel Brittan. Brittan was one of the founders of a religion that owed a significant debt to telegraphy: spiritualism, a broad set of mystical beliefs including contact with the dead, the material existence of spiritual beings, the connections between electricity and intelligent life, and other New Agey–sounding things. He quickly converted Whipple to the faith. Through her entire life, she was an advocate for working people's interests, feminism, abolitionism, and revolutionary republicanism. Once introduced to the new faith, she fell in with the small, swiftly growing, and inordinately influential community of believers and mediums.
Spiritualists practiced séances with the aid of electric batteries and telegraph machines, charging the power of their auras to become ""spirit batteries"" and communicating with ghosts through ""spiritual telegraphy."" For more than two decades, Whipple practiced as a private medium in Rhode Island and California, including at a famous channeling event where a Union colonel, E.D. Baker, purportedly dictated his own funeral oration, which she then delivered herself. (In this way, Baker—as interpreted by Whipple—became the first prominent West Coast politician to advocate emancipation.)
Whipple preached inward reform first and foremost: Technologies like the telegraph might enable us to do great and wonderful things, to aggrandize and exploit our powers like never before, but she felt we must hold ourselves to higher standards than those who have come before us. Rather than use the telegraph to unite a vast and violent empire, she and other feminist mediums argued that we should use the technology to ""commune with the wise ones of the ages,"" learn from their examples and their grave mistakes, and resolve simply to do whatever we can to be better to each other.
As we enter an age of spiritual machines, with the internet and social media as its substrate and a new Jacksonian populism to match, do we need our own tech-embracing spiritual reform movement? Could individualist libertarianism, with its sacrosanct respect for autonomy and voluntarism, be our answer to the singularity of our times?
Perhaps, but we all know that's a minority position. Our Jacksonian forebears answered their own existential quandary with expansionist, nationalistic, and fundamentally naive bluster. Pro-slavery Jacksonians saw themselves leading the world into true modernity and used their new powers to expand the Cotton Kingdom to continental proportions. The largely anti-slavery Young Americans—convinced they could bend national power to their own dreams for global republican revolution—diluted their movement with every vote for a status quo politician.
In the end, battles over the mail monopoly translated into a far larger conflict about the national state's powers and privileges over its component parts. When Abraham Lincoln won the presidency in 1860, Southerners knew what it meant for them: swarms of Republican officeholders invading their ports and taking command of the postal service; abolitionists once again flooding the mail with their messages (at newly reduced rates, thanks to Bates and Spooner); and no power on Earth able to effectively check them. In time, there would even be Republican parties in the Southern states themselves, and Southern newspapers would turn abolitionist. Vast networks of railroads, steam ships, and magnetic telegraphs would transform into the greatest liberating force the world had ever seen. The very thought was intolerable.
For the remnants of locofoco Young America (including Frances Whipple), the Civil War was no mere horror show: It was a grand historical moment for revolution and rebirth, the true fulfillment of our Manifest Destiny. The Jacksonians' gravest mistake—and they made many—was burying the revolutionary republican tradition in a mountain of nationalistic naiveté. In so doing, they devolved the United States from a grand experiment in self-government into one of history's more familiar tales: the rise-decline-fall cycle of empire.
Today, the same mistakes might mean the end of civilization itself. But spaghettification is hardly imminent, even if we're moving dangerously close to that black hole's gravity well. With as much preparation as we can muster, with serious study of the best examples of how to live freely in turbulent times, with a will to maintain our integrity and a stubborn refusal to make the same mistakes as our ancestors, we just might survive this ride through the historical wormhole without losing our lunch."
A Vivid Description of the Needless Suffering Caused by Laws Banning Organ Markets,reason.com,Ilya Somin,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/28/a-vivid-description-of-the-needless-suffering-caused-by-laws-banning-organ-markets/,"Every year, thousands of people in need of kidney transplants endure greatly suffering because there are not enough organs available to satisfy the demand. They can survive—for a time—only by going through the difficult and time-consuming process of kidney dialysis A recent Canadian Broadcasting Corporation article effectively conveys the pain involved:
Blair Waldvogel wishes he didn't have to spend so much time in his basement. But if he doesn't, he'll die.
The 52-year-old Winnipeg father has been on Manitoba's kidney transplant list for the past eight years. His Type O blood means Blair can only receive a kidney from a Type O donor and he hasn't been able to find a match.
So, four days a week, Blair Waldvogel goes downstairs to the guest bedroom, hooks himself up to his home dialysis machine, and sits there for four hours while the machine cleans his blood.
""I never imagined I'd get to eight years,"" said Blair…..
If you include the time it takes to set up the machine and to clean up afterwards, Blair has spent the equivalent of 348 days in his basement on dialysis.
""There have been some scary, scary times along the way,"" said [Blair's wife] Irene. She has had to call paramedics more than once after Blair passed out in his dialysis room because his blood pressure dropped too low.
As the article describes, kidney dialysis makes it extremely difficult to continue to live a normal life. Blair Waldvogel, for example, has had to quit his job as the president of the North American recycling program for an international steel company. The article also correctly notes that many dialysis patients endure even greater suffering than the Waldvogel family. And, every year, thousands die because organs do not become available in time to save them . Indeed, Mr. Waldvogel is somewhat fortunate to have survived for eight years on kidney dialysis, because the average life expectancy of dialysis patients who cannot get a transplant is only 5-10 years. The case described in the CBC article is in Canada. But the situation in the United States is no better.
In addition to the pain endured by patients and their families, society loses as well, due to patients' reduced productivity and the enormous expense of dialysis treatment (much of it subsidized by federal and state governments).
Nearly all of this death, suffering, and waste could be eliminated if only the US and Canadian governments would legalize organ markets , thereby increasing the supply of kidneys. For reasons I summarized here , laws banning organ markets are the moral equivalent of actively killing innocent people:
The injustice of status quo policy is more than just a matter of failing to help people in need. It is the equivalent of actively killing them. Consider a situation where Bob needs to buy food in order to keep from starving. Producers are willing to sell him what he needs at market prices, but the federal government passes a law saying that it is illegal to sell food for a profit. Bob is only allowed to acquire such food as producers are willing to give him for free. If Bob starves as a result, the government is actively culpable for his death. It cannot claim that it was merely an innocent bystander who refused to help him in his time of need. The same point applies if the government (or anyone else) uses coercion to prevent people from selling organs that ESRD patients need to live.
Unlike in the case of food, it is unlikely that ESRD patients would buy what they need directly from sellers. Most likely, the actual purchases would be done by hospitals, health insurance companies, and other specialized enterprises, which could screen them for quality and then offer them to patients (as is the case with many other types of transplants and complex medical supplies). But that does not change the morality of the situation.
In t he same post and elsewhere, I also addressed various standard objections to organ markets, such as claims that they will corrupt our morals by ""commodifying"" the body , and lead to unjust exploitation of the poor .
By legalizing organ markets, we can save thousands of lives and greatly curtail the kind of suffering now needlessly endured by the Waldvogel family and thousands of others. As an extra bonus, we can also increase economic productivity and reduce health care costs in the process. Few if any other policy reforms can achieve such enormous gains at so little cost."

and reprint the rate of species extinction graph Al wisely redacted from later reprints of the book
It illustrates a passsage lamenting how the million year ascent of man has been attended by an increasingly rapid decimation of edible creatures, its curve of the number of species lost by human action rising from a few species per millennium in neoithic times, to hundreds per century in the age of exploration, and accelerating upward through the 20th century until the line became vertical in the year 2000.
In 1993 I took the trouble to point out in The Scrptical Inquirer that as a vertical line has an infinite slope, Gore was projecting extinction of an infinite number of species in the year 2000.
As a member of one of the species doomed to extinction by Al’s innumerate curve , I suggested he publish a correction while we were still around .
He instead chopped the graph from subsequent printings without a corrigendum leaving those who read the original edition in consequence of his 2000 Presidental run wondering if the report of their extinction might be somewhat exaggerated"

As that ordinate is a dead vertical line, and vertical lines are of infinite slope, the rate of extinction becomes infinite at that point because the slope of the extinction curve is the rate of extinction.

Of note, Hydropower does increase rainfall in the area due to the new lake. However, wind and solar don’t take a meaningful amount of energy out of the system (if you try, it becomes less and less effective). Also, due to thermodynamics, you have a lot of waste heat from both sources (Carnot efficiency, the maximum possible, of solar and wind are around 30%). The power of the sun is so massive and widespread that it’s just not a meaningful amount of energy removed from the system. Outside of extremely local effects (shade and reflections from solar panels, bird chopping from windmills, and the concrete for their foundations), it’s not big.
Biomass, on the other hand, does have a huge impact. You rip out whole acres of land to farm it and then burn the crops. Whether it’s wood, hay, or corn, the impact is the same. huge quantities of land taken of for agricultural use instead of wild use."

The get meat (most of the meat is donated since few western countries allow the importation of African game meat), jobs and money. They therefore are much more willing to assist the government’s in protecting wildlife, and much less cooperative with poachers. In countries that ban big game hunting, the locals actively assist the poachers or simply turn a blind eye. It’s hard to raise enough crop for your family and have any left to sell when elephants are constantly destroying it. Once again capitalism has proven to be a better conservationist then authoritarianism."

Apparently all those deaths were more evenly distributed than anticipated. 2) I don’t understand why you would comment that “Despite these wild species extinctions and reduced numbers, the biomass of land animals has never been greater.” Obviously if one cut down the Amazon rainforest to raise cattle intensively, there would be a net increase in animal biomass. But what conservationist has ever had the objective of more cows, pigs, goats etc?"

The chart is on page 24 and while not quite infinite the chart does end at 2000 with the rate of extinctions being 100,000 per year by then. Gore writes: “…living species of animals and plants are now vanishing around the world one thousand times faster than at any time in the past 65 million years (see illustration).” Thanks for reminding us of it.
