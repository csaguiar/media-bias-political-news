Netanyahu vows to annexe Jewish settlements in occupied West Bank – GENRIKO NEWS AGGREGATOR APP,www.theguardian.com,Africa News,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/netanyahu-vows-to-annexe-jewish-settlements-in-occupied-west-bank,"Israeli prime minister’s pledge seen as a rallying call in tight election race. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pledged to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if he wins his country’s election on Tuesday, a dramatic last-minute rallying call to his nationalist base.
In interviews with domestic media ahead of the polls, Netanyahu repeated his promise and said he would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state by “controlling the entire area”.
Hundreds of thousands of settlers live in outposts in the West Bank, which Israel’s military captured in a war more than half a century ago and continues to rule, controlling the lives of more than 2.5 million Palestinians.
World powers consider the settlements illegal under international law, built on land confiscated from Palestinian families and squeezing them into ever-smaller enclaves. Formally declaring the settlements part of Israel would also be seen as putting an end to fading hopes for a Palestinian state, as there would be little continuous land on which to create it.
Rapper Tamer Nafar urges Palestinians not to boycott Israel poll Read more
Netanyahu is facing a tight race for re-election. Recent polls have shown his rightwing Likud party just behind the Blue and White party, run by a former Israeli army chief Benny Gantz. However, with support from smaller pro-settlement, far-right and ultranationalist parties, Netanyahu would have a better chance of forming a coalition government.
During Israel’s last election, in 2015, Netanyahu was criticised for a poll-day statement, seen as incendiary and racist, to rally rightwing supporters by warning that Arab citizens in Israel were “heading to the polling stations in droves”. Without certain victory in sight this year, many had been waiting for a similar stunt.
On Saturday night, Netanyahu gave an interview to Israel’s Channel 12 TV. He pledged not to dismantle a single Jewish settlement, of which there are more than 100, from makeshift trailer parks on hilltops to huge townships indistinguishable from towns in Israel.
The interviewer asked why he had not already annexed some of the larger settlements. “Who says that we won’t do it? We are on the way and we are discussing it,” he replied. “You are asking whether we are moving on to the next stage – the answer is yes, we will move to the next stage. I am going to extend sovereignty and I don’t distinguish between settlement blocs and the isolated settlements.
“From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.”
A so-called two-state solution , which envisions an Israel and a Palestine side by side, has long been the preferred peace option of most of the international community. But growing settlement construction has dashed hopes.
In a separate interview on Sunday, Netanyahu boosted about adding new housing units into settlements. “We’re going to continue controlling the entire territory west of the Jordan (river),” he said, in reference to the occupied West Bank.
Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term as US president further damaged the two-state ideal. The Palestinians see the occupied eastern section of Jerusalem as the capital of any future state, and cut contact with Washington after the declaration.
Last month, Trump recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights , a plateau Israel captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict and annexed in 1981. The move broke from the post-second world war international consensus that forbids territorial conquest during war, and Palestinians warned that it set a dangerous precedent for land grabs in the West Bank.

In Israel, Trump’s announcement was viewed as an election gift to Netanyahu. On Saturday evening, Trump said he had made the controversial decision after getting a “quick” history lesson from his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his pro-settlement ambassador to Israel and former bankruptcy lawyer, David Friedman.
Trump said when he suggested US recognition, Friedman was thrilled and reacted like a “wonderful, beautiful baby” getting what he wanted. “He [Friedman] said: ‘You would do that, sir?’” Trump told the audience to chuckles.

April 6, 2019 Saeb Erekat , a veteran former Palestinian negotiator, said he was not surprised by Netanyahu’s statement on settlements.
“Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration’s support and endorsement of Israel’s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine,” he said.
Netanyahu’s remarks were also criticised by his main election challenger, former military chief Benny Gantz, who branded them calling it an “irresponsible” bid for votes.
“Why not ask how in 13 years Netanyahu could have annexed and didn’t?” said Gantz, in reference to Netanyahu’s time as premier. “I think that releasing a strategic and historic decision in an election campaign bubble is not serious and (is) irresponsible.”

Channel Nine begins work on drama based on Lawyer X scandal | Media | The Guardian,www.theguardian.com,Calla Wahlquist,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/07/channel-nine-begins-work-on-drama-based-on-lawyer-x-scandal,"Produced by the makers of Underbelly, the series titled Informer 3838 is pitched as a ‘rollercoaster of ambition, love, delusion, murder and epic betrayal’. Channel Nine has begun pre-production work on a new television drama based on the life of former Melbourne lawyer Nicola Gobbo, better known as Lawyer X .
The production has been the subject of speculation since revelations about a lawyer acting as a police informer prompted the Andrews government to call a royal commission in December .
Gobbo, who was designated Informer 3838 in police records, was a key police informer from 2005 to 2009 at the tail end of Melbourne’s bloody gangland wars.
Screentime, the Australian production company behind the award-winning Underbelly series on the gangland wars, will produce the series which will begin filming later this year.
“Informer 3838 is the incredible gangland war story that has it all – a rollercoaster of ambition, love, delusion, murder and epic betrayal,” Michael Healy, Nine’s director of television, said in a statement on Sunday.
“It promises to be an explosive series about a well-connected young lawyer who put her life on the line, representing Melbourne’s underworld in court, and giving information about their criminal exploits to the police.”
Lawyer X: the extraordinary story laid out before royal commission Read more
Gobbo’s former clients include murdered kingpin Carl Williams and his associate Tony Mokbel, who is currently in jail for drug trafficking.
Both were figures in the previous instalments on Underbelly, and Nine reported that it was possible the actors who played them — including Gyton Grantly, who won a Logie for his portrayal of Williams and is in the middle of a long run at Melbourne’s Princes Theatre as Ron Weasley in the Australian production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child — could reprise their roles.
Mokbel is among those challenging the validity of his conviction after the high court last year ruled that Gobbo’s former clients be informed of her double role , saying that passing on confidential information to police was a “fundamental and appalling breach” of her professional duty.
Gangsters, cops and Lawyer X: the police informant scandal that has shocked Australia Read more
The court also said Victoria Police were “guilty of reprehensible conduct” in asking Gobbo to work as an informant, despite knowing that she was a barrister.
The royal commission into the management of police informants has heard that Gobbo was registered as an informant twice in the 1990s before being registered again in 2005 , and that police did not seek legal advice on the risk of using a lawyer as a source.
The royal commission is due to make a preliminary report on 1 July and a final report on 1 December.

I currently live in Sweden. I don’t know how much you know about Swedish politics, but for decades the Social Democrats held power, with an occasional Moderaterna (Tory-ish) interlude.
That bloc consensus has been thrown into total disarray by the emergence of the far-right Sverigedemokraterna party. The same thingg is happening in Germany with AfD.

The football league reflects society. The 1% at the top have all the money and win everything, and keep getting richer. It's a totally unfair competition in terms of sport - there isn't a level playing field. You've got money you get into the top 5. I don't even think those managers are so great...spending hundreds of millions against clubs spending tens of millions doesn't make you a genius...you buy the best players in the world at inflated prices to boost egos and of course you should be up there. Fuck all those managers at money clubs - they aren't good managers - they've just got lucky and have an easy job thanks to the megabucks squads.
