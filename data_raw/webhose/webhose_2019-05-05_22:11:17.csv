Fetal surgery for spinal defect at Providence hospital a first in New England | Video,www.providencejournal.com,G.

Dr. Francois I. Luks, pediatric surgeon-in-chief at Hasbro Children's Hospital, and a team of other physicians and professionals have led the way in the region with in-utero surgery to treat the birth defect spina bifida, a procedure that offers a better prognosis for an Attleboro boy who had the surgery while still in his mother's womb.
PROVIDENCE — Your baby has a birth defect.
These are words no parents want to hear.
But that diagnosis is what Emily Hess and her husband, Brian, learned following an ultrasound at about the 19th week of her pregnancy.
The Attleboro couple’s other three children were healthy, but their fourth, Selwyn, was destined to come into the world with spina bifida — a spinal defect caused by errant embryonic development that produces varying degrees of paralysis, incontinence and hydrocephalus — fluid on the brain — among other life-limiting conditions.
“It was very hard news,” Emily Hess told The Journal. “It was a lot to take in, and we were upset. A lot of emotions.”
Enter pioneering medicine.
Traditionally, the initial treatment for spina bifida has consisted of surgery after birth with other interventions following, but results vary from negligible to exceptional. Dissatisfied with the poor prognosis in cases of myelomeningocele, the most severe form, experts at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia several years ago began experimenting with a new approach: surgical repair on the fetus, months before birth.
The Philadelphia hospital's so-called MOMS study found that children who had been operated on in utero could walk better, had better motor function and were less likely to need a shunt to drain fluid from the brain, compared with children who underwent surgery shortly after being born. A few other centers learned the delicate, high-risk procedure, but for years, none had tried it in New England.
Dr. Francois I. Luks, pediatric surgeon-in-chief at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, and a team of other physicians and professionals at Hasbro aspired to join that elite group. They had extensive experience in other fetal surgery, but for this, they lacked a critical piece: an appropriate opportunity.
Not every woman carrying a baby with spina bifida is eligible. The diagnosis must be made at the right time. The mother-to-be must be in the proper weight range. And she must be willing to accept the risk to the baby in her womb — and to her. This would be an operation with a chance, however remote, of fetal and maternal mortality.
“You're talking about a major operation on the mother in order to open the uterus, which is a big deal, to get to the fetus,” Luks said.
To determine eligibility, Hess underwent a whirlwind of tests and discussions with staff at Hasbro Children’s Hospital. Waiting for the results proved emotional, too.
On the one hand, “If we got excluded, it was going to be a relief, because then the decision was made for us,” Hess said. On the other, “If we didn't get excluded, then it was just up to us. So it was our decision to make.”
Hess met all criteria. And she and her husband decided to proceed.
“We wanted to do what was best for the baby,” Hess said.
On May 11, 2018, the couple arrived at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, part of the Lifespan system.
“I remember going to the OR because I had to go in awake to start,” Hess said. “So it was a very stressful day. It was a lot of waiting, because this was in the afternoon. A lot of waiting and thinking and a lot of praying. Very scary.”
Luks had practiced with his team, which included pediatric neurosurgeons Konstantina Svokos and Petra Klinge, obstetric anesthesiologist Denis Snegovskikh, maternal-fetal medicine specialist Dr. Stephen R. Carr, and several other doctors and nurses. Fetal Treatment Program of New England’s nurse-coordinator Deb Watson-Smith also played a vital role.
“As Emily said, it was a long day, a lot of waiting,” Luks said. “It's a very large team of six or seven nurses and the 12 physicians who all had to assemble and get ready. Because this was the first case, we also spent quite a bit of time earlier that day doing a dry run to make sure everybody knew his place or her place and that all the equipment was where we needed it to be.”
Performing in-utero surgery on this part of a baby's anatomy is a daunting task. The Mayo Clinic describes Selwyn's defect this way: ""Also known as open spina bifida, myelomeningocele is the most severe form. The spinal canal is open along several vertebrae in the lower or middle back. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves.""
Two hours after they began, the operation ended. The deformity on Selwyn’s little spine had been successfully repaired, and mother and baby went home to bed rest until the boy was born, by Caesarean section, at Women & Infants Hospital, a Care New England facility, on July 30.
“Everything went well,” Hess said.
Now, she said on a recent visit with Luks, her son is “very close to on-target with all those developmental milestones. He has a little bit of weakness in his legs, but he has occupational therapy coming to our house every week, stretching and practicing things. We work on it all the time.”
And the outlook for the years ahead?
“We have to kind of wait and see,"" Hess said. ""But he’s looking pretty good.”
“The convergence of technologies enabled the fetal spina bifida repair, but it was the convergence of talent and temperament of all the individuals involved that made it happen,” Carr told The Journal. “These are people from different disciplines, and even different hospital systems, that combine their talents to maximize benefit for these children.”
Said Luks: “This is a success in that Selwyn and Emily have not suffered any of the risks of the intervention. … So from that point of view, it was worth it after the fact, because we know that they suffered none of the risks and, in the end, hopefully, all of the benefits.”

LEMONADE DEREGULATION: IS Governing Just Too Hard for Polis?,coloradopeakpolitics.com,ColoradoPeakPolitics,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://coloradopeakpolitics.com/2019/04/06/lemonade-deregulation-is-governing-just-too-hard-for-polis/,"LEMONADE DEREGULATION: IS Governing Just Too Hard for Polis?
We’d be remiss if we ignored Gov. Polis’s recent grandstanding to appear more business friendly, especially since he’s charging full steam ahead to dismantle our energy economy through the oil and gas bill.
Polis signed a deregulation bill into law permitting children to operate lemonade stand business without the hassle of local control.
While passing more controversial bills in private, the governor seized on this opportunity to share his grand gesture in an official signing ceremony. Thrilled to sign the bipartisan Lemonade Stand Bill today that reduces regulations and cuts red tape, making it easier for young entrepreneurs to start their own businesses! Thank you @COSenWilliams , @JackTateCO , @repjamescoleman & Rep. Carver for your leadership! pic.twitter.com/5Wz9ZRp5O9
— Jared Polis (@GovofCO) April 1, 2019
Of course, children won’t be completely free to just operate lemonade stands willy nilly like a bunch of anarchists. Democrats also imposed new state rules for them to follow.
They can’t set up shop anywhere near a business where they might be seen as capitalist competitors, and they can only run their stands fewer than 84 days. NOT 85 days, but 84 days, because that’s not as random, or something.
But under Polis’s new lemonade regime, local government is forbidden to require any sort of license or permit to operate. In other words, local control is just too onerous on young entrepreneurs.
Conversely, the oil and gas bill will pass state regulatory control around to all local governments.
Apparently the state is fully capable of regulating the lemonade stand trade, just not its main economic driver. 425"

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 06th Apr, 2019) National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST) has made its mark as an Inaugural Participant in a new ranking category introduced by Times Higher Education (THE), a renowned UK-based university ranking agency.
The category is called “THE University Impact Rankings"" – it ascertains universities’ impact on society in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). THE has developed a new set of performance metrics in order to evaluate and rank universities under the new category, which has assessed universities against 11 out of 17 SDGs.
This year, 462 worldwide universities have been considered for the ranking. It merits mention that NUST is a pioneer among Pakistani universities to have aligned its R&D with the UN SDGs, and hence is an SDG-engaged university, committed to producing research and solutions in line with the SDGs.
The contending universities were required to participate in at least 4 SDGs, including the 17th SDG “Partnership for the Goals,” which was compulsory for all. The 3 optional SDGs NUST participated in were Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), and Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure (SDG 9).
NUST was ranked between 101-200 in Quality Education; 201-300 in Gender Equality; 101-200 in Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure; and 301+ in Partnership for the Goals."

Athens, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Chinese investors led the so-called Golden Visa boom in Greece , where residence permits issued to non-E.U countries citizens grew 46 percent last year.
Other crisis-hit countries like Portugal and Spain have used the scheme for years to lure investors in a bid to stoke an economic recovery. Spending a minimum of 250,000 Euros on a home in Greece secures a five-year renewable visa .
According to the latest data from the migration policy ministry published by the Kathimerini newspaper on Saturday, Chinese investors account for 58 percent of the residence permits issued from 2013.
Since the launch of the programme until the end of the first trimester of 2019 , a total of 4,154 permits were issued.
Of these 1,399 were handed out last year, up from 961 in 2017 .
Chinese investors have acquired 2,416 out of the 4,154 permits issued so far. Russian citizens came second with 428, followed by Turks.
The European Commission published a report earlier this year, urging members to curb the practice of granting golden visas and passports to foreign investors.
It singled out Cyprus , Bulgaria and Malta for running schemes granting citizenship to foreign investors for anywhere between 500,000 euros ($570,000) and two million euros.
The report said wealthy candidates for residency or citizenship do not face adequate security and background checks.
The Greek government brought last month a bill to the Parliament , broadening the criteria of the Golden Visa programme.
Non-EU nationals will now be granted a five-year residency permit provided that they invest at least 400,000 euros in Greek companies or if they buy Greek bonds through a Greek bank of the same value. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

IOC evaluation commission chairman Octavian Morariu revealed the figures Saturday after an inspection of proposed sites in the northern Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto.
Morariu described the joint bid by Italy 's financial capital and Dolomites ski resort Cortina D'Ampezzo as a ""very competitive proposition"".
""After our five days here, we can say that the overwhelming popular support demonstrated by the latest IOC poll is not a surprise,"" Morariu told a press conference.
In Milan , 87 percent are in favour of the Olympics , while in the region of Lombardy, of which Milan is the capital, it was 81 percent and Cortina's Veneto region, 80 percent.
Similar polls carried out in Sweden , where Stockholm is the only city in competition with Italy , put the figure at 53 percent.
""Wherever we went we felt welcome,"" continued Morariu of the visit which began in Venice .
Under the bid figure skating, hockey and short-track speedskating would be held in Milan , with sliding sports and curling in Cortina; and speedskating, biathlon and Nordic sports would take place at Trentino-Alto Adige.
The alpine skiing events would be in Bormio for the men and Cortina for women while the opening ceremony would be at the San Siro football stadium, with the closing ceremony at Verona 's Arena, a large Roman amphitheatre.
""We found a great candidature team, that put a lot of passion and enthusiasm into the work,"" said Morariu.
""This is really very, very strong."" - 'Financial boost' - Despite darkening clouds gathering over Italy 's economy, the Italian government on Friday officially provided the financial guarantees for the bid amounting to 415 million Euros ($465 million ).
""There's a strong support from the government , local communities, athletes and the financial community,"" said Morariu.
""The letter we received yesterday from the government proved it."" Former Romanian rugby international Morariu said the IOC would invest a further $920 million into the project.
""The Olympic Games are a catalyst for social and environmental change and also a true business opportunity,"" he said.

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Teemu Pukki took his tally to 26 for the season as his double eased Norwich to their eighth successive victory in a a 4-0 thrashing of QPR in The Championship on Saturday.
The 29-year-old Finnish international's brace plus goals by Emiliano Buendia and Marco Stiepermann sent them eight points clear at the top -- though second-placed Leeds can reduce it to five points if they beat Birmingham away later on Saturday.
Third-placed Sheffield United -- who are 10 points adrift -- are away at play-off chasing Preston North End.
Buendia -- who has hit form too scoring five goals in his last eight matches -- blotted his copybook in the second-half earning a straight red card for a two-footed lunge.
However, a hapless QPR -- who showed little improvement despite sacking Steve McClaren earlier in the week -- found no answer and with just one win in their last 16 league games hover eight points above the bottom three.
""We were the better team today. I'm really proud (to have 26 league goals),"" Pukki told Sky sports .
""It's been an unbelievable season for me.
""We still need to do our best in the final six games and we can't start celebrating anything yet. We need to be consistent every day."" Buendia stroked the ball home in the sixth minute after a lovely flowing move and the Canaries doubled their lead in the 12th minute.
Marco Stiepermann shot from outside the box and although Joe Lumley got a hand to it it was hit with enough force to end up in the net.
Pukki, who is up for player of The Championship on Sunday , wrapped up the points in the 38th minute rifling home the ball.
However, it turned a bit sour for Norwich with 19 minutes remaining when Buendia was sent off for his two-footed lunge on Josh Scowen.
However, QPR could do little with their one man advantage and Pukki added his second six minutes from time with a fierce effort from inside the box."

BRUSSELS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini of the governing Lega party will hold a meeting on Monday of right-wing EU parties with the aim of creating a euroskeptic alliance before this May 's elections to the European parliament .
Italian media reported that euroskeptic parties from 20 countries were invited to the gathering in a Milan hotel . The organizers are careful not to give away details since some are still hesitant and mutual exclusions are not ruled out. Further details are expected this weekend, if at all .
Salvini has a solid experience of Europe . He knows the functioning of the European Parliament inside out, having served there since 2004. He joined Lega Nord of Umberto Bossi in 1990 and rose through the ranks to become the uncontested leader of the party, which has abandoned its ""Northern Italian"" approach and addresses itself to all Italians.
With 47 days until the European elections, the flamboyant Milanese will try to position himself as a natural leader for the Eurosceptic forces in Europe .
Lega's political manifesto ahead of the European elections ""underlines and reaffirms common Christian roots, defends national identity and the supremacy of the Italian constitution over European laws and directives."" Lega, and its coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, also strongly oppose massive immigration, European integration and the austerity policies imposed since the 2008 financial crisis.
Euroskeptics are also in power in Hungary , Austria and Poland but they are also riding high in several countries, including France , Germany , the Netherlands , and are predicted to make significant advances in May 's elections. In Spain , the new right-wing VOX party will enter parliament for the first time.
Their difficulty at European level will be to present a united front. Most are new and are not especially keen on making concessions.
For the countries of the group of Visegrad Four group � the Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland and Slovakia � there should not be any problem to be there, although there are significant differences between them and Italy .
Salvini tried to iron out any problem with Poland . Last year, he met Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of the Law and Justice party in Warsaw , and spoke of the concept of a ""European spring"" to replace the ""Germany-France axis"" that still dominates the continent.
Salvini tweeted on Friday he took time to see his ally, Marine Le Pen, of the National Rally party, to discuss the alliance on the sidelines of the EU interior ministers' meeting in Paris . She cannot attend the meeting in Milan but will be represented.
Marine Le Pen's parliamentary group, Europe of Nations and Freedom, currently has 36 seats in the 751-member European parliament . It is the smallest group in the hemicycle. There have been discussions with the group of UKIP and others, Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD), which has 34 members. They vote often together but several right parties in the EFD consider the image of ENF as too extreme to merge the two groups.
Filip Dewinter (VB), a Belgian lawmaker from the Flemish nationalist Vlaams Belang party in the Europe of Freedom and Democracy alliance , confirmed to Sputnik that VB will come to Milan .
""We will of course attend this meeting on Monday in Milan ... Parties will be selected by Salvini upon their programs of course, but there will be many more parties, with the same ideas, outside the Alliance , because of national issues or existence of other parties at national level that are already part of the present alliance ,"" he said.
Dewinter predicted that choices would have to be made between parties that have opposite programs.
""For the Netherlands for example, the fact that Geert Wilders and his PVV party are a member make it difficult if not impossible to have Thierry Baudet and his Forum for Democracy (FVD) on board . It is a pity, both parties have programs that we can support but exclude each other,"" he said.
He emphasized that the presently dominant parties in the European parliament do not represent the European Union 's interests, including in its relations with Russia .
""We are sure of one thing: we are winners in less than a month! Salvini is right to begin organizing the right,"" Dewinter concluded.
AFD FEELING 'POSITIVE' ABOUT ALLIANCE
The Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now the second most popular in in the country, will attend the Milan gathering, its co-leader, Joerg Meuthen, has confirmed to Sputnik.
""We will be present in Milan on Monday for the meeting organized by Lega and are very positive to their will of organizing an alliance of the Right parties in Europe . We believe in national self-responsibility instead of the European blurring of responsibilities,"" he said.
He argued that EU binding budget rules had never applied to countries such as France where President Emmanuel Macron and his predecessors never respected the deficit rules, proving that the European Commission is ""a toothless tiger,"" in Meuthen's own words.
""By his independent moves from Brussels , Salvini teaches the establishment that Italy is a sovereign state. As such, Italy is responsible for its budgetary policy. Of course, Italy must shoulder the consequences that come with it. Europe can only function as Europe of the Fatherlands,"" he stressed.
Meuthen said the AfD had spoken out against all bailouts of national governments since the beginning of the 2008 crisis and promised continue to do so in the future.
He also credited Salvini with unilaterally stopping the influx of migrants from North Africa after Italy closed ports to migrant rescue ships last year. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Mitiga International Airport , located 5 miles from Tripoli 's center, serves as the capital's main air harbor.
On Thursday, Haftar ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the GNA-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-backed GNA government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary."

Berlin, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of people Saturday joined marches across major German cities against ""rental insanity"" or Mietwahnsinn, which has sparked a popular backlash.
Organisers said at least 6,000 people gathered in Berlin 's emblematic Alexanderplatz and were marching towards the working-class, predominantly immigrant district of Kreuzberg, which has been recently targeted by developers eager to make a fast buck.
""No demolition of habitable houses,"" the protesters cried. Some of the marchers were disguised as what they called ""real estate sharks"".
The protesters also launched a signature campaign to press for a local referendum for Berlin 's city hall to expropriate properties of real estate companies possessing more than 3,000 apartments.
They singled out companies such as Deutsche Wohnen and Vonovia, which have bought thousands of buildings in a capital with one of the cheapest real estate prices in Europe .
They raze exiting structures to build luxury apartments and rented them out at higher rates.
The wave of gentrification and rising rents is provoking outrage and leading some to ponder radical solutions like expropriating housing from institutional landlords.
Average rent prices in Berlin have pushed past 10 Euros per square metre per month, according to a recent study by a real estate group CBRE Berlin and German mortgage bank Berlin Hyp AG.
The campaign's spokesman Rouzbeh Taheri said the movement had radicalised as government measures to cool the property market have failed to work.
- Class struggle - ""Many say this is a type of class struggle. Yes that's what it is. But we did not start it. We're taking defensive measures against the class struggler from the top who has for years been fighting against tenants."" The ""Expropriate Deutsche Wohnen & Co."" initiative, named after the biggest private player in Berlin , targets companies with more than 3,000 apartments in their portfolios.
Of an estimated two million rental apartments in Berlin , Deutsche Wohnen owns 111,500, followed by Vonovia with 44,000.
Taheri argues that cutting them down to size would strip them of the influence they wield in deciding market prices.
""It's about sending a signal on which direction the city wants to go. And a signal to speculators -- telling them that your capital is not safe in Berlin ,"" said Taheri.
But critics question whether the private groups really wield that much influence.
Calling the initiative ""completely absurd"", Harald Simons, an economist at Leipzig University, noted that 70 percent of rental apartments across Germany are owned by small landlords who each hold between two and 20 apartments.
Singling out the big groups would ""mean that about five percent of Berlin tenants will suddenly not have to pay much while the rest would have to keep paying just as much,"" he said.
The extreme move could also scare off investors who want to move their businesses here and create new jobs , critics say.
Further, taxpayers would face a huge bill -- Berlin authorities have estimated the cost at 36 billion euros ($40 billion ).
""When people learn about how many billions this will cost , many would see this differently,"" Berlin Mayor Michael Mueller said.
Deutsche Wohnen boss Michael Zahn said the organisers of the initiative were taking a ""very populist tone"" and warned that the public was not being given the full picture.
- ' Rent rebel choir' - But Hans von Maydell was gearing up for battle, as the building he has lived in for 45 years changed ownership for the first time early this year.
""The new owner ... buys and sells property with money from investors who want to make the highest profits possible,"" the 75-year-old said.
In a pre-emptive move, he and fellow residents have sought protection under Berlin 's ""Milieuschutz"" rules aimed at halting gentrification. Tenants have even formed a ""rental rebel"" choir to belt out their protest against rising rents.
For von Maydell, a roof over one's head is as essential as drinking water and should not be ""left to speculation and the free market "".
""We are in favour of these things coming under communal control and managed for the well-being of the community, and not for the well-being of the few who want to get rich quickly and ruthlessly."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The Libyan National Army (LNA), headed by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, closed the airspace in western Libya for flights of combat aircraft and declared this region a war zone, media reported on Saturday.
The LNA threatened to attack any airport in the west of the country that will allow a warplane to take off, according to the Al-Arabiya broadcaster.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Haftar, commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA)-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-supported government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari said on Friday that Haftar's army was carrying out an offensive on Tripoli in several directions at once but has not yet entered the capital. He stated that he could not yet name the date of the end of the operation, but confirmed that the operation would continue until all objectives are completed."

BRUSSELS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The administration of US President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders, demanding explanations of the situation with the issuance of humanitarian visas to over 1,500 Syrian citizens, the Belga news agency reported on Saturday.
A humanitarian visa , unlike a common one, allows a person to seek asylum in Belgium .
However, Reynders has already told the RTBF broadcaster that he did not receive any messages from the White House .
In January , a Belgian official, Melikan Kucam, was charged with creating a criminal organization, human trafficking, passive corruption and extortion for facilitating the issuance of humanitarian visas to refugees from Syria and Iraq .
According to media reports, Kucam received between 2,000 and 10,000 Euros ($2,250-$11,250) for issuing humanitarian visas through intermediaries to Christians , who were residents of armed conflict zones in Syria and Iraq , and who were eager to move to Belgium . Officially, the administrative costs associated with obtaining a humanitarian visa are estimated at 350 euros.
The piquancy of the situation is that being Assyrian by birth, Kucam was the member of the right-wing party New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), which was previously represented in the Belgian Federal government by Theo Francken, who served as secretary of state for migration and asylum from October 2014 to December 2018 . Francken himself, with whom, as it turned out, Kucam was professionally connected, said he knew nothing about what his colleague was doing.
According to Belga, the Belgian authorities cannot locate at least 121 Syrians who entered Belgium with humanitarian visas. For its part, the US administration is concerned that the Belgian authorities are resorting to an ""alternative system"" of admitting Syrian citizens, ""who then disappear from the radar,"" the agency said.
Belgium is one of the 50 ""privileged"" countries, citizens of which do not need visas to travel to the United States . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Augusta, United States, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Striking blows for gender equality with every swing at former men-only enclave Augusta National Golf Club, women golfers competed for a trophy for the first time Saturday at the home of the Masters.
In a club that opened in 1933 but didn't admit its first women members until 2012, LPGA legends Pak Se Ri, Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa and Nancy Lopez hit ceremonial shots off the first tee to launch the historic final round of the inaugural Augusta National Women 's Amateur.
""It's just exciting to be a part of history,"" Lopez said. ""A day of history for us, for the amateurs that are here and for Augusta National."" A field of 72 played the first 36 holes at nearby Champions Retreat before the event moved to the famed Masters layout, with everyone having a practice round Friday but only the top 30 advancing to compete in the last 18 holes of the tournament.
""It's a dream come true. I'm so happy for them,"" Sorenstam said. ""This has huge potential to not just inspire young girls but golfers, other women in sports and women in business ."" American Anna Redding , a University of Virginia senior, was the first competitor to tee off, but she was eight strokes adrift of US leader Jennifer Kupcho. The Wake Forest University senior led after 36 holes on 5-under par 139 with Mexico 's Maria Fassi, a University of Arkansas senior, one stroke behind.
""To play here for the first time is going to be just a great motivation and it's beautiful. They know how special it is,"" Ochoa said. ""Hitting that first tee shot is probably going to be the highlight of their career."" Augusta National's all-male status led to a 2003 protest across the street from the club but it was not until August 2012 when businesswoman Darla Moore and former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were named the club's first women members.
Another move was 2014's debut of the Drive, Chip and Putt Championship, where young girls and boys won titles with a decisive putt on Augusta National's famed 18th green -- three Women 's Amateur players having taken part as youths.
Pak struck the first ceremonial tee shot followed in order by Ochoa, Lopez and Sorenstam, handling the duties in a similar fashion to how Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and the late Arnold Palmer have done at the Masters.
""First time in a long time I get nervous,"" Pak said. ""I have honor to lead .""""For them to kind of make us like Arnold, Jack and Gary , it's a real big honor to be here and hit that first shot,"" Lopez said."

Diavat�, Greece, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :New tensions erupted on Saturday outside a migrant camp in northern Greece between migrants and Greek police who prevented them from advancing towards the border with North Macedonia .
Hundreds of migrants from camps elsewhere in the country gathered outside the Diavate camp near Thessaloniki after anonymous social media posts over recent days claimed that human rights groups stood ready to assist migrants in crossing into North Macedonia and on to other EU states.
After two coaches left the area on Saturday morning, taking some of the protesting migrants to other camps in northern Greece , a group of the 800 remaining migrants threw stones at policemen, who responded with tear gas , an AFP photographer on the spot said.
On Friday, the migrants -- among them families with small children -- had tried to break the police cordon and security forces used tear gas and stun grenades.
Also on Friday, around 200 migrants occupied the Larissis central train station in Athens , shouting ""Saloniki"" ( Thessaloniki ) and "" Germany "".
They had bought tickets to Thessaloniki , intending to also travel to the Diavata camp but authorities stopped the train.
""People exhorted by fake news were misled because of their hope. They want to pass the border so they believed in the fake news"", Greece 's migration minister Dimitris Vitsas said on Saturday.
""For some reason, smugglers are claiming that the borders will open. The borders are not going to open,"" Vitsas told state agency ANA on Friday.
North Macedonia 's interior minister said Skopje had bolstered border security.
""We don't expect any trouble. But we reinforced the security on the border because it is our obligation,"" Oliver Spasovski told AFP on Friday.
More than 70,000 refugees and migrants are believed to be living in Greece as a result of mass influx since 2015 , fuelled mainly by the Syrian civil war.
Most have submitted requests for asylum, clogging an already overburdened application system and further exacerbating approval delays that can stretch into years.
In 2016 , a sprawling tent city formed at the border town of Idomeni, a bottleneck where 8,000 people mainly from Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan were stranded after other EU countries began shutting their borders.
The improvised camp was eventually cleared by Greek authorities and the migrants and refugees were relocated to organised facilities around the country. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Algiers, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :For weeks, expat Algerians have been streaming home, some just for the weekend, to play their part in the historic changes sweeping the country.
""I took unpaid leave to come and march in Algeria , to be here physically,"" said Chahrazade Kaci, who arrived back from London just days before president Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned in the face of huge protests.
""It's a duty,"" said Kaci, 52, who has spent almost half her life in the British capital since going into exile at the height of Algeria 's 1990s civil war.
Sports shoes on her feet and an Algerian flag draped over her shoulders, she held aloft a sign in English : ""Call to all Algerians living abroad -- return home and support our citizens in their struggle to build the 2nd republic."" Kaci was one of many returnees among the immense crowd that filled the streets of Algiers on Friday, the first mass demonstration since Bouteflika announced on Tuesday he was stepping down after two decades in power.
Flying in from Europe , the Gulf and North America, some have used up annual leave or taken extra time off work to take part.
""Since February 22, I haven't been able to sleep,"" Kaci said, referring to the day of the first mass protests against Bouteflika's bid for a fifth term in office.
""I'm addicted to the internet , I follow developments 24 hours a day and I don't miss anything on social media ,"" Kaci said.
She was joined in the crowd by her former husband Salah Allali, who had flown in from Qatar , while her daughter Nada, who was born in Britain, and nephew Yazi Nait-Ladjemil had both come from London to take part in the protest .
Kaci herself arrived back in Algiers the previous Friday and ""joined the march right from the airport "", she said.
Following Bouteflika's resignation, protestors are now pressing on with calls for sweeping reforms and the departure of key figures in the 82-year-old's entourage.
Bouteflika's departure was ""just the beginning,"" Kaci said. ""Still to come is the departure of the rest of the 'gang' and the building of a second republic."" Protestors say they want to see the resignations of the powerful ""3B"" -- Senate speaker Abdelkader Bensalah, head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui.
- Return and 'rebirth' - Born in Algiers , Kaci studied marine biology, but like many Algerians, left the country when it plunged in the early 1990s into a decade-long civil war that left at least 200,000 people dead .
Back in Algiers , returned expats say they are surprised by the country's new-found freedom of speech and the strong presence of women at the vast, largely peaceful marches.
Kheira, 65, also took unpaid leave from her job as a teacher in Montreal to take part in ""these historic marches"".
She had moved to Canada in 2000, to be reunited with her children after sending them there at the height of the civil war.
""My children have everything there, but they are ready to come work and invest in their country,"" she said.
Former trade unionist Salah Allali, who also sought refuge in Britain in the 1990s, took an extra week of holiday without pay to be able to head home.
""The regime must understand that this revolution must end with its departure,"" he said.
Yazid Nait-Ladjemil, who has lived in London for the past two years, took part in several demonstrations organised by Algerians in the British capital, but also returned home to play a role in the protests on the ground.
He said he would not rule out a return to his country.
""It's a rebirth -- before, ( Algeria ) was a bit depressing ,"" he said. The demonstrations ""give me a sense of hope."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Mal�, Maldives, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The Maldives on Saturday held its first parliamentary election since former strongman leader Abdulla Yameen was forced to stand down, with his arch-rival tipped to make a big political comeback.
President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih appealed for a high turnout as unusually hot weather saw slow voting early in the day. Voting was extended for two hours to encourage the public to come out.
Election officials estimated the final turnout to be between 70 and 80 percent, down from the 89 percent recorded at the September presidential election which unexpectedly toppled Yameen.
""I urge Maldivians to go out and vote ,"" Solih said after voting in the capital, Male , where his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) fielded former president Mohamed Nasheed as a candidate.
Nasheed, 51, is the highest profile contender for the 87-member People's Majlis, or parliament that is elected for five years. Over 385 candidates are in the fray. The first results are expected Sunday .
Nasheed returned from an enforced exile abroad after his deputy Solih's unexpected victory in September .
Solih said he expected Saturday's poll to return a strong legislature led by his MDP. Nasheed is expected to wield considerable influence in any new government .
He cast his ballot in Male , but made no comment.
- No complaints - The opposition coalition that helped Solih win has since come apart, with constituent parties going their separate ways for Saturday's election .
Solih has however made it clear that he wants an MDP-led government .
""I want to stress that I would like the next parliament to be made up of members who are familiar with our policies, and fully support it,"" Solih told a campaign rally on Thursday night.
Nasheed was jailed for 13 years on a controversial terrorism charge when Yameen was in power. However, the conviction was overturned last year after the presidency changed.
Election commissioner Ahmed Shareef told reporters there had been no complaints of irregularities in the runup to the vote .
Voting took place for overseas Maldivians in neighbouring India and Sri Lanka , as well as London .
Former president Yameen was not a candidate, but his Progressive Party of Maldives was seen as the main challenger to the MDP.
Last week, the High Court ordered authorities to lift a freeze on Yameen's bank accounts holding about $6.5 million . But it said a money laundering case against him would proceed.
Yameen received the payments just before he lost his re-election bid in September . Since then, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions quashed.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before Solih won the presidential election on a pledge to end corruption in the country best known for its luxury tourism. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Britain has begun issuing passports with the words "" European Union "" removed from the front cover -- despite Brexit being delayed and its political leaders deadlocked over how to extricate the country from the bloc.
The interior ministry said Saturday that a longstanding decision to start introducing passports without reference to the EU had gone ahead from March 30, the day after the original date for Brexit .
Prime Minister Theresa May has delayed leaving the bloc after 46 years of membership amid stubborn opposition in parliament to the divorce deal she finalised with European leaders in November .
MPs have overwhelmingly rejected the agreement three times.
Ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday, she was forced to ask them for another extension, until June 30, to prevent Britain departing with no deal at the end of next week.
But with EU heads growing increasingly impatient at the political paralysis in Westminster, they could offer just a shorter postponement -- or a longer period of up to a year.
The other 27 members must give unanimous backing to any extension.
May is trying to break the parliamentary gridlock by striking a compromise deal with the main Labour opposition .
Senior ministers have spent several days negotiating with its leaders, but there were signs Friday that talks were stalling after Labour complained of no ""real change or compromise"".
British finance minister Philip Hammond nonetheless struck an optimistic tone at a meeting Saturday of European finance ministers in Bucharest , telling reporters there were ""no red lines"" in the ongoing discussions.
""I expect we will reach some form of agreement ,"" he predicted.
- 'Restore national identity' - In an apt sign of the befuddling circumstances around Brexit , Britain's interior ministry confirmed that some newly-issued passports now omit references to the EU atop the cover while others still bear the bloc's name.
It said the discrepancy was due to an attempt to save public money and insisted both designs would be ""equally valid for travel"".
""In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value for the taxpayer, passports that include the words ' European Union ' will continue to be issued for a short period,"" a spokeswoman added.
British passports have become ensnared in the country's Brexit divisions after the government announced in 2017 it would return to traditional blue passports ""to restore national identity"".
The travel documents had dark blue covers from 1921, but Britain switched to burgundy from 1988, in common with other passports in what was then the European Community.
Brexit backers are thrilled by the highly symbolic change, while those who support remaining in the bloc have mocked their excitement.
Last year it emerged that Franco-Dutch company Gemalto had won the contract to make the new blue passports, prompting fury from Brexit campaigners and more ridicule from Remainers that a British company was not chosen.
The new production contract is to begin in October 2019 , with the passports currently being issued without reference to the EU on them still in the burgundy colour.
- 'Listen to suggestions' - Whether Britain will have left the bloc by then is uncertain.
Many of May 's Conservative colleagues are vociferously opposed to her outreach to Labour , while hardline Brexiteers remain implaccably opposed to her deal.
Hammond, who backed Remain in Britain's 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible, urged his divided party to show flexibility.
""We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions,"" he said.
Labour is pushing for a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU that includes participation in a customs union.
May has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States .
Labour's home affairs spokeswoman Diane Abbott said Saturday her team must compromise.
""The government perhaps has to show a little more flexibility than it seems to have done so far,"" she told the BBC. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

New Delhi, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : India insisted Saturday that debris from its anti-satellite missile test was not a danger to the International Space Station, in a rebuff to criticism from the US space agency.
India has been on the defensive following the March 27 test that NASA branded a ""terrible thing"" that had created new dangers for astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
""The mission had been designed in a away that debris decays very fast and that minimal debris goes up,"" G. Satheesh Reddy, head of India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation told reporters.
""There was a risk for 10 days and we have crossed that period,"" he told a press conference.
""As per our simulations, there were no possibilities of hitting the International Space Station with debris from the satellite,"" he added.
NASA chief Jim Bridenstine last week condemned India 's destruction of the satellite as a ""terrible thing"" that created 400 pieces of orbital debris, or ""space junk"".
The danger from ""space junk"" is not that it falls to Earth but that it collides with orbiting satellites .
Even the smallest piece of debris travelling at great speeds can put a satellite out of action.
The Indian satellite was destroyed at a relatively low altitude of 300 kilometers (180 miles), 120 kilometres below the ISS and most orbiting satellites .
Bridenstine and other space experts also said the risk from the Indian debris would dissipate as much of it would burn up as it entered the atmosphere.
The US military tracks objects in space to predict the collision risk for the ISS and satellites . They are currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters.
These includes about 10,000 pieces of space debris, of which nearly 3,000 were created by a Chinese anti-satellite test.
India has hailed the test as a sign that it is a space power. Only the United States , Russia and China had previously carried out successful anti-satellite missile strikes in space."

Khartoum, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Thousands of Sudanese demonstrators marched in Khartoum Saturday, many reaching the army headquarters for the first time since deadly protests against President Omar al-Bashir erupted last year, witnesses said.
Chanting ""One Army , One People,"" the protesters rallied in the capital's streets, following a call by organisers to march on the army headquarters.
Protests have rocked the east African country since December , with angry crowds accusing Bashir's government of mismanaging the economy that has led to soaring food prices and regular shortages of fuel and foreign Currency .
On February 22, the veteran leader imposed a nationwide state of emergency to quell the protests after an initial crackdown failed to rein in protesters.
Since the emergency rule came into effect, protests have been largely confined to the capital and its twin city of Omdurman , but organisers had called for widespread rallies and a march on the army headquarters on Saturday.
April 6 was chosen for the nationwide rallies as it was the day of a 1985 uprising that toppled the then regime of president Jaafar Nimeiri.
Before the demonstrations began, security forces deployed in large numbers in key Khartoum squares and in Omdurman , across the Nile.
""There's a heavy security deployment where the protesters were to gather for the march , but they still came out and are chanting anti-government slogans,"" a witness told AFP without revealing his name for security reasons.
Witnesses said plainclothes security agents were preventing even passers-by from reaching downtown areas.
Shops and markets in downtown Khartoum were ordered shut before the march by security agents, according to onlookers.
""Those walking in groups were immediately detained or asked to return to their homes by security forces,"" another onlooker said.
In recent days, activists have been circulating leaflets urging residents to participate in Saturday's march , several residents said.
The protest movement was initially led by the Sudanese Professionals Association, but later several political parties including the main opposition National Umma Party threw their support behind it.
Analysts say the movement has emerged as the biggest challenge yet to Bashir's three-decade rule.
The veteran leader has remained defiant however, and has introduced tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested.
Officials say 31 people have died in protest related violence so far, but Human Rights Watch has put the death toll at 51 including children and medics."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The UK Home Office has said that it began issuing passports without the word ""the European Union "" written on them despite Brexit being delayed.
The United Kingdom has changed the color of its passports to burgundy red in 1998 in line with the EU design. However, the UK Home Office announced in 2017 that it would bring back UK 's dark blue cover design starting from October 2019 .
""Burgundy passports that no longer include the words ' European Union ' on the front cover were introduced from 30 March 2019 . In order to use leftover stock and achieve best value for the taxpayer, passports that include the words ' European Union ' will continue to be issued for a short period after this date ,"" the Home Office spokesperson said, as quoted by the Independent newspaper.
The authorities have noted that both designs of the passports are valid for traveling.
""There will be no difference for British citizens whether they are using a passport that includes the words European Union , or a passport that does not. Both designs will be equally valid for travel ,"" the spokesperson added.
The UK government and Brussels reached a divorce deal late last year, but the UK parliament has refused to back the agreement and cannot agree on any alternative measures. The country was supposed to leave the bloc on March 29 but missed the deadline. The European Union gave London until April 12 to either come up with an alternative solution or leave without a deal on that day. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

GENEVA, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The World Health Organization (WHO), celebrates World Health Day each year on April 7th.
World Health Day is a chance to celebrate health and remind world leaders that everyone should be able to access the health care they need, when and where they need it.
The WHO's campaign for 2019 is focusing on ''Universal Health Coverage'' and ensuring that individuals across the world have access to the care that they need when they need it.
According to WHO, At least half of the world 's population still do not have full coverage of essential health services. About 100 million people are still being pushed into extreme poverty (defined as living on 1.90 USD or less a day) because they have to pay for health care. Over 800 million people (almost 12% of the world 's population) spent at least 10% of their household budgets to pay for health care. All UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.
This year's campaign aims to improve understanding of universal health coverage and the importance of Primary health care as its foundation and to spur action from individuals, policy-makers and health-care workers to make universal health care a reality for everyone.
Advocacy events will be held around the world to fuel the momentum of the #HealthForAll movement and to highlight our goal of achieving a fairer, healthier world � in which no one is left behind.
The focus will be on equity and solidarity � on raising the bar for health for everyone, everywhere by addressing gaps in services, and leaving no one behind.
Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. To make health for all a reality, governments need to invest in quality, accessible primary health care. Health workers need to care and advocate for patients and educate them on how to get and stay healthy. Individuals and communities need to be empowered to take care of their own health."

Mexico City, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Argentina great Diego Maradona said he will quit his job at Mexican second-division club Dorados at the end of the season over perceived refereeing bias against his team.

Maradona, who won the 1986 World Cup with Argentina , said he would ask for a meeting with the club president to notify him of his decision and the reason behind it.
At the root of his anger on Friday was a ""very clear"" penalty that was not awarded to his side.
""Do you know why the referee didn't give it? Maradona asked reporters. ""Because you're going to say tomorrow that it's because it's Maradona team.""Dorados extended their unbeaten run in the league to eight games and sit third in the standings, having lost to leaders Atletico San Luis in December 's Apertura final."

Minnesota House votes to allow driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants,thehill.com,Tal Axelrod,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437701-minnesota-house-votes-to-allow-drivers-licenses-for-undocumented,"Minnesota House votes to allow driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants By Tal Axelrod - 04/06/19 12:49 PM EDT
The Minnesota House voted Friday to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses, setting the stage for a confrontation with the GOP-controlled state Senate.
The 74-52 vote marked a victory for the state Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party and Gov. Tim Walz
Some Republicans in the state's upper chamber say the bill welcomes undocumented immigration and could lead to voter fraud. ADVERTISEMENT
""Immigrants, whether they are documented or undocumented, are Minnesotans. They are part of the fabric of our communities,” said House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler (D), according to the paper. ""It is time that we helped take away this shadow of not having a driver’s license.""
""Minnesota shouldn’t be in the business of incentivizing illegal behavior, and by allowing illegal and undocumented immigrants access to driver’s licenses, that’s exactly what our state would be doing,"" state Sen. Bill Ingebrigtsen (R) contended.
To assuage Republican concerns, Democrats included a stipulation in the legislation mandating the licenses would carry explicit warnings that they cannot be used for proof of identification at polling stations. Minnesota has no photo ID requirements at polling stations.
Should the legislation survive the GOP-controlled state Senate and secure Walz's signature, Minnesota would become the 13th state to give licenses to residents who cannot provide proof of their legal status.
Immigrants were able to get driver’s licenses in Minnesota regardless of their legal status until 2003, when the law was changed in light of post-9/11 security concerns, the Star Tribune noted.
Proponents of the bill said it would help restore the opportunity for undocumented migrants to live productive lives in the state.
""It’s common sense,"" state Rep. Samantha Vang (D) told the Star Tribune. ""This will allow people to simply open a bank account, to drive safely on the road to their jobs, to their school.""
""This is about dignity, it is about respect, it is about inclusion,"" state Rep. Mohamud Noor, a refugee from Somalia, added."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The administration of US President Donald Trump is considering the possibility of cutting diplomatic personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq as soon as this and next year, the Foreign Policy magazine reported, citing US officials.
The publication's sources clarified that the number of US diplomats stationed in Kabul is planned to be halved by 2020 . According to a plan that has yet to be approved, between 20 and 30 US diplomats in Iraq may lose their positions this year, and another 30-50 percent of the staff of US diplomatic missions in Baghdad and Erbil may be cut next year.
According to the magazine, these plans are consistent with Washington 's intention to reduce military presence in the middle East and South Asia in order to prepare for the so-called era of great-power competition with China and Russia .
""We are regularly hearing from Africa that we are outnumbered by the Chinese diplomats working on economic or other issues 4 or 5 to 1. We cannot continue to concentrate all that money in Afghanistan and Iraq ,"" a senior US State Department official told the publication.
The US forces entered Afghanistan in late 2001, soon after the September 11 attack in the United States . The military operation was aimed against al-Qaeda terrorist group (banned in Russia ), whose members the United States believed to be in Afghanistan . The Taliban government of Afghanistan was overthrown as a result of the operation, but it regrouped and remained insurgent.
In 2018 , the US administration presented a new strategy for action in South Asia , which includes more active participation in the settlement of the Afghan conflict by the countries of the region. In addition, the possibility of withdrawing or substantially reducing the military presence of US troops in Afghanistan is being discussed. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
