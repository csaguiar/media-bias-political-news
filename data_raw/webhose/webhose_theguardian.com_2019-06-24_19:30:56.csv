It happens often that teams stack in defensively and play the counter attack against Barca. There still is no plan B when this happens and the opposition are well organized. It could just as easily become a loss than a win when the defense isn't up shutting down the counters. In addition, to Cillessen playing poorly the field players just aren't moving the ball quickly enough. This team needs a renovation for sure.
When you have players like Suarez (when on form), David Villa, Neymar the defense is made to mark more than just Messi in the middle. Otherwise, you get what we had today. Defense clogging the middle, putting 2 men on Messi and leaving it for the others. It certainly worked for Valencia today."

Absurdly, he also happened to score considerably more goals in the CL and league than the entire rest of his team (aside from Suarez) put together, while incidentally scoring more than anyone else in any other league and the Champions league.
He will win all the personal accolades, but I don't think he really cares. He deserved more this season, and sometimes, just sometimes, it would be nice if someone lent a hand and bailed Barca out (think Neymar va PSG), instead of it having to be him every single time.

Abbott’s Royal Commission into the Unions set out to do this not only to Bill Shorten but also to destroy the legacy of Julia Gillard. There was an ongoing brainwashing of the population to ‘kill Bill’ which intensified at the election with what could be described as subliminal advertising by Palmer and the LNP across digital venues such as the SMH and even on games sites. The Murdoch media also used it’s propaganda machine to focus on this ‘shifty Bill’ brainwashing technique. Anning and Palmer flooded social media with these types of memes and liesThey also used it on Turnbull. The educated masses did not buy this. When looking rationally at the person of Bill Shorten in comparison with the likes of Morrison who had actually been sacked from a top job and did not articulate clear policies, there is no rational reason for the distrust and hatred directed towards Bill Shorten. This is the way the LNP , Murdoch and the likes of Palmer and Anning will continue to operate and it is a huge danger in an unthinking, uneducated and gullible population."

Barack Obama once described it as “either this is the largest building in the world or the largest tax scam in the world”. That was in 2009. The building was Ugland House in George Town on the Caribbean island of Gran Cayman.
Ugland House was then home to 18,857 corporations. And Ugland House is soon to be home to another one, along with the profits of 43 Australian hospitals, unless Treasurer Josh Frydenberg blocks the deal on grounds of national interest.
No sooner had the Northern Beaches Hospital in Sydney been built in a $2 billion taxpayer-funded deal, its operator Healthscope opted to sell it, along with another 42 Australian hospitals also subsidised by taxpayers, to a shadowy group which has a large presence in tax havens.
We say shadowy because neither the directors of Healthscope nor their slick takeover suitors from Brookfield have agreed to respond to questions about who and what will control these essential Australian assets after the Brookfield takeover.
But there is now strong evidence that Healthscope’s hospitals may be held by a vehicle in the Cayman Islands, indeed a vehicle whose address is Ugland House. This except is from the Implementation Deed for the deal:

Forcing continuation of Gillard Labor's GREAT BIG NEW CARBON TAX while dumping abbott’s Emissions Reduction Fund (Direct Action after the Budget cuts) could have CUT the forecast deficit by as much as $19 BILLION, according to Ross Garnaut. Or if you prefer, Reputex found Direct Action could cost three times more than carbon pricing and may be completely ineffective. As the abbott Misgovernment soon de-funded that non-policy, we may assume that it agreed. Tony Burke talking of promoting it after Labor’s 2019 election defeat highlights policy cluelessness.
Thus a tax on polluting business was reversed to being a big personal taxpayer subsidy to both polluters and those lavishly paid to supposedly sequester pollution.

Coal should simply stand on its own two feet, no more subsidies for coal or renewables (which should be phased out at the same rate). The savings should go to research on economical ways to guarantee energy supply and reduce global warming (which carbon emissions reduction would be a large part of).
Banning coal mining in Australia resulting in it it being purchased elsewhere is ridiculous. There will always be demand for high quality low sulphur coal so these mines should survive (which may not include Adani).
There should be government support (e.g. streamlined approvals and research funding) for future mining and recycling operations of the minerals needed to support expected growth in renewables such as cobalt, copper nickel and rare earths which will probably boom as renewables become more efficient.
Getting in early may reduce the adverse effects of the 2 speed economy caused by the last mining boom and should also provide jobs for coal miners to transition to as lower quality coal becomes less competitive."

There has been nothing but ongoing playing the man with the ‘Kill Bill’ strategy by the Liberals. This campaign strengthened at election time with the subliminal style advertising so that doubt about ‘shifty Bill’ and lying memes of the alt right and the propaganda of the Murdoch Press penetrated the consciousness of the population. As I look at Bill Shorten I see no rational or logical reason he was in any way worse than Morrison who had been sacked from Tourism Australia and used slogans that were meaningless. This playing and denigrating the ‘man’ or ‘woman’ is the way the LNP campaigns and over a very long period of time. Albo will have the same strategy used against him and it won’t be long away. This will happen to any Opposition leader who threatens the big conglomerates behind the LNP.

The first symptom of the illness began probably as long ago as eight years in the form of the carbon ""tax"" that was later confessed to be a lie for no other reason than ""brutal retail politics"".
The media had every chance to nip the illness in the bud during those early years of the malaise, but alas chose instead to completely ignore the beginnings of the malignant tumor that soon began to spread unchecked.
As democracy's health began teetering between bad days and extremely bad days, the malignancy eventually spread to become a mass of huge lies that finally culminated in its inevitable demise.
Instead of an admission of failing to face the symptoms head on in the early stages, the caretaker media have since continued to bury their heads in the sand, insisting instead that it was all the fault of an ineffective political antibody in the ALP that was left to ""lick it's wounds"" and ponder over ""reasons why it failed"".
If democracy is to have a chance of ever being reborn in Australia, we are going to have to ensure in future that the ones responsible for it's recent demise are up to the task at hand and the harmful media pathogens completely removed from within."

Yes, fear of mining job losses played a role in the hunter and qld. But the Coalition have been a complete mess and Labor should have won. They lost largely because of their leader Bill. He was ambitious to a fault and people hadn't forgotten the demise of Rudd, then Gillard, then Rudd... Who was the individual in the background on the phone and the common denominator in all these leadership spills? Bill.
His patronising ""big end of town"" comments, his forced Cheshire cat grin as he iced points in interviews and lack of genuine relatable moments - with the exception, the defence of attacks on his mum - meant Scomo, the league and church loving guy that married his high school sweetheart and did a Bradbury to become leader, was infinitely easier.

I have only met him once - that was on the steps of parliament house in early 1999 where we were holding a protest against the proposed Howard GST on relocatable retirement homes.
Anthony spoke at some length - but from opposition you can do bugger all. However Howard had forgot that in these Retirement Villages the majority of those retirees vote Liberal. Those silly Prix still voted for him at the next election.
Along with a few Labor MP's there was also Wayne Swann. After Anthony and Wayne both spoke, I was delegated [dragooned] into speaking in reply and tasked with thanking both of them.
As you might imagine - being unaccustomed to speaking impromptu in public [Heh! Heh!] - I sallied forth waxing lyrical as they say until...
I glanced down at the ground in front of me - and there is a frigging CH 9 cameraman lying on his stomach with his camera facing up to me - that momentarily unnerved me for once.
For months thereafter whenever I went back down to Sydney the mates would say:
""Yairs, saw you on the Telebishion [sic] with your greasy Communist mates Albanese and Swan as you pissed in their pockets. See you still continue to bash the Howard government in the Daily Telegraph as well."" - that was a standing joke Alice.
It is notable that all the Labor MP's there in support of us that day were Labor Left. The right I personally believe secretly supported Howard's GST.
Anyhoo we all shook hands and went into parliament where later during QT our MP got chucked out under Section 94A and we subsequently got chucked out of the Gallery, in the middle of a Costello speech.
One thing I have always given Costello is that he is a deadly, entertaining debater.
As for Anthony? Rots of Ruck - you are going to need it - move over to the right and you get neutralised by losing the Labor Left vote - this time to a 'write in' candidate known to election scrutineers as:
Oblique / NOTA

Maurizio Sarri and Mauricio Pochettino are both on Juventus’s wishlist as they continue to search for a new manager to replace Massimiliano Allegri.
The Turin club’s hierarchy are looking at the current Chelsea and Tottenham managers as well as Lazio’s Simone Inzaghi, but have not ruled out other candidates.
Massimiliano Allegri leaves Juventus as one of their great managers Read more
Allegri announced on 17 May that he was leaving the club after five years in charge, having won five Serie A titles but also having failed to secure the Champions League title. Juventus, who bought Cristiano Ronaldo for €100m last summer, are looking to take the next step up at European level, and believe Sarri, Pochettino and Inzaghi are all capable of delivering that progress.
Sarri is just 10 months into a two-year Chelsea contract, meaning Juventus would have to pay £5m to secure him – unless the Italian is sacked before they make their move. Sarri has faced sustained criticism from Chelsea fans for his playing style, despite steering his side to a third-place finish and to the Europa League final. Speaking last week , Sarri said he would rather be sacked immediately than have his Chelsea future hinge on Wednesday’s result in Baku.
“Ten months of work, and then I have to play everything in 90 minutes?” said Sarri. “It’s not right. It’s not the right way. You’re either happy about my work or you’re not happy. I have no contact with other clubs at the moment.”
The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. Pochettino, who is preparing his side for Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool, admitted this month he would consider leaving Tottenham in the summer if he does not believe in the plan of the chairman, Daniel Levy, for the next phase of the club’s development.
The Argentinian, who has worked on a restricted budget due to the new stadium project, said Spurs must now “operate in a different way … give me different tools. We need to create a realistic plan to develop in the next year, five years … if not, our destiny is to crash.”

The beauty of the Giro is, it isn’t normally controllable, which makes it much more exciting, so well done Carapaz and well done Yates, written off by many, but this is the Giro, who knows who will win with a very tough last week."

To do this with today's technology requires batteries. This strategy would require mineral resources that do not exist in sufficient quantity. World cobalt, lithium, nickel, copper would run out in a matter of years, according to the USGS, and rare earth elements are predominantly controlled by China. The number of drones and other electric ""toys"" being manufactured would reduce this timescale further. Wind turbines, PV panels, infrastructure, new cars etc take energy to produce.
I don't know about you Greta, but I believe that while politicians worldwide faced with short electoral cycles have any hand in creating long-term plans, they will choose self-interest first ie being re-elected over ambitious carbon transformations.
Is it time for something like a Citizens Assembly to form world policy to direct us all away from extinction? Randomly chosen people worldwide to be given a mandate by a world accepted organisation such as the UN ? Would countries be prepared to accept the will of people worldwide to solve this problem together, instead of self interested own country economic solutions ?"

She tends to lose early in lower tier events. For Serena, she is a serious contender - she just needs to make the 2nd week and she’s a threat. She can play herself into contention with some good early round matches. Roger can go deep, he’s still a great clay courter, but I worry about 7 matches over 5 sets. The last thing he needs to do is overplay before Wimbledon where he still has his best chance for another major. The one great thing about Roger though is he knows how his body reacts to a lot of matches."

Why there is no accounting for a large slice of luck in the Premier League | Greg Wood,www.theguardian.com,StatesideAussie,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/may/25/why-there-is-no-accounting-for-luck-in-the-premier-league#129458887,"As to be expected, the story has provoked quite a discussion on the issue of ""luck"". Some believe in luck, others don't.
But, surely, whether an event is due to ""luck"" or not depends on whose perspective you take. To illustrate this, take the example of a key player (a so-called ""match-winner"") who, for some reason completely within his control, is unable to play in one or more key matches. Perhaps he was suspended for a wilful, obvious red card. Perhaps he was suspended for doping, or convicted and jailed for a serious crime, or injured while out boozing. Those are all things that were completely within the player's own ability to control and avoid, so from his perspective, this is not due to ""luck"".
But what about the impact of this event on others? Most definitions of ""luck"" define it as an event which affects a person's interests, but was beyond their control to cause or prevent. From the perspective of this player's opponents (either direct opponents that play his team while he is not available, or other opponents who somehow benefit from his absence), this definitely is ""lucky"". While for his own teammates, it is definitely bad luck -- they are now without one of their best players.
As for xG, I think it has value in scouting or assessing individuals, relative to their peers. But, as with all statistical metrics, it is open to abuse, misunderstanding and subjective influences, meaning it is flawed. xG basically measures (or attempts to measure) the statistical probability of a particular shot actually scoring. According to one of its pioneers, Michael Caley (who writes for the site mentioned in the article, FiveThirtyEight): ""The idea is to quantify the likelihood of a goal being scored from a particular shot attempt (or other scoring chance).""
This probability is calculated using a number of inputs. Caley again: ""Where was the shot attempted from? What sort of pass assisted the shot? With what body part was the shot taken? Did the attacker dribble past his defender before trying the shot? How fast was the attacking move that led to the shot? Was the shot off a rebound or from a set play? All of these factors clearly influence the likelihood of scoring a goal. By aggregating this information into a model, I can estimate the likelihood of scoring different shooting chances in a match or over a season.”
So, for any given shot on goal, xG calculates the probability of it actually being scored. For example, if the xG for a particular shot is 0.5, there is a 50% chance of it going in: in other words, you would expect it to be scored about half the time.
This is then used to rate the performance of players: how well (or badly) a player actually converts chances, compared to the xG value of each chance. A player who scores 80% of the time, from chances with an xG of 50%, is exceeding expectations. A player who pots only 10% of similar chances is performing below expectations, while a player who sinks them 50% of the time is merely doing as should be expected.
One of the potential issues, though, is whether different statisticians use the same data and methods when calculating xG. There are not many sources for this stat (which are then regurgitated endlessly by other sites), but my research indicates the data and/or methods are not consistent. That is, for any given xG metric (for a match, player, team, season etc), the value may be different depending on who calculated it.
In that sense, it suffers from the same underlying flaw as the ""Possession"" stat: because they are ""stats"", people treat them as if they are incontrovertible, provable, objective, scientific ""facts"". Yet they are from that.
In football, possession can be (and is) measured in different ways which produce very different results, and it's not obvious whether any particular method is empirically superior. The statistic may be presented as factual, but the key decisions about which data to use, how to measure it, and how to analyse it, are inherently subjective.
Some statisticians measure possession as a percentage of completed passes: if there are 500 completed passes in a match, and Team A were responsible for 400 of them, then it had 80% possession, while the other guys had just 20%.
Others measure the amount of time between changes in possession: a team gains possession when one of its players touches the ball, and retains possession until either the other guys get the ball, or the ball goes out of play.
These two methods can produce significantly different figures -- yet more and more, possession is bandied around as an iconic and critical measure of a team's performance. How many times do you hear a losing manager, player, pundit or fan say, ""We dominated possession and didn't deserve to lose.""?"
