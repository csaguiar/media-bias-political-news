Left-winger Cher flips out at Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders for saying felons should be able to vote from jail,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/left-winger-cher-actually-flips-out-at-bernie-sanders-on-twitter-for-wanting-to-let-felons-vote-from-jail,"Left-wing actress and singer Cher has no problem speaking her mind, and by all accounts she's no fan of President Donald Trump , Republicans, or conservatives in general.
But lately Cher has been tweeting some very un-Cher-like things.
There was, of course, her tweet earlier this month railing against Trump's suggestion that illegal immigrants should be sent to sanctuary cities , which supposedly welcome them with open arms and protect them from authorities.
She then offered the following observation:
Trump hilariously responded, saying "" I finally agree with @Cher! ""
It's also worth pointing out that two years earlier Cher urged Americans to take ""a Dreamer"" into their homes and said she was ready to do the same :
What else did Cher tweet? Which brings us to Sen. Bernie Sanders — the front-runner for Democratic presidential nomination — and his controversial declaration that felons should be able to vote while in jail , including terrorists like the Boston Marathon bomber.
Cher — in a now-deleted tweet — wasn't having it.
""Does Bernie Sanders really believe [people] in prison who are murderers!? rapists!? child molesters!? BOSTON BOMBERS ... STILL DESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE!?"" she wrote Tuesday.
When a fellow leftist questioned the singer's tweet, Twitchy noted yet another deleted post of Cher's which read in part: ""EXCUSE THE FK OUT OF ME IF I DON'T FEEL WHITE, BLACK, BROWN CONVICTED CHILD MOLESTERS, MURDERERS OR RAPISTS STILL IN PRISON SHOULD KEEP RIGHT TO VOTE‼️""
The outlet also said she deleted a Tuesday tweet that read, ""This site is not worth it at the moment‼️ I'm hated on Trump['s] side ... and misunderstood by what I thought was my side. Do I screw up sometimes[?] Yeah. Throw the first stone.""
And don't get too excited about Cher crossing party lines anytime soon. When another Twitter user said her criticism of Sanders was a ""lucid moment,"" Cher returned fire as only Cher can: ""Excuse me, my lucid moments have nothing to do with you!! ... F*** you, Trump, and the Russian horse he rode to the presidency on. We have nothing in common.""

Hillary Clinton says President Trump would have been indicted by Mueller if he were 'any other person',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-president-trump-would-have-been-indicted-by-mueller-if-he-were-any-other-person,"Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton says President Donald Trump would have been indicted for obstruction of justice over the findings by special counsel Robert Mueller if he were ""any other person,"" insisting the office he holds provided cover.
What are the details? ""I think there's enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted,"" Clinton said Tuesday at the Time 100 Summit when asked for her reaction to the Mueller report. ""But because of the rule in the Justice Department that you can't indict a sitting president, the whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress.""
Clinton went on to say she interpreted the report to be a call to action for Congress to investigate the president and his 2016 campaign, but cautioned against immediately calling for impeachment.
""I have a weird, personal history with impeachment,"" the former first lady said, which was met with laughter from the audience.
""And not what you're thinking,"" she continued, referring to the impeachment of her husband 20 years ago.
""I was a very, very young staff attorney on the Nixon impeachment inquiry back in 1974,"" she explained. ""And it took several years of slow acquisition and publication of information to show the extent of corruption in that White House.""
Clinton warned against Democrats immediately calling for Trump's impeachment, saying it shouldn't be a partisan matter, and added, ""We want to show the American people that we take constitutional duties seriously. You don't put impeachment on the table as the only option and say we're going to get there no matter [what], which is what happened in 1999,"" Newsweek reported.
Anything else? Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Trump, reacted to Clinton's comments Wednesday morning on "" Fox & Friends ,"" saying, ""There's a woman who really obstructed justice,"" referring to the former secretary of state's email scandal.
""The president didn't delete 33,000 emails, he didn't have somebody smash up telephones, and he didn't have someone wipe out a server and bleach-bit it, among the few things that she did,"" Giuliani continued, adding that President Trump was innocent of the underlying crime investigated by Mueller, and did not obstruct justice by defending himself."
Iowa's longest-serving Republican lawmaker leaves the party over President Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/iowas-longest-serving-republican-lawmaker-leaves-the-party-over-president-trump,"Iowa's longest-serving Republican legislator has left the party, saying he cannot stomach its support of President Donald Trump.
What are the details? State Rep. Andy McKean — who has been a Republican officeholder for 35 years — announced Tuesday that after nearly a half century as a registered Republican, he can no longer carry its banner because of America's current commander in chief.
""With the 2020 presidential election looming on the horizon, I feel, as a Republican, that I need to be able to support the standard-bearer of our party. Unfortunately, that is something I am unable to do,"" McKean said during a news conference in Des Moines.
""I believe that it is just a matter of time before our party pays a heavy price for President Trump's reckless spending, and short-sighted financial policies, his erratic, destabilizing foreign policy, and his disregard for environmental concerns,"" he explained.
McKean also expressed his disdain for the president's behavior, saying, ""He sets, in my opinion, a poor example for the nation, and particularly for our children by personally insulting — often in a crude and juvenile fashion — those who disagree with him, being a bully at a time when we are attempting to discourage bullying, his frequent disregard for the truth, and his willingness to ridicule or marginalize people for their appearance, ethnicity, or disability.
""I believe that his actions have coarsened political discourse, have resulted in unprecedented divisiveness, and have created an atmosphere that is a breeding ground for hateful rhetoric and actions,"" the lawmaker continued. ""Some would excuse this behavior as 'telling it like it is' and the 'new normal.' If this is the new normal, I want no part of it. Unacceptable behavior should be called out for what it is, and Americans of all parties should insist on something far better in the leader of their country and the free world.""
After giving his reasoning, McKean said he had made the ""very difficult decision"" to leave the party and become a Democrat. The lawmaker acknowledged that making the switch would be a disappointment to many Republican friends and colleagues.
""However, the time comes where you have to be true to yourself, and follow the dictates of your conscience, and for me, that time has come,"" he said.
Anything else?
McKean was first elected in 1978, serving seven consecutive terms in the House, and two in the Senate before taking a 15-year hiatus from the Legislature. He returned to Des Moines in 2016, and said he has found himself concerned with Republican priorities ever since he's been back."
"Vegan, feminist cafe boasting 18 percent ‘man tax’ goes out of business",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/vegan-feminist-cafe-that-made-men-pay-more-is-closing,"An Australian vegan, feminist cafe is closing after opening in 2017 with much fanfare.
The cafe, Handsome Her , declared that upon opening, it would charge male patrons 18 percent more than they would charge women for the same exact service — a "" gender tax "" designed to get people talking about the wage gap. The tax, according to NPR , was optional.
Three hard and fast rules of the cafe included, ""Women have priority seating,"" ""Men will be charged an 18% premium to reflect the gender pay gap (2016) which is donated to a women's service,"" and ""Respect goes both ways.""
The business made a Facebook announcement revealing that it would be closing its doors on Sunday.
What did the restaurant say? A portion of the post read , ""A few months ago we found ourselves sitting under the Southern sky ablaze with stars, on land that has been owned by women for 40 years. We were invited there by women we met at Handsome Her.""
""These women lived wildly in times very different to now,"" the post continued. ""Whilst we sipped our tea we listened to stories from the 70's of underground meet-ups to create and distribute newsletters, to organise protests and change the world.""
""We heard about women forming patrols and learning self-defence to protect themselves after they came out and were targeted with brutality,"" the post added. ""Stories of mass imprisonment, rounding up horses, leaving families and forming new ones, living on the land. We laughed and cried and felt held by this open and loving community as they shared their pasts with us.""
The cafe plans to throw a goodbye party as its doors close.
The event, according to the cafe's Facebook page, will be a ""pay as you feel"" event and will benefit an anti-human trafficking fund.
The owners wrote, ""While it is a shame to lose the physical space (and we understand how essential it is for women and lesbians to hold space), we leave knowing that the communities we have made transcend the trendy vegan café on Sydney Rd, Brunswick. We look forward to continuing Handsome Her in a variety of other, more creative ways and expanding our efforts to drive change with flexibility and mobility throughout Australia.""

"Nicole Kidman says that her friends tease her for believing in God, raising her children in the church — but she isn't deterred",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/a-list-actress-says-that-her-friends-tease-her-for-believing-in-god-raising-her-children-in-the-church,"Actress Nicole Kidman says that her friends often give her a lot of flak her over her faith and the fact that she raises her children in the church.
What are the details? In a recent interview with Vanity Fair , the Oscar-winning actress said that faith is an integral part of her life.
""A lot of my friends tease me,"" the 51-year-old actress admitted.
Australian-born Kidman, who is married to country music star Keith Urban, said that she and her husband take their two daughters, 10-year-old Sunday Rose and 8-year-old Faith Margaret, to church regularly.
""That's how we are raising our children,"" she said. ""Keith has his own beliefs, but he comes, too. I had a very Catholic grandmother, and I was raised praying, so that had a massive impact.""
Kidman, who was formerly married to Scientologist actor Tom Cruise, also added that she isn't afraid of raising her daughters to believe in God, and encourages them to question their faith if they feel compelled to do so.
""I wouldn't say it's absolutism, there's constant questioning,"" she said. ""I'm a willful, feisty girl. For me, it's very important that I don't have judgment. My dad would always say, 'Tolerance is the most important thing.'""
Anything else? In 2018, Kidman discussed the importance of her faith in an interview with Allure .
""I'm spiritual in the sense that I absolutely believe in God,"" she told the magazine.
The actress also explained how she once considered being a nun before she went into the entertainment business.
""I loved the idea of being a nun. Obviously, I did not choose to go that path, but I was very drawn to it,"" Kidman said.
When she was married to Cruise, she and her ex-husband adopted two children, Bella and Connor, who later became Scientologists.
In an interview with Australia's Who , Kidman said that she doesn't judge her older children — now 26 and 24 years old, respectively — or the path that they've chosen.
""They are adults,"" she said in a 2018 interview. ""They are able to make their own decisions. They have made choices to be Scientologists and, as a mother, it's my job to love them.
""And I am an example of that tolerance and that's what I believe — that no matter what your child does, the child has love and the child has to know there is available love and I'm open here. I think that's so important because if that is taken away from a child, to sever that in any child, in any relationship, in any family — I believe it's wrong,"" she insisted. ""So that's our job as a parent, to always offer unconditional love."""
"Convenience store clerk uses deadly force against robber. Now, he's being criminally charged. - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/virginia-clerk-charged-killing-robber,"A Richmond, Virginia, convenience store clerk is facing criminal charges after police say he shot and killed a man who robbed the store where he worked.
What are the details? According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch , Jeremy Simmons, 31, is facing charges of voluntary manslaughter and discharging a firearm in a public place after using deadly force to stop a man who robbed the store where he worked.
Police say that around 3 a.m. on Feb 2, 43-year-old Joseph Harris robbed the store where Simmons worked. In response, Simmons drew his personal firearm and began shooting at Harris, who quickly fled the store. Simmons then chased Harris out of the store and fired several more shots.
""During the robbery, Simmons fired several shots at Harris inside the store from his personal handgun. Simmons pursued Harris outside the store and fired several more shots as Harris fled the area,"" police said, according to WTVR .
Police discovered Harris' body on a nearby street shortly before 8 a.m. later that morning.
A Richmond grand jury formally indicted Simmons on the manslaughter and discharging a firearm charges this week.
Why does 'stand-your-ground' not apply? Although Virginia has not formally passed a ""stand-your-ground"" law — which says a person does not have a ""duty to retreat"" before using deadly force in self-defense — the Old Dominion has adopted the practice through judicial precedent.
However, laws that allow deadly force in self-defense — ""stand-you-ground"" laws allow for deadly self-defense everywhere , while ""castle doctrine"" laws permit deadly self-defense only in a person's home or yard — unequivocally say that deadly force can be used only in immediate danger. In Virginia's case, deadly force can be used only in response to an ""overt act indicative of imminent danger at the time.""
The question often then becomes: What is ""imminent danger"" and who defines it?
Using deadly force against someone who is running away, which is what police say happened in this case, is never viewed as justifiable self-defense — only criminal negligence."
President Trump meets with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in Oval Office to discuss potential bias from the social media platform,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-meets-with-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey,"President Donald Trump, a frequent tweeter himself, met with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in the Oval Office on Tuesday, CNN reported . Trump has repeatedly accused the social media platform of bias against his supporters.
What happened? Dorsey co-founded Twitter in 2006 and has been CEO between 2006 and 2008, and since 2015.
After the meeting, Trump tweeted, ""Great meeting this afternoon at the @WhiteHouse with @Jack from @Twitter . Lots of subjects discussed regarding their platform, and the world of social media in general. Look forward to keeping an open dialogue!""
Dorsey responded to Trump's tweet, thanking him for the discussion and saying, ""Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil.""
In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for Twitter said, ""Jack had a constructive meeting with the President of the United States today at the president's invitation. They discussed Twitter's commitment to protecting the health of the public conversation ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections and efforts underway to respond to the opioid crisis.""
What else? Earlier Tuesday, Trump had accused Twitter of ""playing political games,"" saying ""they don't treat me well as a Republican."" He also said it was ""hard for people to sign on"" and that Twitter was ""[c]onstantly taking people off list,"" which seemed to refer to his followers being deleted.
The Washington Post claimed, via an anonymous source who said the meeting was ""cordial,"" that Dorsey told Trump that his lost followers were part of the company's crackdown on spam and bot accounts.
Trump has raised these same accusations against Twitter in the past, including in October when he said that they had ""stifled growth"" and in July 2016 when he accused the company of ""'SHADOW BANNING' prominent Republicans."" In November , he accused Twitter, as well as Facebook and Google, of ""Collusion"" in ""favor of the Democrats."""
Watch: Home Depot co-founder makes the case against Americans 'glorifying socialism' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/home-depot-co-founder-anti-socialism,"Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus is pushing back against the spread of socialism in America, and he recently issued a video statement explaining ""why it pains [him] to see people in this country glorifying"" what's been proven to be a recipe for economic failure.
What are the details? Marcus starred in a new clip for the Job Creators Network — an organization he founded to educate people on the importance of economic freedom — as part of a campaign to fight the ongoing encroachment of socialist ideals in the U.S.
The businessman used his own success story as a testimonial to the benefits of a free market system, saying, ""When I co-founded The Home Depot in 1979, I'd just been fired and I was broke. There's no other country in the world that has a system where someone under these circumstances could turn a simple idea and hard work into a company that employs more than 400,000 people and has created thousands of successful millionaires.
""That's why it pains me to see people in this country glorifying socialism,"" he continued. ""Young people, especially, have been indoctrinated into believing that free enterprise is immoral because it enriches the greedy and oppresses the poor. Even the word capitalism isn't politically correct to use.""
Marcus went on to explain, ""The reality is that the free market system has created the biggest middle class population in the world, and while some may say socialism is well-intentioned, the fact is it robs people of their independence, their dignity, and their finances leading to government dependence, suppression of ideas, and lower standards of living for those under its thumb.""
""Support behind socialism continues to swell in our urban areas and academia, and even in the halls of Congress,"" the mogul warned.
Anything else? This isn't the first time Job Creators Network has hit out against socialist targets. The group made headlines earlier this year when it trolled Democratic socialist darling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) with a billboard in Times Square decrying her successful opposition to Amazon building an additional headquarters in New York City."
Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen told Tom Arnold that some of the crimes he confessed to for plea deal were 'a lie' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/former-trump-lawyer-cohen-told-tom-arnold-that-the-crimes-he-confessed-to-for-plea-deal-were-a-lie,"Recordings released by actor Tom Arnold reportedly reveal former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen telling Arnold that the crimes he confessed to in order to secure a plea deal with federal prosecutors were ""a lie.""
What did Cohen say? In the recordings. obtained by the Wall Street Journal , Cohen tells Arnold that he ""lost my business…my insurance, my bank accounts, all for what? All for what? Because Trump, you know, had an affair with a porn star? That's really what this is about.""
Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison and three years of supervised release for violating campaign finance laws with his handling of a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels.
Although Cohen had pleaded guilty to tax evasion, he told Arnold ""There is no tax evasion."" He also said that he lied when he pleaded guilty to understating his expenses and debts when applying for a home-equity line of credit worth half a million dollars. ""And the Heloc [home-equity line of credit]? I have an 18% loan-to-value on my home. How could there be a Heloc issue? How? Right?…It's a lie.""
Cohen's own lawyer, Lanny Davis, told the Wall Street Journal, ""Michael has taken responsibility for his crimes and will soon report to prison to serve his sentence. While he cannot change the past, he is making every effort to reclaim his life and do right by his family and country. He meant no offense by his statements.""
Current Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani responded to this development in a tweet, saying that ""[s]ince Cohen began composing for the Angry Democrats he has demonstrably lied under oath in his guilty plea and his testimony to Elijah 'I'll throw the book at you' Cummings.""
What about Arnold's recordings of Trump?
Arnold claimed last June to have tapes tapes of Trump, which would prove ""how incompetent he was."" However, if he did have these tapes, he has never released them.
Arnold also claimed at the same time that he and Cohen were planning on ""taking Trump down together."" However, Cohen responded in a tweet, saying that while he appreciates Arnold they ""did not discuss being on his show nor did we discuss @POTUS.""
Arnold is the ex-husband of comedian Roseanne Barr, who appeared on one season of ""The Apprentice."""
The US Navy is making it easier for its pilots to report UFOs,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/us-navy-pilots-report-ufos,"The U.S. Navy is coming up with new guidelines that will make it easier for pilots and Navy personnel to report sightings of unidentified flying objects.
It's not really about aliens While these new guidelines that encourage reporting of unidentified objects may excite believers in extraterrestrials, they have nothing to do with alien spacecraft sightings. Rather, the Navy is concerned about aircraft it doesn't know about entering U.S. military airspace.
In a statement to Politico , a spokesperson for the Navy explained, ""There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years.""
This is especially problematic now that drones have become popular. In December , a drone entered the airspace of London's Gatwick airport, causing panic and delays.
Being able to analyze these sightings could help to better detect the presence of hostile aircraft and other ""hazards to aviation safety."" These UFO sightings happen often enough, Politico reported, that Navy leadership believes they can no longer be ignored. The Navy told Politico in a statement that it ""takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report.""
The U.S. Air Force, the statement said, treats these reports similarly.
What else? The Navy also said that ""[f]or safety and security concerns,"" it was ""updating and formalizing the process by which reports of any such suspected incursions can be made to the cognizant authorities. A new message to the fleet that will detail the steps for reporting is in draft.""
An unnamed senior military official told CNN that some recent UFO sightings are actually classified military tests. This has been a common explanation for UFO sightings in the past, including the infamous 1947 crash at Roswell, New Mexico , which the U.S. government later confirmed was a high-altitude balloon."

The spokeswoman, Aracely Jimenez-Audis, rejected the idea that Democrats needed to compromise on their plan in the way the Obama administration was forced to compromise on health care.
""I would say no,"" Ocasio-Cortez said when asked if there was room for ""moderate compromise"" to get some of the Green New Deal proposals passed. ""And that's mostly because there is growing grassroots support for the Green New Deal in every corner of this country.""
Later in the interview, the host revisited the idea of compromise again, citing a common claim that there are only about 12 years left to do something about climate change and the fact that Congress is divided. She again asked Jimenez-Audis if Green New Deal supporters could compromise.
""I would say no, and that's mostly because, again, the most recent science has told us that this is a crisis; a crisis that we have an expiration date,"" Jimenez-Audis said.
The spokeswoman also said that other Democrats' plans, such as that from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), don't go far enough to solve the problem, and that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are out of touch with the new progressives in the party.
When asked what she thought were the practical things that could be prioritized in the Green New Deal, Jimenez-Audis cited things that mostly seemed to only deal indirectly, if at all, with climate change.
""We want a federal jobs guarantee. We want to expand federal labor rights,"" Jimenez-Audis answered. ""We want to expand indigenous people's rights. We need to give workers consistent access to health care. We need to provide child care. We need to introduce regenerative agricultural practices.""

Stelter — host of the network's ""Reliable Sources"" program — sat in during ""CNN Newsroom"" Tuesday and listened to host Brooke Baldwin's introductory pitch: ""Say what you will about 'the press.' This is an event that honors the First Amendment .""
As you might expect, Stelter knocked that softball toss for extra bases with that rat-a-tat-tat, 1930s sports announcer delivery of his:
Yes, that's what it's about. It's an awards dinner and a fundraiser. In the past, presidents have always shown up even if they were angry at the press at any given time, and importantly it's useful for White House aides to schmooze with reporters. It's helpful for us to get to know our sources. There's some value in these sorts of festive events, but it is, as you said, another example of a tradition at least being put on pause during the Trump age. 'Attack against the media' But Stelter went deeper than that, adding to Baldwin that Trump skipping the dinner — as he's done in past years — is ""yet another example"" of ""the administration's attack against the media."" He added that such attacks take ""many forms,"" one of them being Trump's choice to hold a rally instead of going to the dinner — again, something he's done in years past.
""I do think it matters mostly because of what it means about these tensions continuing to escalate,"" Stelter added.

Another transgender male gives birth — and wants documentary about pregnancy to show 'trans people are actually quite normal',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/transgender-male-gives-birth-want-soshow-trans-are-actually-quite-normal,"Back in January, a story emerged about a gay male who impregnated his transgender partner who identifies as male — and the birth of the Texas couple's baby came to light in March.
Image source: KENS-TV video screenshot
Now a documentary about another transgender male — and the ups and downs involved in Freddy McConnell's pregnancy — is hitting the film festival circuit. It's titled, "" Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth ,"" because male seahorses give birth to their young.
The Guardian put together an extensive profile on McConnell — who was born female and is gay — noting the birth of baby Jack and everything that led up to it:
Here's the description of ""Seahorse"" trailer on YouTube:
One trans man's pioneering quest to fulfill an age-old desire: to start his own family. Freddy is 30 and yearns to start a family but this poses unique challenges. He is a gay transgender man. Deciding to carry his own baby took years of soul searching, but he was unprepared for the reality of pregnancy, both physically and challenging society's fundamental understanding of gender & family. To him what feels pragmatic, to others feels confronting; this was not part of his plan. Against a backdrop of hostility towards trans people, he is forced to confront his naivety. Made with unprecedented access & collaboration, it's an audacious & lyrical story about what makes us who we are. This is the story of the dad who gave birth. 'I feel like a f***ing alien'
McConnell — a 32-year-old who lives in Great Britain — started taking testosterone at 25 and had ""top surgery"" to remove breast tissue a year later, The Guardian said. McConnell considered a hysterectomy, the paper said, but never went through with it — as having children was on McConnell's mind.
""In the film, we see how discombobulated McConnell becomes when he stops taking testosterone as he tries to conceive, using a sperm donor, and his body, in effect, goes into reverse,"" The Guardian noted. ""He starts having periods again ('I don't like the idea that I've got tampons in my bag,' he winces); his facial hair gets wispier, his hips broaden, his tummy softens, and he starts to speak less from his chest and more from his throat. 'Every time I think about it, I think, ""What the f*** am I doing?""' he says. At one point, a tearful McConnell sobs into the camera in the middle of the night: 'I feel like a f***ing alien.'""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
Normalizing transgenders McConnell also told the paper that ""the thing he most wants the film to do is normalize trans people.""
""It sounds wishy-washy, but I thought it could be a good opportunity to spread empathy,"" McConnell added to The Guardian. ""I think empathy is key in convincing people that trans people are actually quite normal, and live lives that are not sensational or scary.""
Image source: YouTube screenshot
As you probably expect, McConnell disagrees with the notion that biology is fixed and that trans women are not really women and trans men are not really men, the paper said.
""Many of these people haven't met a trans person, and the monstering and caricaturing is not based on reality,"" McConnell added to the Guardian. ""Not everyone gets a chance to meet a trans person — but that is often what changes everything for someone who can't get their head around it. So I thought this film could be in lieu of meeting somebody — you could spend an hour and a half with me.""
More from the profile:
McConnell discovered there were trans men in America who were having babies, and spoke to his doctor about becoming pregnant. Even then, he was still battling with the idea. He worried that he might be ridiculed or attacked; that people would think he was transitioning into a woman; that as a man carrying a baby he was having his cake and eating it. ""I went back and forth for ages. But for me, having that genetic link is something I felt I needed to have. It took me so long to feel OK about wanting kids, because there's a stigma attached to it,"" McConnell told the Guardian. ""It took me a long time to separate identity from biology. I'm just using my hardware to do a thing. It's pragmatic.""
'It is not something that I can choose, or leave behind, or change' When McConnell was asked about reasons for having a child, the Kent resident told paper, ""Straight people don't get asked, 'Why didn't you adopt? Why was it so important to be genetic parents?' So why do gay and trans people get asked that?""
McConnell also had to work on separating a transgender identity and physical realities, the Guardian said.
""It is not something that I can choose, or leave behind, or change,"" he said. ""It's not something predicated on my physical state. It's a thing, it's part of me. So if I'm pregnant, it doesn't change me being trans.""

The subject of the documentary also confessed to the paper, ""I hated my early 20s. I just didn't know what was going on. I don't think it's possible to explain what gender dysphoria is like to somebody who doesn't feel it. All I know is testosterone and my transition changed everything and made life not just livable, but enjoyable. The self-questioning, second-guessing quietened down. It didn't go totally, because that's just part of who I am. But the gender dysphoria disappeared.""
More from the Guardian profile:
More than anything, Seahorse is a love story — or a series of love stories. There is McConnell and his son, McConnell and his mother, and McConnell and CJ. At the beginning of the film, CJ and McConnell are living together as best friends and partners. CJ is non-binary and uses the gender-neutral pronoun ""they."" ""My partner and I both have ovaries,"" McConnell explains to the camera. We see the two of them sitting on the sofa with their laptops, looking at sperm donor sites. ""This is like our version of having sex,"" laughs McConnell. ""Talking about having a child together, and the ideal donor.""
""It's very satisfying,"" CJ says.
""Then we have a cigarette afterwards."" They laugh.
But halfway through the film, CJ decides not to parent a child with McConnell. ""CJ's told me they're not involved any more,"" a devastated McConnell tells the camera. The idea of being a solo parent is a different prospect, and initially he is full of doubt: what is he doing to his body, is it safe, is he capable of bringing up a child alone? Meanwhile, the withdrawal of testosterone is playing havoc with his hormones. In a moment of glorious bathos, McConnell tells the camera, Garbo-like, that he wants to be left alone. He laughs when I remind him of this now, all the tears and drama. ""I felt so bad for my mum. She had to put up with me."" More children? The paper asked McConnell if more children are on the horizon: ""I would love to have more children, but I'd also love to not have to carry them, necessarily. Though I haven't ruled it out."" The Guardian then asked if ""lower surgery"" is being ruled out for now: ""Erm, yeah. Yeah ... Ruled out seems strong.""

And what does McConnell want audiences to get from ""Seahorse""?
""I'd like people to feel they can relate to whatever bit of the story echoes with their own experience,"" McConnell told the paper. ""Hopefully people will come away thinking they've seen something relatable, a universal story about love and family and wanting to have kids.""

An epidemic? Feds bust ANOTHER large illegal fentanyl shipment,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/an-epidemic-feds-bust-another-large-illegal-fentanyl-shipment,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have succeeded in stopping the flow of another large fentanyl shipment into the United States.
Feds announced Tuesday that officials had intercepted 26 pounds of fentanyl, an extremely potent and frequently lethal drug, that was hidden inside of a truck subject to a secondary inspection at the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge. The bridge separates Laredo, Texas, from the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo.
A KGNS-TV report added that a canine unit sniffed out 10 separate packages that contained fentanyl, and that the drugs had an estimated street value of $728,000. The case has been turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further investigation, according to CBP.
""Our frontline CBP officers continued to remain vigilant amid heavy Semana Santa traffic and that dedication to the border security mission yielded a significant seizure of fentanyl,"" Port Director Albert Flores of the Laredo Port of Entry said in a statement.
In January, CBP officers made the largest fentanyl bust in U.S. history, when they discovered 254 pounds of the lethal drug hidden in a truck loaded with cucumbers.
There is a renewed effort in the Trump Administration to consider classifying the deadly agent as a Weapon of Massive Destruction ( WMD ). On Sunday, Task and Purpose reported that the Department of Homeland Security is considering the measure.
""Fentanyl's high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack,"" DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction James F. McDonnell wrote in an internal memo obtained by the publication.
Although a lot of fentanyl comes into the United States via Mexico, feds have identified China as the primary source for the extremely addictive drug. It has become immensely difficult to stop its transfer to the United States, as fentanyl offers a major financial windfall to its smugglers, traffickers, and distributors.
However, the Chinese government recently pledged to do more to curtail its manufacturing, distribution, and illegal trafficking. On Wednesday, President Trump acknowledged China's efforts to crack down on fentanyl.
According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, fentanyl and its derivatives were responsible for 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017. Fentanyl is 80% to 100% more potent than morphine, according to the DEA."

What are the details? JoAnn Cunningham and Andrew Freund Sr. were arrested Wednesday, after authorities found remains believed to be the couple's son, wrapped in plastic, in a shallow grave dug on a farm near Woodstock, the Chicago Tribune reported.
Freund called 911 to report his son missing on Thursday, claiming he returned home from a doctor's appointment that morning and the boy was nowhere to be found. The father agreed to speak with detectives, but Cunningham was described by police as ""uncooperative"" earlier in the investigation.
During a news conference after the arrest, Crystal Lake Police told reporters ""that both parents provided information that helped investigators locate the boy's body,"" WABC-TV reported.
Cunningham has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder, four counts of aggravated battery, two counts of aggravated domestic batter, and one count of failure to report a missing or child death.
Freund has been charged with five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated battery, one count of aggravated domestic battery, two counts of concealment of a homicidal death, and one count of failure to report a missing or child death.
Anything else? AJ's younger brother has been in the care of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services since shortly after the 5-year-old went missing.
The family is no stranger to the DCFS. The agency entered their lives after AJ was born with opiates in his system, and has had contact on and off as late as December 2018, according to the Tribune."
Pres.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) regarding the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which both politicians say is doing well, according to The HIll .
Ocasio-Cortez was criticized for saying that the VA was working fine for veterans and didn't need to be fixed.
""[T]here's some things that we're hearing today, there's some themes we've got coming out, and especially when it comes to the VA, all I can think of is that classic refrain that my parents always told me growing up,"" Ocasio-Cortez said last week during a New York City town hall. ""Which is that, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'""
Ocasio-Cortez said the VA provides high-quality care, and that those who are trying to ""fix"" it are seeking to do so to the benefit of private insurance companies.
""But who are they trying to fix it for, is the question we've got to ask,"" she said. ""And this is who they're trying to fix it for. They're trying to fix the VA for insurance companies. They're trying to fix it for insurance corporations, and ultimately they're trying to fix the VA for the for-profit health care industry that does not put people or veterans first.""
Pres. Trump on Twitter backed up the freshman congresswoman in a Wednesday post.
""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great,"" Trump wrote. ""But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed.""
The VA, by many standards, is not ""doing great ,"" however. The Government Accountability Office flagged it as a ""high risk"" agency, citing vulnerability to fraud and mismanagement and pointing to inconsistency in the wait times for veterans to receive service, among other issues."
ESPN's Will Cain blasts overreaction of athletic teams banning Kate Smith's 'God Bless America' — and the panel erupts,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/espns-will-cain-blasts-overreaction-of-athletic-teams-banning-kate-smiths-god-bless-america,"ESPN's Will Cain faced off with ""First Take's"" Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman over the movement to stop using Kate Smith's version of ""God Bless America"" at sporting events.
Last week, the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Flyers announced that they would no longer be using Smith's version of ""God Bless America"" and would be removing a statue dedicated to the late singer , respectively.
Smith came under fire recently after people complained that some of the 1930s-era singer's songs had racist connotations attached to them.
You can read more about Smith, who died in 1986, and the ensuing controversy around ""God Bless America,"" here .
What did Cain say? During an exchange with Smith and Kellerman about the Yankees' and the Flyers' decisions, Cain explained that he felt it was wrong people were reacting to the song, sung by a woman who has been dead for more than three decades.
Cain also argued that it was foolish to dismantle Smith's entire career over a few questionable songs that were written well before the civil rights movement.
""I'm suggesting it's an absolute and utter fool's errand to go back through history — decades,"" he said. ""Someone who's been passed away for 30 years. Incidents which occurred eight decades ago. And apply modern historical standards to something you can almost reach a century. I'm suggesting that your standard — yours — only requires a handful of people to be a little outraged to go back and tear statues down.
""And,"" he continued, ""I'm telling you that by your standard, President Obama's statues would not stand to today's standard when it comes to gay rights, and that is asinine.""
Smith fired back, ""That's pretty damn easy for you to say, because you're not the offended party. It's real easy for the person or group that's not the offended party to take that position.""
Kellerman later explained how we should still hold people accountable for old actions.
""What I'm saying is in the 1930s, if ... someone was putting out racist lyrics,"" he began, ""they were told often times how wrong they were.""
He continued, ""They made their choice — and by the way, black people were horribly disenfranchised and alienated and marginalized and oppressed — and now to say 'Well that's the way it was then, and now even with the advantage of hindsight, 'Well, look, yes there was all this injustice' ... we just have to go along with it now, we can never correct anything, we can never say ... 'Bad, that was bad. You, who supported that, that was bad.' That argument doesn't fly with me.""
What else? Cain responded by noting that he wasn't debating Smith's songs one way or the other.
""There's no debate about the nature of the songs that Kate Smith sang. No one is here to excuse them,"" he said. ""What we are talking about is how we treat history and the standards we apply."""
Rev. Franklin Graham has a fiery response to Pete Buttigieg about Christianity,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/franklin-graham-against-buttigieg,"Rev. Franklin Graham had a lot to say Wednesday to 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg over his numerous statements about the Christian faith.
Graham was specifically responding to the South Bend, Indiana, mayor's comments about God not being on the side of any political party.
""Presidential candidate & South Bend Mayor @PeteButtigieg is right—God doesn't have a political party,"" tweeted Graham.
""But God does have commandments, laws & standards He gives us to live by,"" he explained. ""God doesn't change. His Word is the same yesterday, today & forever.""
""Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian,"" Graham continued in a second tweet.
""As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized,"" he said. ""The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women.""
""The core of the Christian faith is believing and following Jesus Christ,"" Graham concluded, ""who God sent to be the Savior of the world—to save us from sin, to save us from hell, to save us from eternal damnation.""
Buttigieg has used Christianity to criticize his political opponents as part of his presidential campaign, with Vice President Mike Pence as one of his favorite targets. The presidential candidate has tried to reframe Christianity to fit the policies of the Democratic Party while questioning who is authentically Christian.

The New York state affiliate of the ACLU warned Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) in a letter that they might pursue legal action against him.
""We just sent a letter to @RepPeteKing, demanding that he stop blocking constituents who criticize him on Facebook,"" the official Twitter account of the NYCLU tweeted Wednesday.
""Silencing constituents on Facebook is like ejecting them from a town hall,"" they added. ""It strikes at the heart of the First Amendment's guarantee.""
They posted two examples of critical comments on King's Facebook page that led to the authors being ""banned"" from accessing his webpage.
""Silencing these voices is an affront to the First Amendment and to the core values of our democracy,"" the group wrote in their letter to King. ""If you do not unban these constituents promptly, we intend to file a federal lawsuit to vindicate their rights.""
King responded to The Hill , saying that he was allowed to run the Facebook account however he wanted because it was an extension of his political campaign, and constituents were free to reach him via his Twitter account, which is a government account.
He's not the only one who has been accused of acting against constituents' rights on social media. President Donald Trump lost a lawsuit in March 2019 alleging that he was acting improperly when he blocked certain constituents on Twitter.

Bun B, whose legal name is Bernard Freeman, came to his wife's defense after the suspect held her at gunpoint during the attempted robbery.
What happened? At about 5:45 p.m., the suspect, Demonte Alif Jackson, showed up at the door of Bernard and his wife Queen Freeman's home. She answered, thinking it could be a delivery. Jackson pulled a gun on her and forced his way in the house.
She begged him not to kill or harm her, and surrendered car keys and other possessions in an attempt to appease Jackson. Jackson took the car keys and went to the garage.
At that point, Bernard, who had been upstairs, pursued Jackson after his wife told him he was in the garage. When he got to the garage, he saw Jackson sitting in the driver's seat of one of their vehicles.
The two men exchanged gunfire, with Freeman hitting Jackson in the shoulder. Jackson jumped out of the car and ran, but not before Freeman pulled his mask off.
Police later arrested Jackson at a nearby hospital and identified by Freeman, where he was being treated for the gunshot wound. Freeman and his wife were unharmed.
""I've had messages from the Middle East and Europe, everyone is concerned about Bun and Queen. Although they're physically fine, the wounds, emotional wounds, I can't speak to how long they'll take to heal,"" attorney Charles Adams told KHOU. ""But it is really a story of two people that truly love each other and risked their lives to save each other. And I just thank God that both of them are okay.""

Now, the Houston Police Department is investigating whether her death was a homicide.
What are the details? On Thursday afternoon, Kashala Francis made it about a block after leaving Attucks Middle School before she was jumped by fellow students, according to her mother, Mamie Jackson. A video of the incident reportedly shows the teen being punched multiple times and kicked in the head.
Kashala told her mother what happened, but insisted she was fine despite some bruising to her face. Two days later, the girl complained of a headache before slipping into a coma from which she never woke up.
The 13-year-old was rushed to the hospital and placed in intensive care. Doctors discovered Kashala had ""a large tumor in the back of her head, and she had fluid buildup in her brain,"" Jackson told KTRK-TV . She passed away Wednesday morning.
Authorities are now waiting on an autopsy to determine what role the alleged assault may have played in Kashala's death, if any. No arrests have been made in connection with the incident, but police told ABC News the teen's death is being investigated as a homicide pending the results of the coroner's report.
Anything else? Jackson has viewed the video showing the attack on her daughter and told KTRK before Kashala's death that it was replaying in her mind: ""I can see these girls kicking her in the head while other children are laughing at her,"" she said through tears.
The family has started a Facebook donation page to help pay for Kashala's medical expenses."

Biden was reportedly encouraging supporters and donors to give him a boost in donations to help his impending campaign.
""The money's important. We're going to be judged by what we can do in the first 24 hours, the first week,"" Biden reportedly told them.
Despite not announcing his campaign yet, Biden has already seen some setbacks, including accusations of inappropriate touching by several women.

In this clip, Glenn shared details about a documentary called "" Seattle is Dying "" that highlighted, according to Glenn, how to recognize the beginning stages of socialism.
The documentary exposed a disconnect between local government and constituents who live in Seattle. Glenn described what is happening in Seattle as a hostile takeover by Marxist radicals and how the government will respond to you under socialism.
""The police are quitting. The police officers are walking off of the job and saying I can't do it anymore; this doesn't make any sense. What they want us to do is not police, and this documentary, because it was made in such a progressive area, I thought it was really remarkable,"" Glenn said.
Glenn selected two clips from the documentary, both highlighted how local government officials were ultimately devaluing local business owners' cries for help as they protected the drug dealers and prostitutes living on the street and damaging the property of taxpayers.
Glenn asserted that a collapse is around the corner when:
a city is comprised of criminals damaging private property and crimes go unpunished; police officers are unable to police, thus leaving them no alternative but to leave the force; local elected officials protect criminals while treating taxpayers as second-class citizens; property owners must turn to local government as a last resort to plead for restored order; and local government laughs at the cries for help and citizens are told to call 9-1-1, a number that is useless if there are no police to respond.

The video included remarks about Trump's statements following the Charlottesville, Virginia, riots — which occurred between white nationalists, neo-Nazi activists, and protesters against the group's presence. In the video, Biden discussed the riots, calling them a ""defining moment"" for the U.S., and pointing fingers at the ""crazed faces"" of white nationalists and their march.
""That's when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, 'Some very fine people on both sides,'"" Biden said. ""' Very fine people on both sides?' With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it.
""In that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I'd ever seen in my lifetime,"" he admitted. ""We are in the battle for the soul of this nation.
""I believe history will look back on four years of this president, and all he embraces, as an aberrant moment in time,"" the presidential candidate added.

Joe Biden For President: America Is An Idea www.youtube.com
According to NPR , the former vice president is expected in Pittsburgh next week to kick off his campaign. CNN reported that Biden is planning to visit early primary voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina over the coming weeks.
Biden is the 20th candidate to enter a packed Democratic presidential campaign field.
Biden spent more than three decades in the U.S. Senate representing the state of Delaware and served eight years as former President Barack Obama's vice president. This is his third bid for president .
What else? A new Morning Consult/Politico Wednesday showed that Biden leads President Trump by 8 percentage points, 42 to 34, among registered voters in a hypothetical 2020 matchup.
Nineteen percent those polled said that they were unsure at this time who they would support in a 2020 matchup, and 5 percent said that they wouldn't vote at all.
The poll also reported that Biden has a higher support among women, 45 percent to 28 percent, compared to Trump.
Morning Consult/Politico conducted the survey April 19-22 among 1,992 registered voters. The poll's margin of error is 2 percentage points.
Biden enters the race with a lead over other Democrats who have announced their bid for president, CNBC reported , surpassing Democratic front-runners like Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg . A Tuesday Monmouth University poll found that Biden would lead the Democratic Party field, with 27 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters reporting that they would support him in a bid for president."

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came in second with 1.3 million average viewers, right behind Harris.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tied for third place with 1.2 million average viewers each.
By far the worst ratings were garnered by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who only had 869,000 viewers. Klobuchar had an embarrassing moment where she reminded the audience to applaud for her, reminding many of Jeb Bush's awkward ""please clap"" video.
Despite the relative ratings victory for Harris, Fox News still beat out CNN overall easily for the night. Harris also had to walk back comments about allowing convicted felons to vote from prison after her town hall event.

Glenn noted Harris' public support for government reparations for black Americans, which she confirmed during a CNN town hall Monday.
""We had centuries of slavery in this country. We had decades of Jim Crow. We had legalized discrimination and segregation. And then we had de facto discrimination and segregation,"" Harris said at the town hall. ""And to believe or suggest that those years of … abuse and violence and crime did not have an impact is to overlook the facts of history.""
""We should take a moment here to appreciate the irony that someone who has proudly advocated for reparations and called people racist, is a descendant of a slave owner,"" Glenn said.
He referred to an essay published on Jamaica Global Online , in which Harris' father, Donald Harris, revealed that his grandmother owned slaves on a Jamaican plantation .
"" My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy (née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown's Town),"" Donald Harris wrote.
""You as an individual are not responsible for your forebears,"" Glenn asserted. ""You're not responsible for your father's sins, or your grandfather's, or your great-grandfather's sins. But that's not what [Harris] believes.""
""Someone isn't racist just because their ancestors were slave owners ... but that's the whole argument with reparations,"" he added.

The feud with late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) that followed President Donald Trump from the campaign trail to the Oval office will continue to hound him through the 2020 presidential election, according to one report.
The Washington Examiner reported that multiple sources say that members of the the McCain family plan to break with the Republican Party and support former Vice President Joe Biden's anticipated bid for president.
A former McCain campaign official with close ties to the family told the Examiner that support for Biden from the late senator's daughter Meghan and widow Cindy was a given, but that the question is how the pair can best help the former VP without harming his prospects in the Democratic primary.
""It's undeniable that Joe Biden and the McCain family have a very close, personal relationship,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""It's about what's good for him [Biden].""
However, Cindy McCain, the late Senator's wife, denied that she would be supporting any presidential candidate, including Biden, in 2020.
Given the prominence and of far-left progressives in an already-crowded Democratic field, one of the biggest questions around his candidacy is about how well a more moderate, establishmentarian figure like Biden will ultimately fare in the primary, even if his prospects in the general election appear more bullish than his Democratic opponents.
The feud between Trump and John McCain goes back awhile . Trump made disparaging marks about McCain's Vietnam service record as far back as 2000. The two sparred over that and Trump's immigration comments on the campaign trail and continued through Trump's first two years in office and McCain's last months on earth.
The bad blood continued even after McCain's death. Trump was snubbed by not being invited to McCain's funeral and recently complained that he was never thanked for it. The president said he "" was never a fan "" of the McCains last month after Meghan clashed with a Trump campaign adviser on social media.
Earlier this week, multiple news outlets reported that Biden planned to formally launch his presidential campaign on Thursday. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released early Wednesday showed Biden at the top of the Democratic primary field with a 9-point lead. Immediately on his heels is self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)"

What are the details? According to The Wrap , which obtained an internal memo from Ellen Shultz, the executive vice president of Talent and Inclusion, the move was prompted by a ""number of employees"" who voiced concerns over having gender-neutral bathrooms at the facility.
The memo read, ""Effective immediately, the restrooms on the 14th floor near the ATM and vending machines are gender-neutral, accessible, single-person units. A lock on the main door has been added for privacy during use.""
""Additionally,"" the memo continued, ""we will create single-person bathrooms on the 2nd and 8th floors.""
""Please remember that you are welcome to use any bathroom that matches your gender identity or expression,"" the memo concluded.
Shultz added that a variety of menstrual hygiene products would be placed inside ""wellness rooms"" throughout the building.
What else? One social media user, identified by The Wrap as Molly Fassler — a senior analyst for the global Times — tweeted praise of the company's move.
""Worth my first tweet ever,"" Fassler tweeted. ""Today I'm an especially happy employee. There are officially gender neutral bathrooms at @nytimes ! Huge thanks to all that made this happen!""
Carolyn Ryan, the assistant managing editor for the Times, chimed in on Fassler's tweet.
Ryan wrote, ""Thank you for pushing for it!""
Benjamin Hoffman, a third employee, added, ""This rules. After nearly 15 years with this company I still find reasons to be proud every single day."""

Harvard student Samantha Frenkel-Popell recalled how her family escaped the Soviet Union and asked Bernie Sanders how he would square his support for democratic socialism with the ""failures of socialism in nearly every country that it's tried in."" Bernie straight-up lied in his response, and CNN didn't bat an eye.
Bernie answered, ""Is it your assumption that I supported or believe in authoritarian communism that existed in the Soviet Union? I don't. I never have. And I opposed it.""
Anyone with merely a cursory knowledge of Sanders' career knows that during the 1970s and 1980s he supported and defended ""authoritarian"" communist regimes. He even honeymooned in the Soviet Union . Thanks to BlazeTV's Jon Miller, you don't have to take my word for it.

He noted how the media, given the opportunity to ask someone close to the president of the United States ""substantial questions"" about what's going on in the Oval Office, will waste the chance by asking meaningless questions.
Hogan agreed, adding the media would ""cover palace intrigue over policy any chance they get.""
""It's very rare they ask substantive questions. But, what do you expect?"" he continued. ""It's a media that has 93 percent negative coverage against this president. They wrote thousands and thousands and thousands of stories about [special counsel Robert] Mueller, which now know was an investigation that the Democrats pushed. It was a complete and total lie for more than two years with no proof, no evidence. So, it stands to reason they're going to write a question about Russian meddling, which happened under Barack Obama's watch.

What did she say? Poehler told The Hollywood Reporter that she has ramped up her efforts as a feminist and said it has served her in the Trump era. Some of those efforts include speaking out about the president and conservatism.
""Women have been rightly and righteously furious about this administration and have been working together and bonding together just in an attempt to make sense of all of it,"" Poehler said. The comedian and actress also said that her sons were personally affected by Trump's election, because they were so ""looking forward to electing the first female president.""
She revealed that her family is even donating money to causes like immigration and climate change.
Calling Trump's election ""so upsetting"" and a ""huge loss for all of us,"" Poehler said that she and her girlfriends text each other daily for support.
""Every woman I know has a text chain, every morning we just say, 'Can you believe this? Can we break this down together so I don't lose my mind?'"" she said.
Poehler said she sometimes has a hard time facing the day for fear of an anxiety attack.
""It's really hard to not have a full-on panic attack every day. It's why people are self-medicating,"" she admitted, the outlet pointing out that she ""[laughed] hysterically"" and ""a little maniacally"" after making the admission.
What else? Poehler, 47, also went on to bemoan people believing the stereotype that women can be more unstable than men.
""Women are constantly criticized for being too emotional,"" she complained. ""Can we be allowed to be as messy, as all over the place, as inconsistent and as mediocre as men?"""
Trespasser found sleeping inside Louisiana governor's mansion,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trespasser-found-sleeping-inside-louisiana-governors-mansion,"A man was found taking a nap inside the Louisiana governor's mansion.
Here's what we know According to Louisiana State Police, Reynard Green was arrested April 17 before 6 a.m. after he was discovered sleeping on a couch inside the mansion. He is accused of also breaking an antique table while inside the building, according to the New York Times .
It is not clear how Green got inside the building, or where Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) was at the time. The Louisiana State Police's Protective Services Unit claims that ""Louisiana State Police troopers and Department of Public Safety officers are assigned to the Governor's Mansion 24 hours a day, year-round and are responsible for the physical protection of the Mansion and its grounds.""
Edwards has not said whether he or his wife were in the mansion at the time. He told the media on Tuesday that he couldn't ""address any specific information relative"" to this case.
""It's still an open investigation the State Police is conducting, and I will just say that I appreciate all the work that they do to keep me and my family safe. At no time were we anything other than safe,"" Edwards said.
The police found synthetic marijuana in Green's pocket. When he was taken to the police station for processing, he reportedly tried to hit a sergeant and an officer, and steal a sergeant's service weapon. The sergeant reported that he was ""able to stop Green from attempting to disarm me with a right elbow strike to the face.""
Green was charged with simple burglary, criminal trespass, and criminal damage to property.
What else? According to the Associated Press , when state Senate President John Alario (R) heard about the intrusion, he quipped that he was surprised to hear about the incident since security had been increased at the mansion recently, adding jokingly that he even had ""to give a secret handshake"" to get inside."
Pres. Donald Trump sides with AOC in saying the VA is 'doing great' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pres-donald-trump-sides-with-aoc-in-saying-the-va-is-doing-great?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,"President Donald Trump took the side of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) regarding the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which both politicians say is doing well, according to The HIll .
Ocasio-Cortez was criticized for saying that the VA was working fine for veterans and didn't need to be fixed.
""[T]here's some things that we're hearing today, there's some themes we've got coming out, and especially when it comes to the VA, all I can think of is that classic refrain that my parents always told me growing up,"" Ocasio-Cortez said last week during a New York City town hall. ""Which is that, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'""
Ocasio-Cortez said the VA provides high-quality care, and that those who are trying to ""fix"" it are seeking to do so to the benefit of private insurance companies.
""But who are they trying to fix it for, is the question we've got to ask,"" she said. ""And this is who they're trying to fix it for. They're trying to fix the VA for insurance companies. They're trying to fix it for insurance corporations, and ultimately they're trying to fix the VA for the for-profit health care industry that does not put people or veterans first.""
Pres. Trump on Twitter backed up the freshman congresswoman in a Wednesday post.
""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great,"" Trump wrote. ""But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed.""
The VA, by many standards, is not ""doing great ,"" however. The Government Accountability Office flagged it as a ""high risk"" agency, citing vulnerability to fraud and mismanagement and pointing to inconsistency in the wait times for veterans to receive service, among other issues."
Uber says driver who flat-out refused to take woman to clinic for abortion was fired for reasons of ‘safety’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/uber-says-driver-who-flat-out-refused-to-take-woman-to-clinic-for-abortion-was-fired-for-reasons-of-safety,"Uber revealed on Thursday that it fired a driver — who refused to take a woman to an abortion clinic — over safety reasons.
What are the details? An unnamed Uber driver reportedly dropped a 20-year-old woman off on the side of the road when he found out that she was headed to an abortion clinic for an abortion.
The company said that the unnamed driver violated safety rules in dropping the female passenger off at a place other than her destination.
""Our Community Guidelines clearly lay out safety as a top priority and any actions that threaten the safety of drivers and rider will be investigated,"" a spokeswoman for the company told The Daily Caller in a statement. ""Dropping someone off in the middle of nowhere threatens someone's safety.""
The New York woman, who originally shared her account of the event on Reddit, said that her driver seemed to have a hunch that she was headed to an abortion clinic when he came to pick her up.
""My appointment was at 11:30 am so at 9:58 am my Uber arrived and he immediately seemed uncomfortable,"" she wrote. ""After about five minutes in the car, he asked, 'Are we going to a Planned Parenthood?' I said no (because we weren't), but it set off alarm bells that he would even ask that.""
""The destination I put in was just the name of the doctor and the address of the clinic, there was nothing that would suggest it was an abortion clinic,"" she added. ""After a few more minutes he asked, 'Are we going to an abortion clinic?'""
""I was shocked,"" the woman admitted. ""I had no idea what to say, so I just remained quiet. He then said 'I know it's none of my business, but…' and proceeded to mention something about his wife being pregnant, how awful the procedure was (and proceeded to explain it in graphic detail), and that 'There is so much they don't tell you.'""
The woman said that the Uber driver told her that she would ""regret this decision for the rest of [her] life"" and told her that she was making a grave mistake.
After more time went by, the driver pulled over on the side of the road and told the woman that he could not, in good conscience, take her to her destination. He offered to turn the car around and drive her back home, but insisted that he would not be making the trip to the clinic.
The 20-year-old woman then phoned her boyfriend, who called the clinic to tell them she would be late. She left the Uber and called a cab to complete the rest of the trip to the abortion clinic, and later reported the driver to Uber. She also reported the incident to the local police, according to her account of the event on Reddit. "
North Korea demanded $2 million before agreeing to return Otto Warmbier,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/north-korea-demanded-2-million-for-otto-warmbiers,"North Korea reportedly demanded $2 million for the release of American Otto Warmbier in 2017, citing Warmbier's alleged medical costs. Warmbier died shortly after being released.
What happened with Otto Warmbier? Warmbier was a 22-year-old college student who was arrested in North Korea in 2016 and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was accused of stealing a propaganda poster while on a tour.
He was finally released 17 months later, but when he arrived in the US, he was in a coma. He never woke up and died six days later.
In a lawsuit they filed against the North Korean government, Warmbier's parents said that their son was blind, deaf, had damaged teeth, and was making ""inhuman noises"" like ""howling"" and ""jerking violently.""
What happened now? According to the Washington Post and CNN , multiple sources familiar with the situation said that the North Korean government had demanded that the United States agree to pay $2 million in alleged medical bills for Warmbier. It's not clear what treatment they claimed that the money was for.
According to these reports, the U.S. State Department's Special Representative for North Korea, Joseph Yun, was told he had to sign something before Warmbier could be released promising that the payment would be made. Yun reportedly asked the Trump administration for permission to make this deal, which former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and President Donald Trump gave him.
Despite signing the agreement, this bill has reportedly never been paid. It was also reportedly not discussed during Trump's summits with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore or Hanoi, Vietnam.
The White House told the Post that it does ""not comment on hostage negotiations, which is why they have been so successful during this administration.""
Both the Trump administration and Yun have refused to comment on these reports to CNN or the Post."
Exotic dancer encourages little girl to stick money into her G-string.

After many people criticized her for the photo, the burlesque dancer deactivated her Instagram page, deleted the original Facebook posting, and changed her privacy settings, according to the Pluralist .
What happened? Blue shared the image to her Facebook page and her Instagram feed and lauded the child's family for being so open-minded as to let their child stuff dollar bills into her thong.
In the post, the dancer shared the photo and expressed her appreciation for parents who aren't uptight.
She wrote, ""This little girl was at brunch a few weeks ago and her family was encouraging her to tip and engage with me. It's always so refreshing to see families actively destigmatizing and changing narratives around bodies and sexuality.""
""At the end,"" she continued, ""[the child's] mom came up to me and said, 'Thank you for showing her that being a strong woman is OK. And I told her, 'No, no, thank you for exposing her to burlesque and for encouraging her to experience it.""
You can see her post, preserved on the internet for posterity, below.
What else? Blue expressed her anger in a post over the response to the photo.
According to the Pluralist, Blue revealed in a Facebook message that the ""hate"" she received over the image prompted her to remove it from Facebook. She also encouraged her followers to focus on ""more important issues"" like ""[the Trump] administration or equal rights.""
""I still think it's ok for children to see burlesque in an environment that is suited for them,"" she added. ""I still think that the family bringing this child and encouraging her to tip destigmatizes everything we grow up learning about bodies.""
""[E]njoy your place up there on your moral high ground,"" she wrote.
She later deleted that post , too.
On Easter Sunday, Blue shared a highly disturbing photo of herself as ""Stripper Jesus.""

California man arrested for allegedly posing as an ICE agent to rob illegal immigrant construction workers,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-man-arrested-for-allegedly-posing-as-an-ice-agent,"A man in northern California has been arrested in connection with the robberies of several illegal immigrants working at construction sites in El Dorado County. Police say the suspect presented himself as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, handcuffing his victims, threatening them with deportation, and extorting them for cash.
What are the details? Patrick Mullany, 56, is accused of targeting Mexican illegal immigrants and placing them under false arrest as part of his scheme. Authorities took him into custody Monday on suspicion of armed robbery, false imprisonment, and impersonating a police officer, the Sacramento Bee reported.
According to the Daily Mail , Mullany was busted after hitting the same construction site twice in less than two weeks, leading workers to catch on to the ploy and alert authorities.
El Dorado County Sheriff's Office Sgt. Andrew Principe said, ""For this group to call us and come forward it's helpful because we got this guy off the street. Who knows how many other people he targeted?""
Mullany allegedly took the money to pay ""court fees"" he owed.
Anything else? A neighbor of the accused reportedly told Univision, ""He talked about Mexicans saying they're dirty. I told him I'm Mexican and he was quiet and treated me all right for the most part.""
Deputies recovered two replica guns, two pairs of handcuffs, and cash from searching the suspect's home and vehicle. He is currently being held on $102,000 bond."

The Cuban-American musician — real name Armando Christian Pérez — told the women that immigrants built the U.S., and added that ""Mexico is not crossing the border — the border crossed Mexico.""
Co-host Joy Behar was so moved by his words that she suggested he run for president one day.
What happened during the exchange? Co-host Sunny Hostin kicked off the segment by asking the rapper's stance on immigration in the United States.
""As far as immigration, guys, we're the United States of America, not the divided states of America,"" Pitbull quipped. ""This country was built by immigrants, you know. If we're going to talk about the ones who were here first, then we have to talk about the Native Americans.""
Pitbull added that his Cuban-American upbringing equipped him with a way to maintain his gratitude for those who came before him.
""Me, being a Cuban-American — first-generation Cuban-American — my family, that's one thing that was always embedded into me,"" he explained. ""'We already did it for you. You were born here. Now if you don't take advantage of this country after what we've been through ... ' They were like, 'You have to take full advantage of this country.'""
The rapper explained that history says ""Mexico is not crossing the border. The border crossed Mexico.""
His remarks were met by a sea of applause.
Emboldened, Pitbull added, ""If we're going to talk what it is, that's why you have cities like Los Angeles, San Antonio, El Paso, Las Vegas, San Diego. Sounds like Spanish words to me, or names I would say. It goes to show you somebody was here before.""
""Either, or, guys; we all bleed the same blood and we all breathe the same air,"" he explained. ""We all put our pants on one leg at a time. And when we start figuring that out is when we can really understand that we're not really that different. We're really more similar than we believe.""
Behar interrupted and gushed, ""I think you should run for president.""
What else? The rapper, however, insisted that he wouldn't be seeking the highest office in the land anytime soon.

Bernie Sanders (Vt.) received boos and shouts Wednesday from an audience at a forum in Houston focused on women of color.
What are the details? At the inaugural event hosted by advocacy group She the People , an audience member asked Sanders, ""What do you believe is the federal government's role to fight against the rise of white nationalism and white terrorist acts, and how do you plan to lead on that in your first year as president?""
Sanders began his reply by accusing the Trump administration of discriminatory ""demagoguery"" before touting plans for comprehensive immigration reform, universal health care through Medicare for All, and raising the minimum wage to ""15 bucks an hour.""
That's when the heckling began. Co-hosts Joy Reid and Aimee Allison were both distracted by outbursts from the audience while repeatedly pressing Sanders for more clarity on his answers. Allison asked Sanders to specifically address what he would do about ""white supremacist violence to protect our communities.""
""Oh, right. Absolutely,"" the 77-year-old senator replied, saying, ""I know I date myself a little bit here, but I actually was at the march on Washington with Dr. [Martin Luther] King back in 1963."" At that point, groans were heard from the crowd and according to the Daily Mail , one person shouted: 'We know!'""
The self-proclaimed democratic socialist then paused, becoming visibly miffed by audience members interrupting, before name-dropping again while bragging about his support of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson amid boos and jeers.
While Sanders did enjoy several cheers from the audience during the questioning, the praise was overshadowed by heckling during several parts of his talk.
Anything else? Several other Democratic presidential hopefuls also showed up to answer questions at the forum, including former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Cory Booker (N.J.), and Kamala Harris (Calif.), USA Today reported."

She said yes and we talked for a minute and after a while of talking she told me she lost her husband and that tomorrow would have been their 60th anniversary.""
""I instantly gave my condolences and asked her to come eat with us, which she was excited to do,"" Howard added. ""The point in this is always be kind and be nice to people. You never know what they are going through. This woman changed my outlook on life and how i look at other people. Everyone has a story so do not judge! And people i can't stress this enough.

As first reported by the Boston Herald on Thursday, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts announced federal obstruction of justice charges against Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph and court officer Wesley MacGregor, who are accused of helping an illegal immigrant evade immigration authorities in 2018.
According to court documents, local law enforcement arrested and charged an already twice-deported illegal alien on narcotics laws last spring. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement learned about the arrest, it issued a detainer for the immigrant, who was also previously barred from re-entering the U.S. until 2027.
When a plainclothes officer showed up to execute that warrant on the morning of April 2, 2018, prosecutors say, that's when Judge Joseph and Officer MacGregor got in the way.
""I'm not gonna allow [ICE] to come in here [the courtroom],"" Judge Joseph told a court clerk on the date in question, according to the indictment .
MacGregor is accused of escorting the immigrant defendant out of the courtroom and using his security access card to open the exit so he could slip away later that afternoon.
""This case is about the rule of law,"" United States attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a Department of Justice news release . ""We cannot pick and choose the federal laws we follow, or use our personal views to justify violating the law.""
The indictment also states that the courtroom recorder was turned off — against Massachusetts court rules — for 52 seconds while the judge discussed the matter with the illegal immigrant's lawyer.
Federal authorities are charging Joseph and MacGregor with three obstruction-related counts and have also charged MacGregor with one count of perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury in relation to the matter.
""The people of this country deserve nothing less than to know that their appointed and elected representatives are working on their behalf, while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law, not a personal agenda,"" a statement from Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh said. ""Any conduct which severs the underlying trust that the citizens of this Commonwealth place in those who hold positions of power and authority is a stain on all who swear an oath to protect and serve, with honor and integrity."""
Democratic voters reject their party's identity politics for 2020 election,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democratic-voters-reject-identity-politics,"The Democratic Party's voters have a message for their political stars: We don't care about identity politics.
At least, that's the message from a new poll from Monmouth University, which found that a vast majority of Democratic voters don't consider race or gender as important factors in picking the party's presidential nominee to take on President Donald Trump.
What did the poll say? Despite the party's repeated calls for diversity on the ballot and in government, the voters who will be selecting the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee don't seem to care.
When it comes to race, nearly 90 percent of Democrats said it ""does not matter"" if the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee to challenge Trump is a minority or is white.
When asked whether it would be better for the party to nominate a person of color or a white person, only 5 percent of Democrats said a minority would be better and 6 percent preferred a white candidate.
Some 87 percent of respondents said the nominee's race simply does not matter.
The topic of the nominee's gender received similar responses. More than three-quarters (77 percent) of Democratic votes said it doesn't matter if the nominee is a man or a woman. Only 7 percent said it would be better to nominate a woman; 12 percent said a man would be better."
Police and family services forced Christian Navy vet’s family apart for 7 months following false accusation of sexual abuse. Now he’s suing.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/navy-vet-sues-following-false-accusation-of-sexual-abuse,"A Navy vet and nuclear weapons expert temporarily lost his family, his job, and more after a false accusation of sexual abuse rocked his world.
The man, Adam Lowther, is now suing police and family services for the money that he and his family paid to reunite, and for the pain and suffering that they endured during a time of hell.
What are the details of the incident? Lowther, who worked at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, was arrested in August 2017 on suspicion of sexually abusing his daughter. He was the director of the Air Force's school for Advanced Deterrence Studies.
Authorities arrested Lowther and charged him with criminal sexual penetration of a minor, as well as criminal sexual contact of a minor against his 4-year-old daughter, after the child told her school teacher that her 7-year-old brother and father had both sexually assaulted her.
The teacher called family services to report the child's allegation. Within two hours, deputies arrived at the family's home and immediately took the couple's two children into emergency care for two days because of the allegation. Lowther was taken into custody at the home. He spent a week in jail, and lost both his job and his security clearance during that time. After his release, he could not contact the children throughout the investigation and had to live with an elderly couple from church.
The child was subject to an intrusive and traumatizing physical examination, according to her parents. Later, however, the interview with the child rendered facts that the child admitted that her father only helped her in the bathroom, and did not sexually assault her. The physical examination did not find any evidence of abuse.
In November, family services returned the two children to the custody of their mother.
Reason reported that in the following months, the criminal case against Lowther collapsed.
""Though the detectives had repeatedly threatened to go to a grand jury, they never did so, and thus actual criminal charges never materialized,"" Reason reported. ""In April, the court-mandated therapist opined that Adam was not a threat to the kids.""
Lowther was able to fully reunite and integrate with his family in May 2018.
In October 2018, District Attorney Raul Torrez reviewed the case and wrote a three-page letter detailing the many reasons that his office would not prosecute Lowther.
What's the family doing now? Lowther told Reason that he is filing a lawsuit against the proper authorities over the harrowing case.
Lowther filed the suit in September 2018 against the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Office as well as the state's child welfare department. The suit also alleges that authorities violated the family's constitutional rights several times throughout the investigation, and purports that Lowther children were not in good hands when temporarily placed in foster care.
In his suit, Lowther said that the entities traumatized his family and decimated his career as a nuclear weapons expert. The suit also reported that throughout the investigations, a deputy and a family services investigator made ""misstatements and omitted things in reports or affidavits,"" which ended up misleading judges, according to the Albuquerque Journal . The suit says that the two are ""either unencumbered by the truth or reckless incompetent.""
The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, and alleges that the school did not properly vet the teacher before hiring her. The teacher had reportedly only known the 4-year-old child for a period of eight days before filing the report with family services.
The family is seeking more than $300,000 in damages in the lawsuit, according to Reason . The family also wants to help ensure that no family has to go through this type of trauma again.
Officials from the sheriff's office and the family services department did not comment on the case.
Lowther told Reason that he was heartbroken over the incident.
""We never thought this kind of thing could ever happen,"" Lowther said . ""We assumed that law enforcement was competent and we assumed that they obeyed the law. That was a wrong assumption, but that was our assumption."""
Maryland's GOP governor is calling on Baltimore's mayor to resign as federal agents raid her homes and offices,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/marylands-gop-governor-is-calling-on-baltimores-mayor-to-resign,"Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan is calling on Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh to resign over corruption charges, as federal agents search her two homes and her City Hall office.
Wait...what is she accused of? Pugh self-published a series of children's books about a girl named "" Healthy Holly ."" The University of Maryland Medical System bought more than $500,000 worth of these books. Pugh was a member of the system's volunteer board of directors at the time. Pugh has since apologized for this ""regrettable mistake"" and returned the half million dollars.
Health care company Kaiser Permanente also bought copies of ""Healthy Holly."" Around the same time, the city of Baltimore gave it a $48 million contract.
What happened now?
According to WBAL-TV , the FBI and IRS executed search warrants for Pugh's homes and City Hall offices at roughly 6:30 a.m. local time Thursday. They also searched a nonprofit called the Maryland Center for Adult Training, Pugh's attorney's office, and the home of one of her former top aides, Gary Brown Jr.
In an unrelated case, Brown pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws during Pugh's 2017 mayoral campaign. Pugh is listed as executive director on one of the Maryland Center for Adult Training's tax filings.
Her actions are the focus of both a federal case and a state criminal investigation.
The Washington Post reports that at least one of the cardboard boxes that agents removed from City Hall had the words ""Healthy Holly"" written on it.
In a statement on Twitter , Hogan said:
On April 1, I directed the state prosecutor to investigate the disturbing allegations surrounding Mayor Catherine Pugh's questionable financial dealings with UMMS. Today, agents for the FBI and the IRS executed search warrants at the mayor's homes and offices. Now more than ever, Baltimore City needs strong and responsible leadership. Mayor Pugh has lost the public trust. She is clearly not fit to lead. For the good of the city, Mayor Pugh must resign."

Bombshell from a top border agent: Just 6% of illegal aliens in one sector even claim asylum,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/border-agent-asylum-seekers,"What percentage of illegal aliens crossing the border are claiming asylum? Eighty percent? Fifty? That's what you'd think from listening to the news and the politicians. But what if I told you it could be lower than 10 percent?
The prevailing narrative about our border is that the surge in illegal immigration is dominated by Central American family units who instantly assert a ""credible fear"" of persecution and are immediately processed as asylum seekers and released into our interior with the faint hope that they will show up to a court hearing, where their claim will likely be turned down. While it is likely that the perception of bogus asylum claims as the key to obtaining release into our country is what motivated this wave originally, it appears that few of them are even asserting a bogus credible fear at all. Yet, we are still processing them as if they are legitimate asylees instead of immediately placing them into expedited removal, as required by law .
On Monday, Carl Landrum, deputy chief patrol agent of the Yuma Sector, released a surprising piece of information on Fox News that fundamentally upends the public perception at the border, a fact that would even surprise most in government. ""Only six percent of the people crossing the border are expressing a credible fear and requesting asylum,"" said Agent Landrum, regarding the Yuma Sector specifically.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has declined to answer my request for similar data for other border sectors.
Yuma is one of the sectors where we are seeing large family units from Central America cross almost daily. A whopping 24,198 individuals in family units have been apprehended in Yuma for the first six months of fiscal year 2019, up from 6,487 in FY 2018. Yuma is the third-hardest-hit sector, behind the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso sectors, so the fact that we have it from the deputy chief patrol agent that only six percent of overall apprehensions in that sector are even expressing a credible fear is earth-shattering and has disturbing ramifications.
This revelation means that our government has essentially vitiated the entire Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and has declared a de facto open border. This is not just about the erroneous interpretation of asylum law . We are shredding every word of the INA and processing and releasing almost all of these people, even those who don't express a credible fear, rather than immediately placing them in expedited deportation.
It's true that more people will likely express a ""credible fear"" if we were to do that, but that assertion should be denied, starting a maximum seven-day clock for an appeal . Thereafter, they can be returned to expedited removal, and no immigration judge, much less an Article III judge, can get involved in any way . That is current law , and no new law can be written more emphatically than the one on the books.
The problem is that at this point, they are all being released, and that clock is never starting. Therefore, even if we track them down later on, they can always reassert their claim at that point and further delay deportation.
I first started to suspect that most of the families were not asserting a credible fear when I examined the USCIS credible fear caseload data for the first four months of the fiscal year. USCIS has received 35,310 credible fear cases for the first four months of this fiscal year. That is a high number, but that is roughly on pace for the same high baseline of FY 2018, when we hit nearly 100,000 cases . We are on pace for about 106,000 claims this year.
One would expect with our border numbers crushing those from last year that, if it's being driven primarily by asylum requests of Central American families, the dockets would swell even over last year's numbers. That is simply not the case. There's been a 370 percent increase in family units for the first half of this fiscal year compared with the first half of FY 2018. The one caveat is that the USCIS credible fear caseload data for February and March, the two busiest months, has not yet been published, but based on what we see for the first four months, it's clear that credible fear cases are in no way increasing commensurate to the increase of family units coming in.
Furthermore, data from Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) also confirms this trend. In an analysis titled , ""Newly Arriving Families Not Main Reason for Immigration Court's Growing Backlog,"" TRAC asserts, ""Since September, about one out of every four newly initiated filings recorded by the Immigration Court have been designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as 'family unit' cases."" That is just 41,488 out of 174,628 cases. And that number is really inflated because, as noted by TRAC, ""each parent and each child are separately counted as ""court cases"" even though many are likely to be heard together and resolved as one family unit."" They conclude that ""recent family arrivals"" comprise ""just 4 percent of the current court's 855,807 case backlog "" as of February 28.
Even the liberal Syracuse University, which is clearly upset that the administration is not doing enough to grant bogus asylum claims, articulates the case I've made all along – that nothing in our laws compels this outcome.
Families arriving at the border do not automatically have the right to file for asylum in Immigration Court. Under existing laws, such families must pass a number of hurdles. First, those simply coming for better economic opportunity are subject to expedited removal by DHS – a purely administrative process that doesn't require a decision by any judge. Simply expressing a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home county is also not sufficient. Each family must pass a credible fear or reasonable fear review. Those that do not pass this review do not have an opportunity to proceed and present their asylum claims. Again, such individuals are subject to expedited removal from the country.
So why is this administration not placing every single person who comes to the border into expedited removal? Even if they begin asserting the credible fear claims thereafter, those claims can be denied by Trump through his administrative officials without any review from the courts, and then they are placed back in expedited removal.
The only excuse the government has left is that it doesn't have enough suitable facilities to hold the family units in order to comport with the Flores settlement. But the administration has had months to muster all of its logistical assets and diplomatic prowess with Guatemala and Honduras to begin an airlift to Central America for expedited removal.
Let's put aside those already released as water under the bridge for the time being. Declaring expedited removal for the next wave of illegal immigrants will send an immediate message to those farther down the pipeline that catch-and-release is over. It would be worth clearing out all the facilities (which they are doing anyway) in order to hold just the next group for the week or so needed for removal. There is no reason why this should take more than 20 days.
Moreover, the president can nullify the Flores settlement, which in itself is a violation of law requiring us to detain these people (8 U.S. Code § 1225(B)(iii)(IV)) and write a new procedure for detaining family units together. The DHS published such a proposal on September 7, 2018, but for whatever reason has never promulgated it.
The laws aren't the problem. They are, in fact, the solution. This is not about asylum, because most aren't currently asserting it. Nor is this about asylum law, which was written to prevent this very outcome. This is about the abolishing of our laws and borders.

"AOC goofs again, deletes tweet mistaking Democratic leader for a Republican",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/aoc-goofs-deletes-tweet-mistaking-democratic-leader-for-republican,"In yet another unforced social media gaffe, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) mistook one of her fellow House Democrats for a Republican on Thursday.
In an effort to mock a tweet from the Republican Party of Kentucky, the self-described socialist mocked Republicans for posing ""older male members next to cardboard cutouts of young, female legislators."" In this case, the cutout was of herself.
The only problem is that the tweet wasn't about a Republican. Rather it was about Kentucky Rep. John Yarmuth, the Democratic chairman of the House Budget committee — i.e., a prominent member of her own party's leadership in the House of Representatives where she serves.
The congresswoman (who said she was cutting back on social media earlier this month) deleted her tweet shortly afterward, but screenshots are forever.
Perhaps a close read of the original tweet itself could have helped Ocasio-Cortez avoid this particular gaffe (emphasis added):
"" #ThrowbackThursday last month the socialists threatened the lone #Kentucky #Democrat in Congress if he didn't bend to their radical, extremist will: http://bit.ly/2vl9onV looks like @AOC and #socialism are calling the shots for @KyDems now!""
In fact, the link story in the tweet was about how Yarmuth resisted calls to get on board with Medicare for All proposals despite primary challenge threat from AOC's Democratic Socialists of America.
AOC has been long been criticized for her seemingly constant string of gaffes and mistakes, of which t here has been no shortage between her campaign and first few months in office. She's also previously defended herself against her political critics for seizing on her statements by pointing to her own inexperience in the House.
This writer's perspective If a freshman member of Congress want to come and shake things up in either chamber, as Ocasio-Cortez campaigned on, it would help to do and remember one's homework on who is in charge of running important committees of that chamber at the very least."
Chilean 'tourists' responsible for hundreds of burglaries in the US,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chilean-tourists-responsible-for-hundreds-of-burglaries-in-the-us,"Law enforcement agencies are sounding the alarm over a growing trend: Chilean crime syndicates taking advantage of visa waivers for ""burglary tourism."" Authorities believe the sophisticated operations are responsible for ""hundreds and hundreds"" of heists across the U.S., resulting in losses totaling millions of dollars.
What are the details? Officials are working to determine how many people are involved in the rings, but methodical patterns have emerged linking Chilean nationals to a crime circuit with international scope. According to the Daily Mail , the root of the operations have ""been linked to a corruption scandal in the Chilean capital Santiago, involving bribes to police.""
""There are many Chileans who, being criminals here, travel abroad because they can obtain better treasures,"" Chilean journalist Javiera Rodriguez told the Los Angeles Times . ""In addition, they are very ingenious and create new forms of theft.""
The perpetrators use innovative, signature tactics for jamming car key fobs so they won't lock, disabling or circumventing security systems, and disguising their identities with fake documentation even when they are caught. Their efforts appear to be worth it, too; more than $1 million in jewelry was lifted during a single Chilean-linked raid in California last month. An LAPD captain said it's not uncommon for homeowners to lose $30,000 or $40,000 worth of property if they become victims of the gangs.
In Ventura County, California, such thefts by tourist burglars are ""in the hundreds and hundreds,"" Sheriff's Detective Theodore Stern told the Times. ""It's a huge issue. They're taking advantage of our immigration laws. Officers are working hard to catch these guys.""
While Southern California has become a popular target for the malicious visitors seeking easy-pickings of luxury goods, dozens of Chilean ""tourists"" are believed to be responsible for home, vehicle, and business invasions across the U.S. The problem has been flagged by law enforcement in several other states, including Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and New York.
Anything else? Chilean ""tourist"" gangs have also been blamed for recent waves of burglaries across England , Canada , and Australia . Not only have the operatives earned a reputation for their savvy stealing, they are adept at using visas to legally enter wealthy nations and freely pillage for months.
In spite of their elusive ways, dozens of Chilean suspects have been apprehended in what officials say are widespread, well-coordinated gangs of professionals. Law enforcement agencies across the globe are taking notice, while calling for more stringent background checks on tourists entering their countries."
"Liberal journalist warns media to learn something from their coverage of 'Russiagate,' says the 'fiasco' was 'fake news'",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-journalist-warns-media-to-learn-from-russiagate,"Rolling Stone contributing editor Matt Taibbi, who is by no means anything close to a President Donald Trump supporter, reprimanded the media for its coverage of what he called ""Russiagate."" He accused the media of spreading ""fake news"" to promote an anti-Trump agenda at the expense of its own credibility.
What did he say? In a piece for Rolling Stone , Taibbi called out journalists for congratulating themselves about the parts of the Mueller report that they had gotten right in the past two years. This, Taibbi argued, was not nearly enough.
""We're not trying to be right more often than Trump — we're trying to not be wrong, ever. It's a standard, not a competition,"" he wrote.
""You know what was fake news?"" he added. ""Most of the Russiagate story. There was no Trump-Russia conspiracy, that thing we just spent three years chasing. The Mueller report is crystal clear on this.""
He noted that special counsel Robert Mueller's report mentioned that the Russians had tried to reach the Trump campaign but had found the task difficult. ""Not only was there no 'collusion,' the two camps didn't even have each others' phone numbers!""
Reporters are going to insist all they did was accurately report the developments of a real investigation. They didn't imply vast criminality that wasn't there, or hoodwink audiences into thinking a Watergate-style ending was just around the corner, or routinely blow meaningless episodes like the Sessions-Kislyak meeting out of proportion, or regularly smear people who not only weren't part of a conspiracy but had no connection to anything. He called them out for ""giving big stages to craven conspiracy-spinners like Malcolm Nance and Luke Harding"" and for ""denouncing people who doubted the conspiracy as spies and Putin apologists.""
When it's all said and done, Taibbi warned, the ""fiasco will surely end up being a net plus for Trump.""
""The obstruction parts of the report make him look like a brainless goon and thug, but the absence of what Mueller repeatedly calls 'underlying crime' make his ravings about an elitist mob out to get him look justified,"" he added. ""This is not an easy thing to achieve, but we're there, and the press is a big part of that picture.""
Taibbi concluded that even die-hard liberals would come to distrust the media for its reckless disregard for journalistic standards.
News audiences were betrayed, and sooner or later, even the most virulently Trump-despising demographics will realize it and tune us out. The only way to reverse the damage is to own how big of a screw-up this was, but after the last three years, who would hold their breath waiting for that?"
California wants restaurants to tack an additional 1 percent fee onto customers' bills in an effort to combat climate change,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ca-wants-restaurants-to-tack-an-additional-1-percent-fee-onto-customers-bills-in-an-effort-to-combat-climate-change,"A new initiative to combat climate change has been launched in California, pushed by a coalition of public and private entities hoping to transfer carbon from the air into the soil. In order to pay for the plan aimed at creating ""a renewable food system,"" organizers are asking restaurants in the state to start charging an additional 1 percent fee to their customers.
What are the details? The Perennial Farming Initiative wants restaurateurs to sign up for passing the ""optional"" surcharge along to their patrons, so the funds can be funneled to the California Air Resource Board and ""spent on implementing carbon plans on farms and ranches across California.""
According to a report from KOVR-TV , the idea is being met with mixed reviews.
""Well I live in California and I don't know if you know this or not it's pretty freaking expensive here,"" resident Mike Mattingly told the outlet. ""One percent to somebody who doesn't make that much money ain't a lot but it's a lot more than they have.""
An unnamed passerby in Sacramento told KOVR of the plan, ""I wouldn't be interested in doing that. Leave the climate alone.""
But resident John Peters argued, ""We're not asking our fixed-income people to pay that on their property tax. We're asking that of someone who had made a choice to go out and spend money.""
The initiative is set to launch in the fall, and advocates say it could rake in a lot of dough to be used for carbon sequestration efforts.
Restaurant owner Christopher Barnum-Dann noted, ""There's 78,7000 restaurants in California, so if half of them join on that's almost 40,000, so that's a decent chunk of money"""
Domestic terror suspect Christopher Hasson to be released from detention,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/domestic-terror-suspect-christopher-hasson-to-be-released-from-detention,"A federal judge in Maryland has ruled that accused domestic terrorist Christopher Hasson should be released from detention.
Who is Christopher Hasson? Hasson, a Coast Guard lieutenant, was arrested in February . He has been indicted on weapons and drug charges. Although he has been accused of plotting a domestic terror attack, he has not been charged with this, a point his attorneys were eager to bring up.
Prosecutors allege that Hasson had planned to kill politicians and media personalities, and that he had close ties to white supremacist groups. They say that he wrote a letter to a ""known American neo-Nazi leader"" in 2017 expressing his support for a ""white homeland.""
Hasson also allegedly built up an stockpile of tactical gear, guns, and silencers, and is accused of studying terrorist manifestos. He also apparently looked up the home addresses of two Supreme Court justices. When he was arrested, federal authorities said that Hasson ""intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country.""
U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom argued that it would be unsafe to release Hasson.
""The silencers serve one purpose: to murder quietly,"" he wrote. ""The defendant intended to do so on a mass scale, and his detention has thwarted his unlawful desire.""
Hasson has pleaded not guilty on all counts. His attorneys have called allegations from prosecutors ""inflammatory.""
What happened now? On Thursday, Judge Charles Day said that while he had ""grave concerns"" about Hasson, government prosecutors had not made a strong enough case to justify keeping Hasson in custody. Hasson will remain under supervised release while he awaits his trial. The details will be decided at another hearing.
""He's got to have a whole lot of supervision,"" Day said, according to CNN . ""Somebody who's got eyes and ears on him like nobody's business."""

Fortunately, he got pulled over by a police officer willing to make sure he got where he was going, according to Fox News .
The man, Ka'Shawn Baldwin, was on his way to an interview with FedEx when he got pulled over by Cahokia Police Officer Roger Gemoules, who had noticed the vehicle had expired plates.
Once Baldwin pulled over, he told Gemoules that he didn't have a valid driver's license either, but that he was forced to drive anyway to try to get the job.
However, instead of writing him a ticket and causing Baldwin to miss his interview, Gemoules decided to give Baldwin a safe and legal ride to help him out.
Gemoules' generosity paid off. Baldwin got the job, which he needed in order to earn money to get his license back and update his vehicle tags. He already has another job at McDonalds, which he takes the bus to.
""It meant everything to me. It brought my spirits up; it kind of made me happy,"" Baldwin told Fox Illinois. ""I was shocked that he actually gave me a ride to the interview. Normally, cops are like [asking] where I'm from, they don't really do stuff like that.""

""We just won a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking Trump's attacks on the Title X family planning program,"" tweeted the ACLU account.
""This is a victory for all Americans — especially for patients who turn to Title X,"" they added. ""We will not stop fighting for everyone's right to get the care they need.""
Judge Bastian in the Eastern District of Washington granted the nationwide preliminary injunction to halt the order from President Donald Trump.
The policy was to go into effect on May 3.
The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association released a statement praising the decision.
""We applaud Judge Bastian for prioritizing the health of poor and low-income women and men in his ruling to block the Trump administration's dangerous Title X family planning rule,"" said the statement.
""Since day one, NFPRHA's priority has been to block this unlawful policy that could cut off access to contraception and sexual health care for millions,"" it continued. ""Today's decision sends a message to this administration that it will not get away with making harmful changes to the nation's family planning program, at the expense of people's health care.""

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called Rep. Ilhan Omar to discuss Pres. Trump's tweet about her—here's what he said,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-called-rep-ilhan-omar-to-discuss-pres-trumps-tweet-about-her-heres-what-he-said,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey called Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) to explain why President Donald Trump's tweets about Omar's Sept. 11 comments did not violate the social media site's rules, according to The Washington Post .
Omar came under fire after referring to the September 11 terrorist attacks as ""some people did something,"" and was accused of trivializing the tragedy.
President Trump tweeted about it, and pinned the tweet to the top of his feed for some time. The tweet featured a video that began with Omar's comments and included footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers. The president captioned the tweet, ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!""
Omar has claimed that the tweet sparked a surge of death threats toward her.
""Since the President's tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the President's video,"" Omar said in a statement.
Omar reportedly requested to Dorsey that the president's tweet be deleted from the site. Dorsey reportedly told Omar that the tweet itself did not violate the site's terms of service, and that the video Pres. Trump posted had already been circulated far outside Twitter anyway.
Twitter also issued a statement about the call.
""During their conversation, [Dorsey] emphasized that death threats, incitement to violence, and hateful conduct are not allowed on Twitter,"" the statement read. ""We've significantly invested in technology to proactively surface this type of content and will continue to focus on reducing the burden on the individual being targeted. Our team has also consistently been in touch with Rep. Omar's office.""
Dorsey's conversation reportedly took place the same day that the Twitter CEO met with President Trump, during which the president reportedly complained that his followers on the site were being targeted and removed.

Border town mayor and his wife arrested by Texas Rangers for organized illegal voting scheme,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrat-texas-mayor-arrested,"The mayor of a border town in Texas was arrested Thursday and charged with allegedly orchestrating an illegal voting scheme in his own election in 2017.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a statement about the charges against Edinburg Mayor Richard Molina and his wife Dalia Molina.
""Voter fraud is an affront to democracy and places the decision-making authority of the Texas electorate in the hands of those who have no right to make those choices,"" said Paxton in the statement.
""Voter apathy is caused by rigged elections with guaranteed outcomes,"" he explained . ""My office will always do everything it can to protect the integrity of Texas elections and the rights of every legal voter to cast a ballot and have it counted accurately. No one is above the law.""
The Molinas are charged with using fraudulent vote registrations in order to inflate his vote tally. Sixteen others have also been arrested in connection with the alleged voter fraud ring.
""His vote harvesting scheme involved the participation of paid campaign workers, among others,"" said Paxton. ""Molina won the election, unseating long-time Edinburg Mayor Richard Garcia by 1,240 votes.""
""Texas is cracking down on election fraud,"" tweeted Texas Governor Greg Abbott on social media in response to the arrest.
Molina vehemently denies the charges and says he will fight them in court. If convicted, he faces 5 to 99 years in prison, or life.

Hill had been accused of breaking his 3-year-old son's arm in an incident that brought police to his home, but charges against him were dropped this week. Police said they believed a crime had occurred but claimed they couldn't definitively determine who did it.
While Hill may be out of the woods in terms of criminal liability, this audio does not help his reputation with the public or his standing with the NFL.
The audio was reportedly secretly recorded by Hill's fiancee Crystal Espinal while they were walking through an airport in Dubai in March.
In the recording, Espinal accuses Hill of punching their son in the chest when he cries and hitting him with a belt when he gets in trouble. She tells Hill that their son is ""terrified"" of him. Hill argues that his son respects him, then fires back threateningly at his fiancee.
""You need to be terrified of me too, b****,"" Hill allegedly says on the recording. ""That's why you can't keep a f***ing man.""

Hill has a violent background . In 2015, while he was a student at Oklahoma State, he was accused of choking Espinal and punching her in the face and stomach while she was pregnant with their son. He pleaded guilty to the charges and got probation.
Hill denies the most recent accusations of abuse.
""I love and support my family above anything,"" Hill said in a statement Thursday. ""I want to thank the Kansas City Chiefs, my attorneys, my agent and my union for supporting me through this. My focus remains on working hard to be the best person for my family and our community I can be, and the best player to help our team win.""

Joe Rogan bulldozes through the talking points of the transgender agenda in stunning video,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/joe-rogan-on-transgender-debate,"Comedian Joe Rogan dismantled arguments defending many of the policies advocated by transgender activists in an interview with fellow comedian Adam Conover.
Conover, who is known for his show ""Adam Ruins Everything,"" defends many transgender positions, while Rogan politely but forcefully pointed out the internal inconsistencies.
""There's no reason to give kids hormones,"" argued Rogan. ""And there's no reason to decide before a person's frontal lobe is completely fully developed, which doesn't even take place until they're 25.
""People don't know who they are, a 7-year-old,"" he continued, ""people don't even give their 7 year-old phones, you don't let them vote, you're gonna let them decide what sex they're gonna be for the rest of their life?""
Conover gave the example of a friend of his who thought it was humane to respect the decision of their young boy to identify as a girl.
""But if that's who they are,"" asked Rogan, ""if they think they are a girl, why do you have to give them hormones to make them more of a girl?""
Conover asked him to expand on the question.
""It's a simple question,"" Rogan responded. ""If you say that the child thinks it's a girl, so you're gonna give the child hormones, if the child thinks it's a girl, let it be a girl. Why are you adding hormones?
""If you're shooting hormones into a child,"" he explained, ""and you're affecting the child's development, and you're saying that's not a choice, that's nonsense, of course it's a choice. You're choosing to chemically change this child's body.""
Rogan cited a study that showed that ""gender affirmation"" surgery led to ""considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.""
Conover responded by pointing to lower rates of gender dysphoria and improved sexual relationships after the transgender surgeries.
""Right, before they killed themselves, everything is awesome?!"" Rogan responded.
Here's the video of Rogan's debate: Joe Rogan DEYSTROYS Adam Conover in Trans-Children Hormone Debate!! www.youtube.com
""My entire concern is that you're making decisions for children,"" said Rogan, ""and that this is a completely new thing with no historical precedent, we've never done this before.""
""When you're stepping in to a developing baby that's only been alive for six years, and you're shooting chemicals into its body to change the way it develops, show me the research!"" he demanded forcefully later in the interview.
""Show me the decades of peer-reviewed studies on one of the most important things that we know of, the development of a human being!"" Rogan concluded.
What about trans women in sports?
Rogan also sharply disagreed with Conover about the hot button issue of trans women in sports. Conover defended the practice of allowing athletes who were born male to participate in female sports by saying, ""I think when we're talking about people, we should always try to include more people, not less.... if you're a double amputee and you can make your way into the olympics, and you can make a plausible case, I think we should entertain that notion....
""As far as trans athletes go, we could sit here and talk for three hours about, like, all the different ways that hormones might affect your body and your might not affect your body, and I'm not an expert on that... but, a sport with trans athletes who are competing with their gender, right? That is a sporting world that I'm more interested in. I know it's gonna be really complicated and messy... but I hope that's the world that we move forward to.""
Rogan strongly disagreed, saying that ""There's a reason we make the distinction to have male athletics versus female athletics. The reason is that men have a physiological advantage over women. So in most physical sports we do not have males compete with females. The question becomes when someone who is born male transitions to female, do those physiological advantages apply, and what is the evidence?
""Well, the evidence in competition seems to be that it does apply... males that transition to females have a significant advantage and they're breaking world records. So if you're a woman and you're a natural woman and you're not taking any sort of hormones or steroids or performance enhancing drugs, you're doing your very best to compete and you're at the top of the heap, but then someone comes along that was a man for 30 years, and decides that they're going to be a woman — and this has happened — and literally transitioned a few months ago and competes as a woman and destroys records and dominates you in that sport, that's bulls**t. And that's not competing on a level playing field.""
Rogan emphatically declared, ""It's not fair. It's as much cheating as taking steroids when the other person doesn't, or taking performance enhancing drugs when the other person doesn't. Maybe even more so, because there's a bunch of advantages in terms of reaction times that males enjoy. There's a significant difference in reaction times between males — even untrained males versus female professional athletes."""
Health officials issue quarantine at two California colleges — here's why,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/measles-outbreak-in-california,"Health officials announced a quarantine for some students and teachers at two California universities over concerns about a possible measles outbreak.
More than 200 students and teachers who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease have been asked to stay home.
The universities affected were UCLA and Cal State Los Angeles, where officials say at least one student has been infected with the disease.
Only five persons have thus far contracted the disease in Los Angeles County, but officials hope to prevent the kind of outbreaks that have been seen in other states. 38 persons have been infected in the state of California so far this year.
The quarantine was ordered for those persons who might have been in contact with those carrying the disease, but who also could not provide proof of receiving a vaccine for measles.
Officials says that anti-vaccination propaganda might explain why there is a rise in states like California, despite the very strict vaccination laws there.
Dr. Armand Dorian, the chief medical officer at USC Verdugo Hills Hospital, explained that outbreaks are often caused by travelers to other countries who pick up a disease and import it back the U.S., but there's another reasons too.
""The more recent generation of parents have not vaccinated as many children, so the potential for it to be spread has increased, which heightens our fear,"" he explained.
""The potential for illness outweighs any other side effect"" of vaccinations, Dorian explained. ""That risk is quite high. Measles actually kills people, so we have to take that really seriously.
""Who does it kill?"" he asked rhetorically. ""Usually it kills those young people who don't have the ability to make a decision.""
Dorian said that the chances that someone will get measles from an infected person in the same room is at about 90 percent.
Here's a news report about the quarantine:

College students could end up paying for their classmates' abortions under new California bill,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-students-could-end-up-paying-for-their-classmates-abortions-under-new-calif-bill,"College kids might be forced to pay for their fellow classmates' abortions under a new California bill.
As highlighted by The College Fix , the bill, if passed, would mandate that all public universities in California provide abortion pills to students who ""need"" them.
What are the details? The bill, SB-24 , would force public colleges to have RU-486 on hand, a drug to terminate first trimester abortions. The program would be funded by student fees, effectively forcing fellow students to pay for their classmates' abortions.
The California Senate Education Committee met in Sacramento, California, on Wednesday for a hearing on the proposed bill. The committee invited the public to either voice their support or testify against the proposed bill.
Students for Life of America was one group that attended the hearing.
Kristan Hawkins, student president of the organization, testified in front of the committee in an effort to help strike down the bill. To support her stance, Hawkins cited an April FDA report finding that in the last 20 years, 24 women have died as a result of RU-486.
""Are California's schools prepared to handle the repercussions of students experiencing possibly life-ending bleeding and infections, caused by the abortion pills the school is providing?"" Hawkins asked.
She added that it isn't fair that students be forced to pay for their classmates' abortions, since the program would be funded by student fees.
""Given that the both UC and CSU health programs are funded through student fees, it is not just possible but likely students will ultimately be paying for their classmates' abortions. Further, no provision has been made in the proposal to protect the conscience rights of students or health center personnel, who don't want to fund or support toilet seat abortions, ending human life on college and university campuses,"" she said.
Hawkins told The College Fix that her intended purpose of testifying at the hearing was to spread news of the bill as a warning to other states that might be considering the same type of legislation.
""[California] Gov. Newsome has already said he'll sign it into law, and they've already said they want to use California as a prototype for other states,"" Hawkins said. ""What happens here will transfer to other states.""
Democrats currently hold a large majority in both the California State Senate and House. If the bill passes through the California Senate Education Committee, it will head to the the Senate Appropriations Committee for a second vote. If passed, it would go to the California State Assembly, and then onto the governor's desk."
Taking back US sovereignty: President Trump ditches UN treaty,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/taking-back-us-sovereignty-trump-ditches-un-treaty,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that the United States is withdrawing from a United Nations treaty that regulates international arms trade, arguing that the multilateral accord chips away at U.S. sovereignty.
Speaking at the National Rifle Association's annual convention in Indianapolis, the president tore into the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty, which was signed in 2013 by former President Barack Obama.
""Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone,"" Trump told attendees at the NRA gathering. ""We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedoms.""
While delivering his speech, the president, on stage, signed the paperwork necessary for thwarting the ratification process.
The Hill reported on the raucous scene at the NRA convention:
""Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone,"" Trump told the group, which erupted in applause. ""We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedoms.
Trump signed paperwork instructing the Senate to halt the ratification process, held up the document as the crowd cheered ""U-S-A, U-S-A,"" then tossed his pen into the crowd.""
Conservative groups have long opposed the Arms Trade Treaty on grounds that it threatened the sovereignty of the U.S. and hurt America's international competitive edge.
""The ATT is one of several treaties in the field of conventional and nuclear weapons that seek to constrain the ability of the United States to make decisions about how it defends itself and its allies,"" Theodore Bromund of the Heritage Foundation explained in a 2018 report on the treaty. ""The ATT has no substantive achievements and is fundamentally unserious, but its effort to promote norms to shape U.S. policymaking poses significant risks to U.S. security.""
In a fact sheet posted online after the president's speech, the White House contended that the treaty failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent ""irresponsible arms transfers.""
""The ATT will only constrain responsible countries while allowing the irresponsible arms trade to continue,"" the fact sheet added. ""Currently, 63 countries are completely out of the agreement, including major arms exporters like Russia and China.""
The White House release added that the move will help protect American sovereignty and advance U.S. national interests.
Although the treaty was signed by Obama, it was never ratified, a process that requires the support of two-thirds by the Senate. Congress has repeatedly banned federal funding for the arms control treaty under amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act."
‘Black Hawk Down’ mission vets hit back at Rep. Ilhan Omar’s criticisms,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/black-hawk-down-vets-hit-back-at-ilhan-omar,"Veterans of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu are hitting back at 2017 criticisms that surfaced earlier this week from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that appeared to attack their role in the conflict.
As reported by Conservative Review's Jordan Schachtel, a 2017 tweet from Somali-American Omar said, ""he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day!"" in response to a post commemorating the loss of 19 U.S. service members during the two-day operation. She added the hashtag ""#NotTodaySatan.""
""In helping her tribe, we had to eliminate those who were bad,"" former U.S. Delta Force operator Kyle Lamb told the Washington Examiner in response to Omar's criticisms. ""She should be thankful we were there to help her people.""
United States forces were in Somalia as part of United Nations peacekeeping efforts in 1993 when they were attacked by Somali militiamen. The original mission was to ensure that food aid sent to the struggling country would not be hijacked before it reached the people it was supposed to feed.
Eighteen U.S. personnel died in the main battle, and one was later killed by a mortar round. Two U.S. Black Hawk helicopters were shot down in the firefight, leading to the title of the 1999 book and 2001 major motion picture that immortalized the efforts of elite fighters in Task Force Ranger during the battle.
""I really am offended, truly offended, by her comment and her thought that thousands were killed by us,"" retired Army Ranger Col. Danny McKnight told the outlet. ""Not true. Not true at all.""
A 1997 story at the Philadelphia Inquirer estimates that around 500 Somalis died throughout the course of the battle.
McKnight also explained to the Examiner that the Battle of Mogadishu wasn't just a single fight, contrary to what was implied in Omar's tweet. In reality, there were multiple confrontations between U.S. and Somali forces.
""We had six fights before we ever got to number seven, which is the one known as 'Black Hawk Down,'"" he said. ""I think [Omar's] idea was that there was really one that just took place.""
Omar's comments were unearthed by the Investigative Project on Terrorism. The full story can be found here .
""As a nation, we and our political leadership should be proud of what we did there,"" pilot Mike Durant, who was beaten and captured after his Black Hawk was downed in the fighting, told IPT. ""We put our most precious resource on the line to help starving people. In return, my friends' remains and those of my comrades were dragged through the streets.
""I do not hold all Somalis accountable for the actions of a few,"" Durant added, ""but I certainly take issue with the remarks of Congresswoman Omar."""
Junior high administrator on leave after allegedly coloring in student's haircut design with permanent marker,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/junior-high-administrator-on-leave-after-allegedly-coloring-in-students-haircut-design-with-permanent-marker,"An administrator at Berry Miller Junior High in Pearland, Texas, is on leave after allegedly coloring in a student's haircut design with a permanent marker, KTRK-TV reported .
The administrator reportedly told seventh-grader Juelz Trice his hair carving — featuring what appears to be a stylized letter M — violated dress code and gave him an ultimatum, the station said.
""He came over and said, 'You have two options: You can either go to [in-school suspension] or color it in,'"" the student told KTRK. ""Everyone was coming up to me. It was like the talk of the school that day and the day after.""
Image source: KTRK-TV video screenshot
The boy's father Dante Trice told the station regarding the administrator and another staff member: ""Hold my son against his will and color his hair in, then he said they [were] laughing while they're doing it ... so like my kid's a joke.""
Mother Angela Washington posted the following on Facebook last week:
What did the school district have to say? Pearland Independent School District told the Houston Chronicle in a statement that Juelz's haircut violated dress code, which prohibits ""extreme hair styles such as carvings, mohawks, spikes, etc."" But officials also acknowledged to the paper that coloring in a hair carving ""is not condoned by the district and does not align with appropriate measures for dress code violations.""
District officials didn't specify if the administrator used a marker on the student's head, the Chronicle added.
What did a school board member have to say? Pearland ISD Trustee Mike Floyd told the paper that the administrator in question ""should not be a leader on a campus with very impressionable children.""
""From what we're seeing emerging right now in the public discourse, it's just absolutely inappropriate what occurred,"" Floyd added to the Chronicle. ""The real problem is there's a clear and obvious display of a lack of judgment.""
What else did the parents have to say? ""When it first happened, I was very upset because I didn't find out until after he got off the bus, and he got into the car and said, 'Look what they did to my head,'"" Washington told KTRK.
Dante Trice added to the station that his son could have been placed at medical risk because of chemicals from the marker touching open pores from the haircut he got the day before.
""I'm totally disappointed,"" Dante Trice told KTRK. ""Totally disappointed.""
Anything else? Juelz returned to school, the station said, and Washington indicated that the administrator in question called to share his side of the story.
""They were very apologetic, but it still happened,"" she added to KTRK. ""You know, for an adult, no one should think that's the correct way to handle a situation.""
Officials told the station further action will take place apart from the administrator being placed on leave.

During the interview, Biden touched upon his time in the White House as former President Barack Obama's vice president, and offered up a rather interesting tidbit about his pride at serving in the Obama administration.
What happened? In a discussion about politics and his lengthy political career, Biden told the show's co-hosts that he was most proud of a scandal-free Obama administration.
""I'm ... incredibly proud to have served with [Obama],"" he said. ""The thing I'm proudest of is — we, coincidentally, were each at a different part of the country, and we were each talking to groups of people that we being televised, and at the same day, purely coincidentally, we got asked the question, 'What are you proudest of in your administration?'
""And know what I said? It turns out he said the same thing, and probably a little more clearly than I did,"" he laughed. ""'Not one, single whisper of scandal. Not one, single whisper of scandal.'""
So here are some scandals Interestingly enough, co-host Joy Behar also claimed earlier this month that the Obama administration was scandal-free.
Some of those scandals include:
Fast and Furious program Benghazi attack IRS targeting conservative groups Wiretapping journalists Solyndra subsidies Chicago hospital with Obama ties Veterans' waiting list GSA spending spree Guantanamo Bay lies What else happened on Friday's show? Biden also tackled allegations that he had inappropriately touched several women.
Co-host Sunny Hostin asked Biden, ""Are you sorry for what you did? Are you prepared to apologize to those women?""
Biden, who has insisted that he's a hugger and that he never had any nefarious intentions with any of the women who said that they felt odd around him, answered that he would simply try to be more aware.
""A producer backstage said, 'I remember you were the only guy to get up and walk into the audience and talk to people,'"" Biden said. ""I think it's important we listen. I think it's important elected officials listen and understand what people are going through, and what they're concerned about. I don't think it's old-fashioned. Everybody should be doing that, but I have to be more careful.""
He added, ""I'm really sorry if what I did in talking to [the women] or trying to console — that they took it a different way. I'm sorry this happened. I'm not sorry in the sense that I think I did anything that was intentionally designed to do anything wrong or be inappropriate."""

""I am sorry I didn't understand more,"" Biden said after a former Democratic state lawmaker last month accused him of touching her inappropriately . ""I am not sorry for any of my intentions. I am not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I've never been disrespectful, intentionally, to a man or a woman.""
Recent polls indicated Biden leads President Donald Trump in a hypothetical 2020 showdown as well all other Democratic presidential candidates .
How did students react? Phillips showed students the clip compilation of Biden touching females, and many were clearly disturbed by the images.

Among their reactions:
""Ewww! Oh my."" ""Oh, no."" ""Oh my gosh."" ""What's he doing?"" ""You can kind of tell they're uncomfortable with the way he acts."" ""That's definitely, like, very excessive. Like, there's no need to be grabbing at people like that."" ""That's really creepy."" ""Definitely creepy ... there's young women, a little bit older women, so it's just very wrong, and that should not be a thing."" Image source: YouTube screenshot

Prosecutors: Man ran prostitution ring out of parents' basement for years — and they never knew,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/prostitution-ring-run-from-parents-basement,"A New York man has been accused of running a prostitution ring involving as many as 22 women over the course of four years from the basement of his apparently unassuming parents' home.
What are the details? Suffolk County District Attorney Tim Sini says 47-year-old Raymond Rodio III started the operation in 2014. The suspect is accused of plying women with heroine and crack cocaine, holding them in the basement against their will, and pimping them out to clients.
""This is a dangerous and depraved individual,"" Sini told reporters Thursday, according to WABC-TV . ""He kept women locked up in the basement of his parents' house. He used the basement of his parents' home as a dungeon. He preyed on women using their vulnerabilities and their drug dependencies to maintain his control over them.""
Rodio allegedly drugged the women to impair their judgment and made them have sex with men in the basement and various hotel rooms. He is also accused of keeping the cash the women received from johns and instead providing the women with more drugs to feed their habits.
Prosecutors say the basement does not have a bathroom, so the women were forced to use a bucket instead of a toilet.
Rodio's father told WABC he had no idea his son was running a prostitution ring, but, ""I knew something was going on. Drugs, that I know. I've tried to get him into so many drug programs.""
The suspect's parents have not been charged with any crimes.
A neighbor reported seeing one particular car parked in the street some distance from the home on occasion, and noted ""a girl would get out and walk down the block rather than parking at the house, which I though was kind of strange.""
Anything else? The Associated Press reported that Rodio pleaded not guilty to several charges, including sex trafficking and promoting prostitution. The alleged pimp remains in jail on a $2 million bond.
Investigators believe Rodio was feeding his own crack habit with the proceeds from his operation."

Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) says that she was ""afraid"" of Americans in the days following the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
What are the details? Tlaib made the admission in a segment filmed for Makers . She said that she was in law school in 2001 when the deadly attacks — which killed nearly 3,000 people — occurred.
""I was probably my second year in law school when 9/11 happened,"" Tlaib said. ""And I was — I was really terrified of what was going to happen to my husband, who's only a green card holder at the time.""
Tlaib said that she went into a panic and phoned her family to warn them.
""I immediately called my brothers and told them to be very careful who you hang out with, telling my sisters, you know, just be real careful out there, and being really afraid of my fellow Americans,"" she admitted. ""It really pushed me to be more involved, and I got really curious and really angry. And I think that combination got me, you know, in front of a number of issues in the city of Detroit."""
Russian spy who was active in GOP politics and NRA gets sentenced to 18 months,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/russian-spy-who-was-active-in-gop-politics-and-nra-gets-sentenced-to-18-months,"Russian spy Maria Butina has been sentenced to 18 months in prison .
Who is Maria Butina? Butina (whose first name is sometimes spelled Mariia) is a 30-year-old Russian citizen who moved to the United States and became active in Republican politics. While she was living in Washington, D.C., Butina attended events including National Rifle Association conventions, rallies for President Donald Trump, and the National Prayer Breakfast. She also studied at American University.
She was arrested on July 15 in Washington, D.C., and charged ""with conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.""
Butina pleaded guilty in December to trying to promote Russian interests before the 2016 election. She said she had been gathering intelligence on the NRA and other conservative groups.
What happened now? On Friday, Butina was sentenced to 18 months in prison. She will receive credit for the nine months previously served. After her sentence is finished, she will be deported. She is currently being held in a prison in Alexandria, Virginia.
Judge Tanya Chutkan said that what Butina had done ""was no simple misunderstanding by an overeager foreign student."" The conduct was sophisticated and penetrated deep into political organizations,"" she added.
In their sentencing memo, U.S. government prosecutors wrote:
Butina was not a spy in the traditional sense of trying to gain access to classified information to send back to her home country. Acquiring information valuable to a foreign power does not necessarily involve collecting classified documents or engaging in cloak-and-dagger activities. Something as basic as the identification of people who have the ability to influence policy in a foreign power's favor is extremely attractive to those powers. This identification could form the basis of other forms of intelligence operations, or targeting, in the future.
What did she say? ""I deeply regret this crime,"" Butina said on Friday during her hearing. ""Ironically, it has harmed my attempts to improve relationships between the two countries."""

What are the details? Climate change activists across London have been protesting going on two weeks, but one woman took her protest to the next level and glued her breasts to Fleet Street outside of Goldman Sachs.
The Sun reported that the woman — who was protesting with Extinction Rebellion — glued her top half to the road outside the global investment company Goldman Sachs.
Police arrived on the scene and surrounded the woman, removing her from the ground at one point. They erected screens to protect her modesty. Officers eventually led her away from the street.
What else? The BBC reported that Extinction Rebellion's climate change protests have resulted in nearly 1,100 arrests.
The unnamed woman wasn't the only one gluing herself to curious places — authorities escorted seven people who'd glued themselves to one another and to a wall at the London Stock Exchange.
The protesters were wearing signs that complained of ""climate emergency"" and more.
One protester told the outlet that the demonstrators chose the London Stock Exchange because people inside are ""making millions, even billions, of pounds out of trading ecological destruction.""
In a statement, Extinction Rebellion said, ""We will leave the physical locations but a space for truth-telling has been opened up in the world. We know we have disrupted your lives. We do not do this lightly. We only do this because this is an emergency.""

"WATCH: Trump stresses importance of vaccines amidst measles outbreak, says people 'have to get their shots'",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-importance-of-measles-vaccine,"Measles is making a resurgence in the United States, and President Donald Trump wants people to get vaccinated in response.
""They have to get their shots,"" the president told reporters outside the White House on his way to the National Rifle Association's annual meeting in Indianapolis. ""The vaccinations are so important.
""This is really going around now,"" he continued. ""They have to get their shots.""
In the past, President Trump has been publicly pro-vaccine but has expressed concerns about the potential side effects of giving young children a lot of them in a short window of time.
""I am totally in favor of vaccines. But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time,"" candidate Trump said at a 2015 GOP primary debate. ""Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me.""
And despite widespread media coverage of some of his 2014 tweets on the subject, President Trump's Centers for Disease Control clearly states that "" there is no link between vaccines and autism.""
Measles is a virus that can be serious and even fatal for small children, the Mayo Clinic explains , it kills around 100,000 people annually. It is evidenced by respiratory symptoms and a telltale rash.
The U.S. is currently seeing its worst year for measles cases since the disease was declared eliminated almost 20 years ago, according to the CDC.
As of Wednesday afternoon, the agency reported a total of 695 cases of measles across 22 different states and attributed the sum primarily to large outbreaks in Washington state and New York.
""This current outbreak is deeply troubling and I call upon all healthcare providers to assure patients about the efficacy and safety of the measles vaccine,"" CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a a statement . ""And, I encourage all Americans to adhere to CDC vaccine guidelines in order to protect themselves, their families, and their communities from measles and other vaccine preventable diseases. We must work together as a Nation to eliminate this disease once and for all."""
"Dabo Swinney once needed a miracle to pay tuition. Now, he holds college football's biggest coaching contract",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/dabo-swinney-signs-record-contract,"Dabo Swinney took over as Clemson University's head football coach during an incredibly troubled 2008 season. In the years since, he has led the Tigers to become a powerhouse team, with two national championships in the last three years. The school's previous national title was in 1981.
And on top of that, he's now the highest-paid college football coach in the United States.
According to a Friday report from the Greenville News, Clemson handed Swinney his second contract extension in three years Friday morning, and this one is for a whopping $93 million over the course of the next 10 years. The contract was unanimously approved by the Clemson Board of Trustees Compensation Committee.
""I don't think the board can really capture the gratitude for Coach Swinney and the way he has run his program,"" committee Chairman Smyth McKissick said in anticipation of the vote, according to the South Carolina newspaper.
The contract gives Swinney $10.25 million in the first year of the contract, with $8.25 million in total salary. The sum of total compensation over the next decade puts him ahead of all his other fellow Division I head coaches, including the University of Alabama's Nick Saban, Texas A&M's Jimbo Fisher, and the University of Michigan's Jim Harbaugh.
""I'm going to have to hit him up and we're going to have to go break his back at a steakhouse,"" former Clemson player and newly drafted Miami Dolphin Christian Wilkins said. ""It's well deserved.""
""I am grateful and humbled by the incredible commitment Clemson has made to me, my family and our football program,"" Swinney said in a statement . ""For more than a decade, we have given our all to provide this world-class university and our incredible fans the championship football program they deserve — to live up to Best is the Standard .""
Addressing recent concerns that Swinney may one day leave Clemson for his Alabama alma mater, the contract also reportedly contains an ""enhanced buyout"" to serve as an incentive against leaving his current job for the team he has faced in three of the last four national championships.
Swinney, 49, has definitely come a long way from the days when, as he likes to tell it, a desperate prayer and an unexplained credit card in the mail got him the $1,000 loan he needed for rent and tuition so he could play college football, but he definitely didn't get there all alone. Throughout his career, faith has been a consistent driving force for Clemson's head coach.
""All the credit, all the glory, goes to the good Lord!"" Swinney exclaimed after winning his second national title. A sportscaster even once apologized for cutting away from a faith-filled ""sermon"" Swinney gave after a 2015 game against Notre Dame University.
""It's hard to survive and thrive in this world if you don't have a spiritual foundation and have something that will give you peace, because life is hard,"" Swinney said at a 2018 news conference . ""We're all going to experience death and failure and setbacks and disappointments and cancer, and it's just a really difficult world. For me, God is always, and my relationship with Christ, he's given me hope and peace."""
The latest supporter of building a 'high wall' on the border is liberal NY Times columnist Tom Friedman,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/liberal-ny-times-columnist-calls-for-high-border-wall,"During a CNN interview, pro-immigration liberal New York Times columnist Tom Friedman said he thought it was time that the United States built a ""high wall with a big gate"" on the border with Mexico .
Wait...what did he say? In a Tuesday column for the New York Times , Friedman wrote about a trip he took earlier this month to the San Ysidro Port of Entry in San Diego. After being taken on a tour by the U.S. Border Patrol and discussing some statistics about illegal immigration, Friedman came to what was perhaps a surprising conclusion:
The whole day left me more certain than ever that we have a real immigration crisis and that the solution is a high wall with a big gate — but a smart gate . Friedman said that the current ""unthinking approach"" to immigration was critically flawed. He argued that it encouraged illegal immigration while discouraging highly skilled foreign workers from legally immigrating.
Without a high wall, too many Americans will lack confidence that we can control our borders, and they therefore will oppose the steady immigration we need. But for this wall to have a big gate, it has to be a smart and compassionate one, one that says, ""Besides legitimate asylum seekers, we'll accept immigrants at a rate at which they can be properly absorbed into our society and work force, and we'll favor visa seekers with energies and talents that enrich and advance our society."" That's the opposite of the unstrategic, far-too random, chaotic immigration ""system"" we have now. During a CNN interview, Friedman stressed that he was ""as radically pro-immigration as they come"" but said it was clear to him that ""unless we can assure a significant number of Americans that we can control our border, we're never going to have the proper immigration flow I think we need.""
Friedman also suggested that President Donald Trump had the ability to reach a workable immigration compromise with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)."
"1,300 Cuban migrants escape Mexican detention center - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/1-300-cuban-migrants-escape-from-mexican-detention-center,"More than 1,300 migrants — mostly of Cuban descent — escaped an immigrant detention center in southern Mexico on Thursday, amid complaints of overcrowding and insufficient supplies at the facility.
What are the details? According to the National Migration Institute, the detainees busted out of the facility following a riot that began inside. Officials said there was no major confrontation with the agents guarding the compound, and more than half the migrants returned on their own accord — while another 600 remain unaccounted for.
The Associated Press reported that federal police carrying riot shields rushed inside the detention center after the mass escape in order to diffuse the situation, ""as a crowd of angry Cubans whose relatives were being held at the facility gathered outside.""
One family member, Usmoni Velazquez told the AP, ""My wife and child have been in there for 27 days in bad conditions. There is overcrowding, insufficient food and there isn't even medicine for them.""
The Telegraph reported that migrants claim the Siglo XXI center located in the border city of Tapachula has held upward of 3,000 people at times, but was only built for a capacity of 1,000. Not all of the detainees took part in the mass escape, but purported footage of the chaos was circulated on social media.
The AP called the incident ""embarrassing,"" given that the unrest occurred on the same day Mexico's top human rights official toured the facility.
Anything else? Reuters reported that late Thursday, roughly 400 migrants boarded a freight train located in Chiapas, which is the same state where the breakout occurred. It is unclear how many, if any, of the train passengers had fled from the Siglo XXI center. According to the outlet, the migrants on the train were ""hoping to reach the United States.""
Mexico has been under pressure from President Donald Trump and his administration to assist in apprehending and deporting migrants attempting to pass through the country on their way to the U.S.
According to The Independent , Mexico has returned 15,000 migrants over the past month. But the country is being overwhelmed with massive caravans of migrants funneling in from South and Central American countries en route to America."
Stink bomb set off at Jeff Sessions talk in college chapel as apparent part of left-wing student protest,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/stink-bomb-set-off-at-jeff-sessions-talk-in-college-chapel-as-apparent-part-of-left-wing-student-protest,"A stink bomb greeted audience members at former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' talk Wednesday at a chapel on the campus of Amherst College in Massachusetts, the Amherst Student reported .
The campus paper said an ""unknown person deployed"" the stink bomb as listeners were entering Johnson Chapel and taking their seats.
Sessions was picked as attorney general by President Donald Trump but resigned last November at Trump's request . The president had criticized Sessions for recusing himself from the Russian collusion investigation.
The walkout
Five minutes into Sessions' talk — which was planned by the Amherst College Republicans — nearly 70 students stood up and exited in a coordinated walkout, the paper added, noting ""their cheers and shouts were marked with exhilaration. One student waved a rainbow pride flag.""
The Amherst Student said more than half of the chapel was empty after the walkout.
The paper noted that protesters then headed to a quad where the Direct Action Coordinating Committee and other groups had tables with food and drinks waiting.
The chant
""No justice, no peace! No racist police!"" the protesters chanted, the paper added. ""Ain't no power like the power of the people because the power of the people don't stop!""
Student Samantha Schriger noted to the paper that Sessions doesn't deserve a platform to speak anywhere.
""I attended the walkout because I wanted to join in a collective with my fellow students and take a stance ... we're fighting for the world we want, and Jeff Sessions stands for one world, one very much in the past … and another world is possible,"" she told the Amherst Student. ""The goal of the walkout was to basically leave Jeff Sessions' world and enter a different world where we can engage in activism in the valley.""
The following statement was read aloud by a DACC member after the walkout, the paper said:
""When Amherst College Republicans and the Young America's Foundation, went out of their way to invite Sessions to this campus, they knew very well that the action was one of power, not of free speech. We suspect that they intended to provoke students of color to react in such a way that would paint student-organizers of color as aggressive, fitting neatly into the narrative that has vilified racialized bodies in this country for centuries. We oppose not only Jeff Sessions, not only the Amherst College Republicans and not only the Young America's Foundation, but the global system of white supremacy which created them, which funds them, which feeds them. We stand firmly against global hierarchies that attempt to maintain themselves through the veneer of 'free speech' rhetoric. We stand for the power, the sanctity and the love of every human being. And we decry the cowardice, on this campus and off, which allowed for Sessions — and those like him — to continue waging a war on marginalized people."" Professor: Amherst shouldn't have allowed Sessions event Thomas Dumm, a professor of Political Science, told the Amherst Student that the private college should have nixed the Sessions event and added that he penned a ""strongly-worded email"" to Amherst President Biddy Martin about it.
""This is a man who is a racist and misogynist, a person who served in Trump's administration and promoted policies having to do with separation of parents from children,"" Dumm told the paper. ""He promoted policies that would continue mass incarceration, who promoted policies that would continue to deny women the right to choose in regards to abortion, who generally followed the path of an extremist. I thought this was something that was wrong.""
Dumm also called on colleges to take a stand against the Republican Party, the paper said: ""Academic freedom is different than simple free speech. People are trying to treat the current Republican party of the U.S. as though it is part of a traditional bipartisan divide in terms of ideology, and it's not … It is a party that has gone down the authoritarian rabbit hole, and to the extent that people do not realize or recognize it or speak as loudly as they can against it, this country is in serious and deep trouble.""
What did the president of the College Republicans have to say? ACR President Rob Barasch told the paper he respects the right to protest but wishes those against the Sessions' event had ""more of an open mind."" He added to the Amherst Student that it was wrong for protesting students to reserve tickets and not show up.
""By engaging in this protest, you're not allowing other people to hear what Mr. Sessions' views are, and I think that's not okay,"" Barasch added to the paper. ""I think that goes against our values, of trying to be open-minded, of trying to listen to viewpoints that aren't your own.""

WTF MSM!? Trump economy booms with 3.2% growth despite media rooting for failure - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/wtf-msm-trump-economy-booms-with-3-2-growth-despite-media-rooting-for-failure,"The numbers … This morning, first-quarter gross domestic product growth numbers were released. The Trump recovery continues with a booming 3.2 percent growth rate . The economy continues to explode despite the media trying to downplay it at every turn .
Since the moment President Donald Trump took the oath of office, the media has worked overtime to undersell the booming economy. In July 2018, the Washington Examiner highlighted the media saying that the second-quarter GDP bump was ""too big"" and not to ""buy it."" Back then, an MSNBC guest said that people were just stocking up on items because they were "" worried about his [Trump's] tariffs .""
In October, the media peddled doom and gloom and reacted with glee that the stock market had what in hindsight was a short contraction . Vox wrote an explainer on how it was Trump's fault . CNN even made allusions to the "" Great Depression ."" Of course the market has almost recovered all the early October losses .
Just like in 1984, ""It's morning again in America."" The economy is booming and it's touching all segments of society . Millions of people are financially better off than they were during the Obama administration.
While the nation rejoices, the media continue to be sad.
Antonia beats YouTube … On Wednesday, Second Amendment activist Antonia Okafor had her YouTube channel demonetized after posting an episode about ""teaching young women to defend themselves."" Okafor is an outspoken African-American conservative. After an outcry from conservatives, YouTube reinstated her monetization, according to Okafor and Breitbart News .
Okafor isn't buying YouTube's explanation that her channel was demonetized by mistake.
""They claim in the same response that they carefully look at each channel, never make decisions based on politics but after all the uproar claim it was just 'incorrectly removed,'"" she said.
This reversal by YouTube shows that conservative pressure on Big Tech is working. These companies will continue to try to silence voices they don't agree with. With two high-profile reversals over the past month – Twitter's manipulation of the ""Unplanned"" movie's account and now Okafor – maybe, just maybe the tide is turning.

""I refused it,"" he said . ""Delivered by a member of our Board on behalf of his employer, the exhortation was simply: resign or there will be destructive allegation made against me and the NRA. Alarmed and disgusted, I refused the offer.""

He is accused of beating a 4-month-old infant to death after finding out the boy wasn't his child.
What are the details? Carlos Zuniga-Aviles, 33, allegedly struck little Alexander Lizondro-Chacon upon learning the child wasn't his, after believing throughout his girlfriend's pregnancy that he was the father.
The mother called 911 on April 12 to report that Alexander was having difficulty breathing. Shortly after paramedics responded to the call, the child passed away. According to the Daily Mail , an autopsy revealed the child died of blunt force trauma to the head, and was found to have had pneumonia, and a fractured skull and rib. His death was ruled a homicide.
Both the mother and Zuniga-Aviles initially denied having any idea as to why the child became unresponsive, but the mother eventually told police Zuniga-Aviles confessed to hitting the child out of anger over the baby's paternity.
According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Zuniga-Aviles was previously deported from the U.S. in February 2010, January 2011, March 2012, November 2015, and December 2016, WMC-TV reported. The suspect has been kicked out of the country by immigration officials in Utah, Texas, and Louisiana, but managed to return again each time through the southern border. Authorities aren't sure how long he's been back in the country.
The Honduran national is known to have several aliases, and was even arrested under a fake name he gave authorities when questioned over what happened to Alexander.
He is set to be back in court May 1.
Anything else? ICE officials told the Associated Press an immigration detainer has been filed for Zuniga-Aviles, who is being held at a county jail."
Kansas Supreme Court rules that abortion is protected by the state's constitution,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kansas-supreme-court-rules-that-abortion-is-protected-by-the-states-constitution,"The Kansas State Supreme Court ruled on Friday that laws restricting abortion go against the state's constitution. Only one of the court's seven justices dissented.
What did the court say? In its decision , the court wrote (emphasis added):
Section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights affords protection of the right of personal autonomy, which includes the ability to control one's own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self-determination. This right allows a woman to make her own decisions regarding her body, health, family formation, and family life— decisions that can include whether to continue a pregnancy The court asked if the ""equal and inalienable rights"" granted by the Kansas Constitution's Bill of Rights includes a woman's right to make decisions about her body, including the decision whether to continue her pregnancy."" It determined that the answer to this was ""yes.""
""The State may only infringe upon the right to decide whether to continue a pregnancy,"" the court argued ""if the State has a compelling interest and has narrowly tailored its actions to that interest.""
In his dissent, Kansas Supreme Court Justice Caleb Stegall argued that the ruling ""fundamentally alters the structure of our government to magnify the power of the state"" and accused the majority of painting ""the interest in unborn life championed by millions of Kansans as rooted in an ugly prejudice.""
What else? There is no path for this ruling to be appealed. In 2014, however, voters from Tennessee amended that state's constitution to clarify that the Tennessee state constitution did not prohibit the legislature from passing laws pertaining to abortion in response to a similar ruling from the Tennessee Supreme Court.
The state had passed the Kansas Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act in 2015, which is what triggered this lawsuit. In January, Americans United for Life had listed Kansas as the fourth-most pro-life state in the country , after Arizona, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.
Geniveve Scott, the lead counsel for the Center for Reproductive Health lawsuit that led to the ruling, called it ""an incredible decision that really defines what the legal standard now is in Kansas."""
"Terrorist who lied to get U.S. citizenship sentenced to prison, will be deported after",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/terrorist-who-lied-to-get-u-s-citizenship-sentenced-to-prison-will-be-deported-after,"A convicted terrorist who was able to lie his way to U.S. citizenship has been sentenced to prison and will be deported afterward, according to CNN .
Vallmoe Shqaire, 51, became a U.S. citizen in 2008, even after doing time in Israeli prison for attempting to blow up a bus as a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Shqaire had been recruited by the PLO in the 1980s and attempted the bus attack in 1998. It failed, and no one was hurt, but Shqaire still did four years in prison in Israel.
When he got to the U.S., Shqaire lied and did not disclose his arrest and the connection to the PLO, and according to officials he ""slipped through the cracks"" and was able to gain citizenship.
This week, he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison and will be stripped of his citizenship and deported to Jordan once his sentence is complete. He said he is sorry for his past and that he loves the United States.
The judge seemed sympathetic to Shqaire's situation, saying he didn't view Shqaire as a terrorist after so much time had passed since his ""despicable"" acts in Israel.
Shqaire has been in the U.S. nearly 20 years, and has spent time working as a parking attendant. His defense attorney fought back against a portrayal of him as a dangerous terrorist.
""He didn't try to start a sleeper cell for al Qaeda,"" said attorney Mark Werksman.
Assistant US Attorney Annamartine Salick said that the communication between the two nations was not where it is today, and there were significant issues sorting through hard records that had been damaged that would have revealed Shqaire's criminal past.
Once Shqaire got his citizenship, even after U.S. officials found out he had been convicted of terrorism, U.S. legal protections for citizens made it difficult to prove he had lied to obtain that citizenship.

Coach Tony Bennett released a statement that was tweeted out by the official University of Virginia account.
""We have received inquiries about a visit to the White House,"" said Bennett in the statement. ""With several players either pursuing pro opportunities or moving on from UVA, it would be difficult, if not impossible to get everyone back together.""
""We would have to respectfully decline an invitation,"" he concluded.
The invitation of champion sports teams to the White House has become politically charged since the election of President Donald Trump, with many players refusing to meet him over their political differences.
After the victory of the Cavaliers, a UVA alumna and activist began a petition to pressure the team to not accept the invitation from the president to the White House.
""Now it's time for the Cavaliers to stand strong too,"" the petition read. ""By accepting a White House invitation, the team would be condoning the president's reprehensible and divisive behavior, which is unacceptable.""
It received just over 15,000 signatures.
The University of Virginia Cavaliers defeated the Texas Tech. Red Raiders with a final score of 85 to 77.

"Kamala Harris is unfit to be the Democratic nominee because she owns a handgun, columnist writes",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kamala-harris-is-unfit-to-be-the-democratic-nominee-because-she-owns-a-handgun-columnist-writes,"A contributor to USA Today wrote that Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) should be disqualified as a candidate for the Democratic nomination because she's a gun owner.
The article was written by Peter Funt. In it, he compares Harris' stance on guns to that of the National Rifle Association, and accuses her of perpetuating the notion that a ""good guy with a gun"" is the best way to stop armed and violent criminals.
Funt writes:
""This under-publicized revelation (that Harris owns a gun) comes as Harris is getting a lot of ink for being tough about guns. Her words are fine, but for a progressive like me, they are undermined by that handgun. And I can't be the only one who is disturbed. Keeping a handgun for personal safety is a bedrock conservative view."" Harris told Iowa voters that she owns a gun for personal safety, and that she began doing so when she was a prosecutor dealing with sometimes dangerous criminals. A Harris spokesperson said the gun is kept locked away now.
Funt writes that personal protection is no justification for exercising the Second Amendment right to bear arms:
""But Kamala Harris doesn't seem to have the courage to concede that owning a handgun for protection is a bad idea. Instead, she has given voters a real choice: Back candidates who care enough about gun control to not own handguns, or support the only major Democratic contender who has one and won't throw it away."" Despite Funt's criticisms, Harris has promised to take aggressive action to implement gun control if she is elected president. She said during a CNN town hall that she would give Congress 100 days to pass gun control legislation before taking executive action to move toward her goals of universal background checks and an assault weapons ban."
Trump-supporting NFL draftee apologizes for insulting Colin Kaepernick after getting picked by the 49ers,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nfl-draftee-apologizes-for-insulting-colin-kaepernick-after-getting-picked-by-the-49ers,"Nick Bosa, a defensive lineman who was selected No. 2 overall in Thursday's NFL draft, said he regretted insulting tweets he directed toward former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to ESPN .
Bosa was selected by the 49ers, and in the lead up to the draft that possibility had led the player to delete some Trump-supporting and anti-Kaepernick posts to try to avoid controversy. He had previously called Kaepernick a ""clown"" for his national anthem protests.
""It wasn't directed towards (Kaepernick's stance),"" Bosa said according to ESPN. ""It's not like I'm saying his stance and what he was doing, that's not what I was calling or talking about at all. It was just a specific thing that happened and me as a young kid a thought popping in my head and boom, decided to tweet it out. Bad decision. I respect what he's done. If it empowers anybody then he's doing a good thing. So, I apologize for that.""
It's common for athletes in the current environment to scrub their social media accounts of controversial posts before the draft, but Bosa's deleted tweets and apology are notable because his motivation is to essentially apologize for his conservative views simply because he is going to be playing in a liberal city.
He began deleting conservative or anti-Kaepernick tweets weeks before the draft simply due to the possibility that he might get drafted by the 49ers. Now he says he hopes to grow in San Francisco and take advantage of a clean slate.
""I definitely made some insensitive decisions throughout my life and I'm just excited to be here with a clean slate,"" Bosa said. ""I'm sorry if I hurt anybody. I definitely didn't intend for that to be the case but I think me being here is even better for me as a person because I don't think there's any city that you could really be in that would help you grow as much as this one will."
Republican lawmaker graphically details abortions she witnessed when she worked in the medical field: ‘Perfectly formed little human babies in … buckets’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/republican-lawmaker-graphically-details-abortions-she-witnessed-when-she-worked-in-the-medical-field-perfectly-formed-little-human-babies-in-buckets,"Republican North Carolina Rep. Pat McElcraft testified to the horrors of abortion during a hearing about Bill 359, which North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) ultimately vetoed .
Bill 359, had Cooper signed it, would have required that babies surviving botched abortion attempts would receive the same consideration when it came to lifesaving care ""as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age."" If violated, the bill would penalize doctors and health care providers.
Cooper said that he vetoed the bill because ""[l]aws already protect newborn babies and this bill is an unnecessary interference between doctors and their patients. This needless legislation would criminalize doctors and other healthcare providers for a practice that simply does not exist.""
So what did McElcraft say about abortion? During the hearing, McElcraft pointed to her years working in the medical field, in which she witnessed the aftermath of many abortions.
According to Live Action , McElcraft said that the bill was necessary to protect the lives of unborn — and newborn — babies.
""There was an abortionist in Jacksonville, North Carolina, who was known nationally for performing late term abortions. We heard of many girls who came from other states to North Carolina — Jacksonville, North Carolina, to have their late-term abortions. Even hitchhiking down from New York, some of them did, to come in,"" she said.
McElcraft went on to point out that saline abortions were performed at the time, administered through an injection into the uterus. The extra-concentrated saline solution would kill the unborn baby over a course of several hours, and then the child's mother would go on to birth a dead child.
She pointed out that the abortions of today aren't any better, noting that many late-term abortions are completed through a D&E — in which the baby is actively dismembered in the womb — or via induction, in which the child is directly injected with a poison causing heart failure.
""Nurses told stories of the babies that were born alive and [had] been taken by the doctor and turned over with their faces down in the saline to drown,"" she said. ""Most of the nurses refused to work with this abortionist. He only did his abortions on the weekends.""
""One day I was on a break, [and] went in to visit with the pathologist in the pathology lab, and I asked him, I said, 'What are all these little pigs doing in these buckets?'"" McElcraft explained. ""He told me, 'Pat, look again.' And I did. They were perfectly formed little human babies in those buckets. Their skin was even pinker than a normal baby would be, because it had been burned by the saline. Those were the weekend's abortions.""

O'Rourke's statements came after a question from a college student and ""Planned Parenthood supporter"" who said, treatise-like, that she's ""deeply concerned about the lies that are being spread about abortion later in pregnancy. There is no such thing as abortion up until or after birth. And in the 1 percent of the time that a woman has an abortion later in pregnancy, it is due to a diagnosis of severe fetal abnormalities or a serious risk to the woman's health.""
After her speech, the student asked O'Rourke what he'd do to protect women's access to abortion if elected.
What did O'Rourke have to say?
With that, O'Rourke thanked the student for her ""advocacy"" and launched into a pro-choice speech of his own, saying in part:
""No one wants to see people die in the wealthiest and most powerful country on the face of the planet for lack of care, so when I connect back that family planning clinics — Planned Parenthood, to be specific, in Texas is saving the lives of our fellow women, and it's a life-and-death matter in this country. Three times as deadly for women of color in this maternal mortality crisis that we have right now. I think I can find some common ground to ensure that we see the larger picture and our national public shared interest going forward. So I'll make sure that I respect those with differing points of view, that I'm listening to everybody, that I share what I just shared with you, but never compromise on the fundamental principle that health care also means every woman makes her own decisions about her own life. And that will be the test for us and whoever we nominate to the Supreme Court."" Asked About Late-Term Abortions, Beto Says Planned Parenthood Saves Lives youtu.be
In saying ""no one wants to see people die in the wealthiest and most powerful country on the face of the planet for lack of care,"" O'Rourke didn't mention Planned Parenthood annually takes over 330,000 unborn lives through abortions , LifeNews said, which added that Planned Parenthood is responsible for women's deaths due to botched abortions .
The video description of O'Rourke's remarks indicates the campaign event took place Thursday but does not say where. However, it appears the location of the event was a coffee shop near the University of Nevada, Reno .

Only 37 percent of Americans polled said that they thought the president should be impeached.
That is the lowest number saying Trump should be impeached in this poll's history.
That percentage has fallen from before the Mueller report was released, when 41 percent said he should be impeached. And it's much lower than the 49 percent who said he should be impeached in August 2018.
More than half of Americans polled, 56 percent, said impeachment proceedings should not begin against the president.
Surprisingly, when asked if they believed Trump obstructed justice, many more said he did than those that said he should be impeached. Nearly half of Americans, 47 percent, said he had obstructed justice, while 41 percent said he didn't obstruct justice.
Only 31 percent agreed with the president that the Mueller report exonerated him, while 53 percent said the report did not clear him of all charges.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) initially said that it was not worth the trouble to impeach the president, but after pressure from the progressive wing of the party , she relented and said the facts may force Democrats to impeach.

She posted a statement with more details about the release of Christopher Hasson, a U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant who was arrested for allegedly planning mass attacks on politicians and government figures.
On Thursday a judge ruled that Hasson would be able to be released on bail, angering many who thought the decision was too lenient given the charges.
""This is an outrage and the Judge's decision cannot stand,"" Waters said in her statement.
""The Department of Justice must take action, lest anyone presume the Administration implicitly condones the federal judge's decision to go easy on a white nationalist,"" she continued. ""Moreover, Members of Congress must now recognize that many of us who have taken hardline positions against the Trump Administration are walking targets and we must use every resource at our disposal to protect ourselves since we cannot expect any assistance from the current Administration.""
Waters did not elaborate on what ""resource"" members of Congress could use to protect themselves.
The judge will determine what supervision Hasson will have to undergo in order to be released.

"Rod Rosenstein reveals damaging info about Obama admin's handling of Russia probe — then targets media, Comey",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rod-rosenstein-obama-administration-handling-russia-investigation,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein blasted the Obama administration's handling of the Russia investigation, rebuked the mainstream media's coverage of the investigation, and defended his role in the probe on Thursday, the first time Rosenstein has spoken publicly about the investigation since the release of the Mueller report last week.
Rosenstein oversaw the investigation after Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general at the time, recused himself from all investigations relating to the 2016 presidential election.
What did Rosenstein say? According to the New York Times , Rosenstein both castigated the Obama administration for not being honest with the American people about the scope of Russian election interference, while scolding the FBI and Congress, including former FBI Director James Comey, for selectively leaking classified information related to the investigation.
""Some critical decisions about the Russia investigation were made before I got there,"" Rosenstein said . ""The previous administration chose not to publicize the full story about Russian computer hackers and social media trolls, and how they relate to a broader strategy to undermine America.""
""The FBI disclosed classified evidence about the investigation to ranking legislators and their staffers. Someone selectively leaked details to the news media. The FBI director announced at a congressional hearing that there was a counterintelligence investigation that might result in criminal charges. Then the former FBI director alleged that the president pressured him to close the investigation, and the president denied that the conversation occurred,"" Rosenstein explained.
""So that happened,"" he said mockingly.

Indeed, the Obama administration has been heavily criticized for its response to Russian election interference.
In fact, NBC reported in Dec. 2016 that high-level administration officials opted not to respond forcefully to Russian meddling because then-President Barack Obama did not want his administration to appear it was interfering in the election.
NBC also reported the administration acted slowly because officials believed Hillary Clinton would win the election.
What else did Rosenstein say? He also defended his actions in the investigation.
""At my confirmation hearing in March 2017, a Republican senator asked me to make a commitment,"" Rosenstein said. ""He said: 'You're going to be in charge of this [Russia] investigation. I want you to look me in the eye and tell me that you'll do it right, that you'll take it to its conclusion and you'll report [your results] to the American people.'""
""I did pledge to do it right and take it to the appropriate conclusion. I did not promise to report all results to the public, because grand jury investigations are ex parte proceedings. It is not our job to render conclusive factual findings. We just decide whether it is appropriate to file criminal charges,"" he recalled.
As Fox News reported , Rosenstein also blasted ""mercenary critics"" who ""express passionate opinions about any topic, often with little or no information. They do not just express disagreement. They launch ad hominem attacks unrestricted by truth or morality. They make threats, spread fake stories and even attack your relatives.""
""Some of the nonsense that passes for breaking news today would not be worth the paper it was printed on, if anybody bothered to print it,"" he went on to say, according to Politico .
Rosenstein's comments came while speaking in New York Thursday night at the Public Servants Dinner of the Armenian Bar Association."

That fundraiser was started 15 days ago, and has since raised over $1 million for the boy who was targeted for cold-blooded murder at random , it seems.
""We are now turning our focus to additional surgeries, healing, rehabilitation and eventually a return home, which we hope will happen by June,"" said the family.
""We want to personally thank each and every one of you for your love, prayers and support. We are astounded and so blessed by the over 28,000 individuals and families, from literally around the world, that have donated to our gofundme page.

It's not only the family who are calling the boy's healing miraculous. The pastor for the church where the Hoffmans worship announced days ago that the MRI for Landen showed ""zero evidence of brain damage"" and ""no swelling in the brain.""
The result was ""truly a miracle"" said Pastor Mac Hammond.
At the time of that announcement, just days ago, was still in critical condition and had not regained consciousness. On Saturday, he was ""alert and conscious"" and no longer in critical condition, just two weeks after being hurled almost 40ft to the ground in an attempt on his young life.
The fundraiser for Landen continues he re. The costs associated with such catastrophic injury and even the miraculous recovery, and to the family in related expenses, continue to climb. As does the generosity and faith of the American people praying and cheering for this child's recovery.
The man who threw him, Emmanuel Aranda, is charged with attempted first-degree murder. He is in Hennepin County jail and will appear in court next month. He admitted to police it was his intent to kill, that he'd gone to the mall that day looking for someone to murder. He has a prior criminal record, and had been banned from the Mall of America twice before."

The New York City Council passes legislation setting new standards for greenhouse gas emissions from buildings. The measure aligns with one of the central pillars of Rep.

According to de Blasio, the city of New York planned to impose a mandate on all building owners requiring that building be up to code over the next 12 years.

Federal court hands major victory to police officer in lawsuit against Black Lives Matter leader - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/deray-mckesson-lawsuit-baton-rouge-police-officer,"A federal appeals court ruled this week that a Baton Rouge police officer injured during riots in July 2016 can sue Black Lives Matter organizer DeRay Mckesson.
What are the details? The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the officer, who has only been identified as ""John Doe"" in court records, can sue Mckesson on the grounds that ""he acted negligently by leading people to block a highway,"" the Associated Press reported .
Josh Brasted/Getty Images
The court said the police officer should be able to argue Mckesson did not ""exercise reasonable care in leading protesters onto the highway, setting up a police confrontation in which the officer was injured by a thrown concrete block,"" according to the AP.
""Mckesson should have known that leading the demonstrators onto a busy highway was most nearly certain to provoke a confrontation between police and the mass of demonstrators, yet he ignored the foreseeable danger to officers, bystanders, and demonstrators, and notwithstanding, did so anyway,"" Circuit Judge E. Grady Jolly wrote in a unanimous opinion.
Still, the court emphasized it did not address the validity of the plaintiff's arguments.
""Our ruling at this point is not to say that a finding of liability will ultimately be appropriate,"" Jolly wrote. ""We are simply required to decide whether Officer Doe's claim for relief is sufficiently plausible.""
What did Mckesson say? In a statement, he told The Advocate : ""I'm disappointed and troubled by the 5th Circuit's reversal of the district court decision. I am currently exploring my legal options and will respond formally soon.""
Meanwhile, the police officer's lawyer, Donna Grodner, called the ruling a ""stand-up victory for the Baton Rouge PD.""
What is the background? The police officer originally sued Black Lives Matter and five of the movement's leaders . However, a federal judge tossed the lawsuit citing First Amendment rights and claimed Black Lives Matter was too loosely organized to be formally sued in federal court.
The officer was significantly injured during riots in July 2016 following the shooting death of Alton Sterling, a black man killed by two police officers.
Video footage of Sterling's death, and his tense struggle with police preceding his death, would later go viral, triggering mass protests in Baton Rouge."

The NRA even took a shot at North this week when amending a civil complaint in their ongoing battle with long-term NRA ad agency Ackerman Queen.

NYT Opinion pulls anti-Semitic political cartoon attacking Trump backlash,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nyt-opinion-pulls-anti-semitic-political-cartoon-after-critics-rebuke,"The April 25 issue of the New York Times International Edition ran an editorial cartoon based on, in their own words, anti-Semitic tropes, and the cartoon has since been deleted online. The Opinion department ran an editor's note online on Saturday that will appear in the print copies on Monday.
The image depicts President Donald Trump, hunched over and wearing a Jewish yarmulke, being led by a sinister-faced Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog wearing a Star of David collar. That description may sound unbelievable, but that is precisely what they ran and took two days to remove, and then only after a backlash.
The opinion page, in their statement (below), blamed the New York Times News Service and Syndicate for the publication of the image.
The deletion and editor's note follow backlash the paper received both from social media users and other publications, including the Jerusalem Post.
The the editor's note, which some are referring to as an apology but which includes no expression of regret, says the image 'was offensive"" and that it was 'an error of judgment"" to publish it.
""A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it."" One of the more widely retweeted and stronger objections was from an Australian Imam and Muslim peace advocate, who said the image served an ""ISIS agenda"" and is the type of photo the terror group's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi ""would hang on his wall.""
At the Jerusalem Post, Frantzman was not impressed with the editor's note.
This is what The New York Times thinks of us Israelis. Even if they subsequently said it was an error, they thought it was okay to print a cartoon showing the US president being blindly led by the ""Jewish dog""?
And not only that, those who watched as it went to print thought it was fine to put a Jewish skullcap on the US president. Dual loyalty? No need to even wrestle with that question.
It used to be that we were told that Trump was fostering ""Trump antisemitism"" and driving a new wave of antisemitism in the US. But the cartoon depicts him as a Jew. Well, which is it? Is he fostering antisemitism, or is he now a closet Jew being led by Israel, depicted as a Jewish dog? We used to say that images ""conjured up memories"" of 1930s antisemitism. This didn't conjure it up; this showed us exactly what it looked like.
The Nazis also depicted us as animals. They also put Stars of David on us. Antisemites have compared us to dogs, pigs and monkeys before. It used to be that it was on the far-Right that Jews were depicted as controlling the world, like an octopus or a spider.
But now we see how mainstream it has become to blame the Jews and Israel for the world's problems. There is much more to the article that is well worth reading . Frantzman notes that blaming syndication doesn't fly, as multiple people, editors, would see it and have the opportunity to remove it prior to using it in their paper. None, apparently, found any problem with the cartoon.
Washington correspondent for the United Arab Emirates publication The National adds that this isn't an isolated incident.
It is worth nothing that the Times characterization of the offensive image as having ""included anti-Semitic tropes"" is the same language that Democratic leadership used to describe tweets from Rep. Ilhan Omar that also faced backlash. When not writing about their own publication, or Democrat members of Congress, the New York Times more typically uses words like ""slur"" or ""hate"" over the more anti-septic ""tropes."""
Multiple people injured gunman opens fire inside synagogue near San Diego,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/shooting-chabad-synagogue-california,"UPDATE (5:45 p.m. EST): Poway Mayor Steve Vaus told MSNBC that one person has died. The identity of the deceased was not immediately released. He said no other injuries are life threatening.
Vaus also revealed that members of the synagogue engaged the shooter, likely mitigating the scope of possible damage the gunman could inflict.
""We are grateful to those in the congregation there that engaged the shooter and prevented this from being a much more horrific incident,"" Vaus said.
Additionally, NBC reported that Vaus has characterized the incident as a ""hate crime.""

Multiple people were injured Saturday when a gunman opened fire inside the Chabad of Poway synagogue near San Diego.
According to KCAL-TV , deputies with the San Diego Sheriff's Office responded to the synagogue around 11:30 a.m. PST Saturday morning, where worshipers were participating in a Passover service.
CNN reported that a local hospital had received one trauma patient, but was expecting at least four others. At least one of the injured is a child. The synagogue's founding teacher, Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, was reportedly also among the injured. The inured are being treated at Palomar Medical Center.
The San Diego Sheriff's office told The Daily Beast that one man was arrested in connection to the shooting and is being questioned by investigators. ""We don't believe there are any other suspects,"" a department spokesperson told the outlet.
The shooting comes on the final day of Passover. The synagogue was holding services from 11:00 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Additionally, the incident comes six months to the day after a gunman stormed the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh killing 11 people in what was the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.

Pope Francis announces large donation to caravan migrants stranded in Mexico,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pope-francis-donation-migrants,"Pope Francis has donated $500,000 to assist migrants stranded at the United States-Mexico border and throughout Mexico, the Vatican announced Saturday.
The news comes as media attention surrounding the border crisis wanes, likely due to the 2020 presidential election kicking into high gear.
What are the details? The Vatican said funds will be distributed between 27 projects among 16 Mexican dioceses and congregations, all of which requested assistance to continue providing migrants with basis necessities like food, water, and shelter.
Peter's Pence, which issued the funds, said additional funds are necessary because media attention surrounding the crisis has decreased, resulting in a decrease of humanitarian aid.
The group said in a statement :
In recent months, thousands of migrants have arrived in Mexico, having travelled more than 4,000 kilometres on foot and with makeshift vehicles from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Men and women, often with young children, flee poverty and violence, hoping for a better future in the United States. However, the US border remains closed to them.
In 2018, six migrant caravans entered Mexico, for a total of 75,000 people; the arrival of other groups was announced. All these people were stranded, unable to enter the United States, without a home or livelihood. The Catholic Church hosts thousands of them in the hotels within dioceses or religious congregations, providing basic necessities, from housing to clothing.
Peter's Pence said ""regulated and transparent use of the resources"" will be accounted for before they are assigned to local communities.
Peter's Pence is a large collection of funds at the Pope's disposal ""to provide emergency assistance to those in need because of natural disaster, war, oppression, and disease,"" according to the group's website ."
Watch Dan Crenshaw expertly handle crazed college kid calling him Nazi,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-dan-crenshaw-expertly-handle-crazed-college-kid-calling-him-nazi,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw participated in a Turning Points USA campus event this week and received some... let's call it 'negative feedback' from a worked-up college kid upset about, like, war and stuff. But the freshman congressman and former Navy SEAL handled it perfectly.
When he got to the mic, the youngster raged that the event organizer, Turning Points, is ""for Nazis. and then said that Crenshaw ""should be ashamed"" of his service in Afghanistan.
""It was an illegal war of aggression by the United States,"" said the upset fellow. ""You should be ashamed of yourself, not proud of your service.""
The crowd booed the kid with gusto. Without losing his own composure, Crenshaw handed the kid a brutal defeat with the single-eye-roll of the century and a very on-point reply.
