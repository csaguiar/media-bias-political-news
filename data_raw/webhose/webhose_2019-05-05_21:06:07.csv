Gen Z Surveys,pointofview.net,Caron Manley,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://pointofview.net/viewpoints/gen-z-surveys/,"Share Penna Dexter
There’s yet another survey out showing that young people stop going to church after high school as they go off to college or start a job away from home.
A 2017 LifeWay Research Survey shows 66 percent of Americans stopped attending church on a regular basis for at least a year after turning 18. This is down slightly from 2007 when 70 percent reported they dropped out of church at that age.
Most young people who cease regular attendance are not doing so because they no longer believe in God. The LifeWay survey, which is based on responses from more than 2000 young Americans who attended Protestant churches, shows that the top reason for young people leaving church was that they “moved into college.”“It’s not that most rejected the church,” stated Ed Stetzer, former Executive Director of LifeWay Research. Dr. Stetzer, now head of the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College, looked at the data and concluded, “they simply lose track of the church and stop seeing it as important to their lives.” Many, hopefully, will return.
Another semi-encouraging survey has surfaced: A recent New York Times headline reads : “Support of LGBT Rights Drops among Republicans under 30.” A large survey conducted by the Washington D.C.- based Public Religion Research Institute, shows a majority of this group thinks LGBT Americans should receive special privileges and accommodations, but the percentage is dropping, down 9 percent since 2015.
“It was one of the largest and most significant drops that we saw,” Robert P. Jones, chief executive of the institute told the Times .
Family Research Council suggests that “young conservatives may have some buyers’ remorse about this agenda that wasn’t supposed to affect them.”
In the three years since the Obergefell Supreme Court decision that brought us same-sex marriage nationwide, we’ve seen it used as a weapon against free speech, religious liberty, and privacy.
These surveys show something else: We shouldn’t give up on Gen Z. Gen Z Surveys"

‘No Celebrities’: Embarrassing Turnout at Trump’s Beverly Hills Fundraiser,www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/no-celebrities-embarrassing-turnout-at-trumps-beverly-hills-fundraiser,"NO MORE PARTIES IN L.A. ‘No Celebrities’: Embarrassing Turnout at Trump’s Beverly Hills Fundraiser Tickets for the event allegedly started at $15,000 and went as high as $150,000. 04.06.19 2:41 AM ET Alex Wong/Getty
BEVERLY HILLS, California—Late Friday afternoon, Donald Trump landed in Los Angeles for a re-election fundraiser. The event was organized by Trump Victory, a fundraising partnership between the Republican National Convention and Trump’s campaign, and aimed to raise an estimated $5 million for the party. It was the president’s third visit to the celebrity-hub city and, by all accounts, not a star-studded one.
“Celebrities? No celebrities,” Rabbi Marvin Hier said of the event. Hier is the dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and gave the prayer at Trump’s inauguration. Multiple valets in royal blue jackets, who declined to give their names because of their job, echoed his sentiment.
“No celebrities,” said one valet, driving past in a golf cart.
“Yeah, no celebrities,” claimed a second.
The event was held in the 22,000-square-foot Beverly Hills home of health-care executive and GOP donor Lee Samson. The 15-bathroom “Italian-style limestone villa” runs about $10 million, according to Zillow , and was named Robb Report ’s Ultimate Home of the Year in 2012. Tickets started at $15,000 for dinner, $50,000 for a photo op with Trump, and $150,000 to join his roundtable discussion, according to an invitation obtained by the City News Service.
Fundraisers had estimated that some 90 donors would be in attendance, but did not disclose the invite list. Security guards posted around the house could not estimate who or how many people attended, and the drivers of several tinted black cars around the neighborhood declined to identify their clients. One claimed he had signed a non-disclosure agreement in advance of the event. Even Rabbi Hier and his wife, Marlene, who spoke with The Daily Beast while leaving the fundraiser in a golf cart, could not agree on crowd size.
“Hundreds of people came,” Hier said. “Probably 400 people.”
“200,” Marlene corrected.
“No, 200 couples ,” he said.
“Don’t quote him on that. It wasn’t 400.”
According to the Washington Post , 170 people attended the event at Samson’s home.
“It was a big turnout. It was wonderful,” Rabbi Hier told The Daily Beast. “We couldn’t stay because of the sabbath. But the president shook hands with us. It was very nice... We couldn’t see the speech. The sabbath begins. That’s why we’re rushing home. It was sumptuous. There were a lot of things to eat. A beautiful home.”
Republican National Committeeman Shawn Steel told the Washington Post that during his speech Trump talked at length about winning California during the 2020 election. He also reportedly discussed socialism and “got a big round of applause talking about his administration’s decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.”
The event, whose location was leaked to TMZ, drew a tiny crowd, with four flag-clad supporters in MAGA hats, and 10 protesters holding a banner that read “TRUMP AND PENCE MUST GO.” More than one passing driver blared YG and Nipsey Hussle’s “Fuck Donald Trump.”
Michelle Xai, a young woman with a Monroe facial piercing, a megaphone, and dozens of anti-fascist stickers on her clothes, carried two signs, each with the names and images of children who died in Border Patrol custody. She was there on behalf of RefuseFascism.org, an activist organization which conducts sustained nonviolent protests at Trump-related events. Xai had already attended dozens.
“For the past two years, people have been sitting passively and waiting for the Mueller report and for somebody else in power to do something,” Xai said. “We need to shake them awake and say this is already a very dangerous situation and we can’t just sit back and wait for two more years for something to happen.”
Just feet away stood Holly Cleeland, a middle-aged white woman with bright pink lip liner and an American flag shawl. “The organization I’m here for is Make America Great Again. Patriots Unite, or anyone that’s a conservative and believes the way I believe,” she said. “We want America great again. We want it back to the way it was. We don’t want Hillary Clinton giving our money away. Giving our uranium away.”
Behind Cleeland—who claimed that all undocumented immigrants receive $3,500 a month from the government for their entire lives—stood Atlas Winfrey, a teenage-looking boy with a notebook wedged in his pocket.
“I’m with the Time to Get Organized for an Actual Revolution National Tour. The slogan of this tour is ‘You think you’re woke but you’re sleepwalking through a nightmare,’” Winfrey said. “We’re touring all across the country to organize thousands into the ranks of the revolution.”
The section cordoned off for protesters was labeled the “Free Speech Zone.”
Prior to this visit, Trump had visited Los Angeles only twice: once for a March 2018 fundraiser, and again this past fall, to tour areas hurt by wildfires and the site of the Thousand Oaks shooting. By contrast, Barack Obama had visited Los Angeles around 21 times by this point in his presidency.
After about an hour, Trump left in his motorcade and traveled by boat to his golf course in Palos Verdes, California, where he reportedly dined with his son Eric. He is scheduled to leave Los Angeles late Friday night for Las Vegas to address the Republican Jewish Coalition for their annual leadership meeting.
Correction : An earlier version of this story stated that Elliott Broidy, former deputy finance chairman of the RNC, co-hosted the fundraiser. That was a previous Beverly Hills fundraising event for Trump."
Dr M says forced to quit Rome Statute as ‘one person wants to beat up people’ | Free Malaysia Today,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Melissa Darlyne Chow,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/05/dr-m-says-forced-to-quit-rome-statute-as-one-person-wants-to-beat-up-people/,"Dr M says forced to quit Rome Statute as ‘one person wants to beat up people’ By April 5, 2019 4:57 PM Dr Mahathir Mohamad
KUALA LUMPUR: Dr Mahathir Mohamad today said the government had no choice but to withdraw from the Rome Statute, adding that opponents of the treaty were trying to pit the Malay rulers against the government.
The prime minister said the withdrawal was due to the confusion of “one particular person who wants to be free to beat up people”.
“If he does that, I will send the police after him. I do not care who he is. It is an attempt to blacken the good name of the government,” he told reporters after announcing that Malaysia was withdrawing from the Rome Statute, which serves to complement existing laws in member-states to prosecute individuals who commit international crimes.
Mahathir said the decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute was not due to fears of government leaders being prosecuted.
“We are withdrawing not because it is harmful to us, but because of the political confusion that has arisen.
“Therefore, the Cabinet this morning decided to withdraw from the Rome Statute,” he said.
He said the opposition to Malaysia joining the treaty was political, and a move to get the rulers to back them.
“The whole idea is to get the royalty in Malaysia to go against the government. That is the motive.
“Because of that confusion, we have made a decision not to recognise the statute. We have ratified, but we still have time to withdraw,” he said.
Malaysia’s ratification of the Rome Statute has come under attack from the Johor palace, with crown prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim saying Malay rulers could fall victim to “orchestrated war crimes” by those wanting to see the fall of the country’s royal institution.
“What if there are orchestrated war crimes and such?” he asked on Twitter recently.
“Key word ‘orchestrated’, and those wanting to menjatuhkan Msia’s sistem Diraja [bring down Malaysia’s monarchy] can do that, and the King takes the hit. Or is someone trying to be the commander in chief?”
The Rome Statute is an international agreement that created the International Criminal Court.
It complements existing laws in a state to prosecute individuals who commit international crimes, as contained in Article 5 of the statute, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.
Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said the Cabinet had signed the treaty after being satisfied that the King, who is the supreme commander of the armed forces, would not be affected.
Mahathir today said some people were easily misled by certain quarters, adding that there was a lack of understanding by the public on the issue.
“I am very surprised at some people who try to make use of the signing of this statute as evidence that the government has surrendered everything.
“I know there is an attempt to undermine this government by saying we have surrendered all power to foreigners. We have not. There is no way for them to take action against us,” he said.
Mahathir said he had been strict in applying the rule of law, such as taking action on money laundering.
He reiterated that whoever breaches the law will be punished, regardless of whether they are “prince or paupers”.
He also rubbished the suggestion that the Rome Statute would undermine the Malay rulers.
“This is absolute nonsense. They cannot possibly depose our king because some soldier shot somebody.
“The king is not some executive or monarch, but acts on the advice of the prime minister. Of course, they can take action against me, but for what? Am I going to kill people?” he asked.
Giving an example, Mahathir said the statute could be applicable if the Malaysian government engages in the genocide of non-Malays and confiscates their properties.
“But what we are doing now is not excessive. We ensure equal distribution of wealth. Everyone will benefit,” he said, referring to pro-Bumiputera policies.
On why the issue was not tabled in Parliament for approval, Mahathir said there was no need to debate everything in public, and that the government has the authority to approve and sign treaties.
“I don’t think we have to debate everything in public. If we do that, there will be differences in opinion and we cannot make a decision,” he added. Subscribe to our newsletter and get news delivered to your mailbox. TAGS "

A U.K. court sentenced a Muslim Iranian asylum seeker to jail Thursday for stabbing his wife to death, in part for converting to Christianity.
Iranian asylum seeker Dana Abdullah stabbed Avan Najmadiein, his estranged wife, 50 times in October and left her to die after discovering that she refused to support his application to stay in the U.K., according to the BBC . Najmadiein was 32 years old and the mother of four children.
Authorities said Abdullah returned illegally to the U.K. after being deported in 2013 for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl and that he previously threatened to kill his wife because she “dishonored” him by converting to Christianity. Advertisement - story continues below
“It does show that you are not someone of good character and, having been deported for that matter, you chose to come back into this country illegally and have committed this very serious crime,” Judge Michael Chambers said of Abdullah, according to Premier .
Chambers also lambasted Abdullah for the callous and brutal nature of his crime.
“This was, on any view, a planned and pre-meditated murder involving a brutal and sustained attack using a knife — knowing full well that it would deprive four children under the age of eight of their mother,” Chambers said.
Chambers sentenced Abdullah to a minimum of 18 years and one month in prison.

Detective Victoria Downing characterized Abdullah as an “an arrogant and controlling man,” asserting that he killed Najmadiein because he resented her rejection, her refusal to support his application, and her conversion to Christianity.
Abdullah murdered Najmadiein with a kitchen knife at her home on October 1, 2018, tried to set her kitchen ablaze in an attempt to erase evidence, then fled, initially to Liverpool and then to Glasgow.

“We recently wrote a report for the hate crime inquiry on Islamophobia so that we could show the other side of the coin, where much of the persecution of apostates in this country is based on a real hatred for those who quit Islam.” Chowdhry told Premier.
“We do really need to think about how best we protect ourselves in this country,” he added. Advertisement - story continues below

“When Dana killed my sister Avan,” she said, “he killed all of us — my mother, my father, and her children as well.”

Musk and his lawyers were appearing before a federal judge in New York who will decide whether the Tesla CEO should be held in contempt of court for violating an agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

A federal judged decided Friday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk must meet with federal regulators for about an hour so they can resolve their problems, chief among them the mercurial billionaire’s Twitter behavior.
Judge Alison Nathan’s decision comes after a hearing Thursday when Musk’s lawyers and SEC prosecutors got into verbal spats over what constitutes a material disclosure on Twitter.
The Securities and Exchange Commission asked a judge in February to hold Musk in contempt for violating the terms of an agreement requiring Tesla to pre-approve his tweets. Advertisement - story continues below
Musk agreed to resolve an SEC probe in October 2018 without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
The plan called for a combined $40 million in penalties to be distributed to affected shareholders. TRENDING: Ex-SEAL Known for Exposing Stolen Valor Takes on Nathan Phillips –‘Was Refrig Mechanic’
He told his Twitter followers in August of that year he secured “funding” to take the company private at $420 per share, far more than the company was worth at the time of the tweet.
SEC regulators said he violated the agreement when he tweeted that Tesla would make around 500,000 cars in 2019. Advertisement - story continues below
Musk later corrected the tweet, saying he “meant to say” weekly production would be equal to half-a-million cars.
“For the reasons stated on the record at oral argument yesterday, the parties are required to meet and confer for at least one hour in an effort to resolve the pending motion to hold Mr. Musk in contempt,” Judge Nathan’s order noted.

Musk, who owns more than 20 percent of the company, reacted favorably to the judge’s decision.
“I have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I’m pleased with her decision today,” he said in a statement distributed by Tesla.
“The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement with the SEC. We have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the SEC, rather than prematurely rushing to court.” Advertisement - story continues below
Musk and the SEC have had an acrimonious relationship.
“Just want to (sic) that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!” Musk wrote in a tweet in 2018 less than a week after agreeing to pay a fine connected to a tweet he wrote in August.

Microsoft leadership is conducting a review of numerous employee sexual harassment claims that the company’s HR department did not address, according to a string of employee emails reviewed by Quartz.
After one female employee emailed several of her colleagues looking for advice on how to move up at Microsoft, an email chain began that resulted in more than 90 pages’ worth of messages detailing harassment and discrimination cases allegedly ignored by HR.
“This thread has pulled the scab off a festering wound. The collective anger and frustration is palpable. A wide audience is now listening. And you know what? I’m good with that,” one Microsoft employee said on the email thread. Advertisement - story continues below
One woman in the thread detailed an event in which a Microsoft employee asked her to sit on someone’s lap during a meeting with other Microsoft employees present.
At the time, the woman was serving as a senior level Microsoft employee, known as a “Microsoft partner.” TRENDING: Ex-SEAL Known for Exposing Stolen Valor Takes on Nathan Phillips –‘Was Refrig Mechanic’
“As a Microsoft Partner, was asked to sit on someone’s lap twice in one meeting in front of HR and other executives,” she wrote on the chain of emails, according to Quartz .
“I can assure you that nothing was done. I alone objected and cited Microsoft policy. The person said that he did not have to listen and repeated the request a second time. No one said anything.” Advertisement - story continues below
Microsoft’s head of Human Resources, Kathleen Hogan, weighed in on the thread of emails on March 29.
Hogan pledged in a statement to personally look into the allegations and grievances listed on the thread, according to Ars Technica .

“While reading some of this is very disheartening, I am proud and encouraged to see people empowered to speak up, say this is not right, and stand together for change. Thank you,” Hogan said.
Microsoft has come under scrutiny for sexual harassment in the past.
In March 2018, court filings showed that women at the company filed 238 internal complaints alleging discrimination and sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016, according to Reuters . Advertisement - story continues below

The Supreme Court rejected another last-ditch bid to stop the Trump administration’s bump stock ban, denying a gun rights coalition a temporary exemption from the new regulation early Friday afternoon.
Friday’s order was the third application relating to the bump stock ban that the Supreme Court has rejected in recent weeks.
The plaintiffs in Friday’s case were five individuals and three gun rights organizations, including the Firearms Policy Foundation, the Madison Society Foundation, and Florida Carry. Advertisement - story continues below
They sought a temporary reprieve from the ban for themselves and their members.
“Absent a stay, applicants and their members will be required to surrender or destroy their property or face felony charges for possession of devices that were unquestionably legal under ATF’s construction of the statute for the past 85 years and ATF’s prior written rulings stating as much,” their petition read.
Neither the vote count nor the Court’s reasoning was disclosed, as is typical of orders of this nature, though Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch noted their dissent.
Bump stocks are an accessory that increase a semi-automatic rifle’s rate of fire. Advertisement - story continues below
The Department of Justice says the appendage effectively turns a semi-automatic weapon into a machine gun, which the government can aggressively regulate under the Firearms Act of 1986.
The Supreme Court has separately dismissed two other bids to delay implementation of the new bump stock rule : Chief Justice John Roberts rejected one such application in late March, and the full Court turned away a second one on March 28.

The administration promulgated a new rule banning the possession and distribution of bump stocks after the Harvest music festival massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Gunman Stephen Paddock outfitted over a dozen AR-15 rifles with bump stocks to perpetrate the massacre. 58 people died, and hundreds were injured.
The ban took effect on March 26. There are 500,000 bump stocks in circulation, according to Gun Owners of America. Advertisement - story continues below
The new rule requires any person or entity in possession of bump stocks to destroy or surrender them to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
There is one man in America who can legally own bump stocks as of this writing. RELATED: Bill That Would Outlaw Most Abortions Introduced with Strong Support in Alabama

April 5, 2019
The guy seems to be going to all the places that a 2002 Democratic Presidential candidate would be going to….
He’s a certified Progressive…
He running the biggest city in America….
H ? He has traveled to three early presidential primary states, held $5,000-a-plate events for donors and hired a small-dollar fund-raising consultant. He spoke at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, and is now on another trip to raise money in Boston, after which he will meet with Democratic activists in Las Vegas. These are the concrete steps of a man preparing to run for president. But thus far, that man, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, would prefer that his words speak louder than his actions. When asked if he plans to run for president, he gives the same answers. He is “not ruling anything out,” and will consult with his family before making a decision, one that he says will come “sooner than later.” Bank on sooner. Mr. de Blasio has had two City Hall aides working on his tentative campaign on their own time; one of them, Mike Casca, is a veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2016 presidential campaign, and worked in the senator’s office. The other mayoral aide helping Mr. de Blasio with his 2020 exploration is Jon Paul Lupo; last month, Mr. Lupo brought aboard Trilogy Interactive, a Washington, D.C.-based company that does digital fund-raising and marketing for political campaigns and others, to assist the mayor’s national political action committee, Fairness PAC. Mr. de Blasio created Fairness PAC to fund national Democratic candidates, and to pay for his and his wife’s political travel outside of New York.

Ouch….
We parents are under HUGE pressure to have our kids go to college…
The headlines on the celebrities belay a much more complicated problem….

It IS in the American National Security interest to have its young people go to college….

ARE gonna keep using their money, one way or another?
To get their kid in college….
Some College’s administrators are NOT gonna turn the money down…
Private college ARE BIG Business…..
Oh, and as the Washington Post linked piece points out?
It isn’t JUST about the money…..
Some parents will do OTHER crazy assed things ….. The intense pressure surrounding the admissions process — and the corrosive effect it can have on a parent’s tether to reality and morality — has been a hot topic in the aftermath of the recent college admissions scandal that led to indictments against 50 people, including 33 parents, two of them television stars. The alleged multimillion-dollar bribery scheme was said to be aimed at helping less-than-stellar students gain entry to elite colleges and universities. [ Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin, other parents charged in admissions scheme to appear in federal court in Boston ] Even among the most affluent and privileged families, such blatantly illegal acts are rare and widely shunned. But that doesn’t necessarily preclude other underhanded tactics, including attempts to sabotage students who are also competing for coveted spaces at the nation’s most selective schools. “I can tell you that every single parent that I know who has heard about [these rumors] has reacted with shock and horror,” said one Sidwell parent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject. “Whoever did this is a really good example of somebody who has lost all perspective and all sense of control, and I don’t think they represent our community, but I do think they represent the extremes that we’re seeing in the news — that absolute loss of any sense of normalcy around a process that shouldn’t be so intense.” Officials at Sidwell emphasized that the incidents would not be tolerated: “Instances of disrespect are anomalous and often anonymous, but have nevertheless become increasingly intense and inappropriate,” Head of School Bryan Garman wrote in a January email to senior class parents, a message that Sidwell shared with The Post. “The circulation of rumors about students and/or the verbal assault of employees are antithetical to the School’s values.” This sort of behavior is hardly the norm, school counselors and college prep experts agree — but neither is it as rare as one might hope. Sue Moller, a high school guidance counselor in Long Island and president of the Nassau Counselors’ Association, remembers feeling skeptical in 2008, when she first heard a mother voice concern that other parents would comb through her son’s social history or tell college admissions officials about his jaywalking citation. “I said, ‘Why would you think anyone would do that?’ And she said that one of their friends’ kids had been the target of an anonymous, disparaging letter; the admissions office had called them about it,” Moller recalled. “The parent in my office was petrified that someone was going to sabotage her kid, and I was like, ‘Oh, that doesn’t actually happen.’ ” But she wanted to be sure about that. So she posted a question on the message board for the National Association for College Admission Counseling, asking whether anyone else had heard of this type of behavior. And more than a dozen replies swiftly poured in to assure her that, yes, it does actually happen. There were accounts of parents who had called admissions offices to spread gossip about another child’s bad behavior, parents who reported long-ago run-ins with law enforcement, parents who sent anonymous tips about potentially compromising posts on students’ Facebook or Twitter pages. “I couldn’t believe it,” Moller said. But the stories kept coming…."
"The economy added 196,000 jobs in March….But?",politicaldog101.com,jamesb,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://politicaldog101.com/2019/04/the-economy-added-196000-jobs-in-march-but/,"The economy added 196,000 jobs in March….But? April 5, 2019
The numbers are happy numbers on the whole…
But the economy STILL seems to be slowing…. The economy added 196,000 jobs in March — topping economists’ forecasts of 175,000, and a big rebound from February’s weak report , the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate held at 3.8%, while wages grew 3.2% from the prior year — a slightly slower pace than last month. Why it matters: This month’s report, which shows that the economy added an additional 13,000 jobs in February than initially estimated, proves the jobs market is still chugging along for now. “The economy has been adding jobs faster … which is staggering considering how far along we are in post-recession recovery,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. Details: Job growth averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter of 2019. That’s lower than the average 223,000 per month in the same time period last year, but still strong. The number of people jumping in or out of the labor force didn’t budge much. The labor force participation rate — or the share of the population working or looking for work — fell slightly to 63% from the 63.2% in February….
More…
The But….
Jobless claims have fallen three weeks in a row and are sharply lower compared to a recent high of 244,000 in late January.
The downward descent is also reflected in the more stable monthly average of claims, which fell by 4,000 to 213,000. That’s the lowest level since October.
The number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, slipped by 38,000 to 1.72 million. The last time the figure was that low was in mid-January.
Big picture: The low rate of layoffs offers strong proof that a slowing economy has not infected the labor market. Wall Street anxiously awaits the employment report for March for further evidence after a surprisingly big dropoff in hiring in February.
Economists predict the economy added 179,000 new jobs in March after a tepid 20,000 increase in February that may have stemmed in part from harsh weather and the residual effects of the partial government shutdown. The report will be issued Friday morning.
As long as Americans are working and taking home paychecks, the economy should weather the current bout of weakness…."
Is a ‘tired’ Donald Trump working for a one term Presidency?,politicaldog101.com,jamesb,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://politicaldog101.com/2019/04/is-a-tired-donald-trump-working-for-a-one-term-presidency/,"Is a ‘tired’ Donald Trump working for a one term Presidency? April 5, 2019
A week ago there were reports that “The Donald’ was getting tired of being President….(the stories quickly went away…Not a good one for the media , which lives off Trump)
Contrary to what he might have imaged the job would be?
It has not turned out to be ‘King for the Day or Four Years’
Trump has never tried to run anything distantly close to the Federal Government’as bueracrcy….He has never had a board like the US Congress….
It shows….
He idea of things actually work is warped and often completely wrong…
As he serves his 3rd year in office….The constraints of the place have begun wear him down….
Bad moves on immigration, healthcare, trade and his ever present election foreign help may have the guy wishing for the time’s before he got the job….
No wonder some people might think the guy is actually working against a win next November….
The 2020 re-election campaign for President Trump knows it has a lot of work cut out to get the president back into the Oval Office. The electoral map looks to be more challenging than it was in 2016 with states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania likely to be close-calls that could possibly flip back to the Democratic nominee.
Then, there’s the matter of the Democratic field. It’s currently log-jammed, but the high volume of candidates has made it more difficult for the Trump campaign to focus on beating specific contenders.
But a New York Times report detailing the early strategies of the campaign team included another issue that could stand in the way of their goals: Trump is reportedly tired.
Per the Times , White House aides said the 72-year-old president is a bit weary after two years in office. Trump, who will turn 73 in June, was an “unstoppable” campaigner last go around and has continued to hold several campaign-style rallies even while serving as president. But he will reportedly slow things down for the 2020 elections — he’ll commit to just one campaign event per day and has already balked about heading out west for a rally during a fundraising push.
Is it possible that President Trump actually has no intention of winning re-election in 2020?
That’s the question that was posed on Thursday by a surprising voice: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, who in a segment on his show wondered what it might look like if Trump had decided he didn’t want to be president anymore and was taking steps to ensure he didn’t win another term, per The Washington Post .
In this “hypothetical” scenario, Carlson ran through a number of things Trump could do so that his base would turn on him — all of which line up with actual Trump administration actions or reported proposals. He noted, for example, that if Trump wanted to lose, he could raise gas taxes, something the administration is reportedly considering and an idea that Carlson said is “so mindless and counterproductive there’s literally no way you could get re-elected after doing it.” Later, he told Trump he should definitely “go with the gas tax” if he secretly wants “to retire early” and is “really sick of the job.”
Proposing cuts to Medicare and E-Verify would also be ways Trump could undermine his re-election chances, Carlson argued, as well as continuing “our pointless military intervention in Syria.” These, again, are not hypothetical scenarios at all. “If the president did all that, the message would be very clear: he has no idea what he ran on in 2016,” Carlson said. “He just wants out.” This was a surprisingly brutal segment from the Fox News host, although he has been critical of Trump before….

A fire erupted Tuesday in a Houston-area chemical plant, injuring two employees, leaving one and sending a plume of thick, black smoke into the air, authorities said.
Even the Harris County Fire Marshal’s Office stated in a tweet that early reports suggested a third one could not be located and two individuals were injured. Get alerts:
Authorities closed down a roadway near Tuesday’s fire in a KMCO compound plant in Crosby, about 25 miles (40 km ) northeast of Houston suburb, Harris county Sheriff Ed Gonzalez stated in a tweet. All residents inside a one-mile radius of the plant had been ordered to remain indoors or shield in place.
The county fire marshal’s office said that a warehouse in the plant was fire and officials had been”trying to ascertain what products are involved.”
Messages weren’t immediately returned.
Thick plumes of smoke could be seen rising from the plant.
The flame comes about two weeks following a March 17 refuge in a petrochemical storage facility at Deer Park, located about 20 miles (32 km ) south of Crosby. That fire burned for days and triggered air quality warnings.
According to a web site, KMCO is a company that provides brake and coolant fluid products and chemicals for the oilfield market.

Prices to U.S. factories for big-ticket manufactured products fell 1.6percent in February, the biggest drop in four weeks, representing a dip from the volatile commercial aircraft group. Demand in a industry used to track business investment choices declined in February.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the February decline came after a small 0.1% rise January and has been the weakest showing as a 4.3% drop in October.

The manufacturing sector has been strained for the past few months, representing a global economic slowdown and increasing trade tensions that have hurt U.S. exports. However there have been signs lately. Officials said mills are hiring to be sure they can meet need in the forthcoming months.
The report on new orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three decades, showed that a lot of their overall weakness came out of an 31.1% dip in orders for commercial aircraft, a fall that followed wellness gains in the last two weeks.
Prices for motor vehicles and parts dipped a small 0.1% after a 0.5% decrease in January.
Demand for machinery fell 0.3% while requests for computers and electronics fell 0.3 percent.
U.S. makers have faced a number of challenges within the last year for example trade wars begun by President Donald Trump. Trump is attempting to pressure China and other countries to open their economies into more U.S. exports, however Trump’s imposition of tariffs on foreign goods has prompted other countries to levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.

I can understand why people wouldn't want to read it, it contradicts the overpopulation narrative that people cling to so they can portray themselves as victims of a doomed world that needs to be saved.

It is almost impossible to maintain any accuracy with a bump stock; not to mention they invite even a quality weapon to jam. It is also very easy to tie a shoe lace to your belt and mimic the function of a bump stock. Legal arguments aside a bump stock is a joke to any serious shooter I know of. Most any experienced shooter could do a mag dump without a bump stock as fast as with one and still maintain better groups on paper. For me and a lot of other NRA members the reaction to bump stocks is 'who cares'.

"Final Version, ""Compelled Decryption and the Privilege Against Self-Incrimination"" - Volokh Conspiracy : Reason.com",reason.com,Paul Elliott,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/volokh/2019/04/05/final-version-compelled-decryption-and-t#comment_7748201,"Continued from international servers.
Compromised usage: You are arrested or kidnapped. A CANARY tells the international servers that you are compromised. The International servers start requiring proof that you are free and clear of coercion before they will release the real password. The password to the password stops working because the servers have lost trust in you. You can truthfully tell any court that you never had the real password. And you will be believed because it is well known that that is how these servers work. And you can not force the servers to trust you again until you can prove that you are free and clear of coercion.
How the CANARY works: you would choose this at setup time. Many possibilities:
1) a friend or attorney could be the CANARY.
2)Automatic CANARY when you go incommunicado when arrested or kidnapped. That is, you routinely tell someone that no one has messed with you. if you stop doing this, they report.
3) an Organization that reads the arrest records and newspapers everyday.
4)some combination of the above.
DEFENSIVE FORMULATION: I did not set this up to evade U.S. law, I was worried about being kidnapped by criminals or coerced by foreign governments."

Requiring the defendant disclose information necessary to interpret the evidence violates the fifth amendment, no matter how you try and dance around it."

We can look at what is practical, or we can look at the fundamental morality of a right against self-incrimination.
I don't think there is anything in history that says that the right against self-incrimination was intended to provide any balance or distribution of power between a defendant and the government. More likely, the founding fathers had an instinctive sense of fairness and considered it simply morally unacceptable that the government should commandeer a defendant into assisting in his own prosecution. Not that different from the immorality of making a person dig his own grave before he is executed.
So: is compelled decryption analogous to getting a blood sample, getting fingerprints, extracting from pockets the key to a safe, or getting DNA? I don't think so. All of these can be done if the defendant is lying there unconscious. Compelled decryption cannot.
The doctrine has been distorted over he centuries into something unrecognizable. What was merely a moral stand has now become a balancing of interests and an inquiry what society considers reasonable. Forgotten is the simple circular fact that what American society considers reasonable is largely driven by what the Supreme Court says."

How will this work?
Basically, NO ONE will remember their password anymore. Instead people will remember the password to the password. The real password will be stored on several international servers outside the U.S. and not subject to any U.S. court. These international servers will use SECRET SHARING (look it up, you will remember it longer), so that all servers will have to be compromised to circumvent the rules.
Normal usage: You need to authenticate yourself. You give the password to the password to the international servers, which returns the real password to those whom you need to authenticate to. YOU NEVER SEE THE REAL PASSWORD. This real password is checked as usual. This is all done automatically by a standard computer program, so the user does not need to think about the details.
