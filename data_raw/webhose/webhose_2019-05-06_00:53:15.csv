Iran threatens to respond in kind if US labels Revolutionary Guard terrorists,warsclerotic.com,josephwouk,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://warsclerotic.com/2019/04/07/iran-threatens-to-respond-in-kind-if-us-labels-revolutionary-guard-terrorists/,"By TOI STAFF and AFP Today, 2:51 pm Members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) march during the annual military parade marking the anniversary of the outbreak of the devastating 1980-1988 war with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, in the capital Tehran on September 22, 2018.

Iranian lawmakers warned on Sunday they would respond in kind if the United States designated their country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terror group.
On Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported such a move by Washington could come as early as Monday and would be the first time the US has designated a state entity as a terrorist organization.
Responding to the report, a vast majority of lawmakers in Iran’s parliament issued a statement threatening to designate elements of the US military a terror group, state-run news agency IRNA reported.
“We will answer any action taken against this force with a reciprocal action,” Reuters quoted the statement, signed by 255 out of the parliament’s 290 members, as saying. “So the leaders of America, who themselves are the creators and supporters of terrorists in the (Middle East) region, will regret this inappropriate and idiotic action.”
According to IRNA, the lawmakers also called the IRGC one of Iran’s greatest achievements since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
The US has accused the IRGC of supporting terror groups and militias throughout the Middle East that threaten allies such as Israel.

The Wall Street Journal, quoting unnamed officials, said US President Donald Trump’s administration would announce the long-mulled decision as soon as Monday and that concerned defense officials were bracing for the impact. Reuters said three US officials confirmed the plan.
It would be the first time the US has designated another nation’s army as a terror organization.
Iran warned that it could respond in kind, listing the US military as a terror group.
“If the Revolutionary Guards are placed on America’s list of terrorist groups, we will put that country’s military on the terror blacklist next to Daesh [Islamic State],” Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, the head of the Iranian parliament’s national security committee, tweeted on Saturday.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps was formed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution with a mission to defend the clerical regime, in contrast to more traditional military units that protect borders. It exists in parallel to Iran’s regular military. The Revolutionary Guards have amassed enormous power within Iran, becoming owners of significant industries and other economic interests on behalf of the regime.

The Guards’ prized foreign operations unit is the Quds Force, named for the Arabic word for Jerusalem, which supports forces allied with Iran around the region, including the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad and Lebanon’s Hezbollah terror group.
The Trump administration has already imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran after withdrawing last year from an international agreement under which Tehran scaled back its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
A foreign terrorist designation would make it harder for businesses and institutions to interact with the IRGC and its assets, as many such interactions would carry punishments under US law.
The Pentagon and CIA reportedly have reservations about the planned move by the Trump administration, with officials saying it could increase risks for US troops in the region without doing much more to damage the Iranian economy than existing sanctions and restrictions are already doing.
Reuters noted that in 2017 IRGC chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said such action by Washington would lead the Guards to “consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”
Republican Senator Ben Sasse spoke in support of the move, saying, “A formal designation and its consequences may be new, but these IRGC butchers have been terrorists for a long time.”"
Barack Obama Warns Progressives Not to Form ‘Circular Firing Squad’,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/barack-obama-warns-progressives-not-to-form-circular-firing-squad.html,"Breitbart April 7, 2019
On the heels of a week’s worth of attacks on handsy Joe Biden for his years of untoward treatment of women, former President Barack Obama is warning progressives not to form a “circular firing squad” to take out their own candidates.
Speaking in Germany at a town hall event on Saturday for his Obama Foundation, the former president said he feared that the extreme left of the Democrat Party has become too rigid.
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Uh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,’” Obama said , according to the Hill. “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a ‘circular firing squad,’ where you start shooting at your allies because one of them has strayed from purity on the issues. And when that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens.”
“So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer,” Obama continued, “you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you, and that by definition means you’re not going to get 100 percent of what you want.” This article was posted: Sunday, April 7, 2019 at 3:42 am Share this article"
Why Are Young Americans So Miserable?,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/why-are-young-americans-so-miserable.html,"Free Beacon April 7, 2019 Survey after survey shows young Americans are increasingly unhappy, depressed, and even suicidal. They are America’s future, and their outlook makes that future look grim. What’s the matter with kids today? Recent years have seen a rise in Americans 12 to 25 saying they are unhappy. Since 2012, the proportion of 8th and 10th graders who tell the Monitoring the Future survey that they felt unhappy has crept up from 13 percent to 18 percent. In roughly the same time, the proportion of 18- to 25-year-olds who say they are unhappy has risen from 11 to 17 percent, according to the General Social Survey . These small increases underrepresent the growing group of young people for whom life has grown unbearable. Among both high schoolers and young adults, incidences of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness—culminating in major depressive episodes —have risen substantially. A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that 70 percent of teenagers think anxiety and depression are major problems among their peers, easily outpacing bullying or drug addiction.

Mysterious Drug-Resistant Germ Deemed An “Urgent Threat” Is Quietly Sweeping The Globe,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/mysterious-drug-resistant-germ-deemed-an-urgent-threat-is-quietly-sweeping-the-globe.html,"Zero Hedge April 7, 2019
Thanks to the overprescription of antimicrobial drugs and use of antifungicides in crop production, a relatively new germ that preys on people with weakened immune systems is rapidly spreading across the globe, according to the New York Times .

The infection – a fungus known as Candida auris, kills almost half of all patients who contract it within 90 days , according to the CDC – as it’s impervious to most major antifungal medications. First described in 2009 after a 70-year-old Japanese woman showed up at a Tokyo hospital with C. auris in her ear canal, the aggressive yeast infection has spread across Asia and Europe – arriving in the US by 2016.
The earliest known case in the United States involved a woman who arrived at a New York hospital on May 6, 2013, seeking care for respiratory failure. She was 61 and from the United Arab Emirates, and she died a week later, after testing positive for the fungus. At the time, the hospital hadn’t thought much of it, but three years later, it sent the case to the C.D.C. after reading the agency’s June 2016 advisory. – NYT
“It is a creature from the black lagoon,” said the CDC’s Dr. Tom Chiller, who heads the fungal branch. “ It bubbled up and now it is everywhere. ”
In the last five years alone, it it has swept through a hospital in Spain, hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, spread throughout India, Pakistan and South Africa, and forced a prestigious British medical center to close its ICU for nearly two weeks.
By the end of June 2016, a scientific paper reported “an ongoing outbreak of 50 C. auris cases” at Royal Brompton, and the hospital took an extraordinary step: It shut down its I.C.U. for 11 days, moving intensive care patients to another floor, again with no announcement.
Days later the hospital finally acknowledged to a newspaper that it had a problem . A headline in The Daily Telegraph warned, “ Intensive Care Unit Closed After Deadly New Superbug Emerges in the U.K. ” (Later research said there were eventually 72 total cases, though some patients were only carriers and were not infected by the fungus.) – NYT
After C. auris reached New York , New Jersey and Illinois, the CDC added it to a list of germs deemed “urgent threats.”
Last May, an elderly man who was admitted to the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital for abdominal surgery was found to be infected with the drug-resistant candida. He died after 90 days in the hospital, however C. auris did not according to the Times . According to tests, the germ was everywhere in his room – to such a degree that the hospital required special cleaning equipment and had to rip out ceiling and floor tiles to get rid of it .
“Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,” said Hospital president Dr. Scott Lorin. “ The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive .” Dr. Shawn Lockhart, a fungal disease expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, holding a microscope slide with inactive Candida auris collected from an American patient.
Why is this happening?
Simply put, fungi are evolving defenses to resist and survive modern medications.
“It’s an enormous problem,” said Imperial College of London fungal epidemiology professor Matthew Fisher, who co-authored a recent scientific review on the rise of resistant fungi. “We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.”
The C.D.C. investigators theorized that C. auris started in Asia and spread across the globe. But when the agency compared the entire genome of auris samples from India and Pakistan, Venezuela, South Africa and Japan, it found that its origin was not a single place, and there was not a single auris strain.
…
The genome sequencing showed that there were four distinctive versions of the fungus, with differences so profound that they suggested that these strains had diverged thousands of years ago and emerged as resistant pathogens from harmless environmental strains in four different places at the same time. – NYT
“Somehow, it made a jump almost seemingly simultaneously, and seemed to spread and it is drug resistant, which is really mind-boggling,” said CDC fungal expert Dr. Snigdha Vallabhaneni.
While various theories exist as to why C. auris has made a grand entrance, Dutch microbiologist Jacques Meis believes the drug-resistant fungi are developing thanks to the heavy use of fungicides on crops .
Dr. Meis visited the C.D.C. last summer to share research and theorize that the same thing is happening with C. auris, which is also found in the soil: Azoles have created an environment so hostile that the fungi are evolving, with resistant strains surviving.
This is similar to concerns that resistant bacteria are growing because of excessive use of antibiotics in livestock for health and growth promotion. As with antibiotics in farm animals, azoles are used widely on crops. – NYT
“On everything — potatoes, beans, wheat, anything you can think of, tomatoes, onions,” said Dr. Johanna Rodes, an infectious disease expert at Imperial College London. “We are driving this with the use of antifungicides on crops.”
Keeping it quiet
In 2015, Dr. Rhodes received a panicked call from the Royal Brompton Hospital medical research center outside of London, where C. auris had taken root months earlier. The hospital had no idea how to get rid of it.

“We have no idea where it’s coming from. We’ve never heard of it. It’s just spread like wildfire,” Rhodes was told, before she helped them clean it up. Under her direction, hospital workers used a special aerosol devices to spray hydrogen peroxide around a room which housed a patient with the germ – with the theory being that the vapor would permeate the entire room.
After one week of saturating the room, they put a “settle plate” in the middle of it with a gel at the bottom that would allow any remaining microbes to grow.
Only one grew back; C. auris . And officials were scrambling to keep a lid on it.
It was spreading, but word of it was not. The hospital, a specialty lung and heart center that draws wealthy patients from the Middle East and around Europe, alerted the British government and told infected patients, but made no public announcement.
“There was no need to put out a news release during the outbreak,” said Oliver Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.
This hushed panic is playing out in hospitals around the world . Individual institutions and national, state and local governments have been reluctant to publicize outbreaks of resistant infections, arguing there is no point in scaring patients — or prospective ones. – NYT
And while the Brompton Hospital case did make headlines, the issue remaied largely out of the spotlight internationally – despite an even larger outbreak in Valencia, Spain occurring at virtually the same time at the 992-bed Hospital Universitari i Politècnic La Fe. Unknown to the public or unaffected patients, 372 people had become “colonized” with the germ – meaning it was on their bodies but they had not yet contracted it. Of those, 85 patients developed bloodstream infections, and 41% of those died within 30 days .
And while other prominent strains of Candida have not developed significant resistance to drugs, over 90% of C. auris infections are resistant to at least one drug, while 30% are resistant to two or more drugs .
According to Connecticut’s deputy state epidemiologist Dr. Lynn Sosa, C. auris is now “the top” threat among resident infections.

Most Brits Now Just Want To Leave With No Deal…Get Out While They Can; Poll Shows,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/most-brits-now-just-want-to-leave-with-no-deal-get-out-while-they-can-poll-shows.html,"April 7, 2019
Perhaps there is some new plague that only affect politicians on a global scale.
It seem no matter what country we look at, it is simply going completely insane. Americans rarely understand Parliamentary politics in London for it is not unusual for Trump to meet with Chuck and Nancy in the White House. In British politics, there is no pretend bipartisanship where there are meetings between the parties.
The structural difference in a Parliamentary system is that the ruling party controls everything and the opposition party might as well just go on holiday.
Here the mere fact that Prime Minister Theresa May is meeting with the head of the Labour Party is earth-shattering to say the least. It illustrates that May will not compromise for it is very clear that she will not yield to her own people and is attempting to force the EU demands down everyone’s throat.
The latest polls show that the majority of British have had enough .
While parliament has so far been completely unable to agree on a way out of the current deadlock, is there any consensus among the public?
A survey by YouGov shows that, assuming the EU were to allow an extension, only 11 percent think we should take that offer, with a plurality (40 percent) saying the country should then settle for a no deal situation . A slightly lower 36 percent would then rather remain in the Union.
If an extension is not on the table though, the split is almost even between those favouring no deal (44 percent) and to remain (42 percent).
You will find more infographics at Statista
They just want to exit the EU without any deal whatsoever. There is absolutely NOTHING to gain from an EU deal.
Britain will be the major loser and it will surrender its sovereignty in the process.
This is going to make for an extraordinary interesting WEC in Rome. Our model has been projecting political chaos but this brexit debacle has scored a new record high in political incompetence.
PM May was against BREXIT from the outset. She has refused to negotiate a fair deal for Britain and in the process she is dooming her own country. This article was posted: Sunday, April 7, 2019 at 3:42 am Share this article"
Even Joe Biden’s Wife Said His Constant Groping Made Her Feel “Strange And Uncomfortable”,www.prisonplanet.com,admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.prisonplanet.com/even-joe-bidens-wife-said-his-constant-groping-made-her-feel-strange-and-uncomfortable.html,"Zero Hedge April 7, 2019
Even Joe Biden’s wife found her husband’s tendency to be overly physical to be strange and off-putting when they first met.
According to an excerpt from the former second lady’s upcoming autobiography published in the Daily Mail, when the couple first met, “He was always holding my hand, putting his arm around me, brushing the hair from my face.” She added that Joe and his “handsy” family made her feel “strange and uncomfortable” at first. As an admitted introvert, she “sometimes found all that affection draining,”
But she said she soon came to understand that it was the death of Biden’s first wife Neilia and their baby daughter Naomi that made Biden and his family realize “how precious every second could be,” which was displayed by “constantly touching” and “being connected to each other.”
But Jill said this “tactile” sensibility helped make Biden the politician that he is .
“He connects with people so easily and he never hesitates when a stranger wants to tell him something personal or give him a hug,” she said.
“When Joe loves, he loves hard; he’s all in.”
Case in point: She went on her first date with Biden after he cold called her. “How did you get this number?” were the first words she remembers speaking to him back in 1975, when he was a young Senator from the State of Delaware. Joe told her that he got her number from his brother, Frank.
When she told him she had a date already planned the night, Biden asked her to cancel it; she did, and they went out for the next three nights.
Of course, the eight women who have accused Biden of inappropriately groping them probably wouldn’t see this as an excuse. Not that Biden cares: He infamously refused to apologize for his behavior, though he did promise to be more mindful of other people’s feelings.
Since one of Biden’s accusers blasted him over his non-apology, maybe getting the “you just don’t understand” talk from his wife would be more effective. This article was posted: Sunday, April 7, 2019 at 3:42 am Share this article"

Democrats and members of the establishment media fell for a viral clip purporting that President Donald Trump called asylum seekers “animals” on Friday at an immigration roundtable.
In reality, the clip in question is from an event in May 2018 when the president was clearly referring to members of the MS-13 gang as “animals.” At the time, CSPAN posted a deceptively edited clip that cut out someone else’s remark about MS-13 that the president responded to, making it sound like Trump was talking about immigrants more generally.
The shortened clip was reposted on Friday by Twitter user Mark Elliot, who falsely claimed that the president was referring to “people asking for asylum” and did not indicate that Trump’s remarks were not new.

WASHINGTON -- During the two years when Democrats controlled the Oval Office, Senate and House, President Barack Obama squandered a major opportunity.
He failed to push for a vote on a DREAM Act, which would create a path to citizenship for qualified undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as minors. That matter was left for a vote in the lame-duck Congress; and that vote proved to be a gesture, as the Democratic Senate failed to garner the needed 60 votes. America will never know how it might have ended if Obama had put his back into it.
Ever since, Obama's failure to push for this key promise of his 2008 campaign remains an object of contempt among conservatives -- who presume Democrats preferred to dangle the issue through the 2012 election and gin up resentment among Latino voters.
With President Donald Trump's failure to push Republicans to change immigration laws when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress in 2017 and 2018, Trump may find himself in that same corner of shame.
With 1 million or so undocumented migrants expected to cross the southwest border this year, Trump's commitment to building his signature border wall doesn't seem to be doing the trick, and he hasn't focused on measures that actually could improve the nation's immigration machinery.
When Trump first got into office, a big drop in southwest border apprehensions suggested his anti-immigrant campaign rhetoric had such a chilling effect that his promised wall might be superfluous. But then the numbers began to climb.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently argued that a law which prevents immigration officials from promptly returning minors from the so-called Northern Triangle countries and a court decision that limits how long the government can hold minors serve as loopholes that ""create a functionally open border.""
That's why Mark Krikorian of the pro-enforcement Center for Immigration Studies always has argued that changing immigration law and enforcement would be far more effective than building a wall -- not that he's opposed to spending on a wall.
Trump's push for the wall shows that he is working to keep to his 2016 campaign promise: But it really can't do much to discourage economic migrants who ultimately would not qualify for asylum but nonetheless believe they will be able to get into the United States through a port of entry.
That's the problem with Trump's beloved wall. It may resonate with his base, but it won't bring about the changes the base wants.
And it's hard to get Republicans -- many of whom do not share Trump's view on illegal immigrants -- to die on a hill for a big-ticket item which the public opposes and politicians doubt will work.
Krikorian doesn't think it's too late for Trump to switch his focus to changing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act so that federal officials can send undocumented minors who don't qualify for asylum back to non-contiguous countries the same way that they can return minors from Mexico and Canada.
Could such a measure make it through the Democratic House? Not now, but that could change if the flow of migrants through Mexico continues at such dangerous levels.
""Politically it is essential for the Republicans to make it clear that [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer are the reason we have this border disaster,"" said Krikorian. ""They are playing the part of [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel in inviting an unlimited number of people to come to the United States.""
Krikorian believes that the GOP Senate should put its efforts on reworking immigration law so that it doesn't encourage border chaos.
It doesn't help when Trump says, as he did Friday morning, that he wants to ""get rid of the whole asylum system."" It was another act of verbal self-sabotage that showed an executive ready to bar not only economic migrants, but also refugees fearing for their lives.
The week's antics with the president's since-retracted threats of closing the border with Mexico only reinforce a portrait of an executive who hasn't focused on a goal -- reducing illegal immigration -- so much as on winning.
So, Trump claimed victory Friday morning because Mexico has done a better job of enforcing its southern border under his threat. Does anyone think that will last when the mercurial president takes his eye off the ball?
I get how the Trump base cheers on the president's ability to drive the left crazy with his rhetoric: But it's not going to fix a humanitarian crisis.

In fits of hyperbolic condemnation for President Trump and the America First movement, political and media leftists continue to escalate their rhetoric and now reach almost casually for comparisons to Hitler and his evil Nazi regime. Such obscene references poison our public dialogue, demean the horror suffered by Holocaust victims, and betray the heroism of our American military veterans.
On Thursday, former Congressman Beto O’Rourke appeared at a campaign event in Carroll, Iowa and castigated President Trump’s tough talk on illegal border crossings as reminiscent of the “Third Reich.” O’Rourke told the story of a visit to an elementary school where a “third grade girl, who was handing us the hand-drawn Valentines, who happens to be Mexican American, says: ‘Why does the president not like me?’” Quite frankly, I find O’Rourke’s setup difficult to accept, as it conveniently fits the popular but dubious narrative of the “woke 8 year old.” Even more suspiciously, it almost precisely replicates the story Playboy’s White House correspondent, Brian Karem, tweeted : that a “young Hispanic boy” on the Washington subway “saw my press pass and asked me ‘why does the president hate me?’”
But regardless of the veracity of these accounts, O’Rourke leapt at the opportunity to compare Trump to Nazis. He told the audience that the president “went on to call asylum seekers animals. … Now, we would not be surprised if in the Third Reich other human beings were described as an infestation, as a cockroach, or a pest you would want to kill.”
First, President Trump did not, at all, call asylum seekers “animals,” but rather very clearly directed that descriptor toward violent MS-13 gang assailants. Trump opponents have lied about these “animal” comments almost as often as they have propagated the totally discredited Charlottesville hoax, the myth that he called neo-Nazi supremacists “fine people.”
The extremist O’Rourke clearly disagrees vehemently with Trump on U.S. border sovereignty, even arguing to tear down already existing barricades. While his open-borders fantasies represent awful policy, he at least displays honesty in publicly staking out his highly unpopular view. But he also delves into demonization, comparing Trump and border enforcement to the most evil regime of modern history, one that systemically slaughtered millions of people.
Sadly, O’Rourke finds much company in this ugly pattern of Nazi analogizing among Trump critics. For example, former CIA Director Michael Hayden tweeted out a picture of the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp with the text “other governments have separated mothers and children.” MSNBC’s Donny Deutsch expanded the condemnation, not only impugning Trump and our Homeland Security agents, but also the 63 million Americans who voted for the president. Deutsch admonished “Morning Joe” viewers that “if you vote for Trump, then you the voter -- you, not Trump -- are standing at the border like Nazis.”
It is really beneath decency to debate these accusations on their substance, though I will point out that Trump, ironically, is the closest America has ever come to a Jewish president. No national political leader in our country deserves such ignorant insults, and certainly not a man who shares Shabbat with his own grandchildren and was told by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that “Israel has never had a better friend than you.”
Even more importantly, cavalier comparisons like O’Rourke’s denigrate the ghastly sufferings of the millions massacred by Hitler and his henchmen. Throwing around Nazi references to disparage rivals over policy prescriptions cheapens the sacredness of the true horrors of the Shoah. Edna Friedberg, a historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, decried that politicians and media figures “casually use Holocaust terminology to bash anyone or any policy with which they disagree.”
Moreover, such vile analogies disrespect the honor of America’s veterans who led the alliance that toppled the wicked Nazi menace. Hundreds of thousands of young Americans perished across an ocean to dismantle fascism. American military cemeteries dot that continent today, and remind us of the price our country paid to smash oppression. There’s truth in the aphorism that “politics ain’t bean-bag,” and we should all welcome a vigorous debate on controversial ideas such as illegal immigration. But we should also all agree to refrain from comparing political rivals to the worst murderous monsters in history.

Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech,www.realclearpolitics.com,Peter Berkowitz,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/04/07/defending_democratic_norms_requires_defending_free_speech_139981.html,"now reading: Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech COMMENTARY By Peter Berkowitz - RCP Contributor April 07, 2019 Defending Democratic Norms Requires Defending Free Speech COMMENTARY Video: Global Warming Lorem Ipsum Dolor Sit ...
Many in the United States worry about the erosion of democratic norms. Too few, however, exhibit concern for the steady deterioration over the last half century of the essential democratic norm of free speech.
True, the United States remains an exceptional experiment in free and democratic self-government. Of all the Western-style liberal democracies, the nation “conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal”— as Lincoln put it in 1863 at Gettysburg — is grounded in the oldest written constitution, sustains the largest economy, enjoys the greatest diversity, possesses the largest capacity for projecting force around the world, and shoulders the most extensive responsibility for preserving the freedom and openness of the international order. Yet the increasing hostility of influential segments of its population to free speech — not least, speech that affirms American exceptionalism — shows the United States to be in an unwelcome respect all-too-similar to fellow Western liberal democracies.
The growing scorn for free speech in the United States — on campuses, in Silicon Valley and Hollywood, and in human resource departments and on corporate boards of all sorts of commercial enterprises — is on a collision course with the U.S. Constitution. Free speech is inscribed in the First Amendment, following religious freedom and followed by freedom of the press and “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
Its position in the text of the First Amendment symbolizes free speech’s indissoluble connection to religious liberty and political liberty. One can neither worship (or not worship) God in accordance with one’s conscience, nor persuade and be persuaded by fellow citizens, if government dictates orthodox opinions and punishes the departure from them. Indeed, the more authorities — whether formally through the exercise of government power, or informally through social intolerance — prescribe a single correct view and demonize others, the more citizens lose the ability to form responsible judgments and defend the many other freedoms that undergird human dignity and self-government.
In the mounting hostility toward free speech within its borders, the United States is not alone, argues Andrew A. Michta in The American Interest. “Democracies across the West are at an inflection point on free speech,” he contends in “ The Rise of Unfreedom in the West, ” “and it’s not clear which way things will go on this issue in the next 20 or 30 years.”
The problem is manifold. “In some cases, ostensibly liberal governments have already made moves to police and suppress what they deem unacceptable speech; in others, rigid political binaries have threatened to crowd out traditions of free inquiry and debate,” Michta writes. “All too often, it seems not to matter what is said in an argument but rather who says it and how it was said.”
The dean of the College of International and Security Studies at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, Michta grounds his dire diagnosis in concrete empirical evidence. Barely a quarter “of American adults believe they have true freedom of speech.” Ninety percent of American universities censor speech or maintain policies that could authorize administrators to engage in censorship. In 2017, Germany enacted a law that obliges social media networks to be more “diligent in policing ‘hate speech’ on their platforms.” The next year, France adopted a similar law. A substantial plurality of British voters in 2018 believed that people do not feel free to express their opinions on “important issues.” And an annual report to the Council on Europe concludes that press freedom in Europe is, in Michta’s words, “more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War.”
In both American and European societies, according to Michta, the tyranny of public opinion not only dictates what one may not say but also decrees what one must affirm. In both societies, ideological litmus tests govern public discourse. The notion that lively give-and-take is the route to public consensus is fading.
Elite opinion in the West, Michta maintains, not only leans left, but seeks to silence the right. For much of the academic, media, and political establishments, progressive opinions glow with righteousness while viciousness and ignorance indelibly stain conservative convictions.
Cultural and political elites besmirch caring for one’s own nation as xenophobia. They fervently embrace globalization. They trumpet their commitment to save the planet while pressing for impossibly expensive and utterly unworkable environmental measures. They revile the popular desire to preserve traditional morality and the nation’s inheritance even as they take for granted ordinary people’s humanitarian conscience.
The West’s descent into unfreedom, argues Michta, stems from the aggressive promulgation of ideas at odds with liberty and limited government. In the 1960s, a critical mass of university professors used their tenured positions not merely to argue for but to institutionalize the belief that to achieve a just society it was necessary to sweep aside the fundamental principles and institutions of liberal democracy.
Over the last 20 years, the neo-Marxist students — and students of the students — of the ’60s generation have intensified attacks on free speech. Neo-Marxist thinking replaces the proletariat with a bevy of identity-based groups whose claim to authority arises from their success in portraying themselves as victims of bias and oppression which, they maintain, are deeply embedded within the West. Like Marx’s proletariat — or those bourgeois intellectuals whom Marx declared would break from their class and speak on the proletariat’s behalf — the neo-Marxists assert that by virtue of their grievances, they have acquired a monopoly on the truth.
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe 30 years ago and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that followed, argues Michta, “carried a hidden threat” that further damaged the West’s commitment to free speech. The great victory of democracy and freedom in the Cold War over communist totalitarianism convinced Western elites that they were uniquely suited to bring democracy and freedom, as they uniquely interpreted it, to the entire globe.
This conceit had perverse domestic ramifications. According to Michta, it “contained within it the seeds of arguably the greatest peril the West has ever confronted: the ideological certitude — not just on the Left — that we had cracked the code of the human condition and could get on with the work of perfecting both the individual and society.” Ideological certitude hardened at the very moment that communism’s defeat deprived the West of “a living example” of the costs of social engineering on a mass scale. “And so at its moment of triumph,” writes Michta, “the West fell victim to a post-Enlightenment delusion of the perfectibility of man.”
That delusion fuels the self-consuming scorn many intellectuals in the United States as well as in Europe direct at the principles of liberal democracy. At universities, America’s founding promise of individual freedom and equality under law is often treated as irredeemably tainted by racism and sexism, colonialism and imperialism. In some cases, free speech is placed on the list of “incorrect phrases” that ought not be uttered, because it belongs among the “impure thoughts” of which minds must be cleansed.
In light of long-term trends, those who care about the erosion of democratic norms in the United States — and who believe that that the United States can serve as a model to fellow liberal democracies — would do well to focus their energies on upholding the constitutional requirements of free speech, cultivating tolerance, and learning to benefit from a diversity of opinion.

It is clear that the Dems are only interested in minorities to the point of how much they can use them. You just have to look at places like Chicago to see how much Dems care about the Black population.
The Dems have divided America like it has never been since the civil war.
They have blacks against whites, Women against men, straights against gays and rich against poor.
The Dems are at such a point that it is unlikely that Bernie will win the nomination because he is straight, white old man so he does not tick any of the minority boxes. Even at this early stage it is becoming apparent that Harris is the nominee the MSM will be throwing their weight behind and Bernie will likely be cheated again.
It doesn't matter who the best candidate is, it just matters which candidate is in the most 'oppressed' groups
I can't stand Bernie and I hate Harris even more, but if Bernie is cheated again, the Dem party will rip apart. I am a Trump supporter, but certainly recognise the need for an opposition party in any democracy. A one-party state is very dangerous."

Click here to login and CreateDebate will send an email for you. I'm inviting Amarel to compile a list of proofs for free will Since you are a pseudo-intellectual lying coward you did not provide much proof for free will when we debated about it, instead you tried to bypass my arguments without really addressing them then called me an intellectual coward when I got bored of your stupidity. So why don't you try to prove free will exists using solid proofs instead of just repeating fallaciously that free will does not contradict the laws of cause and effect. Amarel (4729) 1 point
When discussing free will we have to account for what people mean by it. Proponents of the free will position mean that a person with free will makes choices. Opponents of the free will position mean that a person with free will acts without constraint, independent of causation (If this does not fit your description of free will, feel free to correct it).
It is the case that people cannot act independent of causation. But then, even if they could, you would not have a person expressing what anyone might consider free will as their actions would be truly and completely random. The person would be in control of absolutely nothing. When asked why they chose a given random action, the only reasonable response would be “I don’t know”. From the free will opponents perspective, free will should never have become a topic of conversation since it does not and cannot exist in any given circumstance, with or without causation. It is a non-subject.
How then did free will become a subject?
Proponents of the free will perspective recognize that people are agents that make independent choices. Independent here does not mean in a vacuum or unconstrained. It means that the agent itself is that which makes the choice. How one chooses is determined by the kind of person they are and the outside circumstances they are in. But they still engage in the act of choosing. And it is still the agent engaging in the act. That is free will from the proponents perspective, and that very clearly exists.
There is a bit of regression that free will opponents may engage in to dispute proponents. Opponents may challenge that a person cannot choose what kind of person they are. Proponents counter that people choose to change themselves all the time. Opponents then argue that the agent was the kind of person who chooses to change what kind of person they are, which is a quality that is fundamental to the agent and thus could not be chosen. While that is true, it does not negate the fact that the agent is making choices, so it does not disprove the proponents perspective.
A shortcut to the above regression would be to argue that human agents cannot choose to fly and thus do not have free will. This shortcut illustrates the weakness of the regression argument. Proponents do not need to claim that agents are unconstrained, only that they make choices. Choices within the constraints of one’s fundamental character are still choices.
Indeed such constraints are necessary to the free will proponent who will argue for responsibility of an agent for their actions. Without the fundamental constraint of character, we would not be able to judge by their actions what kind of person an agent is. But since an agent makes choices based on the kind of person they are in context of their circumstances , we can categorize people by character trait tendency (honest, violent, manipulative, etc). Such judgements rely not only on the premise of free will (as understood by its proponents), but also on the premise of a causal universe. Thus, free will isn’t merely non-contradictory to causation, it relies on it. This is why free will proponents can ask for reasons (causes) behind actions, and expect an answer. Indeed the person who cannot name their causes is less of a free will agent than the person who can name all of them.
Summary:
-Free will opponents conceive of free will in terms of agent action independent of any causes or constraints.
-Free Will proponents conceive of free will as agent choice.
-The opponent perspective is not conducive to any notion of actual choice, given a person acting without reasons (causes) would be a puppet of randomness.
-The proponent perspective is not only conducive to, but relies on a causal universe, wherein an agent can provide the reasons for their choices.
-The existence of constraint does not diminish the proponent’s perspective. Being unable to make specific choices does not equate to being unable to make any choices. 5mins ago "

Democrat Jerrold Nadler: Religious rights must bow to LGBT – GOPUSA,www.gopusa.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.gopusa.com/democrat-jerrold-nadler-religious-rights-must-bow-to-lgbt/,"Democrat Jerrold Nadler: Religious rights must bow to LGBT Michael Haverluck Posted On 7:40 am April 5, 2019 71 FILE - (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) As Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.-Dist. 10) championed the so-called “Equality Act” in a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, he stressed that the bill would make sure religious beliefs cannot be used to “discriminate” against the LGBT community. As the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Nadler impressed that under the Equality Act, everyone must fall subject to the LGBT agenda – with churches and religious employers, organizations and colleges being afforded no exemptions whatsoever. “Religion is no excuse for discrimination when it comes to sexual orientation or gender identity,” Nadler asserted Tuesday in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, according to Liberty Counsel . LGBT trumps all? Giving testimony against the pro-LGBT bill – also known as HR 5 – was Julia Beck, who is a self-described radical lesbian feminist and the former law and policy co-chair for Baltimore’s LGBTQ Commission. She alerted the Christian community and other faith-based groups about what to expect when or if the proposed legislation passes and becomes enforced. “This would eliminate women and girls as a coherent legal category worthy of civil rights protections,” Beck revealed, according to Liberty Counsel. “There is no way to tell if someone is lying about being transgender.” She said that if gender identity becomes recognized under federal law, Americans can expect to see the following scenarios regularly play out: Male rapists will go to female prisons and will likely assault female inmates – as has already happened in the UK. Female survivors of rape will be unable to contest male presence in women’s shelters. Men will dominate women’s sports and girls who would have taken first place will be denied scholastic opportunity. Women who use male pronouns to talk about men may be arrested, fined and banned from social media platforms. Girls will stay home from schools when they have their periods to avoid harassment by boys in mixed-sex toilets. Girls and women will no longer have a right to ask for female medical staff or intimate care providers – including elderly or disabled women who are at serious risk of sexual abuse. Female security officers will no longer have the right to refuse to perform pat-down or intimate searches of males who say they’re female. Women undergoing security checks will no longer have the right to refuse having those searches performed by men claiming a feminine identity. And these shocking instances are by no means farfetched … “It’s already happening,” Beck insisted. “And it’s only going to get worse.” Nip it at the bud … Legal experts argue that the proposed legislation takes aim at wiping out Americans’ freedom of religion guaranteed by the United States Constitution – giving the LGBT community a free pass to infiltrate virtually every aspect their lives while violating their sincerely held religious beliefs. “Members of the U.S. House of Representatives recently introduced this bill that threatens the free exercise of religion and free speech,” Liberty Counsel announced in its news release. “HR 5 amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by striking the word ‘sex,’ and inserting ‘sex, sexual orientation, gender identity’ as protected classes throughout the federal code. This amendment applies to employment, housing, rental, public accommodation and more.” Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver indicated that the bill is nothing less than a Trojan Horse used by the LGBT community to force acceptance and its agenda on society. “Chairman Nadler and Julia Beck gave surprising testimonies at today’s House Judiciary Committee hearing confirming that the so-called ‘Equality Act’ has nothing to do with equality,” Staver argued in the release. “This bill pushes the LGBT agenda on all people and targets Christianity in every area of life – including the church.” He wared about the repercussions of passing such a dangerous piece of pro-LGBT legislation. “There also will be an increase of sexual assaults when males ‘identifying as females’ are allowed to use girls and women’s bathrooms and locker rooms,” the legal expert added. “And that is just the beginning of unconstitutional chaos in America – and even radicals can see that.” Dr. James Dobson – who founded Focus on the Family and the James Dobson Family Institute decades later – sent an earlier warning that the Equality Act could spell disaster for Americans – if passed in Congress. “Make no mistake – the so-called Equality Act is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to finish off religious liberty in America once and for all, which ought to be plainly obvious – based upon a cursory reading of the First Amendment,” Dobson contended, according to WND . “Simply put, by creating a protected class of citizens out of the LGBT community, this bill places Christians who believe in traditional marriage at grave legal and civil jeopardy.” He saw no reservation by Democratic leaders to steamroll over Christians’ rights to live out their faith in order to forward their ultra-left pro-LGBT agenda. “I wish I could say I was shocked to see the speed with which Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats have brought to committee the sweet-sounding but entirely treacherous Equality Act,” Dobson continued. “This decision demonstrates a frightening willingness by those on the left to advance a radical social agenda at a time when our nation already faces so many other divisive challenges.” According to another conservative nonprofit group, the Pelosi-backed bill would trample the religious rights of a slew of Americans. “The Heritage Foundation said employers, workers, medical professionals, parents, children, women and nonprofit organizations all would be harmed by the plan from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-Calif.),” WND’s Bob Unruh noted. The Christian leader pointed out the left’s deception that LGBT rights are equal to the civil rights African Americans fought for decades ago during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960 – even comparing it to slavery. “While no evangelical Christian would ever support hate or violence of any kind against an LGBT individual – or any other person for that matter – to modify the 1964 Civil Rights Act with this wrong-headed bill would not only be legally fraught – it would also put moral equivalence to the unprecedented, centuries-long struggle of countless millions of African Americans to gain freedom from slavery and the persistent, systematic oppression that followed,” Dobson stressed. Taking another shot at Christian freedom Besides trying to pass the Equality Act, Nadler is attacking 1993’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the religious freedoms by which Hobby Lobby and other Christian businesses and organizations able to enjoy protections as a result of its passage. “Bosses should not be able to make health care decisions about the reproductive choices of their employees,” Nadler said in a press release statement he released on the oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court regarding Hobby Lobby and RFRA. “The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was intended to be used as a shield – not a sword. No matter how sincerely held a religious belief might be, for-profit employers – like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga Wood – cannot wield their beliefs as a means of denying employees access to critical preventive health care services [including abortion].” Attempting to forward the LGBT agenda, he tried to argue that Christians are trying to get more religious freedoms than what have been guaranteed to them by the Constitution. “When we passed RFRA, we sought to restore – not expand – protection for religion,” Nadler continued.” We kept in place the core principle that religion does not excuse for-profit businesses from complying with our laws. Religious belief did not excuse restaurants or hotels from following our civil rights laws in the 1960s or an Amish employer from paying into the Social Security system in the 1980s. It should not be expanded now to allow for-profit companies to override the health care choices of female employees.” The ultra-left Democrat then implied that Christians living according to biblical teachings on human sexuality is essentially them pushing religious beliefs on others. “To hold otherwise allows the owners of for-profit companies to impose their beliefs on others – their employees and patrons – who may not share their beliefs and who will be harmed as result. I am hopeful that the Court will confirm that these sort of discriminatory actions by for-profit companies are neither protected by RFRA nor the First Amendment.”

The cold opening showed multiple cringe-worthy examples of the behavior that has raised questions about Biden’s potential 2020 bid.
As the show opens, several Biden advisers stand around talking, with one asking “do you think he can turn this around?” And another says “Yeah, he’s a good guy. I’m sure this is tearing him up inside.”
Biden (played by Jason Sudeikis) then enters, laughing, and then gives everybody big hugs, rubs their heads, etc.
Then an African-American voter from Oakland comes to meet him and says “Oh my God, I know who you are. You’re Obama’s granddaddy! I’m going to vote for you.” And Biden says “get in here” and they give each other big hugs. Then Biden turns around, bends over and yells “Give me some low five” while the black woman slaps his butt a few times with Biden laughing.
Then she grabs him and squeezes him, yelling “Yeaaah!” and Biden says “not that far” with both of them laughing and having a great time.
Then she leaves saying “I’ll see you later” and Biden says “There you go, Love ya Baby! I appreciate it!” then later adds “Whoa, her thumbs. Wow.”
Biden’s campaign adviser, played by Kate McKinnon then says “That’s not how I wanted that to go. But did we learn anything today?”
Biden says “Oh yeah, yeah. Not really. But the important thing is I’m listening. I hear you, and I feel you, I feel you” with his hands rubbing her legs, and McKinnon says “that’s not the right direction.”
But Biden laughs it off, saying:
“So come on, let’s hug it out America. Biden and Some Woman in 2020. We can do this!

Also on the same show, the “Weekend Update” segment discussed the fact that Donald Trump’s presidency lacks legitimacy.
“If Donald Trump stole his presidency, why don’t we just steal it back?” co-anchor Michael Che asked.
“Why is everybody trying to play fair with this guy?
“Even the FBI — oh, you didn’t find anything — then plant it, you’re the FBI,” he continued.
“Just turn off your body cam and put some crack in his shoes, man,” Che suggested."

That's it, isn't it? We've turned into a Monty Python sketch: angry, absurd and ultimately, bizarre. And yet the Sunday shows keep inviting on all these Trumpies as if they won't get abused or argued with from what we all know is the truth.

Why Trump’s Risky Economy Could Crash At Any Time,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/07/why-trumps-risky-economy-could-crash-at-any-time.html,"Why Trump’s Risky Economy Could Crash At Any Time 521 Subscribe Print Flipboard
A special report from the Washington Post has revealed that in order to stimulate economic growth, Donald Trump made risky changes in financial rules that could backfire at any time.
Trump took the steps so he would look good and receive high approval ratings due to a booming economy.
But Trump’s economy is built on extremely high risk loans made to hundreds of large companies that could soon default on those loans, throwing the economy into the worst crisis since 2008.
In making the rules changes, Trump worked with complicit Republicans in Congress who had received large campaign donations from financial firms. These firms have lobbied the government to relax the strict financial rules which have been protecting consumers and the economy.
The new rules have been worked on by federal regulators for the past two years, ever since Trump took office. The changes allowed banks and other financial companies to issue more than $1 trillion in risky corporate loans.
And now there is spreading fear that the U.S. government has once again been manipulated by Wall Street, making the same mistakes that were made before the last financial crash.
Trump, congressional Republicans, and the people they appointed to administer and oversee financial regulations have all worked together to undo the economic protections put in during the Obama administration.
And the result has been an economy built on risk.
Now, regulators are struggling to comprehend the scope and potential dangers of the trillions of dollars of leveraged loans that have been made that could go bad at any time.
Hundreds of companies received the loans even though they were already highly leveraged with large amounts of debt. The risk of default is extremely high.
The reason the loans were made is that Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and other financial companies have earned huge fees from making them.
If the loans go bad, these Wall Street firms won’t be on the hook, since they have sold the debt to other companies. And the risk of default is very high since the loans won’t be repaid if the economy slows down or if interest rates go up.
“This means that the next downturn that we have could be more serious and longer-lasting and more difficult to deal with than it would have been if we had constrained these practices,” former Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen told the Post.
After Trump was elected new regulators came into the government anxious to ‘strip away post-crisis financial rules and find ways to juice the economy by encouraging more lending.”
And the new regulators all came from Wall Street, where they maintained close ties. Their actions were taken to benefit their Wall Street firms, not the American people.
According to the Post :
“By freeing banks to make more of these loans, regulators allowed more money to be pumped into the economy. White House officials believe this helped achieve President Trump’s goal of growing the economy faster in the first half of his term.” Trump and Republicans Have Sold Out America to Wall Street
Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have sold out America’s people to the sharks on Wall Street. When things go bad, the Wall Street firms are protected. They’ve already made their huge profits, and they have made sure the risk has been spread around to other people.
There is growing concern in Washington now that it won’t take much for the economy to be plunged into a severe recession due to the large amount of high-risk loans which the Trump people allowed to be made.
This is one more reason to make sure that Donald Trump is a one-term president. We need to restore stability to America’s economy again by getting rid of the people in Washington who have been serving the interests of predators on Wall Street."
Democrats Kiss The Ring Of Al Sharpton,townhall.com,Jeff Crouere,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/columnists/jeffcrouere/2019/04/07/democrats-kiss-the-ring-of-al-sharpton-n2544375,"Democrats Kiss The Ring Of Al Sharpton Share The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. Source: AP Photo/Paul Sancya The Left Wants More Government Because of Their Irresponsible Behavior
It should surprise no one that in the radicalized Democratic Party of 2019 disgraced Reverend Al Sharpton is a major power-broker. His influence has been on display this week as many of the major Democratic Party presidential candidates attended a convention sponsored by the National Action Network, a “civil rights” organization founded by Sharpton. The list of attendees included Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as Congressman Julian Castro, former Congressman “Beto” O’Rourke, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Democrats view Sharpton as an African American leader with a huge following across the country. Instead of being regarded as a major figure in the party, Sharpton should have been shunned many years ago. In 1987, he advocated the cause of Tawana Brawley, a young girl who claimed she was raped by a group of white men. She also maintained that she was smeared with feces and had racial slurs written all over her body.
Sharpton turned her case into a national story claiming a racist attack and demanding compensation for Brawley and prosecution for the white men accused of the crime. Ultimately, a jury decided that it was a hoax and the men were innocent. Subsequently, Brawley, Sharpton and some of her other advisers were ordered to pay restitution to one of the men, former prosecutor Steve Pagones, who was falsely named in the attack. View Cartoon
This outrageous hoax should have forever banished Sharpton to the political sidelines. Instead, he has been conducting his racial shakedowns ever since and given a national media platform with a syndicated radio show and a MSNBC television show.
For so many of the top Democrats to show solidarity with Sharpton is a stinging indictment of the party today. At his convention, the presidential candidates pledged support for the extreme Democratic Party agenda, including such controversial proposals as paying reparations to African Americans as “atonement for slavery.”
It is unclear exactly how Democrats foresee reparations being paid. A bill by U.S. Representative Shelia Jackson Lee (D-TX) calls for “recommendations” on payments along with “an apology” to African Americans. Several of the leading Democratic Party candidates, including Gillibrand, Harris, O’Rourke and Booker have endorsed the bill.
It is incredibly sad that Democrats are fixated on the past instead of trying to create a better future for Americans of all races. Obviously, they want to aggravate racial divisions in a bid to capture a higher percentage of minority voters in the next election.
Before the next election, let’s hope African American voters will examine whether Democrat elected officials in office all over the country, regardless of their fiery race-baiting rhetoric, are actually enacting policies that are creating better living conditions in the major urban areas of the country. Today, almost all of the cities with the highest rates of crime and poverty, such as St. Louis, Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago, are controlled by Democrats, who exacerbate these problems with their disastrous polices. Instead of accepting responsibility for such catastrophic results, Democrats usually blame Republicans and institutionalized racism as the true culprits.
This current push for reparations is another example of what Democrats always do to generate support at election time. Rather than offer strategies to improve the plight of African Americans such as initiatives that will produce good paying jobs and more opportunity for business growth, Democrats advocate policies like reparations that will create more racial division and economic misfortune for millions of Americans.
Such an idea is ludicrous for many reasons. Americans living today should not be financially penalized for morally reprehensible actions of previous generations. Poor and working-class white Americans should not be forced to pay reparations in a scheme to improve the financial situation of African Americans. Along with the racial discrimination involved in the proposal, it is also patently unfair. No white American living today has ever owned a slave and no African American living today has been a slave, at least not in this country. Recommended Conservative Abroad: My Experience As A Trump Fan In Germany Michael Malarkey
What is ironic is that slavery currently does exist in many countries around the world and Democrats seem to have little to no interest in freeing those imprisoned people from oppression. Their only interest is in promoting positions that will enhance their political power, not in actually creating better conditions for people in this country or anywhere around the world.
By advocating destructive policies like reparations and paying homage to a race hustler and scam artist like Reverend Al Sharpton, these leading Democrats are giving all Americans a clear indication of the sickness that is afflicting their party. It is a powerful reminder that voters should heed as they start to focus on the upcoming 2020 elections.

Bipartisan senators offer bill to expand electric vehicle tax credit MORE 's nominee to the Federal Reserve Board praised the health of the U.S. economy in a new interview, and predicted that a strong economic outlook would boost the president in the 2020 elections.
In an interview with AM 970's ""The Answer,"" Stephen Moore told host John Catsimatidis that the nationwide unemployment rate in April was the lowest the U.S. had seen since The Beatles were actively touring. ADVERTISEMENT
""When everybody thought the economy was slowing down, we get this beautiful number. We’ve got the lowest unemployment rate now since the Beatles were still playing together,"" Moore said, adding that Trump ""defies his critics at every turn.""
His assertion was not accurate: While the Trump administration does enjoy historically low unemployment rates, the record for the lowest rate in 50 years was last fall, when it dropped to 3.7 percent. As of April 5, it sits at 3.8 percent.
Moore went on in the interview to predict that the U.S. would not enter a recession in the near future, adding that if current rates of unemployment continued Trump would be in a comfortable position ahead of the 2020 election.
""I don’t see any recession on the horizon anywhere as far as I can see,"" Moore said. ""If the economy 18 months from now is as strong as it is now, I think Trump will be in very very strong shape for his reelection.”
Moore was announced as Trump's pick to join the Federal Reserve. A longtime critic of the bank, Moore has been recently vocal against the Fed's decision to raise interest rates, echoing criticism that Trump himself has espoused.
He currently awaits a Senate confirmation process and has recently disputed news reports claiming that he owes tens of thousands of dollars to the IRS in back taxes and penalties."
Dems see room for Abrams in crowded presidential field,thehill.com,Amie Parnes,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/437639-dems-see-room-for-abrams-in-crowded-presidential-field,"Dems see room for Abrams in crowded presidential field By Amie Parnes - 04/07/19 06:00 AM EDT
Democrats say there’s room in their crowded presidential field for one more high-profile candidate: Stacey Abrams.
The Georgia Democrat, who became a national name in her gubernatorial bid last year, is pondering whether to run for the White House — or the Senate, where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis Schumer Dems see room for Abrams in crowded presidential field Border Dems introduce resolution condemning Trump's closure threats Schumer responds to Biden allegation: 'Voters will weigh the pros and cons' MORE (D-N.Y.) would love to have her take on Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.).
When Abrams's name was floated as a potential vice presidential pick for former Vice President Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette Biden Warren places third in 2020 Massachusetts poll Santorum: Biden, Sanders are 'tone deaf' on allegations raised by women Bernie Sanders says felons should be able to vote while in prison MORE , who has yet to enter the race himself, some supporters were offended because they saw her as the politician who should be at the top of the ticket. ADVERTISEMENT
Some Democrats say she would add a degree of diversity to a race that at the top looks to be crowded with white men.
“Frankly, like many of us, she's looking at four white men — one who lost a Senate race, one who is new to national politics, one who refuses to register as a Democrat, and one who isn't even in the race — getting all the headlines and raising money,” said Democratic strategist Basil Smikle, who formerly served as executive director of the New York Democratic Party.
Smikle was referencing former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas), who lose a Senate race last year; South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Bernard (Bernie) Sanders Warren places third in 2020 Massachusetts poll Santorum: Biden, Sanders are 'tone deaf' on allegations raised by women Booker campaign says it raised more than million in first quarter MORE (I-Vt.), who may be the Democratic primary’s front-runner as it stands; and Biden.
“Abrams has been great at shaking expectations about who can win.” Smikle said. “Should she enter, most candidates will be forced to rethink their strategy.”
If she gets in, Abrams wouldn’t be the only woman in the race or the only woman of color.
She would face stiff competition from Sen. Kamala Harris
But the top of the race has been dominated by white men more than many expected. And that may be providing an opening for Abrams.
Those close to her camp say she is weighing her options carefully.
Abrams is expected to make a decision on whether to run for the Senate by the end of the month, sources say. As she debates that race, she’s hearing a growing number of voices suggest that she aim higher.
After Abrams delivered the Democratic response to President Trump Donald John Trump Nielsen to stay on at DHS through Wednesday to ensure 'orderly transition' House chairman blasts Nielsen's tenure as a 'disaster from the start' Obama praises youth climate activists: 'The sooner you start, the better MORE ’s State of the Union address earlier this year, Dan Pfeiffer, who served as a senior adviser to former President Obama and now co-hosts the popular ""Pod Save America"" podcast, tweeted, “Stacey Abrams should run for president.”
At this week’s National Action Network convention, she was greeted with chants of ""Run, Stacey, run.""
And in an interview on MSNBC's “Morning Joe” on Thursday, co-host Mika Brzezinski weighed in too. “You should jump in,” she told Abrams.
Democratic strategist Eddie Vale said there is momentum around a potential Abrams candidacy.
“I think there is definitely a lot of grass-roots and donor support for Abrams,” Vale said. “I think it's both driven by her qualifications — a long history and record in the legislature and the excitement of ... having another African-American woman in the race.”
Abrams late last month declared that “you don’t run for second place” during an appearance on ABC’s “The View,” throwing cold water on the idea of joining Team Biden.
She added that if she entered the race, she would be at the top of the ticket.
Not every Democrat is eager to see Abrams joint the race.
Some throw the same criticism at her that was thrown at O’Rourke: She lost the Georgia race, and Democrats should focus on those who won elections.
“This is becoming the theater of the absurd,” said one prominent Democratic strategist. “She couldn’t win a race for governor, but we think she can win the White House?
“We have now adopted the Trump standard: Experience and background doesn’t matter as long as you think you can win,” the strategist said. “You’re supposed to earn the right to run. You’re supposed to be qualified for it. And by the way, just because someone is more progressive doesn’t mean they’re going to be a better president.”
But with a Democratic field that has 17 candidates already and is growing by the day, Vale said there’s space for Abrams to join the fray.
“I think there's certainly room. With this many people already running, why the hell not?” he said. “Let's WWE Royal Rumble it and see who comes out on top as the best and strongest candidate.”"
2020: Socialist America Or Trump’s America? – Real Conservatives Unite,realconservativesunite.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://realconservativesunite.com/2019/04/07/2020-socialist-america-or-trump-s-america/,"
In the new Democratic Party, where women and people of color are to lead, and the white men are to stand back, the presidential field has begun to sort itself out somewhat problematically. Breaking News Be the first to know when big news breaks
According to a Real Clear Politics average of five polls between mid-March and April 1, four white men – Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, “Beto” O’Rourke and Pete Buttigieg – have corralled 62 percent of all Democratic voters.
The three white women running – Senators Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand – have, together, a piddling 8 percent.
The lone Hispanic candidate, Julian Castro, is at 1 percent.
African American candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker fare better, with Harris at 10 and Booker at 3 .
Who has raised the most money from the most contributors?
Sanders is first with $18 million; Harris is next with $12 million; Beto is third with $9 million in 18 days; and “Mayor Pete” is fourth with $7 million.
Warren, Klobuchar and Gillibrand have yet to file reports.
But the big takeaway from recent weeks is the sudden stunning vulnerability of the front-runner. Seven women have come forward to berate Biden for unwanted and offensive touching and crowding. Joe is on the defensive. Some in the #MeToo movement want him gone.
He is also being slammed for decisions across his 36-year Senate career — opposing busing for integration, deserting Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas hearings, supporting a racially discriminatory crime bill, voting to authorize George W. Bush to take us into war in Iraq.
And unkindest cut of all: Barack Obama’s stony silence about Joe’s candidacy.
The most compelling case for the 76-year-old ex-vice president is that he can win back Trump’s white working-class voters, and return Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Democratic fold.
Thus a major drop in Biden’s polls could be terminal to his candidacy.
If Biden can’t guarantee a victory over Trump, why go with Joe?
Yet, if he fades away as a candidate, as he has done twice before, who emerges as front-runner? The 77-year-old Socialist Bernie Sanders. If Joe fades, Bernie and the comrades will have removed the last large roadblock to a socialist takeover of the national Democratic Party.
And what would then happen if the Democrats simply held the House, added three Senate seats and defeated Trump in 2020?
An all-out effort to abolish the Electoral College that is integral to the historic compromise that created our federal Union. Puerto Rico and D.C. would become states, giving Democrats four more Senators and making America a bilingual nation.
A drive would be on to give 16-year-olds and convicted felons the right to vote in federal elections, freezing Republicans out of power forever. A packing of the Supreme Court would begin by raising by six the number of justices and elevating liberal activists to the new seats.
On the southern border, where 100,000 illegal migrants were apprehended in March, Trump’s wall would come down, all peoples fleeing repression in Central America would be welcomed into the U.S., sanctuary cities would become the norm, and ICE would be abolished.
Open borders would be a reality, along with amnesty for the 12 million-20 million people here illegally, with a path to citizenship for all.
It is impossible to see how the U.S. border would ever be secured.
The Green New Deal would be enacted. Medicare for all. Free tuition for college students. Millennial college debts paid off by the government. Free pre-K schooling and day care. Guaranteed jobs for all. A guaranteed living wage. Repeal of the Reagan and Trump tax cuts. A re-raising of the corporate rate and a return of the top rate for individuals to 70 percent. New wealth taxes on the rich.
With climate change seen as an existential planetary peril, fossil fuel-powered energy plants — coal, oil, natural gas — would be phased out and a new national reliance on solar and wind begun.
There would be reparations for slavery. Abortion on demand right up to birth for all women. Marijuana would be legalized. Harris has urged that prostitution, sex work, be legalized.
How would the Green New Deal be paid for?
Under “ modern monetary theory, ” currency is a public monopoly for the government, and unemployment is evidence that the monopoly is choking off the needed supply. So print the money necessary to get to rising wages, full employment and a booming economy.
To achieve Bernie Sanders’ Socialist America, the filibuster would have to be abolished, easily done, and the Constitution altered, requiring the support of three-fourths of the states, not so easy.
Yet, as of today, the unannounced front-runner Joe Biden, who is taking fire from many quarters, appears to be the last man standing between Sanders Socialism and the Democratic nomination.
Should Joe falter and fall, Trump would be the nation’s last line of defense against the coming of a Socialist America. For never-Trump conservatives, the day of reckoning may be just ahead. "

This follows the announcement in December for over 2,000 units. Settlements are illegal under international law and undermine the physical viability of the two-state solution.

Pakistan releases 360 Indian prisoners – The Asian Telegraph,www.theasiantelegraph.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theasiantelegraph.net/pakistan-releases-360-indian-prisoners/,"Share KARACHI Pakistan will release 360 Indian prisoners this month, the foreign office said on Friday, as the nuclear-armed neighbours scale back from a confrontation that prompted world powers to urge restraint. Tension has been running high since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-administered Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on February 14, but the risk of conflict rose dramatically on February 27, when India launched an air strike on what it said was a militant training base. The following day Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured its pilot who was later released. Pakistan has decided that 360 Indian prisoners having break-up of 355 fishermen and five civilians, who have completed their term of sentence, will be released,” Mohammad Faisal, spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office, told reporters. He said the prisoners would be released in four batches starting from April 8. — Agencies 16 "

Flooding Displaces Tens of Thousands in Iran,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361470-flooding-displaces-tens-of-thousands-in-iran,"1 2 3 4 5 Flooding Displaces Tens of Thousands in Iran A- A A+
Nationwide floods in Iran have displaced tens of thousands of people and left dozens dead in the past two weeks. More rain is forecast in the coming days.
Heavy rain began in mid-March in the northeastern province of Golestan, which received 70 percent of its average annual rainfall in one day. The flooding has steadily spread across the nation, inundating communities in at least 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces.
“Iran is under water,” said Sayed Hashem, regional director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. “The scale of this crisis means that more help is needed.”
Aid groups are warning that the situation could get worse if the rains continue. Train lines have been washed away and neighborhoods been submerged. Footage posted to social media showed raging floodwater sweeping cars from roadways and rivers bursting their banks, filled with muddy debris.
At least 70 people have been killed in the flooding, according to the most recent update from the Iranian Red Crescent, which has coordinated rescue and relief efforts. But aid groups have struggled to reach all of the affected areas.
Some residents have had to take to rooftops as they wait for rescue, their homes partially submerged. Aerial images showed waterlogged fields stretching as far as the eye could see.
“While the precise impact is still to be seen, it is already very clear that the floods have caused extensive damage and suffering in villages, cities and rural areas,” Mr. Hashem said.

What Monroe Doctrine? | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-06/what-monroe-doctrine,"
Authored by Philip Giraldi via The Strategic Culture Foundation,
Because there is a presidential election coming up next year, the Donald Trump Administration appears to be looking for a country that it can attack and destroy in order to prove its toughness and willingness to go all the way in support of alleged American interests. It is a version of the old neocon doctrine attributed to Michael Ledeen, the belief that every once in a while, it is necessary to pick out some crappy little country and throw it against the wall just to demonstrate that the United States means business.
“Meaning business” is a tactic whereby the adversary surrenders immediately in fear of the possible consequences, but there are a couple of problems with that thinking.
The first is that an opponent who can resist will sometimes balk and create a continuing problem for the United States, which has a demonstrated inability to start and end wars in any coherent fashion.
This tendency to get caught in a quagmire in a situation that might have been resolved through diplomacy has been exacerbated by the current White House’s negotiating style, which is to both demand and expect submission on all points even before discussions begin. That was clearly the perception with North Korea, where National Security Advisor John Bolton insisted that Pyongyang had agreed to American demands over its nuclear program even though it hadn’t and would have been foolish to do so for fear of being treated down the road like Libya, which denuclearized but then was attacked and destroyed seven years later. The Bolton mis-perception, which was apparently bought into by Trump, led to a complete unraveling of what might actually have been accomplished if the negotiations had been serious and open to reasonable compromise right from the beginning.
Trump’s written demand that Kim Jong Un immediately hand over his nuclear weapons and all bomb making material was a non-starter based on White House misunderstandings rooted in its disdain for compromise. The summit meeting with Trump, held in Hanoi at the end of February, was abruptly canceled by Kim and Pyongyang subsequently accused Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of making “gangster-like” demands.
The second problem is that there are only a few actual casus belli situations under international law that permit a country to attack another preemptively, and they are usually limited to actual imminent threats. The current situation with Venezuela is similar to that with North Korea in that Washington is operating on the presumption that it has a right to intervene and bring about regime change, using military force if necessary, because of its presumed leadership role in global security, not because Caracas or even Pyongyang necessarily is threatening anyone. That presumption that American “exceptionalism” provides authorization to intervene in other countries using economic weapons backed up by a military option that is “on the table” is a viewpoint that is not accepted by the rest of the world.
In the case of Venezuela, where Trump has dangerously demanded that Russia withdraw the hundred or so advisors that it sent to help stabilize the country, the supposition that the United States has exclusive extra-territorial rights is largely based on nineteenth and early twentieth century unilaterally declared “doctrines.” The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 and the Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 de facto established the United States as the hegemon-presumptive for the entire Western Hemisphere, stretching from the Arctic Circle in the north to Patagonia in the south.
John Bolton has been the leader in promoting the Monroe Doctrine as justification for Washington’s interference in Venezuela’s politics, apparently only dimly aware that the Doctrine, which opposed any attempts by European powers to establish new colonies in the Western Hemisphere, was only in effect for twenty-two years when the United States itself annexed Texas and then went to war with Mexico in the following year.
The Mexican war led to the annexation of territory that subsequently became the states of California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and Colorado. In the same year, the United States threatened war with Britain over the Oregon Territory, eventually accepting a border settlement running along the 49th parallel.
Meanwhile the march westward across the plains continued, forcing the Indian tribes back into ever smaller spaces of open land. The US government in the nineteenth century recognized some Indian tribes as “nations” but it apparently did not believe that they enjoyed any explicit “Monroe Doctrine” rights to continue to exist outside reservations when confronted by the “manifest destiny” proponents who were hell bent on creating a United States that would run from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.
The Roosevelt Corollary of 1904 amended the Monroe Doctrine, making it clear that the United States believed it had a right to interfere in any country in the western Hemisphere to maintain good order, which inevitably led to exploitation of Latin American nations by US business conglomerates that could count on a little help from US Marines if their trade agreements were threatened. In 1898, Washington became explicitly imperialist when it defeated Spain and acquired effective control over Cuba, a number of Caribbean Islands and the Philippines. This led to a series of more than thirty interventions by the US military in the Caribbean and Central America between 1898 and 1934. Other states in the region that were not directly controlled by Washington were frequently managed through arrangements with local autocrats, who were often themselves generals.
Make no mistake, citing the Monroe Doctrine is little more than a plausible excuse to get rid of the Venezuelan government, which is legitimate, like it or not. The recent electrical blackouts in the country are only the visible signs of an aggressive campaign to destroy the Venezuelan economy. The United States is engaging in economic warfare against Caracas, just as it is doing against Tehran, and it is past time that it should be challenged by the international community over its behavior.
Guns may not be firing but covert cyberwarfare is total warfare nevertheless, intended to starve people and increase their suffering in order to bring about economic collapse and take down a government to change it into something more amenable to American interests. Login "
Rwanda genocide marks 25 years since mass slaughter,ednews.net,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361474-rwanda-genocide-marks-25-years-since-mass-slaughter,"1 2 3 4 5 Rwanda genocide marks 25 years since mass slaughter A- A A+
Commemorations have begun in Rwanda to mark the 25th anniversary of the genocide that killed about a tenth of the population.
The country will mourn for 100 days, the time it took in 1994 for 800,000 Rwandans to be massacred.
Most were minority Tutsis, killed by ethnic Hutu extremists.
President Paul Kagame, who led the rebel force that ended the genocide, will light a remembrance flame at the memorial in the capital, Kigali.
One week of commemoration activities will begin with Mr Kagame lighting the flame at the memorial, where some 250,000 victims are said to be buried.
The 61-year-old president, who has led the country since the end of the genocide, is scheduled to make a speech at the Kigali Convention Centre.
He will then lead a vigil at the Amahoro National Stadium, which was used by United Nations officials to try to protect Tutsis during the killings.
A number of foreign leaders are expected to be at some of the events. They are mainly African, although Prime Minister Charles Michel will represent the former colonial ruler, Belgium.
French President Emmanuel Macron will not be there. This week he appointed a panel of experts to investigate France's role in the genocide.
France was a close ally of the Hutu-led government prior to the massacres and has been accused of ignoring warning signs and training the militias who carried out the attacks.
France will be represented by Herve Berville, a Rwandan-born MP.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will also not be there. He has been accused of backing Rwandan rebels who oppose Mr Kigali.

Nepali Congress (NC) has yet to print the party statute almost three months after the end of mahasamiti meeting. The party during the mahasamiti meeting held from January 13-23 had said the statute has been sent to the press for printing. The meeting originally scheduled for five days was extended as it could not settle the issue of number of office-bearers and members at the central level and nature of party membership among others. President Sher Bahadur Deuba had finally forged consensus with senior leader Ram Chandra Paudel and former general secretary Krishna Prasad Sitaula and raised the number of office-bearers to 14 from eight. The party had said the statute will be printed and distributed to the participants during the mahasamiti meeting but the statute has yet to be printed. NC leaders and cadres alike do not know about the provisions kept in the statute. Chief secretary at central office Krishna Prasad Paudel said the party is preparing to send the statute to the press for printing. “We currently only have two copies of statute, one for the central committee and the other to send to the press,” he stated. He claimed that printing of the statute will be completed by April end. Published Date: Sunday, April 7 , 2019 03:46:52 Share:"
I have vested interest in recommendation of Manoj Kumar Sharma: CJ Rana,setopati.net,Prem Dhakal,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://setopati.net/political/143501,"I have vested interest in recommendation of Manoj Kumar Sharma: CJ Rana I have vested interest in recommendation of Manoj Kumar Sharma: CJ Rana Shova Sharma Kathmandu, April 7
Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana has said he has vested interest in controversial recommendation of Manoj Kumar Sharma, the nephew of former CJ Damodar Sharma, to the Supreme Court (SC). Giving an unscheduled speech during the conference of judges in Kathmandu on Saturday after judges criticized the recent recommendations and appointments for SC and High Court (HC) justices, he called Sharma the diamond in the legal sector. The then CJ Sharma had appointed his nephew as Appellate Court additional justice. He was relieved of duty after the Constitution promulgated in 2015 did not keep the position of additional justice. He had been practicing as an advocate since then.“He is a diamond with a PhD who was thrown out of the judiciary. I have picked the diamond and brought him to the SC,” a justice quoted CJ Rana as saying during the conference. “I have vested interest in this.” The then CJ Sharma had acquitted Rana after the SC made a judicial comment on the verdicts he gave while at the then Appellate Court, and brought him to the SC. Rana, who was not scheduled to speak during the program, stood up and started to defend the recent recommendations and appointments after judges of district courts, HC and SC all strongly criticized that. He pointed how justices in the past have also been appointed in the same manner. “Justices have been recommended in the past in the same manner as it has been now. You didn’t speak against that then. Why are you blaming me now?” he fumed. He claimed that recommendation and appointment of judges have become controversial due to the structure of Judicial Council (JC) and added that he cannot reveal all the intricacies of the appointment process.“You all have been appointed in the same manner in the past. You all came from nowhere to jump the line and now point your fingers when others come in the same manner,” he continued his tirade.“I have the courage to take back my recommendations if they are wrong. But can you all who were appointed in the same manner resign? Let us all write a collective resignation letter and make a list. I am ready to sign on that first,” he threatened. The Judicial Council on April 2 had recommended five justices for the SC and 18 for HC. Chief Justice of Patan High Court Prakash Dhungana and that of Surkhet High Court Sushma Lata Mathema, and senior advocate Kumar Regmi, and advocates Hari Phuyal and Manoj Kumar Sharma were recommended for SC. Regmi is considered close to the main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) and Phuyal close to the ruling CPN. Published Date: Sunday, April 7 , 2019 02:55:12 Share:"
Put mothers and their newborns at center,setopati.net,Setopati Admin,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://setopati.net/views/143496,"Put mothers and their newborns at center Put mothers and their newborns at center Subhakar Baidya A woman pose for a photograph with her two-year old daughter in Siwa village of Panchthar district, one out of 13 working districts of One Heart Worldwide in Nepal. It is no secret that Universal Health Coverage has become a hot topic in the international community. With all UN Members states – including Nepal –signing on to try and achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030, more attention is being paid to how governments can make healthcare affordable, all-encompassing, accessible and adequate. One of the targets for this goal is to reduce the global maternal death rate to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Nepal has made commendable strides toward this goal: the maternal mortality ratio in Nepal decreased from 539 deaths per 100,000 live births to 239 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1996 and 2016. Nepal’s progress, while impressive, has not been evenly distributed. Take rates of postnatal check-ups (PNC) as an example of this. PNC visits are an important part of maternal health services wherein providers can check for warning signs of postpartum hemorrhage, postnatal depression and other life-threatening conditions. According to the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, nearly 64% of urban women received a postnatal check-up within two days of delivery, as compared with 48% of rural women. Women in the highest socioeconomic status were more than twice as likely (81%) to receive postnatal care within two days of delivery as women in the lowest (37%). To guarantee a future where no child grows up without a mother due to pregnancy-related death and no parent loses their child during the critical period of labor and delivery, the current approach to Universal Health Coverage won’t cut it. This is especially true for women living in remote and hard-to-reach parts of the country. Women and children should be the preferential beneficiaries of Universal Health Coverage because they are especially vulnerable to healthcare inequalities. This is true for all women and children, but it becomes worse for women in those inaccessible areas I just mentioned. In the years I have been helping to implement the Network of Safety model with the nongovernmental organization One Heart Worldwide, I’ve realized that investments in the health of women and newborns are investment in #HealthForAll. I’ve learned how a single issue – maternal health – can drive large-scale, systemic change, and on World Health Day 2019, I’m writing to share three of the most relevant lessons-learned for Universal Health Coverage advocates: Service integration creates more pathways to vital healthcare services. Both the Universal Health Coverage agenda and our approach to scalable maternal health systems task-shift (delegate tasks to less specialized health workers) to provide multiple services in a single visit. By offering primary care services and strengthening the public health system of Nepal, programs like ours that place the mother and child at the center of their efforts reach the most marginalized people and ensure they have access to important services. When the nearest health facility to an expectant mother is a three-day trek over mountains, up hills and around rivers, the care she receives must be efficient. Delivering healthcare in a manner that maximizes resource use and minimizes waste has been essential to the success of our programs and must be a priority for any attempt to build a Universal Health Coverage system. Look outside the traditional health systems approach for inspiration. To effectively deliver services in hard to reach places, we have used innovative approaches to reach the “last mile.” For example, we incorporate solar-powered suitcases to overcome the problem of unreliable electricity and employ eHealth and mHealth to collect better data and reform supply-chain management. That being said, innovation is not just about technology. We have had to think creatively about how to build a partnership of government officials, local leaders, community members, fathers, mothers-in-law, outreach providers and healthcare workers to surround the mother and her unborn child. At One Heart Worldwide, we call this evidence-based approach the Network of Safety because we know it takes a holistic approach to drive positive change. These opportunities are not unique to maternal health, and can be replicated in other priority issues, making this an applicable lesson from maternal health for Universal Health Coverage advocates. Gender equality is both a prerequisite to and consequence of Universal Health Coverage Gender equality and #HealthForAll are interdependent. On one hand, I have seen gender act as a barrier to healthcare access, as women sometimes lack the agency they need to demand maternal health services. The unique healthcare needs of women are often excluded from basic healthcare packages, often at the detriment of entire families and communities. On the other hand, I have also seen community-level opinions on gender empowerment change through discussions on maternal health and by training Female Community Health Volunteers, nurses, and Skilled Birth Attendants. By prioritizing women’s health and training women to be healthcare providers, we have worked to advance gender equality through maternal health programs on both the supply and demand sides of care.

Fox News Mocked Over Ridiculous Obama 'Selfie Stick' Criticism - Hill Reporter,hillreporter.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://hillreporter.com/fox-news-mocked-over-ridiculous-obama-selfie-stick-criticism-30077,"BY Chris Walker April 7, 2019
In what can only be assumed to be a tongue-in-cheek jab at the right-wing media and its previous obsession over every little thing former President Barack Obama did while in office — as well as conservatives for being overly forgiving of the gaffes the current president makes on a near-daily basis — the Daily Show shared an intriguing video last week. The video reminds us of what Fox News and the right-wing media once attacked former President Obama for his use of a selfie stick.
In the video, clips of Fox News personalities are shown describing Obama using a selfie stick in 2015. They describe his use of the gadget as being “undignified,”“not presidential,” and “a new low for our juvenile president.” Lou Dobbs’s voice was also featured prominently in the video, as he quoted a Minnesota newspaper describing Obama as a “self-absorbed assclown.”
The Daily Show described the “controversy” as “a scandal” that “rocked the Obama presidency to its core” at the time.
Fox News wasn’t alone in attacking the former president. Other commentators went after Obama, including Dinesh D’Souza, who described the president’s use of a selfie stick as “ghetto” and an “embarrassment.”

Meanwhile, ever since he came into office, Fox News has seemingly bent over backwards many times to come to the aid of President Donald Trump’s controversies and gaffes, big and small, including reversing course when he made embarrassing statements during the Helsinki summit with Russia President Vladimir Putin, MSNBC reported.
Trump had said during the meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin that he didn’t “see any reason why it would be Russia,” referring to that nation’s attempts to interfere with our elections. Trump later tried to play it off by saying he misspoke, according to CNN .
While initially joining mainstream media in criticizing the president, hosts on the network soon were defending him over the matter, including Mark Levin who said the media were “acting like it’s the apocalypse” when it came to Trump’s miscues.
Some will likely view the Daily Show’s reminder on how right-wing media once acted when the president used a selfie stick as a telling example of how the network and other conservative voices have lowered the bar on how they criticize a sitting commander-in-chief.

Herman Cain said he will face a ""cumbersome"" vetting process that he might not survive after President Trump Donald John Trump Chelsea Handler says she went into therapy after Trump's win Will it take more deaths or disaster for Washington to fix immigration and border security? Conspiracy theorists keep their Ginsburg death claims alive MORE said he intends to nominate Cain to the Federal Reserve Board.
Cain made the remark in a video posted to Facebook, according to Reuters , and added that he will be forced to turn over numerous records from his career. He also said he's unsure if he will pass a required FBI background check. ADVERTISEMENT
“Whether or not I make it through this process -- time will tell. Would I be disappointed if I don’t make it through this process? No. Would I be thrilled and honored if I make it through this process? Yes. That’s the bottom line,"" he said.
“They have to collect an inordinate amount of information on you, your background, your family, your friends, your animals, your pets, for the last 50 years,” added Cain, whose nomination could be derailed by sexual harassment accusations.
Cain suspended his presidential campaign in 2011 after four women accused him of sexual harassment. Two of the women were employees of the National Restaurant Associated and said the harassment happened while he served as the head of the trade group.
Another woman also claimed she had a 13-year affair with Cain. He denied all of the claims.
Cain in the Facebook video said that people who don't like him are ""already digging up all of the negative stuff that’s in storage from eight years ago.""
Trump said Thursday he intended to nominate Cain to the Federal Reserve Board, but added that the nomination wasn't yet official because of the background check.
“I’ve told my folks that’s the man, and he’s doing some pre-checking now. I would imagine he’d be in great shape,” Trump said."
Barack Obama Jokes About 'Politicians Who Could Use Some Meditation' In Apparent Jab at Donald Trump,www.newsweek.com,Jason Lemon,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/obama-jokes-politicians-meditation-jab-trump-1388249,"On 4/7/19 at 9:05 AM EDT Share U.S.
Former President Barack Obama spoke to a town hall of about 300 young leaders in Berlin, Germany, on Saturday, and made what appeared to be a jab at his successor President Donald Trump.
Taking questions from the audience at the event organized by the The Obama Foundation, the former president was asked how he practices mindfulness and if he meditates. Obama’s response drew laughter from the audience, as many in the room were undoubtedly making a comparison between him and his successor.
“I definitely think that there’s some politicians who could use some meditation,” he said, to a roar of laughter. “There is no doubt about that. I can think of a few who, you know, should just sit there for a little bit and — reflect,” he continued, laughing himself. “Find some inner peace.”

Journalists on CNN shared the clip on Saturday evening, pointing out that Obama appeared to be contrasting himself with Trump, although a reporter in Germany noted that the former president didn’t specifically call out the current president.
“So, was that a dig at the current president? Perhaps,” the reporter said. “Again, he didn’t mention any particular names,” she continued. “And in fact, he really refrained from weighing in too much on the domestic politics of the day. Instead he really focused on trying to inspire this group of leaders.”
Obama did, however, weigh in a bit on domestic issues to highlight what he said is a personal concern regarding progressives in politics.
“One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States—maybe it’s true here as well—is a certain kind of rigidity where we say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, this is how it’s going to be,’” he said . “And then we start sometimes creating what’s called a 'circular firing squad' where you start shooting at your allies because one of them is straying from purity on the issues.”
Obama continued: ""When that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens, so I think … you have to recognize that the way we’ve structured democracy requires you to take into account people who don’t agree with you.” He suggested that compromise is “necessary for everyone,” pointing to policy achievements of his own administration.

The former president has taken several swipes at Trump in recent months, sometimes choosing to attack more directly. During a speech last October in Milwaukee, he mocked the indictments of several former Trump campaign associates and administration officials.
“They have racked up enough indictments to field a football team,” Obama said to loud laughter from the audience. “Nobody in my administration got indicted,” he pointed out.
Last month while speaking at a conference in Salt Lake City, Obama also made an apparent dig at the Trump administration, saying he personally believes “in things like facts and logic.” Trump routinely uses inaccurate information and sometimes complete lies to justify his positions. Continuing his March remarks, Obama explained that: “Things like rule of law, democracy and you know, competence and facts; those things are not partisan, but they also don’t happen automatically.” "

"Layout related issues: ground scheme, bias current",www.edaboard.com,Fhadz,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.edaboard.com/showthread.php?383516-Layout-related-issues-ground-scheme-bias-current,"Layout related issues: ground scheme, bias current Hi team, I am working on the layout of a mixed signal circuit. I have finished the layout of analog part (basically some amplifiers, and a bias current generator, etc) and digital part (basically clock generator) separately. Can I please ask 3 questions? Q1: I understand that for substrate noise isolation, I should make sure the supply voltage of my analog circuit (AVDD AGND) separate from digital supply (DVDD DGND). So in my layout, should I have 2 separate continents (one for analog supply and one for digital supply) completely unattached? Or should they be just a little bit connected (connected through just one trace)? Q2: My digital clock generator needs a bias current. Can I generate the bias current along with other analog bias currents in my analog domain? Or do I have to separate the bias current generation for digital noise isolation? Q3: I have a second set of VDD2/VSS2(2V to -0.5V) for output buffer amplifiers. I am wondering about their bias current design. Should I have a new set of bias current generator? Or can I just use the same bias current generator in my analog domain (which is from 1.2V to 0V)? Thanks Re: Layout related issues: ground scheme, bias current you do not need to ask permission to ask questions - just ask when you say substrate, do you mean your designing an integrated circuit, or do you mean a printed wiring board? unless i completely misunderstand, when you say bias current, i assume you mean local power for the circuit, Vdd and Vss. the digital and analog Vdd and Vss should be separated somewhere along the line, there must be some sort of power input to your board. the grounds get tied together there. use a big and fat a trace (copper pour / ground plane) as you can - this keeps the current density down and any radiated EM down. you might want to move all of your bias current generation to a third section with its own ground plane. again, tie them all together at one point. 5 Re: Layout related issues: ground scheme, bias current Q1: I understand that for substrate noise isolation, I should make sure the supply voltage of my analog circuit (AVDD AGND) separate from digital supply (DVDD DGND). So in my layout, should I have 2 separate continents (one for analog supply and one for digital supply) completely unattached? Or should they be just a little bit connected (connected through just one trace)? Substrate noise isolation has nothing to do with separate supply. Substrate noise is passed on from digital side to analog side through the low ohmic substrate. If you think you will have problems with substrate noise, place ground cells in between that will serve as a better isolation. Q2: My digital clock generator needs a bias current. Can I generate the bias current along with other analog bias currents in my analog domain? Or do I have to separate the bias current generation for digital noise isolation? Yes... Put large decoupling capacitors in the bias nodes (to Vdd if they are supply referred to Gnd if they are Gnd referred) if there is a chance of digital signals coupling to those nodes. Q3: I have a second set of VDD2/VSS2(2V to -0.5V) for output buffer amplifiers. I am wondering about their bias current design. Should I have a new set of bias current generator? Or can I just use the same bias current generator in my analog domain (which is from 1.2V to 0V)? Same as above. You can re-use your bias blocks."
More Kiwis able to access lower-cost primary health care,beehive.govt.nz,beehive.govt.nz,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://beehive.govt.nz/release/more-kiwis-able-access-lower-cost-primary-health-care,"Health Minister David Clark is pleased to mark World Health Day today as new figures show cheaper doctors visits are available to nearly all the New Zealanders the policy was intended to reach.
This year for World Health Day the World Health Organisation (WHO) is focusing on universal health coverage.
“This is a great day to note that more New Zealanders can see their doctor at an affordable cost, thanks to the Government’s cheaper doctors visits initiatives launched in December last year,” David Clark said.
“As of April 1, approximately 96 per cent of Community Services Card (CSC) holders and their dependants who are enrolled with a general practice are able to visit their doctor at low cost. Those not already enrolled with a very low cost access practice will on average pay $20 to $30 less for a consultation. This means almost all Kiwis who hold a CSC won’t be charged more than $18.50 to visit their doctor.
“We know that cost has been a barrier for nearly 600,000 New Zealanders when they need to see their doctor. For some, their health has deteriorated until they needed to go to hospital. This isn’t good enough and I’m proud of the fact this Government has done something about it.
“All general practices in the Northland, Lakes, Tairawhiti, Bay of Plenty, Hawke’s Bay, Whanganui, Hutt Valley, Wairarapa, West Coast and South Canterbury DHB regions have opted to provide lower-cost visits to their eligible patients with a CSC.
“I’m particularly pleased to see that more than 96 per cent of Māori and over 97 per cent of Pacific people who are CSC holders are enrolled with practices that offer lower cost fees.
David Clark says the Zero Fees for Under 14s scheme, which was part of Labour’s coalition agreement with New Zealand First, is also helping make primary care more accessible.
“Almost all (more than 99 per cent) of enrolled children aged 13 and under can now access zero fee general practice visits.
“Zero Fees for Under 14s is helping deliver on our priority of ensuring all children in New Zealand have access to the primary health care services they need to reach their full potential.
”I'd also like to acknowledge the commitment of the primary care sector to implement the initiatives so promptly. The initiative’s positive outcomes wouldn't be possible without the sector's broad support and hard work,' says David Clark.
BACKGROUND
The initiatives include: People with a CSC, and their dependants aged 14 to 17 years, who are enrolled with a general practice will pay less for visits to see a doctor or nurse at their general practice. An adult with a CSC won’t pay more than $18.50 for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse and young people aged 14 to 17 years, who have a parent or caregiver with a CSC, will be charged no more than $12.50. All enrolled children aged 13 and under won’t be charged a fee for a standard visit with a doctor or nurse at their general practice. They also won’t be charged an after-hours fee at participating clinics or pharmacies or the regular $5 prescription fee.
It’s anticipated that from 1 April 2019: 91 per cent of non-very low cost access (VLCA) practices will have signed up to the CSC initiative. 94 per cent of practices (including the above non-VLCA and all VLCA practices) will be offering low-cost services to their enrolled CSC holders and dependants. 96 per cent of CSC holders and dependants who are enrolled with a general practice will be able to visit their enrolled practice at low cost.
These figures will be confirmed by mid-April 2019, following final analysis."
Indigenous experts advise on Declaration plan,beehive.govt.nz,beehive.govt.nz,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://beehive.govt.nz/release/indigenous-experts-advise-declaration-plan,"Māori Development
Māori Development Minister Nanaia Mahuta today welcomed the delegation from the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) to Aotearoa.
Last week Nanaia Mahuta announced that New Zealand will be taking a step forward on indigenous rights by leading a process to measure New Zealand’s progress towards the aspirations of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
EMRIP members have been invited to Aotearoa to provide advice on the development of that plan.
“This is an exciting opportunity to hear from indigenous experts about how Aotearoa can be reflected in a Declaration plan, drawn from global models.
The EMRIP members have been invited to New Zealand by the Aotearoa Independent Monitoring Mechanism for the Declaration and the Human Rights Commission and with the agreement of the New Zealand Government.
“There are a range of policies and strategies already in place that are relevant to the Declaration, but there is no overall plan. EMRIP’s visit will help the Crown and Māori work together to create a plan to guide the implementation of the Declaration,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
During their visit, EMRIP members will meet with various organisations, experts and the Government. They will also hold two community hui in Auckland and Wellington.
“We are pleased to host these indigenous experts. Aotearoa is the third country to be visited by EMRIP, and this visit will show that we are genuinely committed to developing a national plan for the Declaration that meets New Zealand’s needs and aspirations.
“We wish them the best for their time in Aotearoa and look forward to meeting and engaging with them,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
Editorial Note:
About the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP)
The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is one of three UN expert bodies that focus specifically on the rights of indigenous peoples
EMRIP is made up of seven independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council to provide advice and expertise.
Three of the seven experts will be visiting Aotearoa in the coming week: Ms Laila Vars of Norway; Ms Megan Davis of Australia; Mr Edtami Mansavagan of the Philippines."

Well, Bo got himself arrested for aggravated sexual assault of a child.
“Bo Michael Dresner was booked into the Hays County Jail on April 3 and had not been released as of press time,” the newspaper noted.
Dresner is being held on $250,000 bond.
“The affidavit also states that Child Protective Services (CPS) Investigator Alexandra Rodriguez removed four children from Dresner’s custody on March 28,” the paper explained. “County court records show that there were three CPS cases filed on March 29 regarding the custody of four children in which Dresner was named as a party.”
The abuse may have gone back seven years.

On a Warm Spring Day,pauldeaton.com,Paul Deaton,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://pauldeaton.com/2019/04/07/on-a-warm-spring-day/,"Spring on Lake Macbride Saturday was the first spring day with temperatures in the low 70s. I spent a few hours raking and using the chainsaw, beginning yard clean up. More clean up remains but I’ve learned to take it easy until returning to better physical shape through the work. I relished being outside at work so much. Excited to deploy the chainsaw, I forgot hearing protection until I was almost finished. Neighbors hailed me from their yards and in passing by. The whole neighborhood seemed outside and alive. There was ice below matted leaves yet everything else indicated spring had definitely arrived. Saturday had begun Friday by covering mixed beans with tap water to soak overnight. Before sunrise I cooked the beans in homemade vegetable broth, then added carrots, celery, onion and bay leaves. The broth reduced so I added more — four quarts in all. It simmered all day yielding a deep brown color by supper time. A cup of soup with toasted bread, a small plate of cheese and pickles, and a glass of milk made the meal. A week into April and nothing is planted in the ground. I surveyed the garden plots for a spot to plant peas and carrots and have ideas but no plan. I’m getting better with garden layout each year because of a shift from whimsically filling space to consideration of which plants go where and why. After yesterday there’s a lot of wood to cut for a burn pile, such cutting making space to think about sunlight, shade, soil health, animal traffic and mulch. Such is the world of a gardener.

Mind the Gap: The Foreign Policy Disconnect between Washington and America,911caper.com,HateLiars,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://911caper.com/2019/04/07/mind-the-gap-the-foreign-policy-disconnect-between-washington-and-america/,"By A. Trevor Thrall The Cato Institute
During the Cold War, Washington’s foreign policy establishment operated comfortable in the knowledge that sizeable majorities supported vigorous American global leadership in the struggle with the Soviet Union. More recently, however, many observers have started worrying about the growing disconnect between the Washington’s elites and the public. The scholar Walter Russell Mead argued in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece that the most important question in world politics today is “Will U.S. public opinion continue to support an active and strategically focused foreign policy?
The answer is a qualified yes. Americans on balance remain committed to international engagement but advocates of the status quo are right to worry because Americans increasingly disagree with Washington about how to engage the world.
Americans are not isolationists. As the 2018 Chicago Council on Global Affairs revealed, 70% of Americans want the United States to take an “active part” in world affairs. But the more important question is what does an “active part” really mean? A recent study by the Eurasia Group Foundation, for example, found that 47% of elites subscribe to the “indispensable nation” vision for foreign policy, which calls on the United States to maintain overwhelming military superiority and continue intensive efforts to manage world order, while just 9% supported a more restrained vision of foreign policy. The same study, however, found public preferences to be the reverse of elites: 44% supported a more restrained approach to foreign policy and just 10% supported the indispensable nation approach.
Looking deeper, despite all the nostalgia for the Cold War consensus, there have always been important differences between the public and elites when it comes to foreign affairs. Academic analysis of decades of survey data has identified a stable set of attitude gaps between the public and their leaders. Moreover, while many of the gaps are quite large – often in the range of 30 percentage points or more – the gaps between Republican and Democratic leaders on the key issues are quite small – typically just a few percentage points."

Co2 is .04% of the atmosphere. Humans account for 3% of that. Australia accounts for 1.3% of that. All up that’s .0000156% of the worlds atmosphere that would change if Australia disappeared. And that’s if you even believe the fairy tale about how harmful this necessary plant food is. Our politicians are traitors and working against the welfare of it’s people. If we just spent a fraction of the money wasted on green rubbish, on something like the Bradfield scheme, it would set Australia up for a century. So why don’t we?

If we just spent a fraction of the money wasted on green rubbish, on something like the Bradfield scheme, it would set Australia up for a century. So why don’t we?
I’m not sure of the viability of the Bradfield scheme, but I suggest the goal of our political class is not to set Australia up for prosperity but rather to tear down what has made us prosperous up until now. That is what the Paris Agreement will do. Agriculture, for example, will have to reduce emissions by c.26%, largely by a reduction in production, artificially driving up meat and dairy prices at a time when household budgets are already stretched. I note the plant based meat substitutes are already on the supermarket shelves. Up The Workers!
I’m doing my bit for P.E.T.A., totalitarian Leftards, veganism, saving the planet and environmentalism.
I’ve gone totally vegan.
I only ever eat vegan beef, vegan lamb, vegan pork, vegan chook, vegan eggs, vegan rabbit, vegan turkey, vegan skippy, vegan quail, vegan venison, vegan fish, vegan prawns, vegan calamari, vegan mussels and vegan caviar.
The only exception to my strictly-held rule is carnivorous crocodile and shark, but I make the exception for them because they are both known to do their bit to clean up the environment by regularly eating “Save the Croc” or “Save the Shark” Greenie dills.

Bollux: It’s even more ridiculous than .0000156 %. Coal fired power stations make up approx 27% of Australia’s 1.3% CO2 emissions. Say 33% is coal fired power stations, 1/3 of .0000156% or . 52% is what we are destroying or electricity system and country for. This country is lost.

Rafe, thanks for passing on that sad (but interesting and useful) news. I don’t know Don, but I wish I did. It’s helpful to be reminded from time to time that politics (and anti-politics) are not ends in themselves. John

That would be utterly authoritarian and nearing totalitarian practice.
Trump has been a good President who has not overstepped his powers and has worked to end overcrmininalisation.
Its undeniable that Trump has done more for Israel than America.
You are totally off your bonce. BorisG
That would be utterly authoritarian and nearing totalitarian practice.
Depends how you do it. Start with enforcing current laws.
I don’t think crack down on employers will solve the problem completely because some are not employed or employed in grey or black economy, but it would be a good start.
Instead we see grandstanding about THE WALL. BorisG
Its undeniable that Trump has done more for Israel than America.
Trump thinks strengethig Israel is in American interest. Many Americans agree.
As an aside I am wondering whether growing anti Semitism and anti Zionism among Democrats will finally drive Jeuz away from them. a happy little debunker
If Trump is truly the narcissistic demagogue that he is continually portrayed as, then he would absolutely want to win 2020.
But also, without a successor or heir apparent/presumptive does he have any real choice?
As we see with the current democratic clown show, candidates are spending more & more time fighting each other than their political opponents. Divided parties will not win elections. #2982279, posted on April 8, 2019 at 11:42 am
Trump has always been loyal to those who are loyal to him. This has been a hallmark of his life and a family rule that he never breaks. If you see the way he interacts with his LOYAL fans, you’ll see that the man appreciates their loyalty. He will not just walk away from them in 2020. He will run, put your house on it.
As far as e-verify etc, no point doing anything substantial (like bankrupting businesses that employ illegals) unless you stop the million or so illegals walking into the country each year. THE WALL IS A MUST FIRST STEP. Trump understands this, that’s why he has been big on the wall since day one.
Once the inflow is stopped to a trickle, those already in can be dealt with. Some will self deport to avoid being jailed. Others will be given working visas or even a path to citizenship as long as they don’t have a criminal record.
Considering the economy and polls showing immigration as the most important issue (with blacks and legal Hispanics the biggest opponents of illegal immigration) Trump will win bigly in 2020 and The Wall will be built. RINO’s and Democrats will be made irrelevant after 2020. The US Chamber of Commerce (the biggest obstacle to establishing a meaningful immigration policy), will also be made irrelevant after 2020.

"Watch: SNL Cold Open Riffs on Joe Biden Attending Sensitivity Training With Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant",www.newsweek.com,Gillian Edevane,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/watch-snl-cold-open-riffs-joe-biden-attending-sensitivity-training-kate-1388231,"On 4/7/19 at 9:13 AM EDT Share U.S.
Actor Jason Sudeikis returned to Saturday Night Live this weekend to reprise the role of Joe Biden for the show's cold open, offering up his interpretation of what it would be like if the former vice president attended sensitivity training in the wake of recent reports that he invaded the personal space of women at political events.
The skit revolved around Biden attending a workshop with a political consultant, played by Kate McKinnon, and two of his concerned staffers, played by Cecily Strong and Kenan Thompson. For the most part, the piece zeroed in on a seemingly oblivious Biden repeatedly encroaching on generally understood social boundaries with women, even when it was clear it made them uncomfortable.
""I'm a hugger, I'm a kisser and a little bit of a sniffer,"" Sudeikis' Biden says. ""But the last thing I want to do is offend anyone.”
This bumbling, oafish Biden appears unable to comprehend that what he is doing is inappropriate, even when told by the strategist in the room.
“Ideally when you meet a female stranger for the first time there would be no hugs or kisses of any kind,"" McKinnon stresses in response to SNL's Biden, who insists on placing his head on her forehead.
“That’s a human connection,” Sudeikis says in character. “That’s my whole thing.”
When told it was inappropriate to tickle women while giving them handshakes, SNL 's Biden asks: “What if I see someone’s that’s having a bad day—bear with me here—and I cheer her up by lifting up her shirt and blowing zerberts on her tummy...Let me see what else I got. Am I still allowed to do that gorgeous lift at the end of Dirty Dancing?
""Who would you do that with?"" McKinnon retorts.
“Hell, I don’t know, whoever is strong enough to lift me up, I guess. A coalminer? A linebacker ?"" Sudeikis says, prompting arguably the largest laugh from the audience during the nearly 7-minute skit.
The real Biden, who has yet to officially launch his expected run for the Democratic ticket, spent the last week mired in controversy stemming from an essay penned by Lucy Flores, a former Nevada assembly member.
“Very unexpectedly and out of nowhere, I feel Joe Biden put his hands on my shoulders, get up very close to me from behind, lean in, smell my hair and then plant a slow kiss on the top of my head,"" Flores wrote, referring to a 2014 incident at
In multiple statements, Biden said he regretted making her feel uncomfortable but stopped short of directly apologizing for the touching.
“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more,"" Biden said Friday . ""I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman. So that’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sake.""
Watch the skit above. ​ "
DOJ Wants Two Years To Identify Children Trump Kidnapped,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/07/doj-wants-two-years-to-identify-children-trump-kidnapped.html,"DOJ Wants Two Years To Identify Children Trump Kidnapped 629
Donald Trump’s Department of Justice (DOJ) is asking for two years to identify several thousand migrant children who were stolen from their parents at the Mexican border under Trump’s “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy.
The Associated Press reported that the Trump administration has set forth their proposed timeline in a new court filing.
Trump’s people are now saying that it will take longer than they had expected to review an estimated 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into U.S. custody between July 2017 and June 25, 2018.
The process is somewhat time consuming because the government, after kidnapping the children, did not keep good records. In some cases they can’t even determine which children in custody were separated from their parents.
Trump was forced to stop his practice of stealing children from families at the border last June after a federal judge ruled against him. The ruling came after months of international outrage at the cruel family separation practice which had been put into place by then-attorney general Jeff Sessions.
The judge, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, said that he can legally hold the Trump administration accountable for those children who were separated before his June 2018 order.
According to the AP report, the federal government is just now starting to identify the thousands of children who were taken from their families. Government officials are saying that the identification and reunification process is very difficult because so much time has passed.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued last year to halt the practice of separating families. They criticized the DOJ’s proposed two-year timeline yesterday.
“We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families,” the ACLU’s lead attorney, Lee Gelernt, said. “The government needs to make this a priority.” There Is No Excuse For Trump’s Abuse of Migrant Children
Ever since Donald Trump put into place his Zero Tolerance policy, migrant children have been abused. Tens of thousands of children were kidnapped, causing trauma that will be with them their entire lives.
And many of these children can’t be located, due to faulty recordkeeping by Trump’s immigration enforcement people. Many children have been abused in migrant shelters, kept in cages, while they have waited months to see their parents again.
Donald Trump is a complete failure when it comes to immigration. Every step he has taken reveals that he is motivated by cruelty and has no comprehensive immigration program. "
