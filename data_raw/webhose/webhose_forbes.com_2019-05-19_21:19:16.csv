Bernie Sanders Could WIN The Presidency! Brace NOW For The Tax Tsunami...,www.forbes.com,Jeff Camarda,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffcamarda/2019/04/19/bernie-sanders-could-win-the-presidency-brace-now-for-the-tax-tsunami/?ss=taxes,"Say it ain’t’ so, Karl! No less than Karl Rove, longstanding Republican kingmaker, recently made big news by concluding that Bernie Sanders – self-declared “Democratic Socialist” – has a real shot at unseating Donald Trump in the White House next year. Amazingly, Sanders staked this claim on no less than the Fox News Network, drawing some twice as many viewers on the conservative stronghold than for a similar appearance on the left-leaning CNN just a few months ago, according to Rove, making this event “the most-watched election event so far this cycle.” That the Bernie dog can hunt on Fox is surprising news, given viewers there are thought to more inclined to Margaret Thatcher’s “the trouble with Socialism is you eventually run out of other people’s money” than Sander’s avowed radical vision for Robin Hood-like wealth redistribution. Robin’s mandate, as readers will recall, was to “take from the rich and give to the poor,” but as Thatcher noted, under such a scheme eventually only the poor remain. Redistributionist socialism’s carnage has a long and tattered history, with the steaming carcass of Venezuela as the current period’s most spectacular and tragic example. Could it work in the US? Seems to me like economic voodoo, but the jury’s out, and free stuff is cool. Still, the historical record ain’t good.
While Bernie–a clear 1%-er if ever there was one – passionately claims a desire to ennoble the poor by shrinking the pies of other one percenters, he seemed to personally and unashamedly benefit from the Trump tax reform and is not particularly generous to charities with his own money.
So what’s that to you, my still-merry 1%-ish men (and bonnie maids?) It may be time to batten down the hatches afore your wealth sub is flooded and its hull plunges to the “till there ain’t no rich no more” bottom of universal impoverishment. Regardless of which way your political tail wags, you may want to steel yourself against some of the transformative tax changes lately running up the flagpole. Here are some of the soak-the-rich ideas floating around lately, and a few derivatives likely to pop up as POTUS fever takes the land:
Millionaire Taxes. This magnanimous notion would subject those above a subjective wealth bar – $5M in income has been recently bandied about in NY - to extra taxes. It is noteworthy that the last time NY did this – the current ""millionaires' tax"" – the bar was lowered to some $300K in forming existing law. Current proposals in NY include a special additional property tax on second ""luxury"" residences, as well as an additional closing ""fee"" on real estate transactions over $3M. The stated use is for the subway (yeah, right, and we promise to remove the toll booths once the bridge is paid for!; note the hourly rate for NYC subway borers is some $120 (which surpasses even Germany's) though they still can't seem to get the darn thing done. Property Taxes Kissin’ cousin to NY’s millionaire taxes these, as most landowners know, are nearly unavoidable, and inescapable for the reason you can’t flee to a lower tax jurisdiction, at least not with your real estate. Worse, Mother State has a perpetual, first claim lien on the dirt, and is quite wont to foreclose and redistribute for unpaid taxes. They kinda got you by the short hairs here, and it’s easy to see how such a tax could quickly get soak-the-rich progressive whilst sparing the dear voting class. Benefits-rich, deficit-doomed states like Alaska are prime candidates for such a shift, and it looks like NY is already halfway there. Of course, the net economic effect of increasing expenses without offsetting benefits would be to suppress values, wasting wealth sunk in real estate that might never return. Stealth Corporate Taxes designed to chill stock buy backs which generally are used to juice stockholder returns similar to dividend payments. Sanders opined in the NY Times that buybacks unfairly enrich shareholders - the owners of the companies! - at the expense of the proletariat. Proposed legislation would prohibit buybacks, and possibly dividend payments, unless all workers are paid at least $15/hour regardless of the job or the labor market valuation of it. Beyond this stealth minimum wage boost, such policy would divert erstwhile owners’ profits to the workers' paradise of higher wages, expanded company-paid training, and richer benefits. Such an expansion of the stakeholder model at the expense of shareholders seems likely to divert capital to less productive and accountable ends, and would certainly shave stock values to levels commensurate with the truncated returns. This de facto bump in labor costs will surely serve to make American companies great again and crush the global competition! Income Taxes The old chestnut of raising marginal rates – I have 70% from AOC, who’ll give me 80%? Can I get 90% from Bernie? How about you, Ms. Warren? – has become way popular again, and the drumbeat will no doubt intensify. While income taxes – unlike the rest of the social reengineering concepts enumerated here – are generally malleable and controllable by those blessed by erudite tax advice, many smart and successful taxpayers are not so blessed and stand to get whacked badly. The Trumpian tax reform could easily be upended by a shift in the political ground, and tax rates approaching 100% are not unprecedented in US history, peaking at 94% last century . Higher Payroll Taxes to “save” Social Security and expand benefits to recipients beyond Uncle Sam’s current $1,000,000,000,000 (that's a big $1T) annual nut. This salvation would be paid for by hiking the current FICA tax from about 12% to almost 15% – a 25% rise! – and subjecting those earning over $400K to the full FICA tax, instead of the present $133K cutoff for the Social Security part (by far the biggest piece). A supremely progressive proposal, taxes would also be cut for those below a certain means, large in number, voting power, and aggregate taxes paid, but low in fat cat income. Estate Tax “reform.” It was not so long ago that the estate tax began for many families at the $600K mark, including life insurance proceeds. While the current threshold is a lofty $22M or so (back to $11M in 2026) this could change in a heartbeat. Mr. Sanders has already proposed dropping this to some $3.5M, and he probably isn’t done. He’s also proposed raising the top estate tax rate to 77% from the current 40%. This author believes sharply higher estate tax exposure for many if not most readers to be extremely likely in the years to come, and that proactive tax control measures should be taken. Also suggested by several has been the elimination of the step up in basis, under which capital gains taxes are essentially waived at death. With the step up gone, affected families would face the double whammy of both estate and capital gains taxes. Gee, could they add up to more than 100%? And that’s before considering the possibility that capital gains' favorable rates – already chipped away at in recent years – might be curtailed or eliminated entirely. Wealth Taxes Finally, we come to the pure form of Ms. Warren’s proposed wealth tax, which would be kind of like an annual estate tax levied on the entirety of an affected family’s assets, from stocks to real estate to business to livestock. Since only the dastardly rich are targets, you’d have to have a lot of cattle to get in this game, which seems only fair given the volume of milking hoped to be at hand. A good way to visualize the concept is to contrast a sales tax (one time) with a personal property tax (like buying the same car every year) or real estate taxes. Such a tax would be a real compliance bear given the complexities of annual valuations in complicated, squishy things like businesses. On top of enormous tax prep costs, such a tax could be a real rich-soaker, for sure. While for now, anyway, most strains of wealth tax proposals only target the mega-rich, it wouldn't take much of a political nudge to expand that to soak the entire 1%, which would still leave 99% of the electorate to rally around a ""you deserve it!"" campaign trail cry. Shoot, you could soak the top 10% and still have plenty of electoral hay left.
Nothing is so constant in tax policy as change. While many or most of the changes discussed here may not come to pass, one never knows, and the wise would be carefully ready with plans B. Tax policy is a political football, the right vs. left game is on with a vehemence perhaps not seen since the old New Deal was young, and, if nothing else, we are blessed to be living in truly exciting times."
How Gen X's 'Latch Key Kid' Mentality Propels Their Financial Success,www.forbes.com,Megan Gorman,04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/megangorman/2019/04/19/how-gen-xs-latch-key-kid-mentality-propels-their-financial-success/?ss=taxes,"Gen X gets a lot of negative press when it comes to personal finances. In fact, in the personal finance world, Gen X is often seen as the runt of the generational cohort litter. The rhetoric is repetitive: “Gen X isn’t saving enough.” “Gen X has the most debt of any other generation.” “Gen X isn’t focused enough on retirement.” And on and on. We’ve heard it all before. In fact, thank you for noticing us. Now we would like you to please go on your way. Because this is one thing we know as Gen Xers: we are fiercely independent souls who will figure it out. We don’t need to be coddled like the generations who surround us.
“Like all Gen Xers, we have a little chip on our shoulder about being completely ignored,” says Dr. Billy J. Hensley, President and CEO at The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) and a Gen Xer. “And sometimes we are glad we are ignored. There is a lot of attention on the Boomers because there are so many of them and now the Millennials are the largest generation in history. We are sandwiched in there.”
But just because we are sandwiched between these generations, doesn’t mean we aren’t taking the right steps. The landscape is a lot more challenging for Gen Xers than it was for other generations before us. Because of increased longevity, many of us are helping our Boomer parents. And with the student loan crisis and increased education costs, we are supporting our children. When you compare our lives to that of the Silent Generation and the Boomers of the mid-40s, it’s a different financial playing field
As a result, we have had to tap into our ‘latch key kid mentality’ in order to thrive financially.
Latch Key Kid Mentality
It’s funny to think that a 1970s way of managing child care might be the financial saving grace of our generation – especially since it isn’t how we parent today. Growing up as Gen Xers, it was not uncommon to come home from school to an empty home. Our parents were working and many of us were growing up in single parent homes. The image in pop culture was that of a child getting off the school bus with their front door key hanging around their neck, who had to manage their afternoon schedule without parental supervision. Even if you weren’t an actual ‘latch key kid’, you were expected to be independent.
“[Being a latch key kid] defines our generation as being resilient - as being self-starters in a way,” says Hensley. “We were the kids who came home, made ourselves a grilled cheese or, if we were not allowed to use the stove, grabbed a popsicle out of the fridge. We watched ‘Saved by The Bell’ reruns and entertained ourselves. It shaped us in being resilient and being self-reliant.”
That self-reliance is starting to show itself in some of the data regarding Gen X. In fact, in the recent NEFE/Harris Tax Survey , when asked about what how they will use their tax return, the older Gen X cohort of ages 44-54, focused predominantly on paying down debt (17%), putting money in emergency savings (17%), and investing, either in their own or their child’s education account (11%). For younger Gen Xers and Xennials ages 35-43, there was even more of a focus on debt paydown (39%), adding to savings (26%) and investing (17 %).
Considering this data and the context of the stresses surrounding us from the other generations, it appears that we are actually listening and taking the right steps.
Self-Reliant Doesn’t Mean Loud
But in being self-reliant, we are often not the most vocal group. The generations around us demand attention. They ask for things as a group. Gen X is different in that we all respect our individuality. Any efforts to lump us together tends to fall apart at the seams – and we take pride in that.
Yet what creates momentum for our generation’s financial success comes from the latch key kid experience. We want to be both self-reliant and responsible in the deeper community. From our independent viewpoint, we don’t want to be a burden. In the latch key culture of the 1970s, we weren’t, and we don’t want to start as adults.
Hensley agrees. “When you put in the context of our financial lives, we want to do the right thing because we want to take care of ourselves. To us that is being a good citizen and a good neighbor. We don’t need to tell everyone how much we saved and what our plans are as it is about our own personal journey.”
The Positivity of Latch Key Kid Mentality
In the Gen X world, we often joke about how lax parenting was when we were kids and that we would be arrested today if we parented that way. But most Gen Xers say it with pride. And that pride is going to ultimately come through over the coming decades as our financial success becomes clearer.
“A lot of friends I grew up with were all very independent in terms of not waiting to make decisions. We decide and we do. Our generation grew up that way,” says Hensley. “That word resilience is a reflector of our individual style and our financial identities.”
So - thank you for your concern, but we are doing just fine."
How This Fortune 100 Executive Is Diversifying The Technology Industry,www.forbes.com,Elana Lyn Gross,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2018/07/23/how-this-fortune-100-executive-is-diversifying-the-technology-industry/,"Barbara Whye is on the forefront of making Intel Corporation more diverse. Since entering the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) field as an engineer, Whye has advanced to leadership positions and uses her executive-level position as Intel's chief diversity and inclusion officer and chief human resources officer for the Technology, Systems Architecture and Client Group (TSCG) to accelerate STEM initiatives. Whye leads Intel's $300 million Diversity in Technology initiative to increase the representation of women and underrepresented minorities and improve employee inclusion and retention. The goal is for Intel to reach full representation of women and underrepresented minorities in its U.S. workforce. ""Someone in this role should have a willingness to listen, to learn and to be uncomfortable sometimes,"" she says, ""We should work to create inclusive spaces where different voices can be heard, because at the heart of engineering, designing great products and making sure that you connect with your customers, is diversity of thought. This change is extremely important to the company, to its revenue and to our nation."" We spoke about her career path and advice and the importance of creating inclusive companies.
Barbara Whye, Intel's chief diversity and inclusion officer.
Photo courtesy of Intel. Elana Lyn Gross: How do you think we can encourage more women to pursue STEM fields and advance to leadership roles?
Barbara Whye: We should talk more about what is possible versus focusing on the barriers. Persistence and optimism will always yield successful outcomes. We should spend more time focusing on implementing real solutions that will yield tangible results. We should develop multiple innovative pathways for women to enter STEM careers and ensure there are plenty of opportunities for women to progress. I’m an optimistic person and believe strongly that STEM careers provide amazing growth, reduce pay gaps and, frankly, are a lot of fun. Everyone should have access to a STEM career.
It’s also important to seek out mentors and role models who can support you along the way. Diverse people are needed in all areas of technology and by bringing together people with a wide range of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences and also encouraging a community of inclusion, we will innovate and drive future growth in the technology industry.
Gross: What advice would you give to someone who wants to start a Diversity and Inclusion initiative at their workplace?
Whye: Begin your strategy development work with inclusion at the center of the work. Inclusion transforms individual and group performance, has a strong link to employee engagement and talent retention and leads to better business results. To successfully sustain diversity and inclusion results, in addition to delivering to diversity representation goals, organizations must also prioritize the importance of inclusive leadership. It will empower employees to bring their best, and it also creates a sense of belonging and a community where employees can thrive.
Gross: What's the biggest lesson you learned at work and how did you learn it?
Whye: Through our diversity and inclusion journey, I’ve learned to never underestimate the power of sharing. We will only drive industry transformation by being open and honest about our achievements, challenges and opportunities. We can’t learn or grow without putting our heads together to share our successes, our challenges and our failures – and putting those learnings to work.
Gross: What is one thing that you wish you had known when you were starting out your career?
Whye: The one thing that I wish I had known when starting out my career was that it’s okay to ask for help. Asking for help is a strength not a weakness. I also learned quickly that it’s essential to find sponsors. This is key to retention and growth, because they end up being the bridge between the job that you have and the job that you aspire to have.
In times when you feel stuck or uncertain, know there are always others you can reach out to. I have had a host of wonderful mentors, sponsors and role models who have supported and encouraged me along the way.
Gross: What is the best advice you've ever received?
Whye: I’ve been fortunate to receive a lot of great advice from various mentors. It truly does “take a village.” One of my favorite Quote: s is: “Leadership is about making others better in your presence so that the impact is felt in your absence.” I think it’s important to continue to inspire those around you and make sure that the work you are leading is sustained.
I would also add that my family has had the biggest and most consistent impact on my professional DNA —especially my mother. She is fearless, resilient and always full of faith and optimism. I model these traits daily and, in doing so, it accelerates my ability to lead, learn and unlearn.
Gross: What is your career advice for other young professional women?
Whye: Speak up, speak out and stay true to your dreams and authenticity. Choosing to be uniquely you is a freeing and powerful choice. I also firmly believe that optimism is an important leadership characteristic and is linked to yielding successful outcomes. This is an exciting time for women to enter the tech industry and they are needed!
There are more women in technology than when I entered the technical field and it will continue to increase because it is our collective goal to drive more programs that result in more women and underrepresented minorities entering and staying in tech. Women currently represent more than half of college graduates so the future of the technology industry is truly in our hands."
Born In 1960s? The CDC Says You May Need A Measles Shot Before Traveling,www.forbes.com,Suzanne Rowan Kelleher,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2019/04/20/born-in-the-1960s-the-cdc-says-you-may-need-a-measles-shot-before-traveling/,"Some adults who received the measles vaccine between 1963 and 1967 may not be protected from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That's because when the measles vaccine first became available, in 1963, there were two versions and only one was effective. The first version of the early vaccine was inactivated, also known as ""killed"" measles vaccine. The other version was live attenuated measles vaccine, which was a weakened form of the virus. The killed vaccine was discontinued in 1967 when it was determined that it did not, in fact, protect against measles virus infection.
In 1968, a new version of the live measles vaccine hit the market and is still in use today. Since 1971, the measles vaccine has been combined with the mumps and rubella vaccines in the three-in-one MMR vaccine.
If you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 but you're unsure of which version you received, you should try to check your vaccination records. Unfortunately, there is no national organization that maintains vaccination records and they can be hard to track down.
If you do not have written documentation, or if you have not had a blood test to prove that you're immune, the CDC recommends biting the bullet and getting another dose or two. ""The MMR vaccine is safe, and there is no harm in getting another dose if you may already be immune to measles, mumps, or rubella,"" the agency says on its website .
A heightened risk for travelers
Measles is highly contagious . Early symptoms typically include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Two or three days after infection, tiny white spots may appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after infection, a red rash breaks out. In a small percentage of cases, complications from measles can lead to more serious conditions such as diarrhea, ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis or even death.
This year is on track to be the worst year for measles outbreaks in 27 years, according to CDC data. From January 1 to April 11, there were 555 individual confirmed cases of measles in 20 states.
Elsewhere in the world, there are currently measles outbreaks in Brazil, Israel, Japan, Ukraine and the Philippines.
There have been several recent cases of travelers contracting and spreading measles, including:
A 43-year-old flight attendant for El Al, Israel's national airline, is in a coma after contracting measles on a flight from New York to Tel Aviv. Since February, three measles cases have been reported at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). Last month, a man caught measles on a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo. Last month, a man who was unaware he had measles traveled from New York to Michigan and infected 39 people . The CDC says international travelers are at high risk for exposure and transmission of the virus and recommends the following:
Infants 6 months through 11 months of age should receive one dose of MMR vaccine. Infants who get one dose of MMR vaccine before their first birthday should get two more doses (one dose at 12 through 15 months of age and another dose at least 28 days later). Children 12 months of age and older should receive two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days. Teenagers and adults who do not have evidence of immunity against measles should get two doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days. If you get sick abroad, travel insurance can provide coverage if you contract measles and are forced to miss or interrupt a trip, says Stan Sandberg, co-founder of TravelInsurance.com . ""Likewise, if an existing policyholder gets sick while traveling, travel medical coverage can help pay for medical expenses.""
Risk assessment: When were you born?
Born before the 1957? You probably were not vaccinated against measles but you're safe anyway. ""Before vaccines were available, nearly everyone was infected with measles, mumps, and rubella viruses during childhood,"" according to the CDC website.
For two decades after 1968, most people vaccinated against measles received only one dose. The CDC's Measles FAQ page says one dose of measles vaccine is about 93 percent effective at preventing measles if exposed to the virus. Two doses are about 97 percent effective.
It wasn't until 1989 that health officials started recommending two doses of the live vaccine. There was a catch-up program in 1989, so some grade-school students received a second shot at that time, but guidelines varied by state.
The upshot: If you're unsure which measles vaccine — or how many doses — you received, it's better to be safe than sorry and roll up your sleeve."
Hacking Darwin: Ultimate Guide To 21st Century Sex Education,www.forbes.com,David Sable,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsable/2019/04/20/hacking-darwin-the-ultimate-guide-to-21st-century-sex-education/,"Jamie Metzl, author of 'Hacking Darwin' Jamie Metzl How sex ed has changed.
In the future, perhaps as early as 2045, will most planned pregnancies be conceived in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab; the eggs, sperm and embryos comprehensively screened for genetic disease-associated mutations, ranked and scored for probabilities of more poorly-defined traits, and subjected to all sorts of genetic modifications? Will parents of the future face something between an opportunity and an obligation to dial in and dial out the traits that define their (or their insurance company’s) vision of a perfect baby: minimizing disease risks, maximizing talents and desired physical attributes and abilities, and when necessary trading one predisposition for another?
Will the benefits of these interventions be so compelling that those who choose to conceive in vivo (aka the old fashioned way) will be shunned as mid twenty-first century Luddites, carelessly leaving the important process of evolution to natural selection? For those with access to the technology, will this proactive genetic intervention mean the end of disease, a democratization of innate talents, ...and the ubiquity of broad shoulders, thin waists and great hair?
And will this be the end of sex?
Welcome to Hacking Darwin , Jamie Metzl's timely, important, and thorough exploration of how inheritance will evolve from natural selection to a human-controlled generation-by-generation data hack. And while some of the scenarios for the future of human reproduction that he describes may seem far-fetched, they effectively illustrate the power of the reproductive technologies being developed, and the challenge of using them responsibly.
Hacking Darwin has two parts, a Darwin (historical) part and a Hacking (futuristic) part. The first is a meticulously researched and written history of reproductive genetics, from Mendel and Darwin to Watson, Crick and Franklin, to Steptoe and Edwards, along parallel paths of basic science, medicine and bioethics. Anyone seeking perspective and background for the coming debates on gene modification, de novo egg and sperm creation, and the movement towards consensus on preimplantation genetic diagnosis for miscarriage and genetic disease prevention, fertility preservation in cancer survivors, reproductive alternatives for the LGBT population and proactive family planning using vitrification of eggs and sperm should start here.
The second part of the book, running alongside and interspersed with the first, is a science/science fiction hybrid that tells the ""where all this could be heading"" story, and includes a future where our babies are chosen from a menu, one trait after another, where we extrapolate from the precision that preimplantation genetic diagnosis techniques offer for single gene mutation disease (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, for example) prevention today, relatively low hanging fruit bioscience-wise, to seemingly anything that occurs in the nuclei of human eggs, sperm and embryos.
Read these sections carefully, and skeptically. The connection between what we can do in the one gene, one disease at a time present does not necessarily translate into a many genes, many diseases plus talents/physical traits future. And development of the science does not inevitably lead to mass acceptance and adoption by patients/consumers. (The one place where the presentation falls flat is the brief visits to a fertility clinic of the future, where a clinician of some sort describes the new procedures to a patient. One of author's few under-developed talents is dialogue; I would not wait in line for tickets to his first play).
If Hacking Darwin is less successful projecting the arc of progress into the future than it is in tracing the past's path to now, that's because we have graduated to much more complicated problems, from precision medicine to “I know them when I see them” disorders like autism or Alzheimer’s disease, and traits and predispositions like intelligence or empathy. We are all the sum total of many relative deficiencies, strengths and weaknesses, each with a more or less detailed genetic signature. The genetic decisions of the future will not be good gene / bad gene binaries; biology has decades and perhaps centuries of humbling lessons in store for us.
Further, one can (and should) argue that any 2019 survey of reproductive genetics will overstate the connection between DNA and disease (or DNA and destiny) and place too little emphasis on the post DNA dynamics: the regulation of transcription and translation and how different environmental, microbiomic, metablomic, proteomic, and -omics to be named later. We should approach calculating polygenic risk (and, more importantly, acting on these calculations) with caution. Applying (and therefore implying) digital precision to analog definitions of disease (or talents) is a good way to do the wrong thing for the right reasons.
A final argument against predictions of an explosive adaption of complex and comprehensive proactive genetic intervention: we have really effective versions of it available now, and hardly anyone uses them. We have been able to identify single gene mutations in embryos during IVF in order to prevent establishing an affected pregnancy for over two decades. If this 100% severe childhood disease prevention has not moved the needle, why do we think that changing percentage risk for chronic or adult illnesses will? Maybe this will take time, maybe we need to reach more than the 30,000 families who deliver children with genetic disease in the United States each year. Certainly cost and access is another factor, inadequate patient (and doctor) knowledge of the procedures is another. But will this dynamic change with time and more advances in the technology?
There is so much to like about Hacking Darwin . The author speaks many languages: genetics, data science, eastern and western politics and philosophy and how they affect medical and scientific innovation, and the history and sociology of science. His humble, academic treatment of biology's recent past provides a perspective and grounding that makes the more implausible scenarios for the future seem possible and reasonable, but not necessarily inevitable. Eventually these arcs of history, discovery and science will make everything in Hacking Darwin realistic, and some of it real.
It’s time to clear a section on the bookshelf for a future of reproduction section. In addition to Hacking Darwin , I would highly recommend Carl Zimmer's She Has Her Mother's Laugh and Hank Greely's The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction, together an excellent start to asyllabus for the new sex ed.

Bank Of America Beats $15 Minimum Wage Movement,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/20/bank-of-america-beats-the-15-minimum-wage-movement/?ss=taxes,"Bank of America is jumping ahead of the $15 minimum wage movement. Beginning May 1 st , it will hike its minimum wage to $17, and to $20 by 2021. Other big banks like JPMorgan Chase have already announced plans to hike the minimum wage to $18. As of 2017, Bank of America was the fourth largest employer in the banking sector in the US, with more than 142,000 employees.
Bank Number of Employees Wells Fargo 232,321 JPMorgan Chase 191,929 Citibank 169,092 Bank of America 142,412 Source: Statista.com What drives Bank of America’s generosity to its employees? Several things. One of them is a tight labor market that has companies competing for a smaller pool of qualified employees. “ In recent months we've seen Target, Amazon, Walmart, McDonalds and others all indicate they're willing to pay a $15 an hour minimum wage as the price to hire good workers from a steadily shrinking labor pool,” says Jeff Yastine, Senior Equities Analyst at BanyanHill Publishing . “So it’s not surprising that Bank of America would as well. In fact, given the need for bank workers with strong math ability and other specialized skills, it’s more surprising that the bank didn't commit to paying $15 a year or two earlier.” Then there are the layoffs and the bad rap banks have with the millennial generation, according to Yastine. “Given the number of layoffs in past years as banks closed branches, and the overall ‘bad rep’ that banks have in general with millennials, my prediction is that BofA and other institutions may find themselves playing catchup, and upping wages still further, in order to attract the necessary people to offset retirements from baby boomers,” he adds. And there’s the rising profitability of big banks, following a string of interest rises by the Federal Reserve, which boosted the “interest rate spread.” That’s the difference between what banks receive on the interest they charge borrowers and the interest they pay depositors. This week, Bank of America reported strong financial results -- as did JPMorgan Bank last week. Both banks cited the favorable interest rate environment as the driver of profitability.

Koyfin “ The Bank itself is doing pretty well from a balance sheet perspective and also wanted to reinvest into their business, outside from the common stock buy-back we've seen from the bigger companies,” says Jordan Awoye, Managing Partner at Awoye Capital. Lastly, there’s a public ploy issue by celebrity executives to reform capitalism w ith the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, “calling out its competition to raise its minimum wage in his annual shareholder letter,” adds Awoye. “From the public's eye, Bank of America is part of this push to tip the scale for the employee market, which ultimately can be amazing PR for the bank.” Awoye sees these wage hikes as being positive for banks and for labor as a whole. “ Slowly but surely , this will start to change the minimum wage landscape,” he adds . “As more and more employers raise their wage levels to keep up with the changes that are happening, the wages for the industry's ground level position will increase across the board.” Provided, of course, that the economy continues to grow for years to come, defying historical norms.

America Should Stop Supporting Lavish Life Of Pakistan's Rich,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/20/america-should-stop-supporting-the-lavish-life-of-pakistans-rich/?ss=taxes,"America should stop providing aid to Pakistan, which ends up supporting the country’s rich and powerful. It should let China and Saudi Arabia do it. Providing financial aid to poor countries around the world makes a great deal of sense for America, both on humanitarian and geopolitical grounds.The trouble is that in some cases, American foreign aid ends up supporting the lifestyles of the elite rather than the lives of the poor. Pakistan is a case in point. For decades, Washington has been very generous to that South Asian nation , according to Akbar Zaidi, a Karachi-based political economist and Columbia University Visiting Scholar. It helped the country deal with chronic debt crisis.
 “Washington support is often reflected in its endorsement of Pakistan’s applications for aid from international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,” says Zaidi. “It helps to have the United States as an ally when it comes to seeking assistance from multilateral sources.”

Like back in December 2001, when Washington brokered a $12 billion IMF debt relief package for Islamabad, in exchange f or support to fight Islamic militancy in the region. So w hy Pakistan is running into debt problems that require foreign aid to solve them? Because the country’s elite is refusing to pay its fair share of taxes, according to Zaidi. “These problems are perennial—it would be incorrect to call them a “crisis”—largely because of the Pakistani elite’s ability to avoid taxing itself,” says Zaidi. “Instead, successive governments have preferred to leverage Islamic militancy, ignoring the risks of doing so) while relying on financial aid from outside countries with geopolitical interests in the region from international financial institutions.” The Pakistani elite , he continues, “ frightens foreigners into proving funds to stabilize the country against a self-created, false threat of extremists taking over a nuclear state.” Meanwhile, foreign aid allows the country’s elite to live a lavish life. “This is a classic moral hazard problem: the luxury of always being bailed out has allowed the Pakistani elite to live with great impunity. Beyond responsibility in cocoons of lavish unaccountability. They feel little need to undertake structural reforms of the economy and institutions that would result in a fairer, more just, and more equitable form of government and representation.” Instead, they prefer London, New York, and Dubai more than they do Karachi -- when it comes to investing and partying with their money, that is. That’s according to the former director of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Pakistan , Marc-André Franche. “You cannot have an elite that takes advantage of very cheap and uneducated labour when it comes to making money, and when it is time to party is found in London ; when it’s time to buy things, in Dubai; and when it’s time to buy property it invests in Dubai or Europe or New York. The elite needs to decide do they want a country or not,” Franche stated in an interview with the Business Recorder. All good reasons why America should let China and Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s new allies, support the lifestyle of their rich and powerful.

9thWonder Seeks To Align Its Corporate Incentives With Under-Served Needs Of Marketers,www.forbes.com,Tony Silber,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonysilber/2019/04/20/9thwonder-seeks-to-align-its-corporate-incentives-with-under-served-needs-of-marketers/,"Among major trends in marketing, two aren’t getting as much attention as they deserve, and the advertising-agency business hasn’t responded to them effectively, according to one agency CEO and innovator who believes he’s found a solution.
Jose Lozano.
Jason Fitzgerald The trends, says Jose Lozano, CEO of Houston-based 9thWonder , are the decline of the CMO’s influence within companies, and the need for a broader range of marketing specialization.
About five years ago, Lozano, says, he sensed a disconnect between what agencies provide and what clients need. He commissioned both qualitative and quantitative feedback from clients. Among the questions: What do marketers want from an agency partner? What are the major trend lines in the industry—is there a gap? More importantly, where are the problems and what are the challenges?
Lozano’s hunch about the disconnect proved right. “There was a devaluation of the marketing function,” he says. “CMOs are no longer in that inner circle. When you scratched the surface, you found they needed a partner who could help re-empower them in their own organizations.”
Just as important, CMOs needed specialized partners skilled in various facets of marketing—CRM, data, branded content, martech, SEO, events, web development, video and more, Lozano says. “They need to bring in specialties that drive business, and they need to empower the marketing function,” Lozano says. “These are the least-talked-about significant issues to face our business in the last 10 years.”

9thWonder Even more interesting, Lozano says, the ability to meet these marketing needs didn’t exist on the agency side. Holding companies, co-ops and collectives with specialized skills have long existed in various forms. But Lozano says the economics have never properly aligned with the underlying purpose, which is for local shops to stay entrepreneurial and also to share in the broader upside. The common conglomerate model is for the parent company to own all the pieces—which becomes just a bunch of different agencies that have been strung together. The collective model is better in theory, Lozano says, but indie motivation suffers. “As soon as they become one part in a larger agency, they lose that edge,” Lozano says. “CMOs told us what they needed doesn’t exist. We set out to build it ourselves.”
Lozano’s solution was build a collective of independent specialists that together could meet the twin goals. Starting around three years ago, he made a series of acquisitions of agencies covering key specialties: strategy, web development, production, talent and creative. The terms of the acquisitions were simple—each agency would continue operating its own shop, under its own name, but also effectively get a piece of the other agencies.
But it turned out that model was too loosely connected. CMOs struggled with the idea of hiring a string of different agencies. Others said they couldn’t differentiate from larger agencies.
So, last October, Lozano’s firm, then named The Company, gave way to 9thWonder , a single agency with a network of specialized units. Each of the former semi-independent agencies became an office of 9thWonder, retaining significant equity in their local operation, while also gaining equity in a global fund. This effectively strengthened the overall company while also enabling it to assemble a suite of diverse services for any assignment. ““We have little to no redundancy from one client to the other,” Lozano says. “If I’m in Houston, and I need a specialty, I call one of the other offices.”
9thWonder’s economics are unique, Lozano says, and allow the specialist model to work where it has failed elsewhere. Compensation is tiered to both local and corporate success, with global success accounting for 65% of all bonuses. Teams are paid corporately first and only after that for individual-office performance. It’s important, Lozano says, that the individual offices retain a significant portion of ownership, so they stay nimble and drive their specialty.
“To the best of my knowledge, this is a unique model,” Lozano says. “People have done it in pieces. There’s a reason people don’t do it. We have to be willing to give up a lot. We bring our partners along for the entire ride. When and if we sell the company, all partners participate in the equity at the same multiple I get. If I get six, they get six for whatever the value of their current equity is.”
The model works, Lozano says. Since last fall, 9thWonder has moved three accounts from one office to another, with no issues and no complaints. In one instance, a packaged-goods client working with the Houston office was struggling. “It wasn’t meshing,” Lozano says. “She didn’t feel like she was getting the specialties that a packaged-goods company should be getting. But we had that in Los Angeles.” The account was shifted to L.A. and 9thWonder kept the business.
“We have depth now,” Lozano says. “This isn’t shallow. And that creates great perspectives for our clients.”
Going forward, the plan is to use the first part of 2019 to consolidate and build the infrastructure to deliver on 9thWonder’s promises. Longer term, Lozano says, is to continue with M&A and build up a global family of agencies that want to operate in this new framework."

"Q&A: Cage The Elephant's Matt Shultz On The Beatles, Beck And Being Humbled",www.forbes.com,Steve Baltin,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/04/20/qa-cage-the-elephants-matt-shultz-on-the-beatles-beck-and-being-humbled/,"Cage The Elephant Matt Shultz would prefer it if you didn't call his band rock or alternative. ""There's a lot of controversy with people having the discussion about rock and roll being dead. I mean, come on, guys, let's move onto a new conversation,"" Shultz tells me. ""This conversation has been going on for 20 years. And this is a good and beautiful thing, genre-specific titles starting to disappear where we can focus more on the meat of creativity, which is the act itself of being present and creating something."" Backing up that claim, Shultz and his Cage brethren have delivered a powerful new album, Social Cues , which moves effortlessly between the smooth groove of the lead single, ""Ready To Let Go"" and the rock and roll of ""Broken Boy"" to the beautiful vulnerability of the singer/songwriter tracks ""What I'm Becoming"" and ""Goodbye.""
This year portends to be another massive step forward for the Kentucky-formed band, who get to display their arena-worthy live show on a co-headlining tour with Beck this summer. I spoke with Shultz in a lengthy and deep conversation about his admiration for Beck, the Beatles, why this album finds him letting go of past personal baggage and the importance of being humbled on a regular basis.
Steve Baltin: I love the diversity of the record. Especially the vulnerability of later songs like ""What I'm Becoming"" and ""Goodbye,"" that were some of my favorites. What was the span these songs were written?
Matt Shultz: We're always writing and sharing ideas. Part of our process is just kind of finding that space where we become obsessed with music again and being excited and passionate. So we're sharing ideas, sharing stuff we're listening to. A lot of these songs started very early on, they were very undeveloped, but happened over probably a two or three year period.
Baltin: Does it take a minute for you to fall in love with music again?
Shultz: You can do things to reignite that romance sort of thing (laughs). But there are just times where it wears off and you have to breathe life back into the passion. I think I heard a Quote: by Paul McCartney once and I was like, ""Wow, that's special."" He said, ""You can never outdo yourself, you can only move in a different direction."" And I was like, ""Ah, that's smart."" You take this huge burden off of yourself where next record has to be better. No, it just has to be different and reignite that excitement to where it feels fresh again.
Baltin: How does working with different artists, and especially someone like Beck who has been making music for more than 25 years, feed into that idea of reigniting the passion?
Shultz: Yeah, that's always a huge inspiration. You kind of cut your teeth on that concept. You start working with different producers and you understand what an important role that can play in that crazy process cause it truly does dramatically impact an album. You can't plant an orange seed and expect for apples to grow. So whoever you're working with is undeniably gonna affect whatever you create. So hopefully you're working with people that hold that kind of personality, that powerful cred. And with someone like Beck, we had the track for the most part finished, we had the music done and the chorus was finished. And everyone was feeling really great about the song and we all knew it was something that was really special, but on the verses we were all a little torn between what direction we should take. And a lot of our albums, especially this one, we talked about these characters we can use as vehicles to find the approach or whatever. And we were discussing a couple of different characters. But as far as trying to live in it nothing was really connecting. So Brad [Shultz] just had this idea. He knew that maybe Beck would have a really clear vision for the direction of the verses. So he sent the song off to him and as a great testimony to what a talent he is, within 48 hours he sent back two verses. And it was so funny because the humility which was in it. ""These are two verses, I also have five others in case these don't work for you."" And it's like, ""Wow, he's so amazingly talented, that's crazy."" And it really helped set the course for finishing the song.
Baltin: Obvious question, but will you perform together with Beck on this tour and if so what is the one song of his you'd love to do?
Shultz: Oh man, I would love to do ""Devil's Haircut,"" ""Two Tables And A Microphone,"" just like anything (laughs). I've loved Beck's music, Beck's tunes have helped shape my life and musical palette, so I can't pinpoint a specific track. We've had light discussions, I'll leave it at that. If we do, hopefully it will be a pleasant surprise for the audience.
Baltin: It's like when you cover a song or someone covers one of yours it brings a new interpretation to an existing work. What are covers you have done that really take you in a different direction?
Shultz: One of the things about working in music is community is so important. And in music that aspect is very highlighted, which is pretty amazing. I've learned a lot covering other people's music, about myself, and about people's writing, their approach I believe. For myself, I've always felt I could see the beauty in everyone's perspective. That's why it's really special to work with specific individuals because you can narrow down those possibilities. But covering people's songs has been so important and I believe it's a huge contributor to a lot of artists who have been very highly successful in the past. The Beatles being one of the greatest testimonies to that. They lived in Hamburg and were playing seven-hour sets seven days a week. You're talking about a repertoire that was immense. So whenever they went back to write of course they're musical encyclopedias for the day. ""Oh, wow, do you remember that one thing Little Richard did? And Chuck Berry did this here. And B.B. King was like this."" And whoever it was that was inspiring them, whether it was a jazz tune, a blues song or rock and roll. Not to take away from their own personal creativity, but I think when you cover things it definitely gives you a lot.
Baltin: How do you ensure that Cage stays fun and fresh and not overwhelming? How much does the community you discussed play into that?
Shultz: It's not always fun, but that's life, right? It can be extremely difficult, Usually that's paired with going through a difficult time in life when you're caught up in all sorts of mental, emotional, spiritual bondage. But yeah I think it's really important to be around a community and around people who keep you humble. Being humbled is one of the quickest ways to reignite the fun and excitement with music. What's been really amazing for myself over the years has been that when you're in that space for a long time you're just gonna meet some incredibly talented people. And the more of those people you meet the better chance more of those people are gonna become your friends. And I've arrived at a place in life where my friends are all creating really amazing stuff. I'm not just talking about people that are really well know, that doesn't matter. Some are, some aren't. But just being around an art community pretty steadily you become friends with a lot of highly efficient creators. And having people share stuff with you and they're like, ""Hey, this is my new album, this is my new painting, this is a scene I'm working on,"" and I'm just like, ""Wow, you're so talented, that's crazy,"" and being humbled in that way definitely brings the fun into it for certain.
Baltin: Are there things that surprised you in the writing of this album or things you learned about yourself?
Shultz: Yeah, I think that what I learned this is the last record I'll be shoving my face into things I did before. I think I was revisiting a lot of damage and baggage that I knew so well and that I let dominate me for a long time. I don't know if I learned a lot from writing it except I was just living in it at that moment. I've learned a lot since the record's been done though.
Baltin: You have so many influences you mentioned. When you listen back to Cage can you hear all those different elements in the music?
Shultz: Definitely, and I hope more and more. I've started calling this generation the playlist generation and I think it's such a good thing. There's been so much controversy over the death of the album, so on and so forth. And I love albums, but the diversity of the material you're listening to -- all of a sudden I'm listening to a Cramps song, which transitions into Kendrick Lamar ""Mad City,"" which runs into ""Helter Skelter,"" by the Beatles, and it's followed by Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds and then into Kanye West. And you're thinking, ""What is the common fiber that unties this music? It seems like it's so far apart, but works together so seamlessly in transitioning."" I love that stuff and I'm really excited to see where music goes."

Hacking Darwin: The Ultimate Guide To 21st Century Sex Education,www.forbes.com,David Sable,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidsable/2019/04/20/hacking-darwin-the-ultimate-guide-to-21st-century-sex-education/?ss=healthcare,"How sex ed has changed. In the future, perhaps as early as 2045, will most planned pregnancies be conceived in the in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab; the eggs, sperm and embryos comprehensively screened for genetic disease-associated mutations, ranked and scored for probabilities of more poorly-defined traits, and subjected to all sorts of genetic modifications? Will parents of the future face something between an opportunity and an obligation to dial in and dial out the traits that define their (or their insurance company’s) vision of a perfect baby: minimizing disease risks, maximizing talents and desired physical attributes and abilities, and when necessary trading one predisposition for another?
Will the benefits of these interventions be so compelling that those who choose to conceive in vivo (aka the old fashioned way) will be shunned as mid twenty-first century Luddites, carelessly leaving the important process of evolution to natural selection? For those with access to the technology, will this proactive genetic intervention mean the end of disease, a democratization of innate talents, ...and the ubiquity of broad shoulders, thin waists and great hair?
And will this be the end of sex?
Welcome to Hacking Darwin , Jamie Metzl's timely, important, and thorough exploration of how inheritance will evolve from natural selection to a human-controlled generation-by-generation data hack. And while some of the scenarios for the future of human reproduction that he describes may seem far-fetched, they effectively illustrate the power of the reproductive technologies being developed, and the challenge of using them responsibly.
Hacking Darwin has two parts, a Darwin (historical) part and a Hacking (futuristic) part. The first is a meticulously researched and written history of reproductive genetics, from Mendel and Darwin to Watson, Crick and Franklin, to Steptoe and Edwards, along parallel paths of basic science, medicine and bioethics. Anyone seeking perspective and background for the coming debates on gene modification, de novo egg and sperm creation, and the movement towards consensus on preimplantation genetic diagnosis for miscarriage and genetic disease prevention, fertility preservation in cancer survivors, reproductive alternatives for the LGBT population and proactive family planning using vitrification of eggs and sperm should start here.
The second part of the book, running alongside and interspersed with the first, is a science/science fiction hybrid that tells the ""where all this could be heading"" story, and includes a future where our babies are chosen from a menu, one trait after another, where we extrapolate from the precision that preimplantation genetic diagnosis techniques offer for single gene mutation disease (sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, for example) prevention today, relatively low hanging fruit bioscience-wise, to seemingly anything that occurs in the nuclei of human eggs, sperm and embryos.
Read these sections carefully, and skeptically. The connection between what we can do in the one gene, one disease at a time present does not necessarily translate into a many genes, many diseases plus talents/physical traits future. And development of the science does not inevitably lead to mass acceptance and adoption by patients/consumers. (The one place where the presentation falls flat is the brief visits to a fertility clinic of the future, where a clinician of some sort describes the new procedures to a patient. One of author's few under-developed talents is dialogue; I would not wait in line for tickets to his first play).
If Hacking Darwin is less successful projecting the arc of progress into the future than it is in tracing the past's path to now, that's because we have graduated to much more complicated problems, from precision medicine to “I know them when I see them” disorders like autism or Alzheimer’s disease, and traits and predispositions like intelligence or empathy. We are all the sum total of many relative deficiencies, strengths and weaknesses, each with a more or less detailed genetic signature. The genetic decisions of the future will not be good gene / bad gene binaries; biology has decades and perhaps centuries of humbling lessons in store for us.
Further, one can (and should) argue that any 2019 survey of reproductive genetics will overstate the connection between DNA and disease (or DNA and destiny) and place too little emphasis on the post DNA dynamics: the regulation of transcription and translation and how different environmental, microbiomic, metablomic, proteomic, and -omics to be named later. We should approach calculating polygenic risk (and, more importantly, acting on these calculations) with caution. Applying (and therefore implying) digital precision to analog definitions of disease (or talents) is a good way to do the wrong thing for the right reasons.
A final argument against predictions of an explosive adaption of complex and comprehensive proactive genetic intervention: we have really effective versions of it available now, and hardly anyone uses them. We have been able to identify single gene mutations in embryos during IVF in order to prevent establishing an affected pregnancy for over two decades. If this 100% severe childhood disease prevention has not moved the needle, why do we think that changing percentage risk for chronic or adult illnesses will? Maybe this will take time, maybe we need to reach more than the 30,000 families who deliver children with genetic disease in the United States each year. Certainly cost and access is another factor, inadequate patient (and doctor) knowledge of the procedures is another. But will this dynamic change with time and more advances in the technology?
There is so much to like about Hacking Darwin . The author speaks many languages: genetics, data science, eastern and western politics and philosophy and how they affect medical and scientific innovation, and the history and sociology of science. His humble, academic treatment of biology's recent past provides a perspective and grounding that makes the more implausible scenarios for the future seem possible and reasonable, but not necessarily inevitable. Eventually these arcs of history, discovery and science will make everything in Hacking Darwin realistic, and some of it real.
It’s time to clear a section on the bookshelf for a future of reproduction section. In addition to Hacking Darwin , I would highly recommend Carl Zimmer's She Has Her Mother's Laugh and Hank Greely's The End of Sex and the Future of Human Reproduction, together an excellent start to a syllabus for the new sex ed."

Review: Nixplay Iris And Seed Wave Wi-Fi Digital Photo Frames,www.forbes.com,Brad Moon,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradmoon/2019/04/20/review-nixplay-iris-and-seed-wave-wi-fi-digital-photo-frames/,"Digital photo frames are a great way to display all your favorite photos in limited space. The latest generation of Wi-Fi connected frames add the ability to wirelessly upload photos from virtually anywhere — no USB thumb drive or SD card required — and add the ability to give friends and family access so they can also upload photos to share. That sharing feature in particular makes Wi-Fi frames great gifts. I just wrapped up testing on a pair of Wi-Fi digital photo frames from Nixplay: the Iris and the Seed Wave .
The Iris and Seed Wave (more on that power adapter/cable later).
Bard Moon Nixplay Features
Before breaking out some specifics about the two frames, I wanted to talk about features they share.
Both use IPS displays that offer good color reproduction, plenty of brightness and wide viewing angles. A good display panel is critical to a good digital photo frame, and these do the job nicely. Nixplay also offers advanced features like the ability to tweak the color settings, and manually set brightness levels (or use the built-in ambient light sensor to adjust brightness based on room lighting conditions).
These Nixplay frames let you manually fine-tune the color levels.
Brad Moon Local storage for the frames is 8GB, and Nixplay includes 10GB of free cloud storage. There’s no USB port or SD slot for side-loading, but once you’ve uploaded photos to these frames they are stored locally so you still see them even if the Wi-Fi network goes down.
Besides displaying photos, both can play videos up to 15 seconds in length.
Both frames use Nixplay’s woven cable-stand design. This is a very thick, woven power cable that connects to a very thick, bendable cable connector attached to the back of the frame. The result is a stand that keeps the frame securely at whatever angle you want, and in whatever orientation — landscape or portrait — you wish. It works well, and the woven power cable has a premium look, but it’s also very noticeable if you aren’t able to hide it.
Nixplay's mobile app is full-featured and easy to use.
Screen capture by Brad Moon Nixplay’s app for sharing and uploading photos is available for Android and iOS. Recently updated, it’s pretty easy to use. The expected functions are there — primarily the ability to select photos and share them with a frame. You can also do this with a computer and Nixplay’s website, and can choose to upload photos from your social media accounts like Facebook. The one thing you won’t find is photo editing capabilities.
The app doubles as an easy way to edit settings on the frame, but you can also do so locally. The frame displays aren’t touch-enabled (fine in my books, that just means fewer fingerprint smudges), but Nixplay includes a wireless remote for navigating settings and also has controls to skip forward or back in a photo playlist.
Nixplay Iris
The Nixplay Iris looks very similar to a traditional photo frame, and features an attractive metallic finish (available in three colors). The display itself measures 8-inches diagonally. With its 4:3 aspect ratio this translates into a viewable area roughly 6.5-inches wide and 5-inches high, making the displayed photo a bit larger than the 4x6 prints that many people put inside old school picture frames.
Its 1024 x 768 resolution is high enough that from even a few feet away, it’s difficult to tell that you aren’t looking at an actual printed photo.
Nixplay Seed Wave
While the Iris does the job of sharing and displaying photos just fine — and looks like a traditional photo frame while doing it — Nixplay’s Seed Wave is a little more interesting.
The Seed Wave is a big, high resolution frame that looks a lot like a tablet.
Bard Moon It’s considerably larger, with a 13-inch widescreen display that has Full HD (1920 x 18080 resolution). The frame portion is black plastic, so it resembles a tablet more than a traditional photo frame. And the Seed Wave has an extra feature: hidden behind the display are a pair of drivers, each with 5W of amplification. That’s right, this digital photo frame does double-duty as a Bluetooth speaker. It actually sounds pretty decent as well, and Nixplay includes a rubber strip in the box that will help prevent the Seed Wave from jumping around on a smooth surface if you crank up the tunes.
The Seed Wave's back hides this capable Bluetooth speaker.
Brad Moon I’m not sure who asked for a combo digital photo frame/Bluetooth speaker, but it could be useful in situations where space is limited. Don’t get the idea that you could load up a movie on the SeedWave and watch it in Full HD with booming stereo sound, though — like the Iris, Nixplay limits the length of videos you can upload to 15 seconds.
The Seed Wave's power adapter is unusually large.
Brad Moon The downside(s) of going big? First, while that wide screen looks great with many photos, with others it’s more of a mixed bag. Most cameras don’t natively shoot photos in that aspect ratio. Some of my photos ended up with black bars on the side (even when Pan & Zoom are enabled), although you can choose to replace the black with a blurred background based on the photo being displayed that’s less noticeable. You can see that effect in my photo of the Seed Wave displaying a shot of the Chateau Frontenac.
The second issue is the power adapter. It’s big. Larger than some laptop chargers, but the brick plugs directly into an electrical outlet, so it takes up a lot of space. You can see that in several of my photos — there is 3-inches between the bottom of the power bar and the top of my test bench, but that’s too little space for the Seed Wave power adapter and it had to be rotated so the power cord sticks out the top...

The Nixplay Iris and Wave are capable digital photo frames that make great gifts.
Brad Moon Connected digital photo frames make great gifts, especially for friends and family who may live far apart. Nixplay has the most comprehensive collection of frames I know of, with tons of options including a range of panel sizes and resolutions, and different colors and materials for the frame itself. Both the Iris and Seed Wave are good frames, although I suspect most people would end up preferring the Iris — it’s smaller with a more traditional aspect ratio, has a much more compact power adapter and costs less.

This marks the third year of Venezuela’s Great Depression. Photographer: Marco Bello/Bloomberg photo credit: © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP The call is getting louder—from Washington to Brussels—for Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro to step down. They want him and the ruling Socialists United (PSUV) to abdicate power and make way for Juan Guaido, a man most democratic countries now refer to as el Presidente.
Guaido is the president of Venezuela’s National Assembly, the equivalent of the U.S. House of Representatives. He’s like their Nancy Pelosi, the third in command after Maduro and his veep Delcy Rodriguez.
Maduro stripped the National Assembly of its legislative powers in 2017, creating a Constituent Assembly of PSUV party yes-men and yes-women instead. By the standards of the Western world, Venezuela is a dictatorship now.
Last week, President Trump followed super-hawk vice president Mike Pence to denounce Maduro. To both, Guaido is president and they want the government of Venezuela to restore democracy. Which, to them, means getting rid of PSUV.
Gaming this out, there are roughly three options.
See: Market Ponders The End Of Venezuela’s PSUV — Forbes A pro-government supporter waves a flag displaying the PdVSA logo at a rally in Caracas on January 31, 2019. Maduro is telling the working class at the oil firm that the U.S. government wants to privatize the company and control Venezuela’s oil. At the moment, Russia and China are propping up PdVSA from bankruptcy. Photographer: Marco Bello/Bloomberg photo credit: © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP © 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP
The Battle For Venezuela’s Future — The Economist
The first option absolves Washington from the coup narrative: the military convinces Maduro to step down, they appoint Delcy or some high ranking general as interim president and reestablish the National Assembly as the dual power governing Venezuela.
The two sides begin working on a timeline for new elections, of which PSUV would clearly lose. That makes this scenario a bit of a fantasy, but who knows. It’s still plausible. It’s the version that has Venezuela’s government collapsing on itself, with no outside forces manufacturing its downfall. Sanctions alone cannot bring down a president. Look at Vladimir Putin in Russia, and the last decade of Iranian leaders.
In the event of the government collapsing in on itself, PSUV, founded by the late president Hugo Chavez, would likely no longer exist as a political party. It would splinter off into smaller factions.
The second option is Washington sanctions crude oil exports, really starving the Venezuelan economy of its primary source of cash flow. Protests get more out of hand, and we have some sort of Manuel Noriega of Panama moment.
This may involve senators like Marco Rubio reaching across the aisle to convince the liberal interventionists in the Democratic Party that some sort of military support is needed to get rid of Maduro and save Venezuela from a worsening humanitarian crisis. A demonstrator holds a sign that reads “Out Maduro” during a protest against President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on January 30, 2019.

This scenario may be applauded by the majority of Venezuelans, but the fanfare would be short-lived as any U.S. military involvement in regime change there would play into the hands of future revolutionary movements to rise again. This would serve as their “told you so” newsreel of an American coup to prove to the poor and to the liberal intellectuals in the country that they were right. It would not be a hard sell for them to do so, and would foment anti-American animosity in a country that’s been loaded with Chavez-inspired Yankee Go Home rhetoric.
The third option is the worst option for Venezuela, but the best for PSUV: Maduro and PSUV dig in their heels and maintain their grip on power. Washington does not intervene out of concern that it would be a bad look for them and even endanger the opposition in Venezuela, including Guaido. The economy remains sanctioned and deteriorates further under this option. Venezuela becomes a more closed system, waiting for the day when PdVSA oil money runs out.
For days, PSUV supporters have been taking to the op-ed pages in Venezuela (where the press is no longer free) and here in the States to express their thoughts on how the removal of Maduro makes Venezuela worse.
Yes, the fall of a president is always messy. The end of Kirchnerism is Argentina made Argentina worse. The end of the Workers' Party rule in Brazil made Brazil worse. But these situations were caused by the parties in power. And then for sure Washington would ban imports of Venezuelan crude. Both Chevron and Valero are big importers of Venezuelan oil. They’d have to find it elsewhere. A demonstrator holds a sign calling for humanitarian aid. Maduro has banned international aid organizations from helping and has not called the situation in his country a humanitarian crisis. Post-Maduro, some form of IMF and humanitarian aid will be required to get the country back on its feet.

Sanctions are not the reason for the economic depression in Venezuela.
PSUV has mismanaged the economy and is considered, by most people on the ground, as a corrupt political apparatus. The only thing socialist about them is their rhetoric and the fact that they subsidize things they cannot afford to be subsidizing. All of this will be taken away by a new government, hurting the working class unless mass amounts of humanitarian aid pour in (which is probable).
The country is broke. It has defaulted on all sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds. Only the PdVSA 2020 is not in default.
Barring self-implosion or overt U.S. military intervention, there is no plan B if Maduro stays in power. And the only plan B, if he and PSUV go, is for the IMF to take over.
Washington can call Guaido president all day long, but the real president of real life in Venezuela is Nicolas Maduro. The National Assembly does not exist, as far as PSUV is concerned.

The constitutional crisis is still fluid, but the Maduro regime does look to be on its last legs. New sanctions were imposed this week on senior-level executives at PdVSA. Markets are waiting for word from the Office of Foreign Assets Control at the Treasury Department to clarify those sanctions and what they might mean for oil imports.
There is some skepticism about regime change, although this is much different than the forced regime change in the middle east. PSUV has been left to run Venezuela into the ground for years. There is overwhelming public support for their ouster.
Economic sanctions will only destroy the already fragile cash flow situation in Venezuela and this is seen undermining domestic military support among mid-ranked officers.
“You cut off the money, you cut off the military’s loyalty,” says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed income for Nomura Securities and a long-time Venezuela watcher.
The uncertainty is whether the Venezuela military finally caves to the cashflow stress, leading to option 1.
A U.S.-led military intervention—option 2—looks to be on the table. Recall National Security Advisor John Bolton’s note about “5,000 troops to Colombia” in a notebook snapped in a photograph during a recent press conference with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
Any comparisons between PSUV and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia should be seen as a signal for military intervention to take out a party believed to be financed, in part, by narcotrafficking and extortion.

Option 3 is what we have now.
President Maduro seems unwilling to resign at the moment. His latest offer for “talks” is a non-starter if the agenda doesn’t focus on returning legislative power to the opposition-controlled Assembly. Both sides detest one another. It’s like a cold war between the revolutionaries inside PSUV and many on the other side who came from the private sector, who saw their companies expropriated by Chavez.
Worth noting, Maduro has been promising talks for at least two years. He’s even made that promise to the Pope and Vatican officials. Venezuelan Catholic bishops were the first to say Maduro is not the legitimate president of the country following his inauguration on January 10.
There have been no high-profile defections from PSUV within Venezuela. The higher ranking military commanders have all circled the wagons around Maduro. “We assume that the Maduro administration has already lost support from mid-tier and junior officers and rank-and-file soldiers that equally suffer from the economic crisis,” says Morden from Nomura.
It’s now a game of Survivor to see if the Maduro regime can outwit, outlast and outplay the opposition, and survive the intensity of the economic shocks yet to come.
The WSJ reported this week that PdVSA has only 10 days left of gasoline supply remaining. Venezuela’s crisis isn't stagnating or improving. It’s about to get worse.
On Wall Street, bond markets have already priced in a high probability of PSUV’s demise. Venezuelan bonds are outperforming their peers in emerging markets this month. The recovery value in Venezuela and PdVSA debt is near impossible to assess due to the political crisis, the worsening inflation outlook and the collapse in domestic production capacity.

"In Venezuela, Maduro Has No Choice But To Resist Trump",www.forbes.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/02/26/in-venezuela-maduro-has-no-choice-but-to-resist-trump/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.

(AP Photo/Boris Vergara) photo credit: ASSOCIATED PRESS The dust has pretty much settled from the failed delivery of large quantities of food and medical aid into Venezuela this past weekend. The ruling Socialists United of Venezuela (PSUV) has opted to dig in their heels. Their mission seems to be to turn the country into Cuba. They have no other attainable long-term goal at this point.
From the point of view of PSUV, the humanitarian aid from the U.S. shipped in from Brazil and Colombia was mainly designed to provoke tensions and make president Nicolas Maduro look bad. Jorge Arreaza, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said images of trucks catching fire over a bridge route into his country was a “CIA false flag.”
Univision reporter Jorge Ramos—who on any given day is more Team Maduro than Team Trump—was taken into custody by Venezuelan authorities late Monday evening. He was freed shortly after. Ramos reportedly showed Maduro images of locals fishing through garbage for food. A truck previously loaded with humanitarian aid is lit on fire over the Francisco De Paula Santander International Bridge.

Videos circulating on WhatsApp of a truck carrying aid in Santa Elena in Bolivar state, on the Brazilian border, showed three armored national guard trucks chasing it down the road and shooting at it on Calle Urdaneta, right outside the tiny Hotel La Abuela.
This weekend made it clear that Maduro is officially a member of the anti-Trump #resistance. He has significant numbers in his military, along with PSUV politicians and state employees, believing that they are next in line for Middle East-style regime change.
Senator Marco Rubio was over the top in his comparison of Venezuela to the Middle East on Sunday when he went so far as to tweet out two pictures of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi—one of him smiling and healthy, and the other of him badly bloodied and bruised before he was murdered in the streets.
Yankee Go Home is the obvious mantra for Maduro and Company. The military has circled the wagons to protect Maduro. The rank-and-file did not desert en masse as people like Rubio had hoped.
Maduro has no choice now but to keep resisting. And to continue promoting the narrative that he is a victim of American imperial overreach, a narrative as easy to sell as the next Star Wars movie.
On Monday, Vice President Mike Pence said on the FOX Business Network’s Trish Regan Primetime program that Maduro “must go.”
“In the wake of the brutality this weekend, where literally the dictator Maduro was dancing in Caracas at the same time that his henchmen were burning truckloads of food and medicine, I believe has only steeled the resolve of the nations across this hemisphere and around the world to stand strong in our conviction that Nicolas Maduro is a usurper, he has no legitimate claim to power, and Nicolas Maduro must go,” he said to Regan from Bogota.
Pence reiterated his support for offering amnesty to military defectors.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido met with Pence over the weekend to figure out how to regain democratic control over the country.
There is some dispute that Maduro should not have been president following the death of Hugo Chavez in Havana, Cuba, in 2013. The Constitution of 1999 states that when a president becomes incapacitated, as was the cancer-battling Chavez, a new election should be called within 30 days. That literally took three years to happen, and then was postponed until Maduro was able to get the Supreme Court to disqualify every possible leading opposition candidate who wished to run against him.
In May 2018, Maduro was elected to a second six-year term.
Maduro was never elected in a competitive race by a fully recognized popular vote.
Guiado declared himself interim president on January 10. Some 50 nations no longer recognize Maduro as Venezuela's leader.
The so-called Lima Group met in Bogota on Monday vowing “to find a peaceful solution” to a political crisis that has the National Assembly usurped by Maduro's Constituents Assembly, a body of political yesmen and yeswomen. The economy is in year three of its Great Depression. Venezuelans gathering on the Tienditas International Bridge in Cucuta, Colombia on Saturday, February 23, 2019.

Peru’s Foreign Affairs Minister Hugo de Zela came out against Guaido’s call for an “any means necessary” approach to resolving the crisis, which was taken to mean U.S. intervention. Colombia’s President Ivan Duque called for a “more powerful and effective” way to get Maduro to step down. Guaido warned that “indulging” Maduro “would be a threat to all of America,” AFP reported.
Pressure on Maduro and PSUV will continue from Washington. Treasury sanctioned new individuals from the establishment on Monday.
“We assume intimidation tactics with joint military exercises between the U.S. and Venezuelan’s neighbors, with Colombia especially motivated and well equipped after years of fighting against narco-terrorism,” says Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed-income strategy for Nomura Securities.

A more drawn-out crisis was always a possibility, but now that Maduro has succeeded in shutting out aid, this possibility seems more probable than it did a week ago.
Alejandro Arreaza of Barclays Capital predicted last week that Maduro would no longer be in power by June, or out within 90 days.
What Venezuela post-Maduro looks like is the prerequisite for the next phase of economic recovery and negotiations with bondholders. Venezuela needs to settle the score on its defaulted debt before the big multilateral institutions can come in with financial muscle to build the country up again.
PdVSA bondholders are in limbo. There are increasing concerns about a de-indexation of Venezuela/PdVSA bonds on the JP Morgan EMBI. Such a move would force funds to sell those securities and lock in a steep loss.
Morden says that Treasury could reconsider trading restrictions under the context of a longer than expected Maduro government.
Following last night’s detainment of Mexican journalist Ramos, Venezuela could lose the support of that country’s new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. If he does, it would mean Maduro only has Bolivia, Cuba and Nicaragua on his side in Latin America. Some smaller nations have remained neutral. All of the economic powers in South America have called on Maduro to step down in favor of new elections.

"Meghan Markle, Prince Harry And The Birth of Baby Sussex: No Way To Please Everyone",www.forbes.com,Cecilia Rodriguez,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/04/20/meghan-markle-prince-harry-and-the-birth-of-baby-sussex-no-way-to-please-everyone/,"Meghan Markle has not been seen since March 19 and for the press and public following each of her steps, it's been a long month of rumors, exasperation, speculation and not very nice coverage about her and her husband, Prince Harry. The due date has been kept secret, the sex of the baby secret, the name of the baby secret, the place where the baby will be delivered secret and it's no secret that the tension is mounting, especially among the British tabloids whose circulation is so tied to news and gossip about the royals - and particularly about Meghan and Prince Harry - due to their enormous popularity.
For weeks, the British media has been filled with mostly-unfounded rumors and ""tips"" by anonymous sources about the manner in which Prince Harry's wife is experiencing the final moments of her pregnancy:
That she is capricious and extremely demanding with her staff That she has decided to have the baby at home That she is breaking all the royal rules concerning the birth of royal babies. It has become a challenge to sort out the truth from the fake.

Getty The last time the couple communicated with their followers was through a post in their new Instagram account revealing their decision to keep the birth of their child out of the public eye and to cancel the photo opportunity right after the baby's birth as they intend to share their own photos of the newborn later.
They explained their choice to have the “opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.”
That announcement has provoked a storm of criticism from royal followers and British and international media that consider the decision to protect their privacy like “a slap in the face.”
It's not easy to understand that feeling of entitlement, but most argue that Harry and Meghan have an obligation to keep the press and public informed since they are financially supported by their subjects’ taxes.
The couple, according to The Sun , Britain's largest-circulation tabloid, is infringing “our royal rights. The public has a right to know about the lives of those largely funded by their taxes. You can accept that, or be private citizens. Not both.”
Others are irked by the interruption of royal tradition. But the “tradition” of royal mothers appearing outside the maternity ward with their newborn hours after giving birth for a photo opportunity for press who sometimes camp out for days in advance began only a few decades ago.

Getty “This is an unprecedented slap in the face for those legions of decent, ordinary people who love the Royal Family and see the royal birth as a joyous, national celebration - a celebration they’ve now been shut out of,” The Express fumed.
The exclusion of the press and the effect that it can have on the future coverage of the media-savvy royal couple has been compared with the fairytale story of Sleeping Beauty when the scorned fairy not invited to the princess’s christening throws a spell that hovers for years over the family.
The couple’s reluctance to share their most private moments with the press is understandable and not new. The New York Times recalls “the crushing blow to publications that were giving the wedding saturation coverage,” when Harry and Meghan allowed only one reporter inside St. George’s Chapel for their wedding. “This coldness toward photographers is understood to come from Prince Harry, who was 12 when his mother was killed in a car crash, as her driver tried to escape paparazzi on motorcycles.”
As far as anybody knows, and as the scorned British tabloids demand to be shown the baby, it's possible the rumors are true that Meghan has already gone into labor and the couple is enjoying the event “privately as a family,” as they had announced.
It's credible that the tradition Kate Middleton followed during her three deliveries is too intrusive for Meghan.
""From what we know of Meghan, the idea of ​​a glamorous and perfect photo just hours after giving birth to her child does not fit at all with her vision of the world,"" wrote Omid Scobie in a column for The Daily Mail .

Getty Meghan’s sense of organization and meticulousness are also well known, as her wedding displayed. The same rigor can be expected for her delivery except, reportedly, the surprise around the baby's gender - although few believe that Meghan and Harry don’t already know.
In any case they've chosen neutral tones for Baby Sussex’s nursery: gray and white, in harmony with ecological furniture.
To prepare for the birth, Meghan, who is vegetarian and an adherent of organic products, used acupuncture and hypnosis among her treatments and for weeks has been taking sessions of breathing techniques to manage childbirth-related pain - plus yoga, which she has practiced since childhood.
Rumor had it that she wanted to give birth at home. But she may opt for a maternity hospital near her Windsor home: The press believes she will deliver at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, where Duchess Sophie of Wessex, wife of Prince Edward, had her children.
There's no doubt that wherever they choose to have the baby, at home or at the maternity ward of the hospital, Meghan can count on first-rate medical attention. The Daily Star reports that a team including obstetricians, midwives, pediatricians and surgeons will be on hand.
Until the official announcement, Ladbrokes has set 3-to-1 odds on Baby Sussex arriving between Good Friday and Easter Monday.
That would mean a double celebration: Queen Elizabeth will celebrate her 93rd birthday on Easter Sunday."

Motorola Z3: Motorola Z3 with 5G Moto Mod : this is the first Verizon 5G phone. But Verizon's nascent 5G Ultra Wideband Network is limited** to select locations. The mod works by snapping it onto the back of the moto z3. Price: $199 (but you need to be on one of Verizon's unlimited smartphone plans).
Samsung Galaxy S10 5G.
Credit: Samsung Samsung Galaxy S10: This is probably the highest-profile 5G phone right now. The Samsung Galaxy S10 5G boasts a 6.7-inch display, four rear cameras, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB of storage. Price starts at over $1,200 but that's in South Korea, Samsung's home market. The phone will be available from both Verizon and AT&T in the U.S. later this spring.
Verizon 5G Home: this is available in certain areas including Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento for $70/month or $50/month for existing Verizon customers .
iPhone 5G: needless to say, this is probably's America's most highly-anticipated 5G phone. The road to a 5G iPhone gained some clarity this week when Intel pulled out of the 5G smartphone chip market and Apple and Qualcomm settled their legal differences. The upshot: Apple may use a Qualcomm 5G chip in 2020 , according to report from Nikkei.
Speeds? Verizon told me that in Minneapolis and Chicago, early 5G mobility speeds are an average of 450 megabits per second with peak speeds around 1 gigabit per second (gbps). AT&T told me more or less the same thing for 5G+ with some download speeds ""exceeding 1Gbps."" So speed boots over 4G LTE range from a few times faster all the way to 10X and even 20X faster (theoretically at least). Peak (theoretical) speeds for 5G in the future range from 10gbps to 20gbps.
----
*AT&T 5G+ areas include: Jacksonville, FL, Atlanta, GA, Indianapolis, IN, Louisville, KY, New Orleans, LA, Charlotte/Raleigh, NC, Oklahoma City, OK, and Dallas/Houston/San Antonio/Waco, TX.
** The Verizon 5G Ultra Wideband network is available in select areas in Chicago, IL and Minneapolis, MN. But ""30+ cities"" will be getting 5G later this year, according to Verizon."
Start Selling Oil Investments,www.forbes.com,Bill Sarubbi,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/04/20/start-selling-oil-investments/,"The last (March 17) posting regarding the oil price indicated that there would be a high in late April. Black gold is at a high in the last week of April according to cycles-based research. The first graphic below shows that oil is overbought weekly having more than doubled from the January 2016 low.

Chart 4- Weekly Oil Cycle
The weekly cycle is peaking.
Cycles Research Investments LLC Chart 5- Monthly Cycle
The monthly cycle is confirming the seasonal peak and the weekly high.
Cycles Research Investments LLC The bearish factors are:
Seasonally, oil has hit its annual peak The weekly and monthly cycles point down The $65 price level was cited as the 61.8% retracement of the prior rally and the likely price target for this run. This level has been reached In terms of sentiment, there has been more put writing, a sign of an increasingly bullish climate. The annual high for any April is on the 22nd. The high for the monthly cycle is on the 27th and the weekly cycle high is on April 20th. So, the high for this price rise will likely be between the 20th and the 29th. Following that time period, we will likely see the largest oil decline in 2019.
The Q4 2018 decline may have been an A wave down and the current rally a B wave up. The post-April decline projected by the monthly cycle may be a C wave, the most severe in an A-B-C sequence. If this is true, then the drop could take oil back to the old 2016 low near $26."
The Freewheeling 'Avengers: Endgame' Press Tour Might Be The Best Thing For The Movie,www.forbes.com,Rachel Paige,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rpaige/2019/04/20/avengers-endgame-press-tour-no-spoilers/,"Do you have questions about Avengers: Endgame ? You more than likely do, seeing as how it’s the final film in a 22-movie saga, bringing together all our heroes across Earth and space as they battle Thanos who wiped out half of humanity at the end of Avengers: Infinity War with one quick snap of his Infinity Gauntlet. The movie is shrouded in the utmost secrecy, considering it is the end , but unfortunately while there are hundreds, if not thousands, of questions regarding the film, there are absolutely no answers. Nothing. Nadda. Zip. Even though the cast knows what’s happening in the movie (they filmed it, after all), they’ve clearly been given strict instructions to not actually talk about anything (call it The Curse of Mark Ruffalo and Tom Holland ). This creates an issue as pre-release press is still happening for Endgame . Journalists are still sent to ask questions about the movie, but the cast can’t answer anything. It's, for lack of any better word awkward. What do you do for five minutes with Robert Downey Jr. where he can't say anything about the movie he's currently promoting? This strategy is basically unheard of, since who doesn’t want to ask and answer questions about a movie before it opens to drum up positive reactions? Marvel and Disney, apparently.
So what do you do? At first glance, there’s not a whole lot you can do without creating an uncomfortable situation for the interviewers and the interviewees since every question has to be tiptoed around. But maybe that’s just the thing to do. Instead of keeping the cast tucked away and out of the line of firing questions until the movie drops, Disney and Marvel have sent them out, guns blazing, right to the front line for all this questioning. Would fans of the saga want to watch The Avengers refuse to say anything about Endgame , point blank, for ten minutes? The answer is, surprisingly, yes.
The fact that no one can talk about anything related to Endgame has quickly become a running joke.
Want to ask Chris Evans how he feels to finish off his time playing Captain America? You can, but he’s going to sidestep every direct question and eventually dig himself so into a hole he starts talking about his prior film, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World . Want to ask Paul Rudd about the theory that Ant-Man is going to fly up Thanos’ butt to kill him? Fire away, but Paul Rudd’s now going to question the logistics of that happening — can’t Ant-Man go in through the ear instead ? Want to ask Jeremy Renner where he was during Infinity War ? He’s gonna tell you he was playing ping pong . Want to see Chris Hemsworth ride a rollercoaster at Shanghai Disneyland? Well, you’re in luck, because that’s also happened during this press tour, too. Scarlett Johansson went so far as to suggest that this anti-press tour is leaving her with PTSD , but she’s still clearly having a good time .
What could have quickly become a crazy PR nightmare has instead turned into something downright hilarious. The Avengers are using this time to flex their comedy chops and have come up with many different ways to answer just about every question someone could ask them. Want to even ask them about how to prepare for a three-hour movie? Rudd and Renner have an answer for that , but still can't disclose anything about their characters.
For any other movie, this No Comment strategy would be a kiss of death ahead of the film's release. But considering Avengers: Endgame is going to be one of the biggest movies of the year (if not the biggest), fostering positive pre-release talk isn’t a make-or-break situation. There was a rumor that Marvel might not even release any sort of trailers leading up to the film. Even with a trailer or any sort of TV spots, would we all go see the film anyway? You bet.
So the fact that the Avengers are out here now on talk shows and popping up in YouTube videos literally shooting the shit doesn’t matter. They’re having the time of their lives, and that more than anything seems to be creating a huge amount of positive press for the movie.
And considering that Endgame is going to wreck all of us, every single one of us, over the span of three hours, a huge boost of positivity is definitely needed before we all head into maybe the most tragic three hours of our lives. The more ridiculous responses right now, the better."
NFL Releases Week 1 Schedule And U.S. Sportsbooks Add Week 1 Betting Lines,www.forbes.com,Jay Ginsbach,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayginsbach/2019/04/20/nfl-releases-week-1-schedule-and-u-s-sportsbooks-add-week-1-betting-lines/,"The NFL released its 2019 schedule this week, and the 256 game regular season schedule features many key prime time games. That includes in Week 1, as the Packers and Bears open the season on Thursday, Sept. 5 from Soldier Field in Chicago. But the betting buzz always adds more interest as the schedule is announced ahead of next week’s NFL draft. Some U.S. sports books in Nevada and New Jersey start their no-huddle offense with an early release of Week 1 betting lines. The Sunday slate of NFL Week 1 games on Sept. 8 includes three more division duels. Two of those are in the NFC East with the Eagles and Redskins in Philadelphia and the Cowboys battling the NY Giants in Dallas. The Steelers take on the Patriots in Sunday night prime time, and the Monday night double header features the Texans and Saints in New Orleans followed by the AFC West rivalry Broncos and Raiders in Oakland. The Raiders play their final season at the Coliseum before moving to Las Vegas and a new stadium in 2020.
While the schedule and upcoming NFL draft next week keeps NFL fans interested throughout the offseason, it's the now legal U.S. sports betting market that draws plenty of interest and action.
And the NFL Week 1 match-ups with betting lines and totals add to the discussion (home team in CAPS).

FanDuel has been the sportsbook leader in New Jersey, and they dominated the market in March taking in nearly 55% of New Jersey's sports betting revenue fueled by the NCAA basketball tournament. FanDuel is not only taking action on NFL Week 1, but also involved in setting head-to-head player props and other odds to fuel the betting interest and especially of Pittsburgh Steelers fans.
PointsBet in New Jersey announced a minimum bet-to-win amount of $10,000 on game day during the NFL season.
Also, DraftKings has many offers for people in the Garden State, and added interest to the East coast fans around New Jersey with point spreads on all Jets, Giants and Eagles games during the regular season.
In addition to posting odds for every Week 1 NFL game, @DKSportsbook has now posted spreads for all Jets, Giants, and Eagles games from Weeks 1-16: https://t.co/6l9RokGlWw pic.twitter.com/0LNS84JucU
— Covers (@Covers) April 19, 2019
The wagering limits are reduced initially with early released lines, as is similar with the over/under season win totals that were recently released by selected sportsbooks like sportsbetting.ag . The Week 1 betting draws ""mostly sharp money now, a smaller amount of action, mostly from wise guys,"" Westgate SuperBook manager John Murray told Brent Musburger of the Vegas Sports and Information Network (VSiN) Thursday. Wise guys are professional level bettors, and Murray noted that public and recreational bettors get more involved in betting the games closer to the season.
But the NFL discussion and interest is still immense, as media outlets, talk radio and podcast programs now provide more mainstream coverage of the NFL betting lines and gambling news related to the sport in the growing legal U.S. sports betting market. Many sportsbooks are fullfilling the growing media demands, which ""has become a really big part of the job,"" says Murray.
The SuperBook at the Westgate in Las Vegas happens to run the biggest NFL handicapping contest in the U.S., as entrants select five games each week during the regular season against the point spread released each Wednesday by the SuperBook. The contest has grown considerably over the past decade while retaining it's $1,500 entry fee. In 2010, the contest drew 345 entries. In 2016 I was participating with a top 6% finish and 1,727 entries . The top-heavy prize pool structure awarded the winner a first place payout of nearly $900,000. The 2017 contest drew 2,748 entries before last year's 13% increase to a record 3,123 entries as reported by the Vegas Sports and Information Network (VSiN). The top 100 entries receive prize money, and the 2018 champion won $1.4 million .
That type of growth is now fueling the sports betting interest across the U.S., where nine states have passed legislation and currently offer sports betting. With the Betting On Sports America conference next week in New Jersey bringing thousands of industry operators, suppliers, speakers, service providers, regulators, sports clubs and organizations, and media companies and affiliates together, the pass rush and blitz is on to get into the growing game of sports betting in the U.S.
A team-by-team look at the schedule for all 32 NFL teams allows fans to review their teams outlook for the 2019 season with key division match-ups. Bettors, handicappers, analysts and media members look forward to the sportsbooks NFL betting options, and the release of Week 1 lines adds more interest leading into the NFL draft.
More sportsbooks will release NFL lines, futures and division odds, season wins and other player props and betting options in the months ahead. The lines and odds will adjust with market and betting influence leading into the regular season. Week 1 of the 2019 NFL season can't arrive soon enough. But the continued and growing interest in NFL coverage and the booming sports betting business will continue to provide engagement and excitement in the game right up to opening kickoff between the Packers and Bears.
You can bet on it."
Two Wine Pros Weigh In On The State Of Wine Marketing And Sales,www.forbes.com,Thomas Pellechia,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomaspellechia/2019/04/20/two-wine-pros-weigh-in-on-the-state-of-wine-marketing-and-sales/,"Open for wine sales and tasting. Getty Marketing and sales efforts have generally been a grind for small US wineries: to succeed requires money and expertise. The heating up of distributor consolidation over the past decade hasn’t exactly helped many small wineries get their products to consumers, but the digital revolution has facilitated an alternative: direct-to-consumer (DtC) sales.
Still, despite the seeming ease of reaching customers digitally, the principles of marketing and sales may not have changed. Several weeks ago I posed a few marketing and sales questions to two wine professionals, each with a certain perspective.
Paul Mabray (PM) is CEO at Emetry.io . Paul Mabray Courtesy Maybray
He has been stewarding the wine world in e-commerce, social media, and other digital advancements for over two decades. At Emetry, Mabray seeks better answers for the wine industry through big data. Lynda Paulson =Star Dewar Star Shots Photography
Lynda R. Paulson (LP) is CEO at Success Strategies Inc. , a 35-year-old training firm to coach winery executives and owners in public speaking and presentation, and to teach relationship sales skills to wine tasting room personnel. She is the author of “ Romancing the Grape: Relationship Selling for Hospitality Professionals.”
Forbes: What is on each side of the thin line between marketing and sales?
PM:
LP: “Marketing gets them [consumers] there and sales people’s job is to build the reputation that marketing has sold them…plus close the sale.”
Forbes: How should the marketing team interpret past sales and how should the sales team interpret what marketing says about the future?
PM: “Marketing should look at past sales as tea leaves to help create the roadmap for future sales either from analyzing and interpreting the data, or by focusing on the absence of sales/data. The sales team should use that data in exactly the same way.”
LP: “The marketing team can use past sales information to understand needs and wants…what marketing says about the future can influence expectations.”
Forbes: How best should the marketing team apply present sales data?
PM: “…they should understand the success or failure with the sales activity. As such, they use that data to target more customers that behave like past buyers…”
LP: “I haven’t a clue…I would think that they would know just what to do with the sales data.”
Forbes: By sheer force of magnitude it appears easier to apply digital methods to marketing than by telephone or even in focus groups, but is it more reliable?
PM: “Digital is not necessarily more reliable, just differently reliable…the sheer reach, multiplying factor, and feedback loop from digital far out-scales all other tools especially for the price…you need tools and professionals to properly organize and interpret the data. That being said, nothing replaces the qualitative understanding and feedback loop that human-to-human generates.”
LP: “Not necessarily is the digital information more reliable…people change and they can be influenced.”
Forbes: What can make the answers on a digital marketing survey more reliable than the answers from a focus group or by telephone?
PM: “Scale: you can reach so many more people and observe actual behaviors vs. answer/question bias. Behavioral science tells what people do vs. what they think, which is most important in understanding buying propensity.”
LP: ""Out of my depth.""
Forbes: The role demographics plays in a marketing effort is clear, but people of all ages respond to a good (or poor) sales effort; can either a poor or a good sales effort defy the expectations of marketing?
PM: “Demographics rarely speaks to how people actually behave. With few exceptions (average age of having children, career progression, affluence curve, and death), they tell very few stories about how people will act. That being said, sales can defy marketing with good and bad efforts by sheer charisma or force of will.”
LP: “Absolutely! A seasoned relationship sales person can create sales from whole cloth. An inadequate sales person can ruin it no matter how good the marketing demographics say how good the potential is.”
Forbes: In a fickle wine consumer world, where fads come and go and production either lags behind or gets too far ahead, how nimble can digital information be for making quick decisions and how nimble can tracking sales be?
PM: “Digital can’t overcome the anchor of time and land associated with creating wine. That being said, it can more quickly see opportunities or challenges with making sales and be agile at refocusing efforts…”
LP: “Enthusiastic and well trained people can make the difference in the bottom line any day of the week…no matter the bouncing ups and downs of production.”
Forbes: Speaking of fickle consumers, for generations the wine world has known that approximately 95% of all wine is sold to the largest majority of wine consumers. Yet, wine promotion has always seemed to center on appealing to the 5%. This situation has a decided effect on wine pricing. How does either digital marketing or person-to-person sales address this kind of consumer market? Is there a need to “market up” or to “sell up?”
PM: “Both of these play quite well to trading up. Human-to-human gives a person the opportunity to up-sell via story telling, relationships, and enriching it via the Experience Economy . With digital, you are also giving the ability to up-sell via service and storytelling and reach across time and borders…since the cost of shipping is so significant, gratification is not instant, it lends itself to a buyer that is truly interested in making a higher end purchase.”
LP: “I did not realize that wine promotion targeted only 5% of the market. ..know your “level” and train the tasting room team to sell accordingly.”
Forbes: There are hundreds of thousands of wines in the world produced from thousands of different grape varieties, yet the U.S. market consistently ranks Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Merlot, in that order, the top four. Is this situation an opportunity or an albatross?
PM: “Variety branding is both a sad fact of helping meet customer expectations without needing to really understand wine beyond it being a tasty beverage…this does provide an opportunity to capitalize on a niche flavor/story profile from other varieties…Depending on the situation, people are happy to step out of their comfort zone either when risk is reduced (often in small experiments, hence why “by the glass” programs are so essential) or when there is a guide (friend, sommelier, critic, etc)…every single type of product has tremendous diversity...We focus so much on trying to turn a bug (complexity, plethora of choice, changing product nature) into a feature and we too often see the solution as ‘more education.’ The solution is catalyzing more people to enjoy wine with life. But we also have to understand that sometimes even an aficionado just wants a glass of Cabernet, Chardonnay, or even Red or White.”
LP: “I cheer at the idea of getting people out of their comfort zones and into trying new things…If you want to get people to try new stuff you have to make it worth the effort: make them want it, or, at least, want to try it.”
Forbes: What can small wineries do that haven’t the money to either operate their own digital marketing effort or pay for expensive marketing reports?
PM: “The good news is that digital marketing is inexpensive to test and highly measurable compared to other marketing channels. A small winery can do many small tests and fail forward until they find the perfect combination and then spend money to generate reliably predictable sales.”
LP: “Depends on what “inexpensive” is. Some wineries get so stuck in their budgets, they can’t see benefits.”
Forbes: What can small wineries do that haven’t the money to maintain a crack-shot sales team?
PM: “Small wineries should always create a product with a key target audience that behaves in a key way and target them accordingly, including and especially how they treat that customer when they encounter and buy the brand, and beyond.”
LP: “Every one sells (communicates) differently and my book shows the reader how to use their own, unique personality in selling wine, the wine club and even ice boxes to Eskimos.”
Forbes: Tell us what you want us to know about today’s wine marketing and sales landscape.
PM: “ . While there’s no doubt that a live connection is one of the most powerful ways to engage with customers, it’s limiting in scope and nature. The dependency on forcing customers to come and visit a winery is a flawed model. It’s like asking customers to fly to Detroit to test drive a car and then fly home and have it delivered via mail.
“We live in a mixed reality world where digital is interwoven into our society. Whether through search, social, or e-commerce,— all accessible via our smart phone—we use digital throughout the day as a utility to find, connect, buy, and engage with businesses. While I love the experiences that a winery and a tasting room staff can provide, for the industry to be sustainable, we need to learn how to use digital to acquire, engage and retain customers where they live, not where the vineyard exists.”
LP: “Who doesn’t buy on-line? Who doesn’t get their news, social, event info and BFF messages on-line? People google everything before they do any contacting. It is what we do today.
“It follows that people know as much about your winery as you do before they walk through your door. Add this advantage to your selling and relationship skills and you are half way to a new club member.
“While it is true that everybody buys, connects, learns and researches digitally today, there is still something to say about face to face communication..You can have impressive videos and photos of your wine, your vineyards, your winery, your caves, but you can’t get the sensation of tasting, feeling and smelling and having a great conversation.
“Digital marketing makes them want to be there and being there is the next best step to relationship, a new wine fan, and new club member.”

Roav Bolt Brings Google Assistant To Cars for $49.99,www.forbes.com,Larry Magid,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2019/04/20/roav-bolt-brings-google-assistant-to-cars-for-49-99/,"Roav Bolt brings Google Assistant to your car Roav Bolt webpage In January, 2018 I reviewed the Roav Viva, which brings Amazon Alexa to cars. Now there is a Google Assistant version called the Roav Bolt which, for Spotify users or some folks with older cars, works even better.
The device plugs into a car's power (cigarette lighter) port and also gives you two USB charging ports. It has a very sensitive noise canceling microphone that does a much better job than most smart phones when it comes to picking up your voice in a moving car. I was pleasantly surprised that it works in my Tesla Model 3 whose power port is inside the center console, yet it picks up my voice even with the console closed.
The Roav Bolt works through your smartphone (iOS and Android) which must be turned on. You may have to go into the Google app to enable the Roav Bolt the first time you use it, but that's quick and easy. Once installed, you won't need to touch or look at your phone to play music, listen to news and podcasts, check your Google Calendar, have Google Assistant answer questions or set your destination in Google Maps. You can even ask it for your ETA.
It's especially handy for navigation because it it's totally hands-free. Unlike Google Maps native interface, it will automatically change your destination if you ask it to without your having to do anything to confirm the change. That's huge safety advantage.
The Bold can connect via Bluetooth but it also has a standard audio jack for older cars that don't have Bluetooth but do have auxillary in. I was only able to test the Bluetooth on the Model 3.
I've used both the Roav Viva for Alexa and the Roav Bolt for Google Assistant but both work very well. As a Spotify user I prefer the Bolt as will anyone who has an older car that lacks Bluetooth but does have auxiliary input.
In terms of audio, the Roav Bolt supports Spotify as well as Pandora, Google Play Music, Tune-In, iHeart Radio and YouTube Music. For some reason, you can't play Spotify on the Alexa version of the Roav.

We Are Voluntarily Surrendering The Data We Long Fought To Protect,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/20/we-are-voluntarily-surrendering-the-data-we-long-fought-to-protect/,"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the modern privacy story is the way in which we have voluntarily surrendered all of the rights and protections we fought so long and so hard to achieve. In the space of just two decades, we have torn down most of the privacy rights we spent centuries to build and today voluntarily hand over to private companies the most intimate details of our lives that we fought so hard to shield from commercial and governmental hands. Making matters even worse, we are not only handing all of our data over to private companies, we are granting them unlimited perpetual rights to do anything and everything they please with it, monetizing our most intimate information down to our genetic code. Is privacy truly just a quaint artifact of a bygone era? Genetic data has become the latest frontier in the data privacy debate. Once viewed as one of the most precious and protected aspects of ourselves, the rise of consumer genetic testing companies has rendered our literal genetic code just one more mundane piece of information we are only too happy to hand over to private companies to do with what they want.
From ancestry determination to medical insights, we freely sign away the rights to the blueprint of ourselves to profit-driven companies. In fact, unlike the barter system of the web in which we are “paid” for our personal information through free services, the genetic testing world forces us to pay for the privilege of handing over our genetic data.
Ironically, for all of society’s efforts to shield their genetic data from government intrusion, the private companies we hand our genetic information over to are under no constraints from handing that information right over to the government.
In the US, the police cannot force an entire city’s residents to line up and load millions of DNA samples into government surveillance databases. However, more and more those millions of residents are freely paying private companies to accept their DNA samples, which those companies can then turn directly over to the government or sell subscription access to.
Much as the social revolution has upended the cost model of behavioral and interest surveillance, so too has genetic testing shifted the financial burden of mass genetic surveillance. Governments once spent fortunes surveilling their citizens. Today’s populations freely purchase the smartphones and data plans necessary to observe their every waking moment and happily livestream their every thought for governments to evaluate. In similar fashion, today we pay genetic companies to index our DNA, who in turn are free to make that data available to governments.
It isn’t just genetic data. We pay vast fortunes to instrument every aspect of our lives, from fitness and wellness monitors strapped to our bodies to various medical sensors in our homes to “smart” appliances and devices that monitor us even while we sleep.
All of this data is freely surrendered to commercial enterprises to do with what they wish.
The vast data broker industry reminds us how much our personal data is worth. According to the Wall Street Journal, data broker Epsilon earned more than two billion dollars in revenue last year alone from the monetization of our personal data.
Putting this all together, it is a sad irony that the privacy protections and data rights that took centuries for societies to build up have been cast aside so swiftly in just two decades as consumers rush to hand over their most intimate data, all the way up to their very genetic code, to private companies to mine and monetize.
In the end, all it took to end privacy were a few companies to force society to make a decision between privacy and fun free services, a few lines added to their terms of use granting them unlimited rights to monetize our personal information and a collective societal apathy.
As Mark Zuckerberg taught us, the first major repeal of our privacy rights will always cause an uproar, but if a company stands its ground , eventually society will simply accept the inevitable ."
Ferrari's Vettel Becomes F1's Biggest Prize Money Winner With $500 Million Haul,www.forbes.com,Christian Sylt,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2019/04/20/ferraris-vettel-becomes-f1s-biggest-prize-money-winner-with-500-million-haul/,"Ferrari superstar Sebastian Vettel has earned more prize money for his teams than any other driver currently racing in Formula One according to new research. Formula One’s annual prize money payout is public knowledge and came to $913 million last year. Although F1 doesn’t disclose how much is received by each team, the formula for calculating it has been reported. However, it has never come to light how much each driver was responsible for earning. Until now.
The core prize money is equivalent to 47.5% of F1’s underlying profit. It is then divided into two with one half split between the top ten teams in the championship on a sliding scale based on race results. The other half is split evenly but is still driven by race performance as it only goes to teams which have finished in the top ten in two out of the past three years. That is just the start of the story.
In 2013 we revealed for sports broadcaster ESPN that a further 7.5% of F1’s underlying profit is handed to the top three teams based on the number of races won in the four seasons prior to 2012, which is when this benefit was first introduced. This bonus pot is known as the Constructors’ Championship Bonus (CCB) fund and it comes to at least $100 million annually.
It is guaranteed regardless of the teams’ race results and is split between Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull Racing which leads the CCB pack. This gives it a minimum of $37 million from the CCB fund with McLaren getting at least $33 million for being ranked second and $30 million going to Ferrari. It doesn’t stop there.
Ferrari also gets its own dedicated prize money pay-out as well as sharing in the 47.5% and the CCB Fund. The dedicated prize pot gives Ferrari 5% of F1’s underlying profit which comes to at least $62.2 million annually. Like the CCB fund, this is paid regardless of Ferrari’s race results and it comes in return for the Italian squad being F1’s longest-standing team having been racing in the championship since it was launched in 1950.
In summary, only the core prize money payment relates the teams’ race performance. It is based on their position in the previous year’s standings which depends on the number of points they scored. In turn, each team’s tally of points is calculated by adding up the number scored by both of its drivers.
To work out who are the best performers you first need to establish the percentage of the team’s points scored by each of its drivers. Accordingly, the ranking isn’t just fueled by the success of the team but also a driver’s dominance over his team mate. The more successful the team is, the more points it scores. Likewise, the more dominant the driver is, the greater the percentage of these points he scores for the team.
Career length is also a key factor as the longer a driver has been racing, the more time he has had to score points and therefore to earn prize money for his teams. As the table below shows, Vettel is in pole position with $511.9 million and there is good reason for this.
Sebastian Vettel has earned more prize money for his teams than Lewis Hamilton even though he has won fewer championships
sponsors.formulamoney.com The German driver joined F1 in 2007 giving him the joint second-longest career of any of the current drivers. He ties with Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton who trails Vettel by just $62.3 million. Hamilton has won five titles compared to Vettel’s total of four but the driving force behind his lower prize money haul is the result of the 2007 season.
In 2007 Hamilton raced for the McLaren team which was controversially excluded from the standings for spying on Ferrari. McLaren earned no prize money as its points were cancelled and if this hadn’t happened it would have compensated for the bulk of the difference between Hamilton and Vettel. That’s not all though.
Hamilton has been beaten in the standings by his team mate twice. The first time came in 2011 when Britain’s Jenson Button was driving with Hamilton at McLaren and the next was in 2016 when Nico Rosberg beat him to the title at the season-ender. In contrast, Vettel only ended the season behind his main team mate once when he was driving with Australia’s Daniel Ricciardo at Red Bull Racing in 2014.
Vettel’s dominance is highlighted through the fact that he has scored a higher percentage of the points for his teams than Hamilton. There isn’t much in it but Vettel still comes out ahead as he has scored 56.8% of the points for his teams compared to the 53.8% that have been won by Hamilton.
Vettel’s dominance peaked in 2008 when he drove for the Toro Rosso team and won his first F1 race. Vettel scored 89.7% of the team’s points in that year whereas Hamilton’s highest has been 69% which he won for McLaren in 2009. Those tallies have reversed over time as both drivers have been paired with more competitive team mates.
Vettel was responsible for an estimated $49.7 million of the $81.8 million performance-based prize money paid to Ferrari last year as he scored 60.7% of its points in 2017. In contrast, Hamilton was only responsible for $46.8 million of the $86.1 million paid to Mercedes as he scored 54.3% of its points.
The value of experience is seen in the performance of Germany’s Nico Hulkenberg who is the highest-ranked non championship-winning driver. Hulkenberg has been driving in F1 since 2010 and, crucially, often does well against his team mates.
However, longevity needs to be paired with continuity to boost a driver’s chances of having a high-octane prize money haul. Finland’s Kimi Raikkonen has the longest career of any of the current F1 drivers as he first raced in 2001. However, he took a two-year sabbatical from 2010 which dented the total of prize money he has won.
Raikkonen currently drives for Swiss minnows Sauber so he still has a chance to claim the top spot in the prize money standings but is also competing with drivers who haven’t scored a Cent yet. The drivers who joined last year don’t appear on the list as although their results are known, F1 hasn’t yet confirmed how much prize money they earned. Likewise, this year’s championship only began last month so the race to become F1’s most bankable driver is far from over.

4 Tech Stocks Not Keeping Up With The NASDAQ Composite -- and 1 That Is,www.forbes.com,John Navin,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnavin/2019/04/20/4-tech-stocks-not-keeping-up-with-the-nasdaq-composite-and-1-that-is/,"That the NASDAQ Composite index is about to touch the previous all-time highs (hit in the summer of 2018) is making the business and investment media news headlines -- but it's definitely different this time. A few of the most well-known names in the tech and internet-related sectors are not quite keeping up. Stocks that used to lead the NASDAQ higher are no longer doing so. Names that used to dot the ""new highs"" list without fail under these circumstances are not making the grade this time around.
Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Netflix are still falling short of last summer's higher levels. Let's take a look at the evidence.
Here's Facebook's weekly price chart:
Facebook weekly price chart
stockcharts.com The July, 2018 high was up there near 220. Today the price is 178. This, despite the NASDAQ as a whole now regaining those summertime highs. You can see that the Facebook price remains within the down trending Ichimoku cloud -- even with the spectacular rally off of the Christmas Eve, 2018 lows. This is odd behavior for such a former giant of the index.
Her's the weekly price chart of Amazon:
Amazon weekly price chart.
stockcharts.com The summertime, 2018 high was up there near 2050. Today's price is 1861. As with Facebook, it's just not making it up to the previous all time high level. More positively, it looks as if the stock never closed below the Ichimoku cloud on a weekly basis -- and has now closed above the cloud for at least 3 weeks in a row.
Here's the Apple weekly price chart:
Apple weekly price chart.
stockcharts.com Another strong recovery off of the late December, 2018 low prices, but the stock is clearly unable to hit higher all time highs here as the NASDAQ Composite index is about to get there. That Apple closed below the Ichimoku cloud for several weeks is a technical analysis problem. The same could be said for its failure, so far, to rise back above the cloud.
And here's the Netflix weekly chart:
Netflix weekly price chart.
stockcharts.com Same basic pattern: the previous peak last summer is much higher than today's price.
To demonstrate the difference, here's the weekly chart for one NASDAQ stock that's actually come back stronger than the index:
Microsoft weekly price chart.
stockcharts.com For whatever fundamental reasons, Microsoft just keeps outpacing -- by far -- these 4 other big NASDAQ tech stocks. The September/October previous peak was 115. Today the price is above that at 127. The stock never closed below the Ichimoku cloud level. It's well above the cloud right now. The Microsoft upward trend from 2015 to the present day is an extraordinary move by any measure.
The Bill Gates operation is performing better than the NASDAQ taken as whole. Here's the $COMPQ chart:
NASDAQ Composite index weekly price chart.
stockcharts.com This difference is even clearer on the $QQQ and $XLK price charts, but I'll let you look them up on your own.
I do not hold positions in these investments. No recommendations are made one way or the other. If you're an investor, you'd want to look much deeper into each of these situations. You can lose money trading or investing in stocks and other instruments. Always do your own independent research, due diligence and seek professional advice from a licensed investment advisor."

Moët & Chandon Announces Newest Champagne Release: Grand Vintage 2012,www.forbes.com,Brad Japhe,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradjaphe/2019/04/20/moët-chandon-announces-newest-champagne-release-grand-vintage-2012/,"In 1842, champagne house Moët & Chandon debuted its first 'vintage' release, expressing the characteristics of a single year's grape harvest. The move was unprecedented back then. And even today the overwhelming majority of sparkling wine on the market blends together grapes grown and matured over a range of years. This is how a producer is able to insure consistency from one bottle to the next. But with Moët's Grand Vintage Collection , cellar master Benoît Gouez is awarded the freedom to unfurl a liquid that stands apart, by design. This spring, it arrives in the form of Grand Vintage 2012 --only the 74th such release in the brand's 276-year history. Grand Vintages are reserved for grape harvests which stand out as exceptional. Looking back on the conditions facing French vineyards at the time, 2012 seemed like an unlikely candidate. There was late frost, hailstorms and cold spells throughout the spring, followed by extreme heat and water shortages in the summer. It wasn't until the end of August when the vintage's true potential emerged. Hot, dry weather lessened the yield, but the grapes that survived possessed an ideal balance between sweetness and acidity. The marks for both were higher than the 10-year average, closer to numbers from 1966, 1989, and 2002--each a vintage of renowned distinction.
Typically, Chardonnay grapes dominate a champagne's varietal recipe, known as an assemblage. For the Grand Vintage 2012 Pinot Noir and Meunier did the heavy lifting, combining to form 59% of its body. “The wines made from black grapes, especially the usually fragile Meunier, were particularly good in 2012,"" explains Gouez. ""This explains why they make up an important part of the assemblage.”
The wine matured in Moët's massive cellars underneath Épernay, France for no less than five years. Bottles were then disgorged, with a dosage of 5 grams of sugar per liter added, before an additional 6 months of aging. It pours a pale, straw yellow, wafting aromas of peach and pear. Light and limber on the tongue, a lasting acidity eventually lends structure to a liquid that never overplays its sweetness. In fact, there is an interesting nuttiness throughout. “This Grand Vintage is a softly fresh and harmonious wine that reveals itself slowly but with supple assurance,"" says Gouez, before waxing poetic. ""It's like the gentle transition of spring into summer and envelops the palate, blossoming into a crisp yet balanced bouquet.”
Across the globe consumers pop the cork on just over $5bn worth of champagne, annually. Moët accounts for approximately a quarter of those sales, producing an estimated 28,000,000 per year--well more than any of its competitors. Still, the brand is working to maintain that foothold by courting a millennial audience. Ice Imperial is a prime example. Unveiled in 2010, it's a direct appeal to the 20-something demographic. Intended to be served on the rocks, it has become a staple at nightclubs and music festivals.
The Grand Vintage Collection skews towards the more seasoned drinker. It's the sort of drink to savor in good company, because you don't know if you'll ever taste anything quite like it ever again. And that's the point. The 2012 edition is on shelves now--retailing at $74.99 per bottle-- alongside a Rosé variation at $84.99.

"Gio Gonzalez Can't Replace An Ace, But He Could Be The Answer As The Mets' Fifth Starter",www.forbes.com,Jerry Beach,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerrybeach/2019/04/20/gio-gonzalez-cant-replace-an-ace-but-he-could-be-the-answer-as-the-mets-fifth-starter/,"The Mets could probably still use Gio Gonzalez to replace Jason Vargas. But maybe they won’t need Gonzalez to take the spot of Jacob deGrom. An eventful-even-by-the-Mets-standards day ended with a win Friday night, when Vargas made incremental improvement in a four-inning start before the Mets’ adventurous bullpen barely preserved a 5-4 victory over the Cardinals.
Vargas allowed six baserunners and about 800 feet worth of flyouts to Marcell Ozuna but exited having allowed just one run. The effort lowered his ERA from 14.21 to 9.58 and provided the Mets hope, at least publicly, that he could begin to resemble a decent fifth starter.
The problem for Vargas is Gonzalez might be available as soon as today and would be an even more decent fifth starter. Gonzalez, one of the many low-cost free agents the Mets chose not to sign as Vargas insurance this winter, can opt out of his minor league deal with the Yankees today. If Gonzalez opts out, the Yankees must either add him to their major league roster or release him within 48 hours.
Given that their rotation is perhaps the only area in which the Yankees aren’t suffering a never-ending Mets-like spate of injuries — Luis Severino is out indefinitely, but old warhorse CC Sabathia is 2-0 and hasn’t allowed an earned run in 10 innings this season and youngster Domingo German has allowed just 16 baserunners and struck out 23 over four appearances, including three starts — and the fact Gonzalez has made 297 consecutive starts since his most recent relief appearance, there’s a good chance Gonzalez hits the open market.
The news Friday that Gonzalez switched agencies — from Scott Boras to CAA — is another indication the 33-year-old left-hander is preparing to land with a new organization. There are, of course, 28 other teams Gonzalez could sign with, but it can’t hurt the Mets’ chances that he left Boras, with whom the Mets have a contentious history, for CAA, which is the agency that new general manager Brodie Van Wagenen used to run.
Gonzalez is 2-1 with a 6.00 ERA in three starts with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the Yankees’ Triple-A affiliate. But he has 19 strikeouts in 15 innings and the ERA is inflated by a rough debut in which he gave up eight runs in four innings. His scheduled start for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre last night was rained out.
Gonzalez’s peripherals took a big drop last season — he allowed an average of 8.8 hits per nine innings, up nearly two hits from 2017, while issuing 4.2 walks per nine innings, his most since 2010, and striking out 7.8 batters per nine innings, his fewest since 2011 — but even a diminished version of the former 20-game winner would almost surely be an upgrade over Vargas, whose 6.16 ERA since the start of last season is the highest among pitchers who have made at least 20 starts.
Gonzalez also offers a track record of durability that Vargas can’t match. Last season marked the ninth straight season in which Gonzalez made at least 27 starts, a streak bettered only by Rick Porcello and Max Scherzer (10 straight) and Jon Lester (11 straight). Gonzalez also tossed at least 90 pitches in 21 of 32 starts last year and had another six starts in which he threw 88 or 89 pitches. Vargas has thrown at least 90 pitches just five times in 24 starts with the Mets.
In addition, Gonzalez has thrived at Citi Field, where he tossed a one-hit complete game in 2013 and has a 1.75 ERA in 17 starts. Of course, if he lands with the Mets, we’ll find out if Gonzalez succeeds at Citi Field because he really likes the park, or because he was pitching to the Mets.
A better fifth starter has become increasingly vital to the Mets given the struggles of the rest of the more reliable members of the rotation. Noah Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler each have ERAs north of 5.00. Steven Matz does not, but his ERA shot up from 1.65 to 4.96 after he became the fifth starting pitcher to ever allow eight runs without recording an out on Wednesday night.
The biggest worry for the Mets is their lynchpin. DeGrom, who won the NL Cy Young Award last season and opened this season with 13 straight scoreless innings before allowing nine runs over nine innings in his next two starts and then coming down with strep throat, hit the injured list yesterday after his elbow began “barking,” in the word of manager Mickey Callaway, during a game of catch Thursday.
The Mets sounded optimistic later in the afternoon, when Van Wagenen released a statement saying the soreness was “mild” and that he felt “significantly better” after receiving treatment. Callaway said after the game that deGrom was “…in a good frame of mind right now” and the decision to place him on the IL was made because he couldn’t pitch until Wednesday at the earliest.
Callaway hopes deGrom can return from the IL and pitch next Friday. He’d better hope so, because while Gonzalez would be a fine replacement for Vargas, there’s no replacing deGrom."

32 Dividend Stocks That Could Double Your Money,www.forbes.com,Brett Owens,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2019/04/20/32-dividend-stocks-that-could-double-your-money/,"Growth or yield? Why choose when we can have both . There are 32 dividend hikes on the way that are going to set up their investors for a big 12 months ahead. How? Simple–these payout raises are going to provide fuel to their attached share prices. The 10%+ raises (and there will be double-digit increases) in particular are going to position their shareholders for safe 10% to 12% returns in the year ahead regardless of what the broader stock market does .
Ever wonder why the yield on your favorite dividend aristocrat always looks low even though the firm is regularly raising that payout? Pull up its stock chart and you’ll see that its share price follows its dividend higher like a magnet. For example let’s consider this pair of “dividend doublers”.
Their soaring payouts and profits are about all they have in common. Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) is a mid-level steak restaurant chain that caters to the average American. Vail Resorts (MTN) is a “one percenter” stock that owns and operates high-end ski resorts, condos and lodgings. But both have raised their payouts generously every year, and both their stocks have more than doubled in less than five years.
This is why we keep a close eye on serial dividend raisers. Yield is nice, but doubling our money is even better! In this spirit here are 32 dividend growers to watch in upcoming months.
REITs
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have no equal in retirement-focused accounts . Their very structure requires them to deliver the lion’s share of their taxable income to investors as dividends. If you’re an income investor, you need to be watching this sector like a hawk (if you aren’t already).
REITs have a couple “busy seasons” for dividend-increase announcements, including February and December. But the next couple months should see a decent handful of real estate plays hike their regular dividends.
Contrarian Outlook
Contrarian Outlook Dividend Spotlight: CoreSite Realty (COR): CoreSite is a datacenter REIT with 21 operation centers across eight major communications markets in the U.S. That doesn’t sound like CoreSite is casting a wide net, but each of those locations packs a serious punch, allowing the company to service more than 1,350 customers.
CoreSite’s path over the past half-year or so is similar to the rest of the market’s, swooning at the end of 2018 only to rebound through the first few months of 2019. But COR is doing it better, up 27% to soar above both the S&P 500 (+16%) and the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ, +18%) .
Credit CoreSite’s outstanding operations. The company reported a 20.7% improvement in net income that fueled a 14.2% boom in funds from operations (FFO, an important REIT profitability metric). CoreSite paid out 15.6% more in dividends, too, but FFO growth kept the payout ratio at a perfectly manageable 82%.
Up next is a likely dividend-increase declaration in the final week of May. And if history is any indication, look for another hike to be announced in early December.
MLPs
The last time I guided you through some likely dividend raisers , I pointed out many master limited partnerships (MLPs) that improve their distributions on a quarterly basis – not once a year, but four times a year . So the list of companies on tap for April and May are pretty similar, but a couple things have changed in the space since then.
For one, Western Gas Equity Partners LP and Western Gas Partners LP have combined to become Western Midstream Partners LP (WES) . This follows a slew of mergers in the MLP industry following 2018’s changes to the tax law.
Also, Andeavor Logistics LP (ANDX) announced the same distribution it had for the prior two quarters, so its quarterly hikes appear to be a thing of the past.
Contrarian Outlook
Contrarian Outlook Dividend Spotlight: Delek Logistics Partners LP (DKL): I wouldn’t be surprised if this is the first time you’ve read about small-cap Delek Logistics Partners LP. This roughly $815 million MLP was formed by Delek US Holdings (DK) just a few years ago to hold various energy assets.
For instance, its Pipelines/Transportation segment includes roughly 805 miles of crude and product transportation pipelines, a 600-mile crude oil gathering system in Arkansas, and storage facilities with 10 million barrels of active shell capacity. It also has light product terminals in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas.
That business description won’t make your heart skip a beat. But let’s look at a few of its 2018 financial highlights: Net revenues grew 22.2% year-over-year to $657.6 million. Net income grew 30.0% YoY to $90.2 million. Distributable cash flow (DCF, similar to free cash flow and an important metric for determining the health of the distribution) jumped 43% YoY to $121.6 million. DCF coverage ratio of the distribution was 1.19x. (In other words, its DCF was 119% of what it needed to cover its regular payout.) Fourth-quarter distribution grew 11.7% YoY to 81 cents per share. That payout didn’t grow in a straight line, of course. DKL has been growing its distributions every single quarter for years, which is fantastic for investors because it only adds to the power of compounding.
Aristocrats
The Dividend Aristocrats are a group of 57 S&P 500 companies that have increased their dividends on an annual basis for at least 25 consecutive years, though many of them have done so for many years longer than that.
But they’re not all gems. I’ve recently pointed out a few Dividend Aristocrats that aren’t worth your time . Their business prospects are middling, and dividend growth has become downright begrudging, as if the only reason they’re raising them isn’t to reward shareholders, but instead to just keep their membership cards updated.
Contrarian Outlook
Contrarian Outlook Dividend Spotlight: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Johnson & Johnson is one such Aristocrat laggard. The company is in the midst of serious legal issues related to one of its most famous consumer products.
As I pointed out at the start of the year :
J&J spent 2018 in court battling off cases related to claims that their baby powder contained asbestos and caused mesothelioma to a few people who were exposed to it. “We will continue to defend the safety of our product because it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma,” the company said in May after losing a ruling in California.
But Reuters dropped a bombshell report in December saying that internal documents “show that the company’s powder was sometimes tainted with carcinogenic asbestos and that J&J kept that information from regulators and the public” for decades. JNJ tanked 13% in five trading days following Reuters’ report, and that very likely won’t be the last of it. Johnson & Johnson not only risks suffering a massive reputational hit to its consumer brands, but its legal path forward suddenly looks fraught with potholes.
These issues threaten to put a cap on Johnson & Johnson in the near-term. In turn, that could put some pressure on the company to please shareholders in any way it can – including writing significantly fatter dividend checks. Payout growth has been respectable, at about 28% since early 2015, but J&J might need to deliver something truly generous in mid-April, when it typically announces its annual dividend increase.
The Best of the Rest
There are still dozens more likely dividend increases coming in the next two months. But these are a few of the most intriguing companies, whether it’s because they’re at a pivot point, running hot or just not your run-of-the-mill company.
But the most interesting of the bunch right now is America’s largest company.
Contrarian Outlook
Contrarian Outlook Dividend Spotlight: Apple (AAPL): Apple has been through this before. Back in 2015 and 2016, Wall Street was concerned that Apple had lost its innovative edge, that its product was to expensive for China, and that its other offerings would never make up for any weakness in iPhone sales.
Within a few years, it had doubled its market cap from a trench around $500 billion to a high above $1 trillion, making it the first American company to reach that lofty level.
Apple has found itself in the same position again recently, however. The stock lost about a third of its value on iPhone sales declines (caused in part by Chinese weakness!) and skepticism about its lack of other game-changing devices.
And yet, AAPL shares have defied logic by rebounding 40% off a big share dip after the company made a rare cut to its sales guidance on Jan. 2. What gives? Well, Morgan Stanley analysts recently said year-over-year growth to the iPhone “installed base” in China was its best in 15 months, and the tech giant has announced a series of product upgrades and new services, including Apple News+, streaming TV content and even an Apple credit card.
Don’t sleep on the dividend, though. Apple’s payout has nearly doubled since it restarted regular distributions in mid-2012. And considering a skinflint 23% payout ratio and renowned ability to generate free cash, Apple can afford to continue making significant hikes – even as it finds ways to grow and silence the haters."
It's A Mirakl! You Can Have Your Own Amazon-Style Website Thanks To This Global Company.,www.forbes.com,Daniel D'Ambrosio,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldambrosio/2019/04/20/its-a-mirakl-you-can-have-your-own-amazon-style-website-thanks-to-this-global-company/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Entrepreneurs I write about entrepreneurship and intriguing startups in New England. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin If it’s good enough for Amazon, it’s good enough for Walmart, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters and more than 200 other companies, says Adrien Nussenbaum, CEO of Mirakl, a global firm with dual headquarters in Boston and Paris, plus offices in London, Munich, Barcelona, Stockholm and Sao Paulo. Mirakl co-founders Adrien Nussenbaum, right, and Philippe Corrot. Courtesy Mirakl
Mirakl allows its clients to adopt the same marketplace platform that transformed Amazon from a bookseller into a seller of, well, nearly everything.
“What Amazon is doing is not rocket science,” Nussenbaum said in a recent interview from Mirakl’s Boston office. “I think Amazon has been able to take a fresher look at retail and the consumer experience and that has freed them from some of the blockers that incumbent retailers have.”
Key to Amazon’s success is an online marketplace of third party sellers – obvious to anyone who has been on the Amazon website. Mirakl brings that same capability to its clients, according to Nussenbaum.
“Simply put, Mirakl provides the technology and the partner ecosystem to launch an ecommerce market place,” he explains.
Take Best Buy Canada, for example. The company has stores across Canada and a website.
“They decided to find a way to quickly expand the product selection on their website and provide more choice and opportunity for customers,” Nussenbaum said. Best Buy uses Mirakl technology on its website to include third-party sellers. Courtesy Mirakl.
To do that, Best Buy Canada turned to Mirakl technology, which allowed them to quickly partner with hundreds of third party sellers. Best Buy Canada was an “insignificant” player in baby products, Nussenbaum says. Through Mirakl, the company added thousands of baby products to its website through selected third party sellers, and within a year has become Canada’s number 1 seller of baby products online.
“That was very exciting to them,” Nussenbaum said. “It allowed them to very rapidly learn about this new category, and ultimately identify two products they could also offer in their stores.”
J. Crew is another Mirakl client. It decided that on top of selling its own clothing label online, J. Crew customers would appreciate being able to buy “adjacent” products, like accessories and jewelry.
“Using Mirakl’s marketplace platform, J. Crew started partnering with hundreds of more niche brands, and now offers a selection of very nice items from emerging brands who are very interested in the opportunity,” Nussenbaum said. “J. Crew gives them the opportunity to surface their products on its website, which has a lot of traffic.”
Mirakl’s software takes care of all the complexities of a marketplace operation, Nussenbaum said, making it easy for partners to on-board their products.
“J. Crew may have very specific expectations about how products are described and categorized,” he said. “Mirakl ensures sellers provide content exactly as J. Crew wants it.”
Mirakl also takes care of order management when a customer buys multiple products on the Best Buy website coming from multiple sources, including Best Buy.
“Mirakl provides all the order management capacity in the background to direct the order to the right seller and make sure the customer never sees that,” Nussenbaum said. “The customer only cares about getting the product in due time.”
And finally, Mirakl provides quality control, automatically surveying and supervising the performance of third-party sellers to make sure they ship within 24 hours, and tracking any customer dissatisfaction with their products. So does J. Crew. Courtesy Mirakl.
Nussenbaum, who is French, launched Mirakl seven years ago in Paris with co-founder Philippe Corrot. Corrot remains in Paris, but Nussenbaum is in Boston.
“I’m an adopted New Englander now,” Nussenbaum says.
At the end of February, Mirakl announced it had raised $70 million, led by Bain Capital Ventures, bringing total capital raised to $100 million. In 2018, Mirakl said it had added 60 new customers and launched a record 37 marketplaces, achieving year-over-year revenue growth of 80 percent.
Until this latest $70 million capital raise, Nussenbaum said he and his partner owned a majority of the company.
“Now my partner and I are still very much active in the company and on the board,” Nussenbaum said. “We retain significant ownership of the company, but we have more financial partners supporting our vision.”
And now for the obvious question. Has he gotten a call from Jeff Bezos?
“I have not gotten any calls from Jeff Bezos, but he is definitely influencing the way companies think about selling,” Nussenbaum answers. “I’m sure that people at Amazon know of Mirakl. It’s true that we see ourselves as providing a very powerful instrument that helps businesses compete and survive in an Amazon age.”

De-stress During National Stress Awareness Month With These Five-Minute Micro Chillers,www.forbes.com,Bryan Robinson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2019/04/20/de-stress-during-national-stress-awareness-month-with-these-five-minute-micro-chillers/,"Up to your eyeballs in work? Not enough hours in the day? Can’t seem to get everything done? If you’re like most people, surviving daily job stress can negatively affect your peace of mind, creativity and productivity. Achieving career success and happiness depends on having proper balance between your job and personal time. In today’s hectic work world, where you must do more in less time and with fewer resources, your career goals can seem impossible to attain. As 21st Century technology moves at lightning speed, job pressures and demands can make it difficult for you to keep up the breakneck pace. Many workers—perhaps you’re one of them—have lost the ability to relax and balance their lives. Five Minutes Of Chill Per Day
April is National Stress Awareness Month. What if you took five minutes a day to celebrate this important occasion? Studies show that just five minutes of chill a day has mental and physical benefits—keeping you centered, calm and clear minded. And you have better sleep, increased immunity, lower blood pressure, improved digestion and increased emotional wellbeing. There are 1,440 minutes in a day. Five minutes of chill still leaves you 1,435 minutes to prepare for your presentation, meet a deadline or return emails in a calmer, more enjoyable and productive way.
10 Micro Chillers To Celebrate Stress Awareness Month
Here are 10 ways you can take time out to celebrate National Stress Awareness. These micro chillers take the mystery out of finding balance between job pressures and deadlines and maintaining a sane, productive life without stress.
1. Remember H-A-L-T. When stress takes hold, stop and ask yourself if you are H ungry, A ngry, L onely, or T ired. When stress overtakes you and pulls you out of your job, this alert signal can bring you back into balance. If one or a combination of the four states is present, slow down, take a few breaths and chill. If you’re hungry, take the time to eat. If you’re angry, address it in a healthy manner. If you’re lonely, reach out to someone you trust. And if you’re tired, rest.
2. Breathe from your abdomen . Right under your nose is a valuable antidote to job stress. When stress steals your breath, take a few deep abdominal breaths through your nose. Hold it while you count to six. Then purse your lips and exhale slowly through them. Your body can’t maintain the same level of stress with the extra oxygen you get in your bloodstream when you breathe from your abdomen.
3. Don’t “musterbate!” Remove words like must, should , ought and have to from your self-talk. These self-imposed “rules” can feel oppressive and lead to pressure, frustration and anxiety. Replace these oppressive words with more empowering and compassionate language like “I can” or “I want to” or “I plan to.”
4. List your “tallcomings .” Your relentless faultfinder—everybody has one—is too quick to judge you, minimize your accomplishments, or demote you to an underdog. When your inner critic lashes you for your shortcomings, give yourself the gift of a more balanced view of your capabilities. Throw modesty out the window, and make a list of your accomplishments, what you’re good at and the skills and talents you possess.
5. Make a to-be list alongside your to-do list. The compulsion for constant doing defends you from feeling unpleasant emotions and gives you safety and security even if the task itself is satisfying. When you commit to a less stressful life, you notice you can just be without requiring yourself to constantly do . Watch a sunset or a bird build its nest, listen to nature sounds around you or feel a breeze against your face. These activities recharge your batteries and contribute to job success.
6. Use WAIT to act instead of react. When you find yourself brimming with impatience at others’ seeming dragging-of-the-feet, use the acronym WAIT to chill. W atch what’s going on within when you’re triggered by stress. A ccept the stressor by saying you’re choosing to wait. I nvite the inner reaction to relax by offering compassionate words. T ell your inner reaction, “We’ve got this.” You will notice your heart rate drop, breathing slow and muscles relax.
7. Stack your positivity deck. An un-chilled mind will unwittingly constrict your career potential. When your focus is narrow, you build up negativity—which eclipses career possibilities—without realizing it. Keep a broad perspective that allows you to build on the many positive things in your career. Avoid blowing disappointments out of proportion; look for the upside of a downside situation; underscore positive feedback instead of letting it roll over your head; focus on the solution instead of the problem; pinpoint the opportunity in a challenge; refuse to let one bad outcome rule your future outlook; take chances instead of letting your survival fears hold the cards.
8. Amp up your self-care . Always putting yourself at the end of the line is a grave disservice that actually works against you. Self-care makes your use of time more sustainable. Healthy eating, rest and regular exercise give you the stamina to withstand any challenge your fast paced job throws at you. Take good care of yourself first, and you have more to give to your job and to your career goals. When was the last time you soaked in a hot bath or indulged in a restorative activity that rejuvenates your mind and body and restores your success juices? Make a ten or fifteen minute appointment with yourself, and schedule personal time—a hobby, hot bath, manicure, yoga, facial, reading, a sport or massage.
9. Meditate. Sit in a comfortable place with eyes closed. Breathing in through your nose and out through the mouth, focus on each inhalation and exhalation. Follow your breath through to a full cycle from the beginning when the lungs are full back down to when they’re empty. Then start over again. As you stay with this cycle, mindfully watching your breath, thoughts arise in the form of judgment: wondering if you’re doing it right, thinking about tasks you have to do later, debating if it’s worth your time. Don’t try to get rid of the thoughts. Allow them to arise and accept whatever arises with openheartedness, bringing your attention gently back and focusing on the breath. Each time your attention strays from the breath (and it will), bring your awareness back to it. There’s nowhere else to be, nothing else to do but notice your breath. If your mind gets caught in a chain of thoughts, gently step out of the thought stream and come back to the sensations of your breath. After five minutes or more, open your eyes and notice how much more connected you are to the present moment.
10. Set lifelines instead of deadlines . When you set lifelines, you don’t over-schedule. You put time cushions—chances to breathe, eat a snack, go to the bathroom or just look out the window—between work tasks. When you have lifelines instead of deadlines, you’re less likely to hear that whooshing sound as deadlines go by or feel that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach for “always” being behind. Your days become less hurried and harried, and you enjoy them more. What about it? Do you hear that whooshing sound? Or not?

"Drugs Are Keeping Seniors Healthy, And Hurting Them | jeunesse founder",www.forbes.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2019/04/08/drugs-are-keeping-seniors-healthy-and-hurting-them/?ss=healthcare/,"(Last Updated On: April 20, 2019) Pills at a manufacturer

We are living in the age of prescription drugs . They can turn once-fatal diseases into manageable, chronic conditions. But especially for older adults , many of whom take five or more medications each day, they can cause illness or even death.
A new study by Judith Garber and Shannon Brownlee of the Lown Institute, estimate that as many as 10 million older adults —about one of every five seniors— had some kind of adverse drug reaction in 2018. They calculate that five million older adults were treated for a negative reaction to a medication and 280,000 were admitted to hospitals, at a cost of $3.8 billion. More than half of those hospitalized were older adults . Over the next decade, 160,000 people will die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs .
The most at risk: Those taking five or more medications were nearly twice as likely to seek medical care than those taking one or two meds. Sometimes, these events are caused by the side effects of an individual drug . But often, they result from interactions among multiple drugs . Older adults taking many different pills are far less likely to take them as prescribed—either because they cannot manage them all or because they ration costly meds to save money.
Pharmaceutical drug use among seniors is a two-edged sword. On one hand, these medications can be extraordinarily beneficial. Statins, commonly prescribed for older adults , significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes by lowering cholesterol. Insulin and similar medications allow diabetics to live long and productive lives.
Yet diabetes medications are among the leading causes of adverse drug reactions. If they lower blood sugar too much, they increase the risk of falls and confusion. Similarly, while blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin can improve blood flow for patients with heart disease, they also increase risk of severe bleeding. Here is a list of medications that can be especially risky for older adults .
Unlike opiods, which often have been widely misused or inappropriately prescribed, many medications are appropriate. But they still come with risks.
There are many causes of excessive, and dangerous, prescription drug use among older adults .
Hyper-specialized doctors. The increasing specialization of medical care is a hallmark of modern medicine . The upside: your doctor may be a true expert in your condition. The downside: She may not know—or even care —about how the meds she prescribes interact with drugs ordered by other physicians. For instance, your cardiologist may see her job as only treating your heart disease. She may not think about how your heart medicine interacts with your arthritis drugs .
Prescription cascades . Many of us have seen this one: A doctor prescribes a drug for one condition. The drug itself creates a new problem, and the doctor ’s solution is yet another medication .
The Lown study includes a tragic case study: A man was given steroids to treat Crohn’s disease, then given antibiotics to treat the effects of the steroids. The antibiotics caused nerve damage and pain so he was given multiple painkillers plus drugs to help him sleep . They caused diarrhea, which was treated with meds that damaged the patient’s kidneys, which raised his blood pressure , which required still more drugs . Before he died, the patient was taking 31 pills every day, most to treat the effects of others.
Poor research. The negative effects on older adults of individual drugs or interactions among multiple drugs are poorly researched. Because drug trials often are focused on young adults , physicians may be unaware for years of the effects on seniors. One solution may be better monitoring of prescriptions once they are ordered.
What can consumers do?
Before taking a new drug , ask your doctor about its side effects, especially for older adults . If he is not giving you clear or satisfactory answers, get another doctor .
If your health status changes after you begin taking a new drug , check to be sure the medication itself isn’t the cause. Family members should especially watch for symptoms of confusion. This can be especially important for people who already have some cognitive impairment. Physicians often mistake drug -related confusion or delirium for dementia. They are not the same.
If you are taking multiple medications (including over-the-counter drugs ), insist that one of your doctors—probably your primary care doc—act as quarterback. And if you find yourself getting a cascade of drugs —each to treat the effects of another—call a time-out. Ask your doctors to think about addressing this issue by ending or changing the medication that started the cascade in the first place instead of merely prescribing more drugs .
Finally, consider talking to a board-certified geriatric pharmacist or a consulting pharmacist. They may know much more than many physicians about complex drug interactions.

"Startup Banking On Dog Owners Who Want The Best For Fido, Cost Be Damned",www.forbes.com,Daniel D'Ambrosio,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieldambrosio/2019/04/20/startup-banking-on-dog-owners-who-want-the-best-for-fido-cost-be-damned/,"Renaldo Webb, 30, has traveled a long way from his native New Orleans.
Pet Plate founder Renaldo Webb with his inspiration, Winston.
Courtesy Pet Plate As he neared graduation from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a degree in physics, Webb began to doubt his plan to apply to graduate schools with the intent of working in a laboratory and becoming a professor.
“Oh my God, what am I going to do?” Webb remembers thinking.
In 2010, he landed a job in the Los Angeles office of McKinsey & Company, and two years later, moved to New York to go to work for Catterton Partners, the Greenwich-based private equity firm with $15 billion in assets.
Webb had diverged widely from the path of physics professor. Then his life took another surprising turn when he left Catterton in 2016 to launch Pet Plate, a startup based in New York’s Hudson Yards that provides fresh, chef-cooked meals to dogs.
Dogs like Winston, Webb’s Tibetan terrier, a “small, hypoallergenic dog” that works well for his tiny New York apartment, Webb says.
Pet Plate uses fresh, human-grade ingredients and delivers meals to your doorstep.
Courtesy Pet Plate Webb credits his entrepreneurial venture to his work as a consultant for pet food companies, where he learned about the ingredients going into kibble, the food that so many dogs eat. He was not reassured by what he learned.
“I decided I wanted to cook for my dog, Winston, so I started doing that,” Webb said. “Winston loved the food. Friends offered to pay me for the food. A light bulb went off.”
Webb realized that pet owners wanted a fresh option. He could launch a business that would “make a meaningful difference in the lives of pets across the country.”
Pet Plate is a direct-to-consumer delivery service, freshly cooked with 100 percent real ingredients. Ingredients humans would recognize.
“A lot of the pet food at the grocery store contains ingredients not fit for human consumption,” Webb said.
Pet Plate’s dog meals are made at a USDA-inspected facility in upstate New York, following the same food safety protocols used by Whole Foods, according to Webb.
The meals are flash frozen to preserve the nutrients, then taken to one of several distribution centers across the country where they are shipped directly to the customer’s door. Fido’s meals arrive in a frozen, insulated box similar to what Blue Apron does, Webb said.
“We pack all the meals in dry ice with a layer of insulation that’s 100 percent compostable,” he said. “The box can stay frozen for three days after it’s shipped.”
Webb claims the majority of his customers have switched over entirely to the fresh meals provided by Pet Plate. Small dogs particularly, like Winston, can be picky eaters, he says.
“A growing segment of dogs in the United States don’t eat kibble,” Webb said. “Also dogs suffering from allergies need special diets. Dogs that are overweight and dogs with sensitive stomachs do well with Pet Plate.”
Pet Plate doggy meals are packed in dry ice to keep them fresh.
Courtesy Pet Plate Webb says your dog will be healthier and happier on a Pet Plate diet just like you are healthier and happier when you have a wholesome, fresh diet.
All this wholesomeness and happiness does come at a price. Webb says the majority of his customers are spending $80 to $100 per month on their small dog’s meals from Pet Plate. Big dogs can run up a bill of as much as $100 a week, he says.
“We have a bunch of people doing that,” Webb said.
Webb declined to reveal revenue numbers, but he said Pet Plate has shipped more than 3 million meals since its founding in 2017. The company currently has 10 employees.
“That’s definitely exceeded our expectations,” he said.
Considering that the pet food industry is a $30 billion business, Webb figures he has plenty of room to grow, especially since about half of all dogs in the United States are currently overweight, according to Webb, and are dying of cancer, diabetes and other serious illnesses.
“There’s no shortage of people trying to figure out a way to improve pet health,” Webb said. “That’s an opportunity for Pet Plate.”"

Council Post- The Drive-Through Approach To Employee Communications (And Four Ways To Adopt It),www.forbes.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/03/21/the-drive-through-approach-to-employee-communications-and-four-ways-to-adopt-it/,"Getty Getty Let me tell you a secret: I love drive-through restaurants. And why not? They fit my lifestyle of running to meetings, rushing between appointments and playing taxi to my children. And I’m not alone — drive-through restaurants have become an integral part of our culture, letting us quickly and easily get food to fit our busy and (dare I say) at times, lazy, lives. No longer do we have to leave our car, as we can get our food on demand in a way that works for us.
So why am I telling you this? Because I believe we need to take a similar approach to how we communicate with our workforce. We need to accept that not all our employees can or want to always be ""in the restaurant"" when it comes to communication, but want to be able to ""drive through"" when and how it best fits their lives and their schedules, happening in real time.
The reason this is important is because communications is one of the foundational elements of employee engagement. You’re not going to make an impact on your engagement strategy without a strong focus on how you communicate with your people; it can make or break your efforts. For this reason, I believe that if we also offer up drive-through-style communication alongside the restaurant, i.e., more static communication approach, we better set our employees and our businesses up for success.
Let me share with you four ways I’ve used this drive-through approach to employee communications to advance engagement:
1. Create a drive-through ""window.""
The key to a drive-through restaurant is the drive-through window, which is the entryway to the consumer experience. The same needs to be true in how businesses communicate with employees, creating a window they can enter that allows them to easily and quickly get to the information we want to communicate and create a positive employee experience.
For example, we created a window for our employees with our communications portal, which pulls together everything and anything that our employees need so they can understand what’s going on in the business and what the business is doing to support them. It’s arranged in a simple format so employees can drive through to get what they need, and then get out and get back to their work and their lives. It’s even accessible through an app — how much more drive-through can you get?
2. Create a ""menu.""
Another element that adds to the drive-through experience is the menu or menu board that appears as you enter the queue. It clearly lists out what food is available, helping customers quickly and easily make their selections.
The same needs to be true when we communicate to our employees. By creating a menu, businesses can make it easier for employees to engage with the communication, as well as shape and influence their overall experience.
We use this menu approach on our employee communications portal by creating tiles for each of the key areas of communication. For example, there is one tile where employees can click on to find information on their benefit programs, another where they can find key messages from the leadership team, another to visit the virtual wellbeing hub and another where they can provide feedback at any point in time. A design like this allows employees to ""order"" what works for them, and do so in a straightforward and engaging way.
3. Create multiple ""lanes.""
Have you noticed that many restaurants have moved to more than one drive-through order lane? This speeds up the ordering process, and for people like me who hate waiting, makes us feel more in control of the whole process.
When it comes to communicating with employees, leaders should adopt the multiple lane approach, specifically doing so by using a variety of communication media. With such diverse workforces, we need to recognize and address that our employees will want to be communicated to in a variety of ways.
For example, some employees like to read a two-sentence summary, others like to read the detail while others may want to watch a quick video. By creating a variety of lanes of communication, employees will be encouraged to drive up to them and engage with them instead of just passing by.
4. Collect feedback.
Last, but certainly not least, is collecting feedback, which drive-throughs aim to do each and every time a customer visits them through a web address provided on their receipt. By doing this, they can better understand how they’ve met the needs of their customers and how they can improve in the future.
When it comes to our employees, collecting feedback on how our communication is working (and not working) is something that businesses should likewise be collecting as often as possible. According to a study by Salesforce, employees are 4.6 times more likely to feel empowered to do their best work if they feel their voice is heard.
By creating what I like to call feedback moments throughout our communications drive-through experience, we make it not only easy to provide feedback, but also easy to keep feedback front-of-mind as employees are aware of their company’s interest in their feedback.
Next time you find yourself in a situation where you need to send out a communication message or build a communication vehicle, let me encourage you to try out the drive-through approach. Not only will you have more employees visit your messages and create a full ""meal"" for themselves, your communication will have more impact and engagement will improve.

Telemedicine May Be Giving Kids Too Many Antibiotics | jeunesse founder,www.forbes.com,,04-20-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2019/04/08/telemedicine-may-be-over-prescribing-antibiotics-to-kids/?ss=healthcare/,"(Last Updated On: April 20, 2019) Stock via Getty

A new study suggests that children with cold symptoms who get care via telemedicine are much more likely to be prescribed antibiotics than those who are seen in person, prompting concerns about overprescription and the rise of drug -resistant germs.
Published Monday in the journal Pediatrics , the study looked at over 340,000 insured children who had medical visits in 2015 and 2016 for acute respiratory illness. Among them, kids with cold symptoms who received care through telemedicine sessions were significantly more likely to receive antibiotics than children who were seen at a doctor ‘s office or clinic.
According to the study, more than half of children who used direct-to-consumer telemedicine services, which usually don’t involve input from patients’ primary doctors or health systems, were prescribed antibiotics for their cold symptoms. At urgent care clinics, around 42% of kids received them, and just 31% at doctors’ offices.
Among other things, the study also found that telemedicine doctors more often failed to meet medical guidelines for matching treatment to diagnosis — generally, surrounding the prescription of bacteria-fighting drugs for colds and flus, which are viral illnesses, and not affected by antibiotics.

Researchers found that 4 out of 10 telemedicine prescribers’ decisions on the use of antibiotics failed to meet these guidelines, as compared to 3 out of 10 decisions in urgent care clinics and 2 out of 10 in doctors’ offices.
Researchers pointed out that unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions can contribute to the concerning rise in drug -resistant germs, as well as cause unnecessary side-effects and costs.
Dr. Kristin Ray, the study’s lead author, told the Associated Press, “I understand the desire for care that’s more convenient and timely. But we want to make sure that we don’t sacrifice quality or safety or effectiveness in the process.”
As the AP pointed out, recent research on antibiotic prescriptions for adults showed little difference between patients who used telemedicine or had office visits, but patterns for children haven’t been examined much. Only 1% of kids in the study used direct-to-consumer telemedicine services.
With telemedicine on the rise, especially among cost-conscious employers and busy consumers, the secondary costs or benefits of this kind of care are still being explored.

But now it sounds like Khan's corner has stopped it. Meaning it's a TKO6 for Crawford. And what an unsatisfying way to end this PPV. Said Crawford: ""First of all, it wasn't a low bow. Second of all, Virgil [Hunter, Khan's trainer] knew the fight was going in a bad direction and saved his fighter beore anything bad happened to him.""
Well, it was a low blow, in fact.
Bud Crawford vs Amir Khan stopped after a low blow by Crawford. Strange ending. #boxing #CrawdfordKhan pic.twitter.com/WEXxmijJuP
— Mick Akers (@mickakers) April 21, 2019
Khan, meanwhile, said, ""The fight was just getting interesting. ... I now realize why he's one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world. I'm a good boxer, but he was showcasing great skills great movement. I was caught with a shot right below the belt. I could feel it in my stomach. I could feel it in my legs ... I'm a warrior. I would never give up a flight like this. I was in pain.""
Hunter said he asked Khan if he could continue and that Khan said no. So, make of that what you will regarding whether Khan, who called himself a warrior, was ready to just call it a night.
After the fight, Crawford said he wanted Errol Spence. ""Whenever you're ready,"" Crawford said, ""I'm here.""
Sixth round: The more that I think about it, I kind of think I should have given Khan the last round. Oh well. Too late now. Crawford catches Khan coming in again. And now it's a bad low blow by Crawford and Khan. And Khan is in some pain. He's taking some time to recover. And from the replays, yeah, that was low and ... yikes. The crowd reacts like you expect it would. And what? The fight is being stopped. What is happening?
Fifth round: Huge right by Khan, but he missed wildly. That didn't look so great. Nice body combo from Crawford. They're blasting each other. Big left hook by Crawford, and Khan covers up. Khan is still throwing hard punches, though. Then, a triple jab from Khan. Big rights from Crawford. This is a fun round. Khan comes in wildly and he lands a nice left. He's making Crawford miss a little bit. Forbes scores it for Crawford.
Overall: Crawford 49-45
Fourth round: Crawford is starting to look dangerous again. Ha. ESPN interviews Brian McIntyre, Crawford's trainer, and he said Khan's speed isn't what it used to be. In fact, he said Khan's speed is ""s**t."" With a minute to go, Crawford lands a right. Now, Crawford is focused on Khan's body. Khan complains about a low blow, but they continue. They're exchanging punches, and Khan looks like it's close to being over. Huge right by Crawford, But Khan is taking the punches better now. Forbes scores it for Crawford.
Overall: Crawford 39-36
Third round: Khan with another 1-2 combo, and Khan landed the right jhand. Same combo as last round. Khan looks a little more confident now. Khan jabs to the body. Every time Khan lunges in, it's got to make his corner's heart stop. So far, he hasn't been hurt since the first round. And he's doing OK in this round. Kind of a nothing round but I'll give it to Khan for that right hand early. Forbes scores it for Khan.
Overall: Crawford 29-27
Second round: Khan is jabbing but he's coming up short. He's staying far away. Khan jumps in, and Crawford lands a body shot. Now, Khan is throwing combos again. Khan has hand speed, but Crawford's counter is pretty darn fast too. The two exchange punches, and Crawford got the better of it. But Khan took it OK. Khan hits Crawford with a nice shot with about 20 seconds to go. Forbes scores it for Crawford.
Overall: Crawford 20-17
First round: Khan's first punches are a three-punch combo. Nothing lands. I wonder if Crawford will try to get off to a faster start than normal, because Khan oftentimes does well early in fights. Khan is certainly being more aggressive. A minute in, and Khan lands a right to the body. He lands a left to move Crawford back. A triple jab by Khan. Crawford tires a right, and he blasts Khan. Khan hits the canvas. So much for that slow start. Now, Crawford is opening up on him. Khan in complete survival mode. Khan gets blasted again but he barely keeps himself up. Forbes scores it for Crawford.
Overall: Crawford 10-8
Terence Crawford ringwalk: As he enters the arena, Crawford looks at his feet. Then, he looks forward and walks through the smoke on his way to the ring. He looks ready to go.
Amir Khan ringwalk: As he begins to make his walk, it looks like Khan is talking to himself. He also looks a little concerned. Now he begins to move a little quicker, and he's walking swiftly to the ring. He pounds his glove together, and he enters the ring.
UNDERCARD:
Teofimo Lopez (13-0, 11 KOs) KO5 over Edis Tatli (31-3): The first three rounds of this fight weren't all that exciting, but Lopez again proved that he can end a fight in a hurry. In this case, it was a hard right hand to Tatli's body that put him on the canvas. Tatli never rose again. After the fight, Lopez said it wasn't a great training camp for him. Which is an interesting comment coming from him, though he declined to comment further. Lately, he's been calling out Vasiliy Lomachenko. Hey, that might be a fun fight, but at this point, Lopez would have a tough time beating the best fighter in the world.

Shakur Stevenson (11-0, 6 KOs) UD win over Christopher Diaz (24-2): Two fights ago, Diaz was fighting for a world title at the junior lightweight division and lost a unanimous decision to Masayuka Ito. On Saturday, he was supposed to give Stevenson the biggest test of his career at featherweight. Turns out Diaz was no match for Stevenson, who won a unanimous decision (the judges scored it 100-90, 99-91 and 98-92 (Forbes had it 99-91)). Stevenson outlanded Diaz 165-76 according to CompuBox, and Stevenson simply had too much speed and skill for Diaz to be a threat. Afterward, Stevenson said he was the next Floyd Mayweather and Sugar Ray Leonard.
To add a a little levity to this fight, here's a short video of Stevenson and Diaz stepping on each others' feet over and over again.

Felix Verdejo (25-1, 16 KOs) UD win over Bryan Vasquez (37-4): It was a solid performance, though not a spectacular one from Verdejo. He easily got past Vasquez (the judges had it 97-93, 97-93, 98-92, and I had it 98-92), but he didn't look fabulous doing it. He had a nice jab early in the fight, and his body shots were solid near the end. But with Verdejo trying to get his career back on track after a bad motorcycle crash and a knockout loss in 2018, this wasn't a fight that will convince anybody that he can be a world champion any time soon. There was an interesting moment after the sixth round when Vasquez's trainer—Hanna Gabriels, who's also a very good fighter and his wife—told him that he was embarrassing himself and embarrassing her. Yikes."

Tech's Role In The College Admission Scandal,www.forbes.com,Julian Vigo,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/04/20/techs-role-in-the-college-admission-scandal/,"Having spent much of my professional life as a university professor, I am pretty much unfazed by the recent college admissions scandal simply because higher education is consumed with such problems at all levels. As other educators speak out, yesterday we learned that prosecutors in Los Angeles are looking at new targets in the fraud conspiracy cases. Of the 50 people currently being charged by the federal government, 18 will plead guilty in the hopes of leniency from the court. Still, it is business as usual if you ask other scholars within academia in the US who teach at elite institutions. They will tell you that this is just a drop in the bucket within the culture of higher education. During my career in academia, I witnessed first-hand many coerced political hirings and how nepotism related to admissions, scholarships and hiring. From the late 1990s, many university departments began to reduce the requirements for coursework such that professors report being told not to have their students read or write. The result of such policies is that higher education often resembles an encounter session: Show up, smile and look vaguely interested in the subject and you can be fairly certain of getting a decent final grade. The role of the student is more or less that of financial broker.
Unsurprisingly, where wealth has helped many students gain entry into universities and specialized programs, new technology has made this sort of cheating all the more pervasive due to the velocity of virtual communications and how digital media facilitates the doctoring of everything from documents, letters of recommendation and photos.
While it is disappointing to see Hollywood royalty participating in the recent admissions scandal, these are hardly new infractions of the so-called rules, nor are they the most egregious. The recent college admissions scandal is part of a larger problem of higher education and how it is structured to enable the wealthiest and most privileged of our society to hold onto power. From admission to completion of the degree, there are innumerable industries built around making as much money from students as humanly possible and the larger university structure turns a blind eye to this. More to the point, technology is playing a major role in how it enables this academic cheating with myriad online industries established around every facet of academia—from entrance exams, to coursework and final papers, to theses.
There is no shortage of companies willing to cash in on the education market from the preparation of entry exams through the final stages degree completion. Companies like Kaplan which prepare students for undergraduate admissions (the ACT and SAT) as well as postgraduate programs such as business, law and medical schools. Yet, the feedback from former clients of Kaplan reveals myriad stories of people who felt “ripped off” for having spent upwards of $5,000 for in-person study sessions and where the failure of exams is met with another offer to invest even more in another tier of tutorials. Kaplan is just one of many companies offering students “help” for high fees with The Princeton Review , The College Board and Manhattan Elite Prep among its competitors.
Are test preparation companies engaging in cheating the system? Some would argue that they are simply because they create an impossible bar for poorer students who did not benefit from privately funded training courses or tutorials. Others take issue with companies like The College Board which breached its “fiduciary duty by recycling old exam questions, including those that have been publicly disseminated prior to the SAT exam” as claimed in the lawsuit filed last year against the company which owns the SAT and the Educational Testing Service (which administers the SAT). After the scandal over paying for a disability diagnosis was revealed in 2002, little has changed on these college admission prep exams as students and their families have figured out new loopholes , from having others sit their tests to bribing for changes in the final score. At that, there have been numerous leaks of SAT exams in China amidst a thriving industry which exploits online security issues.
Skip to when students are admitted into their desired university and the money-making has only begun. There are hundreds of online companies claiming to offer tutorials and proofreading services and others which actually sell completed essays. It is difficult to understand where the line is between paying for a private lesson and having coursework written by another person simply because online interactions often blur this difference. Still, companies which offer online “help” abound in the dozens even if they generally mask themselves as tutorial services while reality they are nothing more than essay mills.
While little has been voiced in the US on this front, in the UK several MPs have started to speak out on this issues as recently as 2017 where there were suggestions made to block these essay mills sites and more recently, Education Minister Damian Hinds has suggested that PayPal stop accepting payments to these companies. Some universities are even implementing “ forensic linguistics ” software to crack down on ghostwriting by essay mills. Only one country, New Zealand, has created a law to crack down on cheating services .
Some critics of these essay mills contend that these services prey on the most economically vulnerable but as the recent college admissions scandal shows nobody is guaranteed the intellectual endowment to get into any university, rich or poor. Sure, poorer kids have less access to the kinds of college prep education that will pave their way into the country’s best universities, but why is it not obvious to professors when students are presenting a final essay written by another? While some contend that essay mills and students are committing fraud , others like myself are far more critical of universities that have turned the classroom into an experiment of 21st century Taylorism whose aim is to turn out as many paying students into the job market as possible regardless of merit.
The answer to this problem lies is combatting technological cheating with traditional pedagogical requirements: Professors must simply require weekly written work from students allowing the professors to familiarize themselves with the writing styles and weaknesses of each student. Such practices will not only reduce cheating, but students can learn what they need to work on while having the time frame of a semester to improve their work. It is unlikely in a learning environment where students are regularly expected to turn in written work and discuss their ideas in class that they could easily rely on an essay mill for assignments that are precisely devised for and by them.
The larger problem of cheating in higher education should not focus on how online cheating is “getting worse” or “how best to tackle it.” We need to ask why in higher education the current in-class pedagogy is next to nil as class attendance in many universities is optional. Of course, students will capitalize on their professor not knowing how they think, speak or write when it comes time to settle a final research paper. With such a model, professors are lucky if they recognize their students at all.
The rise in cheating in higher education is a red light to deeper problems attached to our collective social value on education and the young lives we view as having an expiration date upon graduation. Instead of understanding that education is a lifelong process, we have perfectly wrapped up education into a short-term pyramid scheme where most everyone wins except the student."
Pink's New Tour Shows Why She Might Be The Biggest Rock Star In Pop,www.forbes.com,Steve Baltin,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2019/04/20/pinks-new-tour-shows-why-she-might-be-the-biggest-rock-star-in-pop/,"Pink played the second of two sold-out nights in L.A. last night (April 19) at the Forum. The gig came four days after she sold out Staples Center across town. Watching the artists' fans go so crazy they brought her gifts, some all the way from New Zealand, got her to sign their arms for matching tattoos, and more, it was very clear that Pink is as relevant in pop culture now as anytime in her two-decade long career. Then it occurred to me why that is. As we have this wonderful new generation of female pop bad asses, including Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish, Pink, in many ways, helped pave the way for them, making her music her way. And even though she arrived in a time of pop princesses, Pink always carried herself more in the tradition of a rock star.
Sure enough, when I interviewed Lipa in July of 2016, she said, ""I admire Pink a lot and she’s been a massive inspiration to me from the very early days. I love how she’s stayed true to herself and when she does she’s always made pop music, but she’s made pop that she identifies with,"" Lipa told me at the time. ""She’s really cool and you only hear really good things about Pink and you understand her work when you hear it. There’s something so powerful about the way she performs and then things that she wants to say through her music, like when 'Dear Mr. President' came out, it was such a massive thing and it was because she stayed true to herself and she spoke her mind and she allowed that to kind of enter the pop world and not be afraid of it. I admire everything she’s doing.""
Proving the Pink as a rock star theory, even Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler is a big fan as well. When I asked him who would be the dream person to play his Grammy viewing party he said without hesitation, ""Pink, without a doubt. We’re good friends, I met her in the very beginning, brought her in my limousine to a gig that was four hours away and we wrote a song.""
So the timing was right for Pink to return to the top of the pop world. All she had to do was take advantage of the opportunity. Well, being the brilliant show woman she is, all she's done is deliver one of the most astonishing pop spectacles you will ever see and cement her status as maybe the greatest pop performer in the world not named Beyonce.
It's not quite fair to other musicians to call ""The Beautiful Trauma Tour"" a concert as it creates an unfair standard to live up to. From the opening, when the curtain opens and she is performing ""Get The Party Started"" while acrobatically moving about a chandelier hanging from the ceiling, it is a tour de force that combines theater, Cirque Du Soleil and comedy (the ""Revengeland"" video skit is something South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone would be envious of), the show was a multimedia success on all levels.
Yet, for all the surrounding spectacle, the focus never veered from the music or the songs. She found a creative, visual way to introduce her band, who she featured frequently, proving her generosity as a band leader . She also showed that generosity as a headliner when she talked about her love for opener Julia Michaels, who she dubbed a ""badass.""
Musically the versatility was impressive, whether it was the hootenanny feel of the joyful ""I Am Here,"" the sensual ""Secrets,"" the sweet nostalgia of ""Barbies"" or the raucousness of the opening ""Get The Party Started"" or the mix of ""Funhouse"" and No Doubt's ""Just A Girl.""
Having brought a rock star mentality to pop for the last two decades, Pink has elevated all of pop music. So to see her be feted and enjoy the respect and adoration she has earned from fans is something any music lover could and should appreciate. And as she has her whole career, she is doing it her way -- with style, class, fun, passion and pride."
Big Data Can Help Us See Through Government Redactions,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/20/big-data-can-help-us-see-through-government-redactions/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. AI & Big Data I write about the broad intersection of data and society. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin A redacted court filing from the Special Council Robert Mueller in the Paul Manafort case April 16, 2019. (ERIC BARADAT/AFP/Getty Images) Getty The release of the Mueller report this past week has brought with it renewed interest in the practice of “redaction” in which the government blacks out portions of officially released documents to preserve confidential information. The topic has received more media attention on television in the past week than it has in the past decade, while globally as much as 2% of worldwide online news coverage mentioned the term at its peak on Thursday. Yet, the rise of massive centralized FOIA archives, digitized news archives and a bit of statistical analysis can help scholars readily peer through those dark markings and fill in the redacted blanks.
One of the great weaknesses of the governmental redaction process is the lack of centralized government-wide coordination in determining just what is sensitive enough to warrant obscuring from public view. One government agency’s most sensitive secret is another agency’s view of public information.
This leads to a situation in which multiple government agencies may release the same declassified document with different redactions. One agency might redact the entire first paragraph, while leaving the entirety of the remaining text untouched, while another agency might lead the first page untouched, while heavily redacting the rest of the text.
Historically such discrepancies were difficult for historians and the public to exploit because of the lack of open centralized databases of declassified document archives and FOIA collections.
As non-profits, private companies and academic institutions have focused on assembling vast archives of government documents in recent decades, it has become steadily easier to look across the totality of a government’s publicly released output for patterns.
Simple document similarity clustering can instantly group together all of the versions of a given document that have been released over the years by different agencies. A rudimentary “diff” over each group of documents can help fill in redacted passages, in rare cases even restoring the entire document, exploiting the uncoordinated declassification process.
In cases of small factual redactions, it may be possible to reconstruct missing information from other public sources of information, by performing topical and entity-level clustering.
Take the example of a declassified document that mentions that a US official traveled to an unspecified country for high-level meetings about Russian sanctions on a particular date. The name of the visited country is redacted, but the name of the official and the date of the travel is known. A simple keyword search of news reports from the given week may be all that’s required to retrieve news coverage that the given official had been in Germany that day for high-level meetings, but without the news reports mentioning Russia. A closer inspection of the official’s public published schedule or that of their German counterparts might even narrow down the time, place and basic details of the actual meeting in question. Statements issued by both sides over the following weeks could be used to reconstruct the broad contours of the meeting and its outcomes.
Even if there is insufficient evidence to concretely fill in a redacted passage, similarity clustering can offer at least a range of potential options that can help guide a researcher towards other sources to fill in the blanks.
In short, the same data mosaicking that has fueled the modern data broker industry can easily transform piles of unrelated content into interwoven documentaries that can help fill in each other’s gaps.
Of course, historical mosaicking is far from a digital era breakthrough. The idea of looking across vast piles of available information to fill in missing blanks lies at the very root of what it means to conduct historical research. Similarly, diplomatic scholars, historians and intelligence analysts have been using such approaches to restore redacted text since long before “big data.” The difference is that computerized redaction filling can perform such analysis almost in realtime, look across the totality of available information from all sources and find even subtle connections between sources.
In the case of a standalone document like the Mueller report, there are obviously darkened sections of the report so extensively redacted and so broadly stripped of their meaning that there is simply insufficient remaining detail to even estimate what might be in the redacted sections. Some redacted details may be so narrow they leave little trace in the open world that might permit their discovery. Yet, as analysts have already demonstrated, the contents of some of those redactions can already be fairly well guessed.
Putting this all together, the rise of centralized open “big data” government document archives brings an array of mosaicking opportunities to bear on better understanding and potentially combatting, government secrecy.
In the end, like all other forms of privacy, it seems even the government’s privacy is being washed away in our deluge of data.

5 Traits Every College Student Needs To Succeed in The Workplace,www.forbes.com,Shelcy V. Joseph,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelcyvjoseph/2019/04/20/5-traits-every-college-student-needs-to-succeed-in-the-workplace/,"Last year, a Gallup survey , which interviewed 32,585 currently enrolled college students at 43 U.S. colleges and universities, shed some light on students' confidence in their workforce training. Some key findings include: 1. Just over a third of students strongly agree that they will graduate with the knowledge and skills they need to be successful in the job market (34%) and in the workplace (36%).
2. Only 53% of college students believe their major will lead to a good job.
This paints a pretty bleak picture of the future of college students in the job market and workplace. Personally, I didn't feel that my college experience had properly prepared my for the workplace. While I attended several career workshops (resume building, cover letter writing, etc.), no class could have taught me how to deal with office politics, ask for a raise, or stand out as a job seeker. Now I know that there's a lot more that goes into one's success in the job market and in the workplace than college can teach. That's why I've made a list of skills and traits that almost every employer looks for in a candidate.
Reliability
Being reliable comes down to these three main things: show up on time, deliver on your promises and do a good job. Have an important client meeting? Arrive early and have all the necessary materials ready. Meet all your deadlines without being reminded of the tasks at hand. Do this and do it consistently. Reliability is one of the most desirable traits in a candidate as it shows a strong commitment to the job.
Self-starter
An intrapreneur is defined as “a person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation.” Intrapreneurs are an invaluable resource to a company, and what they do is simply identify a problem and solve it creatively.
Do you notice a flaw in a system you interact with daily? Ask yourself how you can make it better and take the initiative, without necessarily asking for permission, to come up with a solution. Make sure to give yourself time to familiarize yourself with the company and its needs before you dedicate a few hours to creating solutions. Once you're confident, present the solution to your manager and offer to take it on. B eing an intrapreneur not only makes you a bigger part of the organization , but it also makes you a bigger part of it.
Adaptability
How quickly can you adjust to changing environments? As the workplace evolves rapidly, staying nimble is key to overcoming these challenges. If your team suddenly loses a member and you're tasked with their responsibilities for some time, be ready to take them on, and do them well. This isn't to say you shouldn't communicate if you feel overwhelmed. It only suggests you remain flexible, as this makes you even more competitive.
Cultural fit
The truth is, you are more likely to enjoy working at a place if there's a cultural fit. Being aligned with your company's culture leads to greater job satisfaction, and can help you reach both your professional and personal goals. That's why it is so important to get a great understanding of a company's culture before you accept to work there. Throughout the hiring process, learn as much as you can about the company culture. Ask pertinent questions to hiring managers, speak to current employees and get a sense of team dynamics.
Teamwork mindset
Teamwork makes the dream work. Almost every company has adopted this mindset and come to expect this attitude from their staff. Look beyond your workload and try to be a resource to the team. Be willing to jump in when needed and work with colleagues to achieve goals. This not only reflects greatly on you, but it also moves your team forward (which only means better opportunities for everyone)."

OnePlus Confirms 'Fast And Smooth' Hardware For OnePlus 7 Launch,www.forbes.com,Ewan Spence,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/04/20/oneplus-7-oneplus-7-pro-launch-date-announcement-confirmed/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Consumer Tech Storyteller exploring digital worlds, mobile, music and podcasting Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the Shenzhen-based smartphone manufacturer will be announcing its launch event this coming Tuesday. Confirming the date will allow the crafted storyline to focus away from the when, and onto the what. OnePlus 6 Launch (Ewan Spence) Ewan Spence
The what is coming into focus as the launch date for the launch announcement of the launch event that will reveal the release date keeps the OnePlus community engaged and excited. Lau’s Twitter statement “ Stay tuned next Tuesday for our launch event announcement ” does not give away much, but the current expectation is that OnePlus are going to announce two handsets at the event, which many believe will be held on May 14th.
So far the only official word is that the new devices will be ‘fast’ and ‘smooth’ , but the are enough clues (such as the triple dots in the above tweeted video) that a bit of Taniyama-Shimura allows us to make a best guess at OnePlus’ plans.
The first handset will be the ‘traditional’ update to the OnePlus line up that will come with new features such as the pop-up selfie camera and the triple lens rear camera. This will get a bump up in the name to be the OnePlus 7 Pro.
That leaves space for something new for the OnePlus team. Rather than completely phasing out the OnePlus 6T for the new handsets an update to the OnePlus 6T, the 6T platform will pick up a smaller update to keep pace with current technology and carry the name OnePlus 7. OnLeaks’ Steve Hemmerstoffer: #OnePlus May 14th launch event: #OnePlus7 ≈ 6.4"" flat display / waterdrop notch front camera / dual rear camera with 48MP as primary #OnePlus7Pro ≈ 6.64"" curved display / pop-up front camera / triple rear camera with 48MP as primary + Telephoto + Ultra Wide #OnePlus7PRO5G pic.twitter.com/zGic9AQdVx
— Steve H.McFly (@OnLeaks) April 16, 2019
As for the confirmed 5G handset from OnePlus, while there is a good chance that it could be on show, the release of that handset is going to be driven more by the demands of the carriers. Showing it would allow it to be tied into the story of a family of devices but it would also dilute the impact the of the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro.
What’s the betting the team are working on two scripts, one with 5G and one without? "
5 Questions to Ask at Your Next Informational Interview,www.forbes.com,Shelcy V. Joseph,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shelcyvjoseph/2019/04/20/5-questions-to-ask-at-your-next-informational-interview/,"Informational interviews can feel really awkward. You're meeting with a stranger to pick their brain and there's no way to know how it'll go. It could be filled with awkward silences where you scramble to come up with questions to ask, or there can be an instant connection and the meeting ends with laughter and future calendar invites. What matters is that, in either scenario, you will achieve one thing: get the information you need while potentially making a new connection. Informational interviews are a great way to do your research on a company or a particular role, become well-informed and network. As such, it's good practice to schedule as many of them as possible, and bring a curious and genuinely interested self to those meetings.
Acing an informational interview is a matter of being prepared. Don't let a little fear of the awkwardness get in the way of major opportunities. Do your research on the person you're meeting with, take genuine interest in what they have to say and build on common grounds. Most importantly, come ready with questions and do not be afraid to ask. Here's a list of questions that will help you make the most out of your informational interviews.
1. How did you land this role at your current company?
2. How have your past experiences prepared you for this role?
3. Walk me through you day-to-day. What are your key responsibilities? 4. What have you learned since you started in this role? 5. What are the main challenges your job is helping with and how is each person on your team part of the solution? 6. As someone with my experience, do you have any advice on breaking into this industry? What is one way to stand out in this competitive space? 7. How do you see the industry evolving? 8. Are there resources you’d recommend, things I should be reading or skills I should be learning? 9. Do you happen to know someone who would be helpful for me to connect with? This list should get you started and is just a template that you can customize. The more personalized the questions, the better. Time to start sending these emails!"

You don’t always… I would have an issue if it would be a teammate, but Aleksei is not a teammate, so that was fine.”
UFC on ESPN+ 7 took place at Yubileyniy Arena in St. Petersburg and streamed on ESPN+.

— UFC (@ufc) April 20, 2019
The reason that Overeem fought Oleinik was because his original opponent, Alexander Volkov was removed from the card due to health issues in early April. Oleinik than accepted the fight on short notice.
With his first-round knockout win over Oleinik, Overeem is on a two-fight winning streak. The veteran fighter said it was not quite time for him to talk about fighting for the UFC heavyweight title. However, he did say that he is interested in facing Volkov.
“I’m still looking for that fight,” Overeem said. “I was very prepared to face Alexander Volkov. I was looking forward to that fight. That fight didn’t happen tonight, but hopefully the next fight will be Volkov.”
Volkov was on a six-fight winning streak before he lost to Derrick Lewis via third-round knockout in October.
Overeem, who has been training with Team Elevation in Denver said he was going to take a short vacation and then rejoin his team to prepare for his next fight. He said his desire is to fight again in September."
Malaysia Cannot Escape From China -- It's Too Late,www.forbes.com,Panos Mourdoukoutas,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2019/04/20/malaysia-cannot-escape-from-china-its-too-late/,"Markets © 2018 Bloomberg Finance LP
Malaysia is already caught in China’s web, and there’s no escape from it. The best it can do is to bring Beijing to the negotiating table, and try to get better deals for projects under way.
In the early days after his election, Malaysia’s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sent a strong message to Beijing about his will and determination to control the destiny of Malaysia by canceling high profile Chinese projects in the country.
Apparently, he wanted Malaysia to avoid China’s debt trap, which has left other countries with no choice but to cede control of indebted projects to Beijing.
Then he took his message on a roadshow, advising the Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to avoid China’s “debt trap.”
The trouble is that Mahathir’s revolt against China didn’t last long. And now the best it could accomplish is to bring Beijing back to the negotiating table to cut the cost of the investment projects assigned to Chinese contractors.
Last week, China agreed to cut the cost of East Coast Rail Link project by one-third. This week, the two countries have agreed to revive the Bandar Malaysia project with the original contractors — a joint-venture between Malaysian firm Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) – with some modifications. Like the construction of 10,000 affordable housing units, and the use of local sources.
What made Malaysia soften its tone on China? A couple of things, in my opinion. One of them is that there’s a great deal of “sunken” costs for the projects under way; and it will be hard to find alternative sources of financing to proceed with them. Malaysian and Chinese Shares Malaysian Foreign Direct Investment Koyfin
Then there’s Malaysia’s reliance on China for its exports. Last year, China was the largest export market for Malaysia ($42.5B), followed by Singapore (35.7B), and the US ($33.1B); and that gives Beijing great leverage against any “irrational” behavior by Malaysia.
By coincidence, Malaysia’s exports dropped unexpectedly lately, down 5.3% annually to MYR 66.6 billion in February 2019, after a 3.1% in January and missing market consensus of a 1.4%, according to Tradingeconomics.com. Sales dropped for palm oil & palm oil-based products (-13.4% to MYR 4.7 billion); refined petroleum products (-30.9% to MYR 3.6 billion); crude petroleum (-21.8% to MYR 1.9 billion); timber & timber-based products (-1.7% to MYR 1.4 billion) and natural rubber (-23.1% to MYR 0.2 billion).
Meanwhile, Mahathir’s decision to revive the Iskandar Waterfront Holdings and China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC) came a few hours after he oversaw the signing of agreements on currency swaps and plans to raise imports of Malaysian frozen durian and palm oil.
Another coincidence? "

7 Lessons: How To Succeed In A Summer Internship,www.forbes.com,Kimberly A. Whitler,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2019/04/20/7-lessons-how-to-succeed-in-a-summer-internship/,"As a professor, we often come in contact with students who go out of their way to help others. Johnny Mishu, currently a second-year student at the Darden School of Business (University of Virginia), is one of these students. He has an undergrad degree in Economics from Princeton and played on their baseball team. At Darden, he recently received one of three Sheppard Awards for distinguished service. It therefore did not surprise me when, a few weeks into his summer marketing internship at a technology firm, he sent an email indicating that he was loving his experience and was quite appreciative of the learning, commitment, and growth that the company and his boss were investing in him. He also shared what he called “lessons,” or “aha” moments that he was experiencing--lessons he kept track of throughout the internship. After reading through his reflections, I asked Johnny if he would mind sharing them with others, and he was happy to do so.
7 Lessons Learned During a Marketing Internship
Lesson #1: Sales Is Important—Much More Important than Previously Understood. “It really became apparent that 'Sales Drives Business.' As marketers, we must understand the incentives of the sales team and get them to understand ours if we want to drive company growth. We work as partners to develop the growth strategies and execute them. Without a strong working relationship, there is an increased risk of a breakdown in company strategy and sales communication and implementation. I’m not sure I fully appreciated how important the two sides of marketing were.”
Lesson #2: Change How To Think about “Networking.” “Have you ever been told that the structure for how you should ""network"" with people at your company over the summer is something like the following: 1) reach out, 2) tell the other person a little bit about yourself, 3) ask her for advice and help on your summer project, 4) add a couple nuggets that show you're a good fit for the company, and 5) then ask her about her career path and how she reached her position? I found out quickly that this sequence is a wonderful waste of everyone's time.
Instead, I realized that to connect with people at the company or have them help me with my summer intern project, the first thing I needed to emphasize was how the interaction would help them . In marketing class, we learned that the essence of marketing is to create value for others, primarily consumers. But as Lesson #1 pointed out, you also have to create value for colleagues in the company. In this case, I quickly realized that one-on-one meetings with colleagues should start by understanding how I could help them (instead of how they could help me). When emailing senior leaders in various departments, I had significantly more success in generating a willingness-to-help when I opened with ""I've learned that one of the big problems that you (or your team, etc.) are struggling with is..."" This contrasts with the me-centric version of ""my summer project is about XYZ and I would love your advice and would love to hear more about your experiences.”
While almost every single person I tried to connect with at my company was incredibly nice and helpful, my response rate was significantly better when I opened with a ""here's how I can help you"" as opposed to ""here's what's in it for me."" I have a strong sense that this lesson is generalizable to almost any situation.”
Lesson #3: There Is No Tried and True Internship Timeline. “Before starting your internship, some second-year students may talk about the importance of understanding the “summer internship timeline.” For example, at time T in your internship you should have met with ~X people across multiple departments, analyzed ~Y% of your data, and prepared ~Z% of your final presentation. While this may be a good general guide, it can be detrimental and cause unneeded stress at an individual level considering the strong variance across departments and bosses. I heard a fellow intern worrying because he hadn’t even opened PowerPoint while his cubemate already had eight beautiful slides ready to go.
Intern timelines are drastically different: each of us is working on a different project, likely on a different team, under a different manager. Some projects are data intensive; others hardly crunch a number. Some require talking on the phone to 6-8 people a day for 30 minutes each. Others require manipulating spreadsheets for hours each day. While there is value in having a general timeline (e.g. obviously I shouldn’t wait until one week before my final presentation to start putting together my PowerPoint), I’ve learned that the only timeline I needed to worry about is my deadline based on my project and my manager’s expectations. Trying to follow some prescribed intern timeline can cause more harm than good.”
Lesson #4: What Big Data is Not . “Our business school cases teach us the importance of aggregating and analyzing data for market sizing, statistical regression, etc. This data typically comes in the form of exhibits or tables. However, one of the surprises I had was how difficult it can be to find the data I needed to do the analysis. It’s often housed in different locations, across different departments. In talking with my classmates who interned at different companies, this was a common dilemma across industries and companies. On top of it, the data can come in many different, seemingly conflicting forms. The important skill is not in mastering each of the data sources, but in being able to find the right data and translate the stories that each data set suggests so that others can understand their respective and collective relevancies.”
Lesson #5: Remember the Goal. “When we start our summers, we’re told about our general action items for our projects, activities we should attend, and people we should talk to for the benefit of our summer internship, but over the course of the summer we often lose sight of and need to be sure that we remember what the ultimate goal is. The goal for the summer internship is to get an offer from your employer. If an action or idea over the summer doesn’t help lead to an offer, then it may not be worth your time. The company I worked for was gracious enough to host numerous intern events for us to get to know each other, and that’s great to do, but if it at all detracts from my ability to accomplish my goal, then I should prioritize accordingly. Each decision, meeting, or plan should keep the goal in mind.”
Lesson #6: Internship Project Does not Equal Full Time Role. “A general “aha” I had (and I’ve heard others have as well) is an understanding that the summer project is not necessarily representative of what the full-time role would be. The internship is a taste of the industry, work environment, teams, manager, and life, all within the confines of an unfamiliar company. I found it hard to separate my project from the potential full-time role, because all I know about the company is from the lens of my project. I realized though, after talking with former interns who are now employees at the firm, that the internship project doesn’t necessarily mirror the full-time job. Taking that step back in perspective allowed me to more clearly evaluate how I could see myself fitting in at the company.”
Lesson #7 : Final Presentation Feedback is Good…to an Extent. “As we’re developing our final presentations, we’re told to run our ideas and drafts by as many people as possible (our managers, their direct reports, our fellow interns, etc.). While it is beneficial to receive feedback from different people, there is definitely a point of diminishing returns. I ended up changing a slide four times (and wound up going back to my original idea) because I asked too many people for feedback on the content of that slide. I think it’s best to seek feedback from people you’ve grown to trust and who are primary stakeholders in your presentation; the rest may not be beneficial.”

Ozuna, Reik, Sebastián Yatra and Yandel will perform as the music reality competition comes to an end this Sunday, April 21. They'll be joining coaches Luis Fonsi, Alejandra Guzmán, Carlos Vives and Wisin, who will also perform. Telemundo is likely bringing in the additional star power to attract more viewers, striving to end the inaugural season on a positive note. Despite having top celebrity artists as coaches and showing promise, La Voz has not delivered spectacular ratings since it premiered on January 13 . It had tough competition from its rival Univision, which led the time slot with dance reality Mira Quien Baila ( MQB ).
La Voz beat Univision for several weeks after MQB ended and it went head to head with comedy show Me Caigo de Risa, which didn't fare well in its timeslot. But the Telemundo Sunday show lost the No.1 spot when Pequeños Gigantes premiered and hasn't been able to recuperate its lead. On March 31, it even extended La Voz half an hour to start at 8:30 pm, instead of 9 pm - a week after Univision's debut of the children's reality competition.
Reality show finales tend to experience a ratings uptick, with casual or new viewers - in addition to those who have been following the aspiring contestants since the beginning - tuning in to see who will take the crown. It's highly likely Telemundo will benefit from that. La Voz also counts on audience voting to pick the winner. The sense of audience participation can also generate goodwill. Will that be enough? It remains to be seen if it can beat Univision's reality that involves cute kids, popular with family viewing.
So who will be the winner of La Voz ? The audience will pick from the following finalists:
TEAM FONSI
Jerry Montañez, 42-year-old Puerto Rican from West Palm Beach, Florida.
Kat López, 19-year-old Cuban from Miami, Florida.
Jeidimar Rijos, 18-year-old Puerto Rican from Dorado, Puerto Rico.
Abdiel Pacheco, 27-year-old Puerto Rican from Humacao, Puerto Rico.
TEAM GUZMAN
Génesis Díaz, 20-year-old Cuban from Hialeah, Florida.
Kari Santoyo, 23-year-old Mexican-Puerto Rican from Chicago, Illinois.
Dunia Ojeda, 27-year-old Cuban from Miami, Florida.
Rubén Sandoval, 21-year-old Mexican from Beldwin Park, California.
TEAM VIVES
Sheniel Maisonet, 22-year-old Mexican-Puerto Rican from Homestead, Florida.
Lluvia Vega, 30-year-old Mexican from Brownsville, Texas.
Mava González, 18-year-old Venezuelan from Coral Springs, Florida.
Abel Flores, 27-year-old Mexican-Guatemalan from Los Angeles, California.
TEAM WISIN
Yashira Rodríguez, 22-year-old Puerto Rican from Ponce, Puerto Rico.
Ronny Mercedes, 32-year-old Dominican-Honduran from Bronx, New York.
Mayre Martínez, 40-year-old Cuban-Venezuelan from Redondo Beach, California.

Scientific Visualizations For Teaching Used To Mean Plaster Models,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/20/scientific-visualizations-for-teaching-used-to-mean-plaster-models/,"In our modern world in which scientific visualizations increasingly look like Hollywood movies and even simplistic visualizations for teaching are using gaming engines and GPU-accelerated renderers to create photorealistic imagery, it can be hard to imagine an era in which visualization of complex geometric equations for teaching was done through plaster models. Yet, these plaster, wood, plastic, paper and string models were ubiquitous for a time in American university mathematics departments, rendering complex equations into three dimensions. As we look back on this period of representation, what might we learn about our visual future?

Kalev Leetaru Physical mathematical models rose into popularity during the late 1800’s to early 1900’s and were once a ubiquitous sight in American university mathematics departments, conveying complex geometric shapes and mathematical equations for both teaching and research. While they have long since faded from use, collections of them still exist at some institutions, with the University of Illinois having one of the largest collections on public display.

Kalev Leetaru In March 2005 during renovations to the third-floor flooring of the University of Illinois’ mathematics department building, around 170 of the campus’ mathematics models were temporarily removed from their cases . This provided the opportunity to create a series of more than 2,200 high resolution photographs preserving the incredibly intricate and complex designs of the models , as well as showcasing the enormous variety of their designs . The entire collection is available as a set of preview images and a digital library of 13 of the original model catalogs as well as the full collection of all 2,200 full resolution images.

Kalev Leetaru Today such visualizations are largely performed by computer with ever-increasing fidelity and crossing from 3D renderings projected onto the 2D surfaces of our monitors into consumer VR devices. While stereoscopic visualization and interaction with modern incarnations of these models was long a staple of university virtual reality facilities like the CAVE, the rise of consumer VR means interactive stereographic versions can increasingly be consumed at home and as part of standard curriculums.

Kalev Leetaru Some of the original plaster models have even been scanned into three dimensions and reprinted using 3D printers, creating permanent and less fragile recreations that preserve these important artifacts for the future.

Mathematical model from University of Illinois Math Models collection. Why is it worth reflecting back on a collection of century-old plaster models?
The reason is that these models form a critical historical evolutionary link between mathematics’ history of two dimensional drawings and today’s computerized three-dimensional renderings. While little more than historical artifacts today, these models were a crucial step in mainstreaming the three-dimensional representation of complex geometric equations in a way that made them tactile and real to students in a way that no drawing on a textbook page could ever hope to.
Mathematical model from University of Illinois Math Models collection.
Kalev Leetaru While today’s computer renderings can achieve precision impossible with the building materials of these models, these early models remind us of the long path scientific visualization has taken over the centuries, from the hand drawn and hand colored two-dimensional visualizations of yesteryear to these hand-built three-dimensional models that allowed equations to leap off the page into the physical world, back to our two-dimensional computer models.
Ironically, while computer visualizations have become the norm today, they have brought us back to our earlier two-dimensional history. A plaster model can be held and inspected from every angle in an intuitive fashion. They can even communicate complex shapes to those with differing visual abilities that cannot consume a traditional computer model. A computer visualization can be spun with a mouse, but it is still trapped within the two-dimensional screen. Stereoscopic displays can help restore that third dimension, but even the best consumer VR system cannot render the kind of tactile realism of models that could be held in one’s hands.
Putting this all together, looking back on the history of scientific visualization for teaching, centuries of two-dimensional drawings gave way a century ago for a brief moment in time to these incredible three-dimensional representations, which in turn gave way back to two-dimensional computer screens. Consumer VR is bringing the third dimension back, but we are still a far cry from the incredible tactile realism of physical models.
In the end, perhaps the greatest lesson these models can teach us today is to remind us that in our race to computerize our world, sometimes the digital world is not always better than the analog one it replaces."

Spotlight news garnering wide interest from this year include from JP Morgan, their announcement of a successful test of a digital coin representing a fiat (example USD) currency – JPM Coin — blockchain-based technology enabling the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional accounts. This matters since it’s estimated that JP Morgan influences $6 Trillion US in daily transactions. Another example includes Master Card with an estimated 81 patents in blockchain and ranked amongst the top in blockchain. All major vendors such as Microsoft and IBM have blockchain platforms and/or tools together with consortia including: R3 (example use, financial services), Hyperledger (example use, supply chain), BiTA (example use, transportation logistics and freight), B3i (example use, insurance).
Blockchain (and distributed ledger) is the underlying technologies behind cryptocurrencies but evolving way beyond. From the WEF Future of Jobs report, by 2022, adoption forecasts include across 12 industries at 45% however differing widely such as financial services at 73%, healthcare at 67%, infrastructure at 18%.
This became a focused area of discussion at the World Food Program (WFP) hosted session in March at SXSW “Around the (Global) Block – Blockchain for Impact.” What was intriguing were the discussions on the interplay of Blockchain with AI (artificial intelligence) since both involve data and driving value from working with data. Clearly, AI will be integrated with use cases of Blockchain.
Post session, since the deep insights were not recorded at SXSW, I did video interviews with the experts, appearing with the non-profit computing science organization ACM, to drill deeper in how blockchain is being used including with AI. The links to these informal chats are provided below:
Nadia Hewett, Project Lead, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology – World Economic Forum’s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution
Robert Opp, Director, Innovation and Change Management within the United Nations World Food Programme
Tomicah Tillemann, Co-founder and Director, Blockchain Trust Accelerator, New America; Chairman, Global Blockchain Business Council
The WFP hosted the session to engage in an open dialogue about the social impact of using blockchain and looking at these questions (which are covered in the post-session ACM chats):
– Are there meaningful examples of how blockchain can best be leveraged for social impact?
– Are we pushing to adopt blockchain because of the hype or is it real?
– What are the key limitations to scaling-up blockchain projects? What are examples of overcoming these barriers?
– What role do/should governments play in investing in promising ideas and technologies? How can policy initiatives ensure impact?
– How important is moving to ‘user-centric’ data management in the impact space?
– What (under-served) sectors or regions do you think a blockchain application could have the greatest impact?
– How does blockchain align with other disruptive technologies like IoT and AI/ML?
The biggest use cases are with United Nations Agencies
The UN World Food Program’s (WFP) Building Blocks pilot is using blockchain at refugee camps throughout Jordan where via blockchain, refugees receive food vouchers for grocery stores by simply looking at an iris scanner that reads refugees’ biometric data.
The program already operates at a large scale. Post-SXSW session, Robert Opp added these comments, “At WFP we see enormous potential to apply frontier technologies like blockchain and AI to our work. We are now using blockchain to support Syrian refugees living in Jordan to be able to purchase food at local stores. It started as a small pilot, but now reaches 107,000 people and has been expanded to include another UN agency, UN Women for their programmes. The programme is both increasing transparency and reducing costs.”
Added insights on the WFP Innovation Accelerator
821 million, or one out of every nine people, still do not have enough to eat.
WFP’s Innovation Accelerator was created in 2015 to identify new ideas and approaches for global solutions. Areas in active exploration and real-world implementation include: machine learning, artiﬁcial intelligence and blockchain.
In 2018, the WFP supported 28 sprint and scale projects in 42 countries. Building Blocks was the ﬁrst implementation of blockchain at WFP and comprise the largest blockchain-based cash-distribution system in the humanitarian sector. Over 380 farmer organizations digitalized their business operations and conducted US$ 3 million worth of transactions with the Farm to Market Alliance platform. Over 6,000 beneﬁciaries were reached in seven countries with the WFP hydroponics technology.
In 2018, Building Blocks: served over 107,000 refugees; transferred US$ 37 million in cash-based assistance; processed more than 1.6 million transactions; saved 98% in ﬁnancial transaction fees. The blockchain system improves WFP’s services’ transparency, efficiency, security, and speed.
In addition, the underlying architecture of Building Blocks can also be applied to other blockchain use cases, such as supply chain management and digital identity.
In 2018, the Innovation Accelerator supported several projects such as RUDA, an Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Aerial Imagery platform for rapid data analysis in emergencies. Added examples include the Child Growth Monitor – a mobile application for better malnutrition detection using 3D cameras and AI; and Cloud2Street – providing high-resolution ﬂood mapping and monitoring system.
During the SXSW session, other notable examples included the successful launch of “bond-I” from the World Bank.
The World Bank funds development through bond issue—more than $50B US for sustainable development. As noted by Denis Robitaille, World Bank Group Chief Information Officer: “Helping countries transition to technology-led development is key to our goals of reducing poverty and promoting lasting development. This is at the heart of the World Bank’s Innovation Lab—and this pioneering bond is a milestone in our efforts to learn how we can advise our client countries on the opportunities and risk that disruptive technologies offer as we strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.”
SXSW panel insights
Together with the post-session chat with the ACM, Nadia commented further, “While emerging technologies have the disruptive potential to solve pain points in the social impact space, technology alone is not enough to unlock opportunities. Policy and governance elements – the conditions that need to be in place to create an enabling environment for stakeholders to do the right thing and for the technology to be truly transformative – are critical. By taking a user-centric approach, both the public and private sectors play a role in policy initiatives for these rapidly evolving technologies.”
During the panel session and post-session chat, Tomicah elaborated on:
– Work in the Rockefeller Foundation and jurisdictions around the world to develop modular, interoperable, open source blockchain platforms to power the public sector. Recent examples include their successful blockchain-based mobile voting project in the November elections in West Virginia and the blockchain land registry in the Republic of Georgia.
– The Blueprint for Blockchain and Social Innovation that they published at Davos.
– Their projects with the State Department, Harvard, Levi Strauss, Coca-Cola … to use blockchain in worker rights and wellbeing applications.

These Are The World's Most Hacked Passwords -- Is Yours On The List?,www.forbes.com,Kate O'Flaherty,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2019/04/21/these-are-the-worlds-most-hacked-passwords-is-yours-on-the-list/,"

Why it matters
Breaches are getting bigger all the time: The Collection #1 breach, for example, saw more than a billion unique email addresses and passwords posted to a hacking forum for anyone to see. Last year, there were major breaches of the likes of Marriott , British Airways and Facebook , among others.
It could be argued that some firms aren’t doing enough to protect people’s data but there is one thing users can do: take control of your own security by trying to follow best practices.
What to do
It goes without saying that if you see your password on the list, you need to change it now. You can also start to follow a few simple guidelines. Passwords need to be strong, but they should also be unique across each of your different accounts.
Of course, some accounts hold more sensitive details than others – your email for example. But concerningly, less than half surveyed by the NCSC say they do not always use a strong, separate password for their main email account. The NCSC itself offers a lot of helpful advice on its site , including avoiding credential reuse and choosing strong passwords comprised of three or more random but memorable words.
If that’s tough to remember, I’d recommend a line from a book or a song – and also do not be afraid to have a physical book for your passwords. As long as you keep this separately from your devices and not in a text file on your desktop, it’s actually pretty secure.
Better still, use a password manager such as LastPass or 1Password. This creates passwords for you which removes the need to remember them. These need to be secured with a master password, which must itself be strong or hackers could access all of your credentials in one handy place.
Dr Ian Levy, NCSC technical director, told me: “Password managers, whether an app, built into your browser or your device, can help with the burden of remembering lots of different passwords. Just remember to make your master password strong, along the lines of our guidance .”
It’s also a good idea to have a look at Troy Hunt’s site, HaveIBeenPwned. You can enter your emails and passwords here to check if they have shown up in any breaches. For those of you concerned about doing this, don’t be: It’s good to be suspicious but this site is great tool to help ensure you are changing your passwords when you need to.

How Does The Express Logic Acquisition Help Microsoft And The IoT Ecosystem - plugilo.blog,www.forbes.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2019/04/21/how-does-the-express-logic-acquisition-help-microsoft-and-the-iot-ecosystem/,"On April 18th, Microsoft has announced the acquisition of Express Logic, a San Diego-based embedded software company, for an undisclosed sum. Since its entry into the IoT market through Azure and Windows 10 IoT Core, Microsoft has been making significant investments. Last year, Julia White, CVP for Azure, announced an investment of $5 billion in IoT over the next four years. The latest acquisition of Express Logic indicates the commitment of Microsoft towards building an end-to-end IoT platform.
Electronic Chip
Pixabay Why did Microsoft acquire Express Logic? How does this acquisition help the company and its partners?
Here is an attempt to address these questions.
Express Logic – An embedded OS company
Express Logic has been building and deploying real-time operating system (RTOS) since 1996.
An RTOS is a niche, specialized, purpose-built operating system designed exclusively for constrained devices such as microcontrollers. Unlike general purpose operating systems like Linux and Windows, RTOS manages the OS and the code written explicitly for the device in real-time. Think of it as the firmware that can be flashed to a device.
Express Logic has an RTOS called ThreadX that’s been deployed in over 6.2 billion devices. With a small footprint of 2KB, the OS can be deployed in resource-constrained devices including microcontrollers. ThreadX runs on most popular 32/64-bit microprocessors, out-of-the-box, thoroughly tested and fully supported.
ThreadX is the foundation of Express Logic's X-Ware IoT Platform, which also includes embedded file support (FileX), embedded UI support (GUIX), embedded TCP/IP and cloud connectivity (NetX/NetX Duo), and USB support (USBX). All the components are built in a modular fashion that can be assembled to form a platform.
Though not open source, ThreadX is distributed through a model in which source code is provided and licenses are royalty-free. It is available for a variety of platforms including ARM, Intel, NXP, TI and Xilinx. It even supports the most recent FPGA platform from Intel based on Arria 10.
NASA used Express Logic's ThreadX in the Sensor Data Acquisition (SDA) component of Deep Impact, a spacecraft designed to study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1.
Why did Microsoft buy Express Logic?
The Express Logic acquisition is strategic to Microsoft which will help the company in connecting millions of devices to its Azure cloud platform.
Microcontrollers are cheap electronic chips that are found almost everywhere. From TV remote controllers to microwave ovens to even doorbells, all modern electronic devices are based on microcontrollers.
With the rise of smart devices, consumers want to control everything from the Internet. The mobile phone is transforming into a universal remote control. Even in industrial environments, connected factories and machinery is becoming the norm. Microcontrollers are at the front and center of the connected world.
Traditional electronic and device manufacturers are not equipped to deal with connected platforms. They are looking for a turnkey solution that will help them build smart devices that take advantage of the cloud and IoT ecosystem.
With the Express Logic acquisition, Microsoft is going to turn ThreadX into an RTOS ready for smart devices. Microsoft will make ThreadX the cloud-enabled RTOS by extending the kernel to include libraries that talk to Azure IoT. Each device powered by ThreadX will gain secure and instant connectivity to Microsoft Azure IoT Hub. When deployed in highly resource-constrained devices, ThreadX will enable the devices to discover and communicate with Azure IoT Edge devices. This architecture and topology can connect every ThreadX-based device with Azure IoT Hub.
Microsoft will exploit the popularity and the reach of ThreadX in on-boarding millions of microcontrollers to its IoT platform. This move will also help Microsoft in countering the threat from AWS IoT. Two years ago, Amazon acquired FreeRTOS to augment its kernel with capabilities to talk AWS IoT Core and AWS Greengrass. Microsoft is all set to do the same with Express Logic’s ThreadX RTOS.
What happens to the Azure Sphere?
Almost a year ago, Microsoft announced Azure Sphere, a secure software platform for microcontrollers.
Azure Sphere has three components – certified microcontrollers, secure OS and cloud connectivity service. The researchers at Microsoft worked on all the layers to deliver an end-to-end stack that’s secure from the ground up. Microsoft has partnered with silicon manufacturers such as MediaTek to build Azure Sphere chips.
Why did Microsoft invest in Express Logic when it has Azure Sphere? Azure Sphere is an integrated stack designed to run on specialized microcontroller exclusively designed for it. Due to the emphasis on security, Azure Sphere OS cannot be used with every microcontroller. This is where Express Logic’s ThreadX plays a critical role. It removes the barrier in on-boarding pretty much any microcontroller to Azure. Due to reduced security policies and prerequisites, all the devices powered by ThreadX can be easily connected to Microsoft’s Azure IoT.
How does this impact Microsoft’s IoT Strategy?
The Express Logic acquisition extends the reach of Microsoft Azure IoT to the last mile. It gives Microsoft access to millions of devices that are waiting to turn into smart devices.
Express Logic ThreadX, Azure Sphere, Windows 10 IoT Core, Azure IoT Device SDK, Azure IoT Edge cover the entire spectrum of microcontrollers and devices. Devices that are powerful enough will consume Azure IoT services directly while the constrained devices will talk to the nearest Azure IoT Edge device for connectivity.
The investments in embedded software and RTOS combined with a scalable and secure IoT platform on Azure transform Microsoft into a leader in industrial IoT and automation."
Little League Institutes More Extensive Background Checks -- And Shows Their Limits,www.forbes.com,Bob Cook,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobcook/2019/04/21/little-league-institutes-more-extensive-background-checks-and-shows-their-limits/,"If you're a parent who signed up your child for a school sport or youth league, you probably got word that someone has done a criminal background check on any adults involved with the team in question. I don't want to freak you out, but that background check may be doing almost nothing to keep sexual offenders and child abusers away from your child. Now that I have your attention, I can assure you that there is an extremely strong chance that the people coaching your children have no bad intentions. But that background check you hear about likely isn't responsible because it scope is limited, and because it only can catch people who already are convicted criminals. As a parent, you don't have worry every moment that a bad person is going to attack your children, but you should listen to any little voice inside that tells you something doesn't seem right.
The limits of background checks are very apparent when you look at new rules Little League International has put in place for the 2019 season to make those checks more expansive .
Little League has instituted a rule that requires every league to submit every coach to a national background check conducted by a vendor. The first difference between Little League and many other leagues is that the check is actually national. In most cases, background checks are through state police agencies and cover only local or in-state convictions. (Assuming they're done: only nine states require background checks for non-school activities .) However, like most leagues, Little League's background check focuses on searching databases for crimes against children .
For Little League, if an individual appears on the National Sex Offender Registry , the league must immediately notify the organization's security director before the individual can participate. Part of the reason for this is that Little League acknowledges that its system could end up returning false positives, in part because of limits in what information states actually run to check backgrounds.
This is from a sample letter Little League suggests leagues send about the background-check process :
As part of the verification process, we provide information from various government agencies and sex offender registries. In most states, we alert Little League only when a criminal record matches at least two of a person’s personal identifiers, such as name and date of birth, or name and Social Security number.
However, sex offender registries from several states list offenders by name and do not provide sufficient personal identifiers to help differentiate between two people with the same name. Little League is aware of the fact that these states do not provide any other personal identifiers and still requires JDP [Little League's background check vendor] to report any match of an applicant’s name if it is associated with a criminal record, even when no other information is made available by government officials.

The other problem, and it's nothing that Little League or any other organization can do anything about in advance, is that a name doesn't get rejected unless someone is convicted of a crime. As we know from the Larry Nassar case, someone can abuse scores of children for years before getting charged with anything. As we also know from the Larry Nassar case, organizations can keep their heads in the sand or protect an abuser even once complaints begin.
Only a few days before I write this, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles just paid out its largest sex-abuse settlement ever to a single person , $8 million to a woman who, as a girl, was abused by the athletic director and volleyball coach at an all-girls Catholic high school, which was accused of ignoring previous warnings about his behavior. (He was convicted of charges related to this, so he should appear in background checks.) Also, you can search online anytime for coaches accused of, or convicted of, sexually abusing children and get back plenty of results .
Little League and many other organizations are sincerely trying to protect children, and doing what they can with the resources they can. Every league should do some sort of background check, if for no other reason than to get the most obvious threats out of the way. However, parents and league officials, while they don't have to assume everyone is an abuser until proven otherwise, do have to keep their eyes open to inappropriate behavior, be ready to report it, and be ready to take action -- no matter how connected the subject of concern."
"Terence Crawford Vs. Amir Khan Results: Winner, KO Highlight (VIDEO), Analysis And Reaction",www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/21/terence-crawford-vs-amir-khan-results-winner-ko-highlight-video-analysis-and-reaction/,"If you ordered the Terence Crawford vs. Amir Khan fight on Saturday night, chances are you're angry. Crawford won via 6th-round TKO, but it came after Khan was hit with a low blow and apparently told his trainer Virgil Hunter that he couldn't continue. Here is a look at the punch that ended the fight:

The Madison Square Garden crowd booed the ending vociferously, but because the foul was ruled accidental, Crawford wasn't disqualified and he was awarded the TKO win and successfully defended his WBO Welterweight title.
Prior to the low blow, Crawford was in full control of the bout. He dropped Khan with a counter right hand in the first round and outboxed him throughout the fight. Khan rebounded with a solid second round, but Crawford was dominating, and touching him to the head and body consistently.
The champion's advantages are evidenced by the official scorecards and Compubox numbers below.

Crawford with an all-time low blow. And the fight’s over. What?! Khan looking for a way out?

I probably will not be telling my grandkids about that.
— adam abramowitz (@snboxing) April 21, 2019
It certainly appeared as though Khan was looking for a way out. While the punch was obviously low, Khan didn't even try to utilize the five minutes he was allowed, and he had been complaining about an injured arm. He was showing the signs of a guy looking to save face in a fight he was destined to lose, most likely via KO. Crawford definitely committed the foul, but this ending won't stain his reputation. It was purely accidental, and instead, Khan is the one who will feel the wrath of angry boxing fans.
The victory runs Crawford's record to a perfect 35-0 with 26 KO. Khan has had a very good career, but this loss pushes him to 33-5 with all but one of the defeats coming by stoppage. Crawford remains in the pound-for-pound conversation, but it's difficult to imagine him being challenged any time in the near future. Crawford and his promoter Bob Arum again expressed a desire to face IBF champion, Errol Spence Jr., along with his promoter Bob Arum.
Arum called out Premier Boxing Champion's Al Haymon and named him as the major impediment to the fight that most boxing fans want to see.
Unless we see Top Rank and PBC work together on a fight between Crawford, Spence Jr, Keith Thurman or one of the respected welterweights under Haymon's advisement, Bud won't be seriously challenged by the fighters within his promoter's reach."
The Game Boy Celebrates Its 30th Anniversary Today,www.forbes.com,Ollie Barder,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2019/04/21/the-game-boy-celebrates-its-30th-anniversary-today/,"The Game Boy is 30 years old today. Credit: Nintendo Back in 1989, a new handheld gaming console was released in Japan. Called the Game Boy it redefined the world of gaming. Its legacy, with consoles like the Switch, is also still very much with us today.
While it took a few months for the Game Boy to hit the U.S. in Europe, it was over a year until they saw the plucky grey brick of joy.
The launch line-up of games was also very well done, with classics such as Super Mario Land and Tetris (in the U.S. and Europe) being a huge draw for young gamers at the time.
That was the thing really, the Game Boy opened up a new world of gaming possibilities for a younger demographic of gamers. So much so that it’s hardly surprising that series like Pokémon debuted on the handheld. My humble Game Boy collection. Credit: Ollie Barder
Not only did series such as Pokémon start on the Game Boy but also equally long-running franchises such as the Super Robot Wars games. With the latest being Super Robot Wars T available on both the PlayStation 4 and Switch.
The Game Boy also forced game developers to really drill down and focus on making the gameplay good, as graphically the Game Boy couldn’t do all that much compared to the TV consoles of the time.
The result of this gameplay focus produced one of the best gaming libraries of possibly any console ever.
It also goes without saying that I have been collecting classic Game Boy games for a while now (shown above) and they are all still a lot of fun to play.
So if you are wondering how and why consoles like the Switch are hugely popular the world over, the reason behind that is in the foundations that the Game Boy laid thirty years ago.

With the latest Japanese game charts listed over at Famitsu , Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain managed to sell 55,573 copies and topped the charts as a result.
To give some context to that figure, the recently released VR Labo Kit for the Switch came in second with 26,634 units sold.
Either way, the new Yuke’s developed Earth Defense Force spin-off game has done rather well in Japan. However, the main focus for Iron Rain was for it to appeal to a foreign audience, so on that count, it’s not clear how well it has done as yet.
Anyway, Iron Rain is a solid game and definitely one of the best spin-off games in the series and I hope it continues to do well.
The last mainline game in the series developed by Sandlot was Earth Defense Force 5 and that is also an amazing game.
So to see a spin-off like Iron Rain do so well is definitely encouraging and I hope D3 Publisher give Yuke’s more leeway on the next game they make for the Earth Defense Force series.
Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain is now available on the PlayStation 4.

Unpatched Windows 10 Vulnerability Uses Microsoft Edge To Steal Data -- How To Mitigate The Risk - Forbes,www.forbes.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/21/unpatched-windows-10-vulnerability-uses-microsoft-edge-to-steal-data-how-to-mitigate-the-risk/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Cybersecurity I report and analyse breaking cybersecurity and privacy stories Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty Last week it emerged that an Internet Explorer zero-day vulnerability could enable threat actors to steal limited data from computers running under Windows 7, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 (R2). Writing for Forbes, Jason Evangelho explained that while this is an archaic web browser the vulnerability could be ""exploited even if you never intentionally use Internet Explorer."" That sounded bad enough, but the impact was dulled somewhat by the proof of concept exploit demonstrating that it was the system.ini file which could be exfiltrated and in such a way that required a couple of clicks to execute successfully. Now things have got worse, a lot worse.
What is the Edge vulnerability?
New research has now revealed that Windows 10 users are at far more risk if they use the Microsoft Edge web browser. Security researcher Mitja Kolsek disclosed how that original proof of concept exploit could be ""improved"" in such a way as to steal far more files and with the malicious file being opened directly from within Edge. That malicious file being of the MIME HTML (MHT) variety. Internet Explorer creates a single MHT file to save a complete web page to a local drive, one that contains all images, CSS, JavaScript and internal links.
What Kolsek had stumbled upon while analyzing that IE zero-day was an undocumented Windows 10 feature, one that should boost the security of such saved file against malicious code being able to execute within the Edge sandbox. This security feature appears to effectively disable another, known as mark-of-the-web, which is used by IE to flag files from the internet as untrusted. ""We have found that the malicious MHT file doesn't have to be downloaded and manually opened by the user, just opening it directly from Edge can be made to work as well"" Kolsek explains . What's more, Kolsek says that the exploit can also be enhanced to make it operate with more stealth and ""extract many local files using a single MHT file.""
The Microsoft response
Things continue to get worse as Microsoft had already declined to issue a patch for the original vulnerability according to ZDNet , which reports the company as saying ""We determined that a fix for this issue will be considered in a future version of this product or service. At this time, we will not be providing ongoing updates of the status of the fix for this issue, and we have closed this case.""
Surely this new research will change that judgement? Well, maybe not. According to an email from a Microsoft representative published by Ars Technica , ""The technique described relies on social engineering and requires a user to download and open a malicious MHT file. We encourage customers to practice safe computing habits online, including exercising caution when clicking on links, opening unknown files, or accepting file transfers.""
How to mitigate the risk
Kolsek says that only Edge users are at risk, so not using the Microsoft browser makes good sense. ""No other leading web browsers and email clients we've tested are using the undocumented security flag on the downloaded files, which effectively blocks the exploit"" according to Kolsek, who seems sure that Microsoft will revisit the issue and develop a patch. In the meantime as a co-founder of micro-patching service 0patch , which is free to personal and non-profit educational use, Kolsek has also already created such a micro-patch for Windows 10 users.

Amir Khan Lost More Than A Fight On Saturday Night Against Terence Crawford,www.forbes.com,Brian Mazique,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/04/21/amir-khan-lost-more-than-a-fight-on-saturday-night-against-terence-crawford/,"On Saturday night, Amir Khan stuck it to boxing fans when he refused to continue after he was hit with a legitimate low blow in the sixth round by WBO Welterweight champion Terence Crawford. The left uppercut was supposed to bang Khan's body, but the punch landed in the Brit's nether regions. However, it does appear to hit him on the leg and perhaps in the testicle area. It's hard to say for certain. It would have been perfectly understandable for Khan to take five minutes to recover, but when his trainer Virgil Hunter asked him if he could continue, he said no. ESPN's Stephen A. Smith took note of this as well.
Trainer Virgil Hunter just told a Nat’l Audience he ASKED @amirkingkhan if he wanted to continue and Khan said “No.” its official. I AM DONE with @amirkingkhan . Don’t even want to see him fight anymore. He wanted Hunter to rescue him from an imminent Knockout. I’m totally Done!
— Stephen A Smith (@stephenasmith) April 21, 2019
Moments later, Hunter was interviewed and he used different verbiage. In this interview, it sounds more like it was his decision, and not Khan's to stop the fight:
""He was hit in the testicles!""
Virgil Hunter explains his decision to pull Amir Khan out of the fight with Terence Crawford #CrawfordKhan pic.twitter.com/nWRoCrAFqb
— Boxing on BT Sport (@BTSportBoxing) April 21, 2019
It doesn't matter if it was Khan or Hunter who informed the referee, ultimately this falls on the fighter. If Khan goes over to the corner showing a willingness to continue, there is no way Hunter stops the bout. Hunter did what any good trainer would do. He read his fighter and made a decision on his behalf based on the messages Khan was sending with his body language and words.
This decision saved Khan from taking a continued beating in a fight he was losing.
Crawford had already knocked him down with a hard counter right hand in the first round. Khan had some brief moments of success, but it was clear he couldn't land consistently enough, and he lacked the power to hurt Crawford. As the rounds wore on, Crawford was landing more frequently to the head and body, and Khan was beginning to show more frailty.

Getty Boxing fans have long known about Khan's weak chin. However, most would not have questioned his heart. In fact, legendary HBO commentator Jim Lampley once famously said this during a call of Khan's battle with Marcos Rene Maidana: ""will he hold? Will Khan hold? No. Too much heart.""
Unfortunately, few would laud Khan's heart after Saturday's disappointing and anticlimactic result. Frankly, Khan looked like someone trying to find a way out, and the low blow was his ticket. Perhaps he thought the low blow would lead to disqualification.
That only happens if the low blow is considered to be intentional. Therefore, Khan's inability to continue led to the TKO loss.
Khan didn't just lose the fight. He also lost respect within the boxing community. Smith tweeted his displeasure with Khan, but he wasn't alone, and others weren't as nice:
The fight is Stopped! in the 6th on a low blow from Crawford!
Crawford gets the TKO He looked like the best in the world tonight

Khan claims he didn't quit, but that he had been hit by repeated low blows and the last one made it tough for him. He says in the interview with BT Sport below that Hunter made the decision to call the fight.
After a history of colossal KO losses, the one on Saturday just looks plain silly for Khan. It seems no one is buying his story. Most are more comfortable with the notion that Khan quit. That is perhaps the most damaging word to have associated with any fighter.
Up to now, Khan had been called plenty of things within boxing circles, but never a quitter. That has clearly changed."
2018 Retina MacBook Air Gets Screen Update: Quick-Take Review,www.forbes.com,Brooke Crothers,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2019/04/21/2018-retina-macbook-air-gets-screen-update-quick-take-review/,"2018 Retina MacBook Air. Credit: Apple The Retina MacBook Air got a welcome display tweak recently, bringing it up to par with rival's displays.
The update boosts the brightness from an Apple-rated 300 nits to 400 nits, addressing a lingering concern about a display that is dimmer than competitors. Many of the latest and greatest laptops (including the 2018 MacBook Pro) and 2-in-1s are rated at 400 nits or higher. The 13-inch MacBook Pro, for example is rated at a maximum of 500 nits by Apple.
Dell's XPS 13 9380 4K model (which I have) is rated at 400 nits and HP's Elitebook x360 1040 G5 with 4K display (which I also use) is rated at 500 nits by Hewlett-Packard.
So, when I got wind of the macOS 10.14.4 update, I immediately installed it on my 2018 Retina MacBook Air. And, yes, it looked brighter. But to make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks, I checked with Apple and a spokesperson confirmed that the brightness had really, truly been increased to 400 nits.
For buyers still waiting in the wings because of display brightness concerns, that should remove any doubts. The new rating puts the Retina MBA on par with most high-end Windows laptops and gets it pretty close to the MacBook Pro.
Improves an already-great MacBook
Unrelated to the screen brightness, here's a quick update on my impressions of the 2018 Retina MacBook Air after about four months.
The Retina MBA has proven to be a no-regrets replacement for my mid-2017 15-inch MacBook Pro, my erstwhile main Mac for more than a year. Because I've been traveling more in the last six months, I welcome the switch to the much lighter MacBook Air.
And don't believe the benchmarks: it handles everything I can throw at it, despite having a dual-core low-power Intel Y series processor. Apple is no slouch when it comes to laptop design and they've engineered the new MBA to be a very capable performer with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD (the latter is so fast it makes up for the small amount of RAM).
Battery life is excellent, often lasting more than a day for me. And, needless to say, the Retina screen is a delight. MacBook Air with Retina display (left) and Dell XPS 13 9380.

"Marijuana Users May Gain Less Weight Than Non-Users Despite The Munchies, Study Suggests",www.forbes.com,David DiSalvo,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2019/04/21/marijuana-users-gain-less-weight-than-non-users-despite-the-munchies-study-suggests/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin Among the most well-known effects of marijuana is the irresistible hunger that kicks in for many people after using, referred to as ""the munchies."" No bag of chips, package of Oreos, or anything else sweet, salty or fatty is safe when the munchies start. So you might think all of that munching would result in users gaining more weight, but a new study suggests that’s not the case – in fact, just the opposite may be true.
Researchers analyzed Body Mass Index (BMI) data for 33,000 participants from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions , comparing BMI of marijuana users and non-users 18 and older over a three-year period.
They found a small average weight variance between users and non-users (around two pounds), but that modest difference held true across nearly the entire study group.
""An average two-pound difference doesn't seem like much, but we found it in more than 30,000 people with all different kinds of behaviors and still got this result,"" said lead study author Omayma Alshaarawy, assistant professor of family medicine at Michigan State University.
The study also found that marijuana users seemed to gain less weight over time than non-users.
""Over a three-year period, all participants showed a weight increase, but interestingly, those who used marijuana had less of an increase compared to those that never used,"" said Alshaarawy. ""Our study builds on mounting evidence that this opposite effect occurs.""
Other studies have found a similar correlation between marijuana use and lower rates of weight gain and obesity, but the likely cause is still in question. It may be that certain cannabinoid compounds in marijuana alter metabolism in the opposite way popularly assumed, or it could be that users adapt behavior to counter-balance the extra calories.
""It could be more behavioral, like someone becoming more conscious of their food intake as they worry about the munchies after cannabis use,"" said Alshaarawy. ""Or it could be the cannabis use itself, which can modify how certain cells, or receptors, respond in the body and can ultimately affect weight gain.”
Whichever is true (and it could very well be a combination of metabolic and behavioral changes), the researchers stressed that marijuana use should not be considered a diet booster.
""People shouldn't consider it as a way to maintain or even lose weight,” added Alshaarawy. “There's too many health concerns around cannabis that far outweigh the potential positive, yet modest, effects it has on weight gain.""
Along with that caveat, we should also add that this was an observational study looking for correlations, not causation. This research does not prove that using marijuana assists in weight loss – only that across a three-year period the researchers observed a steady correlation. More research will have to fill in the gaps to understand why this correlation exists.
In case you're wondering why marijuana triggers the munchies – the latest research suggests that THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, sets off a cascade of brain activity in neural networks underlying our sense of smell and taste. When that activity reaches a certain threshold, the brain responds as if we're starving, and the hunt for snacks is on. That's a finding based only on experiments with mice , however, so the precise munchies mechanism in humans is still not entirely clear."
How To Turn Satisfied Customers Into Loyal Customers,www.forbes.com,Shep Hyken,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2019/04/21/how-to-turn-satisfied-customers-into-loyal-customers/,"Share to linkedin Getty Sandy Rogers understands customer service and loyalty. He is the former senior vice president for corporate strategy at Enterprise Rent-A-Car and is currently the leader of FranklinCovey’s Loyalty Practice.
Rogers’ story at Enterprise Rent-A-Car is one for the customer service history books. During his tenure at Enterprise, he was part of a team that focused on improving service to drive customer loyalty. In 10 years, the company’s satisfaction ratings and NPS scores increased from 67% to 80%. The results were much more than just increased numbers. Customers were happier and service quality was more consistent. Best of all, here’s what made it worth the effort:
Sales tripled!
Rogers, along with co-authors Leena Rinne and Shawn Moon, wrote a book titled Leading Loyalty: Cracking the Code to Customer Devotion . It’s not about the Enterprise experience specifically, but focuses on the notion that increased customer satisfaction translates to more sales. The book also serves as a guide to how to achieve this … faster. Here are a few of the major takeaways:
The biggest factor in customer loyalty is empathy: Customers who give you high marks on a survey are telling you they’re happy, but that doesn’t mean they are loyal. I’ve always said that satisfaction is a rating, but loyalty is an emotion. You can’t always explain loyalty with facts and figures. There’s an emotional side. It comes from the company’s employees understanding the customer’s wants and needs and the empathy they display for those customers.
Empathy starts on the inside with employees: What happens on the inside of an organization is felt on the outside by its customers. The way employees are treated has a direct impact on how customers are treated. If the internal culture of a company fosters empathy and emotional engagement, it will have a similar positive impact on the customer’s experience.
Practice a mentality of hospitality: “We all know how to make people feel warm and welcome in our homes,” Rogers says. “But can we bring that hospitality mentality over the phone, online, and in person?” In other words, make the customer feel at home, metaphorically speaking. That level of engagement drives the emotional connection that, in turn, drives loyalty.
Empower employees to deliver the best level of service they can: The word “empowerment” may be a bit overused, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Let your employees come up with ideas to improve the customer’s experience. That means allowing them to break tradition and go outside of the established policies and processes. First, they must be properly trained. Then, the culture must allow them to take chances and reward them for doing so. Management must lead the charge to advocate empowerment. Good ideas for improvement could come from anyone – from the frontline agent to the CEO.
A regularly scheduled “loyalty huddle” is essential to creating customer loyalty: Take time with your team to focus on customer service and loyalty principles. Having brief, regularly scheduled meetings – say, once a week for 10 to 15 minutes – will keep the concept of loyalty front-of-mind. These meetings are opportunities for mini-training sessions and reinforcement of the most important loyalty principles. Rogers states, “If you’re serious about staying fit, you don’t stop going to the gym after finishing a program. If you’re serious about bringing loyalty principles to life, you do them over and over again.”
Loyalty is more than points and rewards: My opinion of many “loyalty programs” is that they are not loyalty programs. They are marketing programs. There’s a difference. Points or rewards programs can be copied by competitors. True loyalty is driven by empathy and emotional engagement. You must connect with a customer at a level that goes deeper than rewards points.
Adopt a loyalty mindset: This is about having loyalty for everyone in your life, not just customers and employees. Practice loyalty techniques and treat people with respect and empathy to build a following. Creating loyalty with others is not just a goal. It corresponds to how you behave and how you treat others. It’s genuine, because it’s who you are.
I’ve talked before about the need for authenticity in business. Loyalty ties into that. Loyalty is driven by a human, emotional connection, which you cannot have without maintaining a certain level of authenticity. If you want to earn your customers’ unwavering loyalty, take Rogers’ advice – and mine. Insert just a little bit of vulnerability, some empathy and a lot of authenticity into your customer service, and you’ll be amazed at the difference it makes. After all, the companies that succeed are the ones that focus on building customer relationships.

"This Entrepreneur Went From $400,000 In Credit Card Debt To Selling His Business For $1.65 Billion",www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2019/04/21/this-entrepreneur-went-from-400000-in-credit-card-debt-to-selling-his-business-for-1-65-billion/,"Reggie Aggarwal Reggie Aggarwal Son of Indian immigrants, a former lawyer and now a CEO, Reggie Aggarwal took on an industry worth more than the GDP of 90% of countries in the world and built a billion-dollar business in the process.
I recently hosted Aggarwal on the DealMakers Podcast . He de-coded a lot of what he has learned both as a corporate M&A lawyer for tech startups and through building a SaaS business which is now worth the better part of two billion.
Although he took what some might call a detour into corporate America, Aggarwal was always very entrepreneurial. As a kid, he ran a paint company, a lawn care and snow removal service, and rarely worked for anyone else but himself.
Founders: Why You Should Listen to Your Lawyer
Aggarwal attended the University of Virginia to major in finance. Then he went to law school and started practicing law in Tysons Corner, the Silicon Valley of the Washington D.C. area. He specialized in the M&A to IPO process for technology transactions. That got him excited about the startup space.
His experience also gave him substantial insight into founding companies. Law school teaches you not to be a team. It’s you on your own. Though you do learn work ethic and to work hard. He saw the difference between being a solitary worker and team builder and the greater potential of the latter.
He also learned a lot about structuring companies and where most founders go wrong. There are countless exciting things to work on at the beginning of a venture, but ignoring the startups’ equity structure is a common pitfall he saw and knew to avoid.
If there are cofounders, you make sure you vest equity. Otherwise, when one of three co-founders leave a company after one year, they still own a third of the business. Then the other founders are dying, working 80 hours a week, and are basically working for this person who still owns a third of the company. Aggarwal says “that can literally tear a company apart.”
In most cases, people tend to give up far too much their equity too early. Reggie points out that if you start a company with four people, and you've just given away 75% of the equity, you could have waited six months and hired the same person for 1% or 2%.
It’s your lawyer's job to walk you through the best and worst case scenario and be sure you are protected. Let them help you. They’ve seen it again and again.
Networking, Pain Points & Creating Your Own Aspirin
Reggie went on to found the Indian CEO Tech Council while a lawyer to bolster his networking opportunities. When it launched, members were required to have at least $10 million in revenue and 75 employees, or have raised $10 million in venture capital. Back in 1996 and 1997 that was a lot of money.
Once they had recruited all eligible members to join, he realized he needed to broaden the criteria to continue to grow. By opening up the organization to a larger group, he successfully grew it to over 2,000 members, becoming the largest CEO networking group on the East Coast.
There were four things he found common amongst the high achievers in this group:
1) They were willing to take high risks
2) They were persistent and consistent, and just never gave up
3) They really believed in what they were doing and success was possible
4) They were patient
Eventually, Reggie said to himself, ""Hey, if that person can do it, I can do it."" Shortly after, he founded Cvent, the company he has now been at the helm for over 19 years.
At the same time, it was painful organizing these events. He decided he needed to create the aspirin for his own headache. He would be his own first customer. That's how Cvent got started. He wanted to do away with tools like Excel, Outlook, and yellow sticky notes and automate it.
The Leap
One thing he learned from all the other failed entrepreneurs was that most founders never really take the leap full time. They don't execute because they don't go all in. They try to say, ""I've got to build this business, work my job, and once the business brings in more revenue than my job, then I'll quit."" Most people never get to that. Or it takes three years. If it takes three years, someone else already got your idea, and they're already building it.
Ideas are like buses. You've just got to get yourself on the bus and close the door as quickly as you can. Especially, because you have guys like Reggie. They're going to quit their job, work 100 hours a week, and put everything they own into the business. You're not going to be able to compete against someone like these other entrepreneurs that just go all in. You have to go all in.
Reggie embodied all in. He gave up a nine-year career making good money as a corporate lawyer. He was starting a tech business and didn't even code. He even moved in with his parents. They thought he would stay a year. He was still there at 35 years old. It was a proverbial write-it-on-a-napkin business plan, but he did take three to four months to build a team. Eight of his eleven original people are still working with him now, nearly two decades later.
One trillion U.S. dollars will be spent on events in 2019 across the globe. That's bigger than the GDP of all the countries in the world except 17 of them. Cvent is automating the event industry from picking your hotel to registering to your onsite experience like mobile apps. AWS is one of their big customers, and they now do around a million events a year.
Cvent ended up raising over $136 million in venture capital in 2012 - the largest raise following the recession at the time and subsequently went public via an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013. The dark days of the dot com bust were just an early chapter in the company’s history, where they laid off 80% of their staff, and Aggarwal had to personally take over a $5 million office lease. Still, with grit and perseverance, Cvent’s early investors ended up getting a 45x multiple.
To Sell or Not to Sell: It’s Not About You
After going public, Cvent began getting hit with unsolicited acquisition offers. The prices were 40% or 50% over stock prices, and they ended up getting a 70% premium. You don't want to be that guy or that gal that doesn't sell their company at such a high premium and misses the boat. You could get sued if you turn it down because people are going to be like, ""Are you crazy that you turned down the highest premium ever paid for a software company in the last 15 years?""
He didn’t really want to sell but says he realized “It was my fiduciary duty, it's not what I wanted. It's what's best for the shareholders.” That’s your real job as CEO. Vista Equity Partners took the company private again for $1.65 billion.
Reggie’s Two Top Tips for Startup Entrepreneurs
Cvent now has over 4,000 employees. However, out of the first 1,000 employees, he probably interviewed 800 of them. He was the chief. That's what he spent time on. He says “You could always get customers, but it's hard to get good people. If you get a good person, they'll get you, 100 customers.”
So, if you want to create really big success:
1. Have patience
2. Hire really good people

Jeff Koons' 'Anti-David' Epitomizing 1980s Excess Is Climax Of Media Mogul's $130 Million Collection,www.forbes.com,Natasha Gural,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/natashagural/2019/04/21/jeff-koons-anti-david-epitomizing-1980s-excess-is-climax-of-media-moguls-130-million-collection/,"Jeff Koons, Rabbit, 1986, Stainless Steel. Estimate: $50 million to $70 million Christie's No doubt 1986 was a transformative year.
A Soviet nuclear reactor at Chernobyl exploded, spewing radioactive material across much of Europe. The Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated 73 seconds after launching, killing all seven astronauts. The first ""Goodwill Games"" were held in Moscow. Comet Halley reached the closest point to the Earth, during its second visit to the solar system in the 20th century. Some six-and-a-half-million people donated $10 to form a human chain in “Hands Across America” to help combat poverty through local charities. The experimental aircraft Rutan Voyager made the first continuous non-stop flight around the world without refueling. The then-Soviet Union launched the core unit of the Mir Space Station into Earth’s orbit. Manned by Richard Branson, the Virgin Atlantic Challenger II powerboat broke the world record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.
Jeff Koons released his “Rabbit” sculpture.
“Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit”, a sculpture which, when it was released in 1986, would not only shake the art world to its core, but alter the course of popular culture as we now know it,” said Alex Rotter, chairman, Post-War and Contemporary Art at Christie’s. “For me, ‘Rabbit’ is the “anti-David,” which signaled the death of traditional sculpture – disrupting the medium in the same way that Jackson Pollock’s “Number 31” permanently redefined the notion of painting. From my first day in the auction world - this is the work that has represented the pinnacle of both contemporary art and art collecting to me, and it is an immense honor to be presenting it to the auction market in May.”
Collectors are expected to pounce on the stainless-steel “Rabbit,” which stands at slightly more than three feet high, and is estimated to sell for between $50 and $70 million on May 15 as part of the Collection of S.I. Newhouse, heir to the magazine and media empire that includes Condé Nast (publisher of such magazines as Vogue , Vanity Fair , and The New Yorker ), dozens of U.S. newspapers (including The Star-Ledger, The Plain Dealer, and The Oregonian ), former cable company Bright House Networks, and a controlling stake in Discovery Communications.
Christie’s is selling 11 works from the eclectic collection across its New York Evening Sales of Impressionist and Modern Art on May 13, and Post-War and Contemporary Art on May 15.
Other highlights include Cézanne’s “Bouilloire et Fruits,” (1888-1890), expected to fetch around $40 million, and Andy Warhol’s beguiling and darkly enchanting “Death and Disaster Series, Little Electric Chair” (1964-1965), anticipated to sell for between $6 million and $8 million). The sale of all 11 works, which is expected to exceed $130 million, also includes: Vincent van Gogh “Arbres dans le Jardin de L’asile” (1889) with an estimate of $25 million; Lucian Freud “Painter’s Garden (2003) estimate of $4 million to $6 million; and Roy Lichtenstein “Landscape with Boats” (1996) estimate of $7 million to $9 million.
“Si Newhouse was one of the most important collectors of the 20th century and well into the 21st. He personified the rare combination of a great intuitive eye and equally great was a breakthrough within the timeline of art history, signaling the end of all previously held notions of traditional sculpture, and the beginning of a new era for contemporary art,” said Tobias Meyer, advisor to the Newhouse Family.
Koons’ “Rabbit” was revealed at the Sonnabend Gallery’s “New-Geo” exhibition in 1986, ushering in a new wave of controversy in the art world. It embodies a moment in America’s socio-cultural history, punctuated by a grotesque magnification of personal wealth breeding an unquenchable lust for manufactured popular culture.
In the more than three decades since “Rabbit” was introduced, it has evolved into a global manifestation that’s drawn gawkers to exhibitions at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, Tate Modern in London, the Château de Versailles, The Broad in Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Best BBQ Ever - Your Ultimate Grilling Guide 2019,www.forbes.com,Larry Olmsted,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2019/04/21/best-bbq-ever-your-ultimate-grilling-guide-2019/,"Just about every year for as long as I can remember, here at Forbes I have been covering the best products in the world of barbecue, grilling, and every style of outdoor cooking, from Southern slow smoked BBQ to Brazilian rodizio. Last year I featured the Best Bargains for Backyard Cooking and a Father’s Day Guide to Ultimate Grilling Gear . My most popular article in recent years—with nearly half a million views—was a collaboration with world renowned grilling guru and TV host Steven Raichlen to pick the 10 Best BBQ Grills & Smokers on the market back in 2016 (still very relevant). This year I’m covering the whole gamut of backyard cooking, from great new grills and smokers at various price points to must-have accessories and even the best foods to cook. After a very long winter and late spring, the sun is finally coming out in much of the country, so let’s get outside and get cooking!
The IG Charcoal BBQ can feed 2 people or 30 by packing a lot of features and great value into a sleek well designed package.
IG Charcoal BBQ
Feed a Crowd: It’s not a backyard party without lots of flame kissed food, and lots is exactly what you get with the IG Charcoal BBQ : lots of capacity and lots of bang for the buck. The simple design gives you a large amount of cooking area, quality stainless steel construction with sharp looks, great heavy duty 4-inch caster wheels that make for easy storage when not in use, and a very functional dual purpose cooking surface: regular grates for grilling steaks, burgers or chicken in large (or small quantities), or remove these to turn it into a street fair worthy skewer cooking machine. Once you try the IG you’ll look for excuses to through kebab parties. This grill is also perfect for Santa Maria-style cooking, America’s lesser known fifth major form of regional barbecue, via central California.
It packs a lot of punch and great features in one neat package, my favorite being a rotating handle that raises and lower the coal bed like Argentinean style wood grills do with the cooking surfaces for fast, easy temperature control - the trickiest part of charcoal or live fire cooking. It also has an easy to clean up ash bin. It’s sleek, well made, highly functional and also has two generously sized steel folding side work tables that can be put down when not in use. You get all of this for just $499 - or as much as fifty dollars less from online retailers such as Walmart, Houzz and others. You’d be hard pressed to find a better-quality charcoal grill with so many unique features at this price - in fact, I doubt it is possible.
There has never been a gas grill like the deluxe new Ferno, which in addition to many other great features, allows you to raise and lower the burners with a wheel.
Ferno Grills Deluxe Gas Grilling: I have more than a dozen grills and smokers in regular rotation at my house, and every time I think there is no more room for improvement something like the Ferno comes along. When I heard about the Ferno - recommended by no less an authority than Steven Raichlen, the world’s leading expert on all things grilled - I had to check it out. The Ferno is the first real gas grill, and a high-end, high-performance one at that, to use a revolutionary flywheel design that allows you to adjust the height of the burners and flames. The fancy Argentinean-style asado grills use wheels like this to raise and lower grates over live flames, but no one had thought to apply the idea to gas, which is the most popular cooking fuel in this country, and the reality is that when you’re cooking a simple dinner for two, like a steak or two burgers, it’s a lot less hassle to use gas.
The flywheel is the big novelty, and lets you crank the heat up and sear like a top steakhouse, and then quickly move the fire away, faster and more responsive than simply turning down the dials on the burners. But that’s just one wow factor, and the folks at Ferno decided to reengineer the entire concept of the gas grill and pack in all the features you’d expect (but don’t always get) in a mid-four figure luxury cooking appliance. It has a flatter hood shape that’s “optimized” so there are no low points and you can cook two whole turkeys at a time, which few gas grills allow. The hood is also insulated, something seemingly obvious, but surprisingly few are, for much better efficiency and heat retention. For easier nighttime use, it’s got integrated LED lights.
This thing is well made, very heavy duty, and has two ample side tables that are removable for easy cleanup. It is these kinds of ergonomic and design bells and whistles that wow about the Ferno - it’s even got a unique swing out gas storage tube that makes changing propane canisters much less effort. I love the asymmetrical heavy cast iron grates that distribute heat well and eliminate hot and cold spots, while half the cooking surface has an extra narrow slot design to prevent things from dropping through - you can do a stir-fry style veggie sauté right on the grates, something impossible on most grills. Add a commercial temperature gauge, electronic ignition, 304 stainless steel - it’s all about the details, and you can tell the Ferno folks are obsessed. You will be too. There is just one model, one size, freestanding, very well made in Santa Barbara, California and it costs $4,800.
No matter how good or bad you are at cooking, you can look like a pro with the best BBQ apron in the neighborhood, courtesy of Filson.
Filson Might As Well Have The Best Apron: This one is more of a gift idea (Father’s Day?) than something you might buy for yourself - unless of course you are one of the thousands of Filson enthusiasts out there, folks who just can’t get enough of the venerable American brand whose motto for over a century has been, “Might as well have the best.” Filson is renowned for its nearly indestructible manufacturing and heavyweight waxed canvas “tin cloth.” This apron is made of tin cloth, and is equally adept at woodworking as BBQ, extremely durable, abrasion-resistant, with five varied pockets for grill tools, jars and bottles, a D-ring for hanging tools, and adjustable quick-release buckles allow for a highly customized fit ($180).
One of Sonoma's oldest and most respected wineries, Seghesio, just released a lineup of great food products including BBQ sauce.
Seghesio Winery Eat Better, Drink Better: Next year will be the Seghesio winery’s 125th year of making high quality wines in Sonoma, one of the oldest in California. Five generations ago, Edoardo Seghesio, a winemaker and Italian immigrant, planted his first Zinfandel vineyard in 1895. Today that plot is Seghesio’s Home Ranch Vineyard in Sonoma County’s Alexander Valley, and the winery has been synonymous with great zinfandel ever since. Zinfandel also happens to be one of the best - if not the best - varietals for enjoying with barbecue and grilled meats.
Because Seghesio’s wines have long been a perfect match for backyard cooking, they decided to up the ante and release food products to enjoy while cooking at home , including a Zinfandel mustard ($8) made with their wine, wildflower honey and stone ground mustard - think coarse Dijon with less mustardy kick and more layered flavors. It’s good on sandwiches, but I’ve become hooked on using it in to make salad dressing or cooking glazes, especially for chicken and pork. There is also a sweet and tangy Artichoke and Piquillo Pepper Tapenade ($14) that is perfect for accompanying cheese and cracker appetizers or atop grilled bruschetta. But the signature product is the Zinfandel BBQ sauce ($12), and it’s unlikely you will find another jar on the market made from wine this good. Seghesio’s Executive Chef Peter Janiak said, “Painted on ribs, slathered on pulled pork or brushed onto chicken while working your grill, this sauce will become a permanent staple in your pantry. Crafted not just with our zinfandel, but with the design of drinking our zinfandel with your favorite BBQ.” It combines the wine with sweet, smoky California chili peppers which are slowly simmered with tomatoes, brown sugar and molasses.
The products are great, but why stop there? For the everyday backyard dinner, pop a bottle of the 2017 Sonoma Zinfandel, the workhorse of the winery, blended from their vineyards in three prime regions, Russian River, Dry Creek and Alexander Valley ($26). When favored guests come over, or if you are mail ordering some of the crazy good meats described below, upgrade to the 2016 Old Vine Zinfandel, absolutely prefect with grilled beef ($40).
The Roccbox is a high-performance wood or gas burning pizza oven for the modern age, and has garnered rave reviews for its design, performance, and value.
Roccbox by Gozney A Taste of Old Italy: Even more than smokers or other specialized outdoor cookers, pizza ovens are a luxury that usually are very expensive and space intensive and not many backyards ever end up with one. There are some acceptable shortcuts for turning the top of a gas grill into a pizza oven, but even better is the very well designed new Roccbox . It’s a small, space saving, standalone pizza oven that uniquely lets you easily switch between two fuel sources, fast and convenient propane or purist beloved wood. And unlike most grill top sets, it reaches the crazy high temperatures required for producing blistering classic Neapolitan pies in under two minutes, soaring to over 900°. It’s highly portable (tailgate or the beach anyone?) and combines a classic pizza stone oven floor with extremely efficient body insulation and an outer silicone skin that makes it safer than metal bodied ovens, greatly reducing the risk of burns.
It’s got everything you could want, including a built-in thermometer that monitors the temperature from beneath the pizza stone, but the most ingenious innovation is the dual burner design. It has two machined and easily interchangeable burners, one for wood and one for gas (with a hose to connect it to the tank), both of which simply twist onto the body of the oven to create an airtight seal. The folding legs and burners are stainless steel, the kit comes with a much better than normal high tech, easy to use, no stick pizza peel (worth buying on its own), and at just $599 for the oven with shipping, the price point is way below most dedicated backyard wood pizza ovens. But why stop at pizza? In Italy they roast and sear all kinds of meats and veggies and breads and casseroles and pretty much everything you could think of in high temp wood burning ovens, and so can you.
Find out why Serious Eats cooking editor J. Kenji Lopez Alt, author of the New York Times Bestseller The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science , picked this as the #1 outdoor pizza oven on the market.
Engineer-driven startup Z Grills has been a huge hit, thanks to its high tech, multi-function pellet grills that work great and are great buys.
Z Grills The Starter Smoker You Won’t Outgrow: Pellet grills turn anyone into a slow smoked barbecue ace by allowing you to precisely maintain the required temperature with no effort while burning real wood. But today’s next gen pellet grills do way more than smoke, and are also fully functional grills and can even triple as outdoor ovens for baking. Red hot newcomer and fast growing brand Z Grills pushes this envelope and claims its top of the line model offers 8-in-1 cooking, from 180°F to 475°: grill, smoke, bake, roast, sear, braise, barbeque and char-grill.
For the past few years pellet grills have been the hot segment of the industry, and as a result they keep getting better and cheaper, delivering a lot more bang for the buck. If you don’t currently own a smoker and are ready to experience delicious brisket, ribs and pulled pork, along with burgers, steaks, and even breads, there are few better ways to take the plunge than with the affordable and high-quality Z Grills lineup. The relatively new company is engineer driven out of Burlingame, California. It started with a crowdfunded Kickstarter release, quickly got great reviews, and now has several models available for sale. Technology gear site TechCrunch called it “an all-in-one cookout workhorse that’s easy to use.”
With pellet grills, a digital thermostat controls an auger that delivers pellets to the fire, automatically adding fuel as needed to precisely regulate the temperature. The Z Grills design also adds fan-forced convection heat distribution, so your food gets cooked evenly no matter which side is up, for truly low maintenance, no fuss cooking. As an added bonus, it is much easier to assemble than most grills, and some are a real pain. Newer models have good looking stainless-steel covers, but all are heavy duty and well-constructed, especially for this price. Full function pellet grills start at just $369 and top of the line 700E with stainless steel cover and 700 square inches of cooking space is still a bargain at $699 - with shipping included.
Grilling staples go upscale at Nashville mail order butcher Porter Road, which makes hot dogs and burgers from dry aged, drug free, truly natural meat.
Porter Road Better Meat: Meat is the king of the American barbecue, but not all meat is created equal. These days just about anyone who knows how industrial meat is raised is switching to drug free, naturally fed animals, and I’m a big fan of Nashville-based specialty butcher Porter Road . The shop claims to be the first online whole animal butcher shop, and focuses on sustainability, using only pasture raised animals from small family farms in Kentucky and Tennessee that are hormone and antibiotic free, raised outside, and fed vegetarian, non-GMO feed. Yet compared to most mail order fine meats, the prices are extremely reasonable - the same or less as you’d pay at local butcher.
The Porter Road team turns out gourmet versions of backyard grilling standards, including a real rarity, hot dogs made from dry aged beef, as well as dry aged burger patties, house made bratwurst and Italian sausage. These kinds of sausages are hardly ever made with such high-quality meats. They also have all sorts of dry aged steaks, and hard to find great grilling cuts including Korean cut short ribs, skirt, hanger, bavette and the star of Santa Maria-style barbecue, tri-tip. With skirt steak from $12 a pound and free shipping on all orders over $100, you can afford to grill exceptional meat this summer.
Of course, if money is no object, let your fingers wander over to the website of Holy Grail Steak Company , which lives up to its name by sourcing some of the world’s rarest and most prized meats, as the only licensed mail order retailer of real Japanese Kobe beef in the country (there’s lots of fake Kobe online, buyer beware).
Mail order meat specialist Holy Grail Steak Co. lives up to its name with delicacies like real Japanese Kobe beef - they are the only licensed online retailer in the U.S.
Holy Grail Steak Company But they don’t stop at Kobe, and also carry many other famed Japanese regional beefs, including Omi, Matsuzaka and others. They also carry pure blood domestic wagyu raised in this country from imported Japanese cattle bloodlines (not the cross bred “wangus,” many retailers try to pawn off as wagyu), and high-quality Australian Wagyu, considered the second best on earth after Japan. Want something more traditional? How about dry aged, so-called “High Prime” steaks, taken only from the upper echelon of the surprisingly broad USDA Prime grading range. High Prime is the best of the best of American-style red meat, a small elite percentage of the less than 5% of domestic beef that qualifies as Prime. These steaks really are the beef lover’s Holy Grail, and they offer a bewildering range of varieties, cuts, and numerous multi-steak tasting “flights” such as “Upper Prime Black Angus Flight” (seven high prime steaks including ribeye, strip, filet and porterhouse, $375) and the ultimate dream box for steak lovers, “Legends of Japan,” including Kobe as well as Omi, Japan’s oldest regional brand going back more than four centuries and known as “The Emperor’s Beef” ($899).
The Grilla pellet smoker by Grilla Grills has an eye catching design, but wait until you taste the smoked meats it cooks.
Grilla Grills Grilla Grill: I’m a big fan of pellet smokers and grills, because you get real wood flavor much faster, more easily and at precise temperatures that are a cinch to control. But especially for making classic slow smoked barbecue, the Grilla by Grilla Grill takes it up an innovative notch by going with an unconventional, more kamado-cooker style shape. By venting out the sides rather than the top, they generate more smoke flavor. This is the key: while the Grilla can also grill at up to 500° with a cool no flare up technology, has a no-corner design to eliminate hot and cold spots, a unique swing door that reduces heat loss when opening the lid, fan driven convection, and heavy duty construction, it’s really about the smoky flavor you get. That’s why the folks at Amazingribs.com , the most respected and comprehensive reviewers of grills and smokers in the world, gave it their coveted Gold award for Best Value. The Grilla comes in two versions ($799 & $849), while Grilla Grills also makes more conventional pellet smokers and ceramic kamado cookers at equally attractive prices."

Credit: Geralt/Pixabay My recent article about how Microsoft’s dismal history of releasing dangerous Windows 10 updates gives people good reason to switch to a different operating system produced more mail from readers than anything I’ve written for Forbes in the last three years. Almost all that mail was from long-time Windows users who were fed up, looking for an alternative and asking about Chromebooks and Chrome OS.
Chrome OS updates automatically in the background without inconveniencing the user. Google rolls out security updates as soon as they’re ready and applies them silently when a Chromebook boots up. Compare this with Windows which interrupts work and forces an update either immediately or in the near future. Windows 10 updates are annoying, disruptive and and have a consistent history of breaking programs or making computers unusable.
Security updates for Chrome OS are not only painless, they play a key role in making Chrome what many consider the most secure operating system in the consumer market. Here’s why Chrome OS is so secure. Chrome OS locks malicious code in a sandbox. Credit: Clker Free Vector Images/Pixabay
Sandboxing
One way to increase an operating system’s efficiency is to let processes running on the system share resources. You don’t have to create a separate resource pool for every process if you create a common pool that every process can share. The problem with this approach is that malicious code that gets into the resource pool can spread throughout the system. The solution is sandboxing.
Sandboxing locks a process into an isolated environment that doesn’t share resources with anything else. If malicious code gets into a tight sandbox, it can’t get out. Most importantly, it can’t get out and embed itself in the operating system where it can create serious problems.
Chrome OS sandboxes with a vengeance. Every program and every app runs in its own sandbox. Every tab and every webpage in the Chrome browser is sandboxed. If you visit a website that downloads malware into your system, it stays in the sandbox. Close the tab and poof! it’s gone. Never see screens like this again. Credit: Google
Verified boot
Suppose something escapes the sandbox and infects the operating system. What do you do then? Simple, start up your Chromebook and the problem will probably be solved. Google calls it verified boot.
When Chrome OS boots, every component of the operating system is compared to the current version verified by Google. If a discrepancy is found, the operating system is quickly replaced with a clean and up-to-date version. This happens every time you start up a Chromebook.
Verified Boot is great for maintaining security but it only works if the user shuts the Chromebook down instead of putting it to sleep. If you’re switching to Chrome OS from Windows (or macOS) you may have gotten into the habit of letting your computer sleep so you don’t have to wait through the 30 to 90 second boot up procedure when you come back.
Breaking that habit with a Chromebook is relatively painless because Chromebooks are fast. My Pixelbook with an Intel seventh generation core i5 processor, 8 GB RAM and 12 GB storage takes about 8 seconds to arrive at the password screen and between 3 and 4 seconds to reach full readiness after the password is entered. Chrome OS is built for security from the ground up. Credit; The Digital Artist/Pixabay
Automatic updates
Add automatic updating to the mix and you can see why Chrome OS is so secure. During the boot sequence Chrome OS checks to see if a new update is available. If one is, it installs it without interrupting the user. It’s seamless, painless and efficient.
Aggressive sandboxing helps keep malicious code from infecting a Chromebook. If malware manages to escape the sandbox and infect the operating system, it’s discovered and eliminated the next time the system is powered up. Any security updates released since the last time the Chromebook was turned on are automatically applied. All of this takes place in the background without inconveniencing the user. All you have to do is use your Chromebook, turn it off when you’re finished and turn it back on. Powerwashing a Chromebook is easy. Credit: PaulBr75/Pixabay
Powerwashing
Chrome OS is more secure than other popular operating systems but no operating system is 100% secure. What happens if Chrome’s defense in depth fails and a Chromebook is compromised? You powerwash it.
Powerwash is what Google calls a factory reset. It completely wipes a Chromebook’s hard drive and installs a clean copy of the current version of Chrome OS.
If you’ve ever had to reinstall Windows, you’re probably thinking powerwashing a Chromebook sounds like a nightmare. In fact, like almost everything else about Chrome OS, it’s easy. After you reinstall Windows you have to manually reinstall most of the programs you were using on your Windows machine. If you’ve done that once, you probably don’t want to do it again. You don’t have to reinstall any programs or apps after a powerwash. If you’ve stored personal files on the Chromebook’s hard drive, you have to back them up before you powerwash and then reload them. If you store your personal files in the cloud, you don’t even have to do that.
You don't have to reinstall programs and apps because Google does it for you. The user signs into a Chromebook with their Google account. If syncing is turned on—which it should be to take maximum advantage of the Chrome OS security features—all the programs and apps on the Chromebook are always synced to Google’s servers. When the user signs in to Chrome OS on their freshly powerwashed Chromebook, Google replaces all the programs and apps just as they were before. You have to wait while your programs and apps load but that’s all you have to do. Power the Chromebook up, log in, and in a short time your system is just the way you left it minus the problems that led to the powerwash in the first place. Note that if you switch to a new Chromebook, this same procedure duplicates the way your system was set up on the old Chromebook. All you have to do is log in. Tired of malware? Credit: Google
Security and ease of use were built into Chrome OS from the ground up and it shows. If you’re thinking about escaping the constant threat that a Windows 10 update will bork your computer, give some thought to a Chromebook. You’ll not only reduce or eliminate your update worries, you’ll have the most secure computing platform in the consumer space and all you have to do to keep it up to date and secure is turn it on and off.

"If You Haven't Heard Of Extinction Rebellion Yet, You Soon Will...",www.forbes.com,Enrique Dans,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/enriquedans/2019/04/21/if-you-havent-heard-of-extinction-rebellion-yet-you-soon-will/,"Decarbonizing the economy by 2025 would mean removing 38 million diesel and gasoline vehicles from the roads and disconnecting 26 million gas boilers in six years. The Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit says this is “… an ambition that technically, economically and politically has absolutely no chance of being fulfilled,” but even so, it supports the movement and its actions as a form of activism. XR’s radical approach is very much “ be realistic: demand the impossible ,” but that does not make it any less interesting, or less necessary. Idealistic yes, but certainly serious, and whose goals are backed by many experts and that can certainly do a lot to raise awareness.
Environmental activism has now moved to its next phase, and will soon be on the political agenda, starving the deniers and the irresponsible of oxygen. It's important to be responsible and take action. We are going to see more and more movements such as Extinction Rebellion , Plan B Earth or Climate Strike around the world as the evidence of the true scale of the destruction we face becomes clearer. If for no other reason than self-interest, politicians and business leaders who think they can continue playing down the issue of climate change or just plain ignore it should give some thought to their own futures."

5 Ways To Develop A Team Atmosphere of Gratitude,www.forbes.com,John Hall,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2019/04/21/5-ways-to-develop-a-team-atmosphere-of-gratitude/,"Ceo showing gratitude to employee in front of her teammates Getty When was the last time you expressed gratitude to your teammates? Have you told them recently how much you appreciate their hard work? Have you mentioned how valuable their efforts are to the company as a whole? If not, it’s time to start cultivating more gratitude at work.
After all, gratitude is good for business — it increases people’s mental strength, enhances their self-esteem and empathy, and opens the door to new relationships. It also improves physical health and sleep.
Best of all, in my experience, people who are grateful and appreciative are more open and content. They see possibilities where others see closed doors; they want to make things better. They’re focused and dedicated because they want the entire team to win — they’re not simply looking out for No. 1.
Here’s how you can create a grateful team that looks out for its members:
1. Align rewards.
Rewarding your team members for their hard work and dedication is a given. But if you really want to show your appreciation, you’ve got to go beyond raises, bonuses, branded swag, gift cards, and perks. Your team won’t reject those rewards, of course, but to strike a chord, you need to think about offering rewards that align with your company’s values and goals.
According to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services report sponsored by BetterWorks , employee alignment is a top motivator for employees that leads to long-term satisfaction and positively impacts business outcomes. As a result, you have a more collaborative and productive team that most likely won’t jump ship. The reason? Your teammates know they have an important role to play within your organization.
Here’s the beauty of aligning rewards: It doesn’t have to cost you an arm and a leg. Writing handwritten letters to individual team members, thanking them for their specific contributions to a project, reinforces this good behavior. It’s an effective way to show you’re sincere, but it also communicates that teammates’ actions contribute to the bigger picture.
Other options include giving them a shout-out during a meeting or via your social media channels or company newsletter. You can also gift a teammate with something that makes his or her life easier at home or in the office -- a paid house cleaning during a busy work travel month can work wonders.
And don’t forget to reward your entire team when it’s deserved . Celebrate together by patronizing a business that uses your products or services, volunteering as a team, or doing fun team-building excursions like picnics or an afternoon at the movies.
2. Lead by example.
“A culture of gratitude starts from the top,” explains Karl Sun, co-founder and CEO at Lucidchart. “If leadership takes the time to recognize the modest acts that can so easily go unnoticed throughout the company, it encourages others to do the same.”
Sun adds, “People might feel uncomfortable calling out the sometimes seemingly insignificant things people do. But it’s a snowball effect — the more you express gratitude, the more natural and almost subconscious it becomes.”
If you truly want to show signs of gratitude, don’t be the CEO who implies your employees are lucky to even have their jobs. If you don’t radiate gratitude, the people who report to you won’t feel it in return -- or invest their energy in your business. Instead, emulate Richard Branson, who wrote , “Your staff are the lifeblood of your company. At the end of the day, they make all the difference between running a successful business and one that is just run of the mill.”
3. Spend extra time in the recruiting process.
Over the years, I’ve had some amazing interviews that made me extremely excited about a new hire. Then it all came tumbling down after I asked one more question or made a phone call while checking references. It’s times like these when prospective employees’ true colors start to show, and I’m grateful for avoiding a massive mistake.
It’s worth carefully investing extra time in the recruiting process. Be on the lookout for signs of appreciation: Do their hobbies include things like writing or volunteering? Did they send you a thank-you note? Did they stop by other interviewers’ offices on the way out to thank them for their time? Were they polite and respectful to anyone who helped them, from the lobby to the parking garage?
These small signs can go a long way toward letting you know whether a recruit is a good fit for your culture. All it takes is one bad apple to spoil the bunch — or, in this case, the current of gratitude flowing through your office .
4. Draw attention to people who show appreciation and gratitude.
This is similar to rewarding good behavior so it happens again and again. When you see somebody showing appreciation, point it out as good behavior. Just remember to be as specific as possible: “I really appreciate you helping Jane meet the project deadline” or “Thanks for letting me know that George worked through his lunch break to handle that client emergency.”
It’s simple, but it’s really powerful. By acknowledging something they didn’t even realize was a big deal — probably something they view as an automatic reaction — you’ve underscored how much you value gratitude. Aware that you’re keeping tabs on this, they’ll keep supporting each other.
5. Give your team a break.
It seems like your team needs to get a million things done by the end of the day. But, as Tom Freeman, a business psychologist, points out , “Breaks can be a vital part of looking after both body and mind, and it’s a foundational component of working smarter. Better breaks allow teams to stay energized and engaged.”
Schedule blocks for breaks . At Headspace, there are no meetings at 10 a.m. or 3 p.m., which allows people to go outside or meditate. Provide a good break space, whether it’s a quiet room or access to a walking trail.
Keep the kitchen stocked, too. Encourage your team to eat together , enabling them to chat while grabbing a healthy snack. It’s a proven way for people to get to know each other, and they’ll return to their desks feeling lighter and more grateful for their teammates.
I’d also add that you don’t want to throw more work at your teammates than they can handle. If they’re at capacity and you add to their stack, they’ll feel pressured to work straight through the day. They won’t feel very appreciative — or appreciated.
There’s no denying that gratitude can transform the workplace by creating a positive environment where people feel they’re not just “cogs in the machine.” Best of all? Building a grateful and appreciative team doesn’t have to be complex or expensive. Things that seem trivial, like handwritten letters and better breaks, can have a big impact.

"Amazon Is ""Littered"" With Fake Reviews...And Other Small Business Tech News This Week",www.forbes.com,Gene Marks,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2019/04/21/amazon-is-littered-with-fake-reviews-and-other-small-business-tech-news-this-week/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Entrepreneurs I write about technology developments for small business owners. Share to facebook Share to linkedin ASSOCIATED PRESS Here are five things in technology that happened this past week and how they affect your business. Did you miss them?
1 — Amazon littered with thousands of 'fake' five-star reviews, Which? report finds.
According to an investigation by consumer group Which?, Amazon’s customer review section is being overtaken by ‘fake’ five-star reviews from ‘unknown’ brands. After analyzing the listings of hundreds of popular tech products in 14 different categories, the group found that many of the highest-rated items in each category were from little-known brands, while thousands of positive reviews were written by unverified purchasers. In addition, Which? found evidence of duplicated reviews, as well as positive reviews for unrelated products, which suggests that the reviews might be automated. (Source: Independent )
Why this is important for your business:
If you’re an Amazon merchant there’s a lot of temptation to hire one of those firms that do fake reviews for your products. Obviously, that’s been done by a lot of businesses already. But this is a practice that will absolutely come back to bite you in the future. Amazon is cracking down on these companies and if your customers get wind that you’re being dishonest they will no longer be customers. Don’t give in to the temptation. It’s not worth it.
2 — Google Pay adds Gmail importing for automatically adding tickets and loyalty cards from your inbox.
Google has introduced a new setting for its Google Pay users with Android devices. It lets them have relevant data from Gmail automatically appear in the Google Pay app, including loyalty cards, movie tickets, airline boarding passes, etc. Users need Google Pay v2.86 or higher to see the toggle that enables the app. The setting is disabled by default, but opening Google Pay and clicking on Settings > General > Gmail Imports allows it to be toggled on. (Source: 9 to 5 Google )
Why this is important for your business:
Google is fully invested in expanding the use of its mobile payment service over the long term, and this week’s added features reinforces that commitment. Regardless of your business, you should be evaluating whether to accept Google Pay from your customers as another convenient way for them to do business with you.
3 — Dropbox challenger pCloud just became profitable.

Why this is important for your business:
Given some of its advantages over Dropbox, particularly for small businesses, I can understand why the company is now in the black. The pCloud service lets users back up and sync files across devices. It gives them 10GB for free and then charges for more storage and features. Unlike Dropbox or Microsoft’s OneDrive, pCloud functions more like an external hard drive. Once installed on a computer, the app enables files to stay in the cloud by default.
4— Report: as e-commerce keeps growing, 75,000 stores could close.
With American retailers announcing this year that 5,994 stores will close—a number that already exceeds last year’s total of 5,864—a recent report from Coresight Research now predicts that thousands more stores could close in the coming years. The reason is the growth of online shopping on sites such as Amazon. In fact, online sales currently account for approximately 16% of retail sales. And UBS analysts said in a research report last week that percentage will rise to 25% by 2026. (Source: WRAL Tech Wire )
Why this is important for your business:
Will this be the end of brick and mortar? I think not. But I do believe that today’s merchants will be best positioned to succeed if they sell products through different channels. That means not only serving customers in your store, but having a strong online presence as well.
5— Adblock Plus filters can be abused to execute malicious code in browsing sessions.
A security researcher has uncovered an exploit in the filter systems of Adblock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock which may permit attackers to remotely inject arbitrary code into web pages. According to the researcher, the issue lies within version 3.2 of the Adblock Plus software, which introduced a new filter option for rewriting requests in 2018. This feature is vulnerable to a security flaw that was thought to be ‘trivial’, and the issue could potentially be leveraged in attacks to steal online credentials, tamper with sessions, or redirect pages. (Source: ZDNet )
Why this is important for your business:
The company, in a blog post , says that it is “taking this very seriously and is currently investigating the actual risk for our users to determine the best countermeasure.” In the meantime, you should check to see if any of your employees are using this tool which could make your network vulnerable.

Why Reinventing Systems Beats Just Solving Problems,www.forbes.com,Brook Manville,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookmanville/2019/04/21/tomorrows-leaders-wont-solve-problems-theyll-reinvent-systems/,"Photo credit: Getty Imagine if you were suddenly in charge of rebuilding America’s infrastructure. Or overhauling our society’s healthcare. Or restructuring the tuition economics of higher education. How would you answer such a call?
Twenty years ago, you might have led the effort as a problem-solver-in-chief, creating a plan by breaking the big challenge into smaller pieces, hiring analysts to crunch some options, and then forging a compromise solution among competing stakeholders.
A Different Approach
OK for then, but not today. Or so argues Bill Matassoni , who capped his recent rollicking memoir of a forty-year marketing career with the bold claim that society's big complicated challenges now require some fresh thinking and leading. The book’s title sums up the proposition: Marketing Saves the World . Bill Matassoni (Photo credit: Kristina Safarova )
“Marketing?” I asked, as we started discussing the book. “That’s going to save the world?” (Disclosure: in 1987, Bill Matassoni hired me into McKinsey & Co ., where we worked together for a couple of years—long before either of us worried about rescuing civilization.)
“Well, it’s not just marketeers I’m talking about. All leaders have to reorient their thinking for big challenges ahead. They have to adopt a new sensibility and skills, which I’ve seen revolutionizing marketing over the last ten years.”
As we talked further, it became clear the skills and sensibilities he envisions are not about “fixing problems” but rather reinventing systems : the complex, interrelated processes, information flows and incentives that surround any domain of human society or business operating in today’s global economy. Matassoni argues that reinventing systems creates more and widely distributed value; and if done right, allows all stakeholders to share in the rewards and enjoy better lives as the system grows and adapts into the future.
“Two principles ground this approach,” Matassoni explained. “First, replacing traditional, linear marketing strategies (e.g. creating specific value, communicating it, then capturing it) with more dynamic systems thinking , and guiding the interrelationships among system elements, to create broader, ongoing growth. Second, relentlessly pursuing ‘win-win’ strategies so every stakeholder gets an outcome they desire—which Nobel-prize-winning economist John Nash has shown drives the best results. “
Matassoni wasn't promoting so much a specific methodology, but rather suggesting a conceptual shift for all leaders today: rethinking how to solve big problems with a new marketing-inspired mindset.
Five propositions emerged from our conversation. Ask yourself if any of these are now shaping—or should be shaping—your leadership too.
1.System change begins with system thinking . Many leaders today opine about “fixing the healthcare system” or “transforming the energy conservation system,” or building strategies for this or that business across “the entire ecosystem of an industry.” But how many, as Matassoni pointed out, do the homework to really understand what “system thinking” means? Or actually utilize its well-established tools and practices? What’s your own level of understanding about how to change a complex system, and redesign it so it continues to evolve and adapt? (Photo credit: Getty)
“If you’re going to move beyond incrementally fixing narrow problems— for example, not just lowering drug prices but rather transforming healthcare overall (e.g. simultaneously improving access, innovation, affordability, health outcomes)—you have to understand at least some system dynamics. Get familiar with basics of information stocks and flows , feedback loops , i ntervention points , etc. The work of Donella Meadows is a good place to start. You need enough background to work with systems specialists who will be on your team.”
2. Humanize your systems thinking with intangible values too. That said, if you bury yourself too deeply in systems thinking, with its often bloodless diagrams, you can lose track of real people. Matassoni commented further:“With everything dynamically connected now, you can’t just map information flows and feedback loops. You also have to pay attention to human emotions and purpose. Old marketing often missed that. Reinventing win-win systems goes beyond money and market share—you also have to consider things like different stakeholders’ sense of identity. In a healthcare system, how does the work doctors do define who they are, and what they aspire to be? Or nurses? Hospital administrators? What meaning do pharma researchers bring to their clinical trials? How do patients expect to be treated?"" (Photo credit: Getty)
3. Harness action with superordinate goals . To get at the intangible values of a system—and also prioritize the right information flows and feedback loops, Matassoni stressed that that leaders must define success ultimately with “ superordinate goals ”—communicating higher-level hopes and desires that can inspire people to pursue change together. Tomorrow’s leaders will bring marketing-style savvy to explain why overcoming this or that big challenge really matters to people. They reach for higher aspirations than the narrower objectives of classical problem-solving.
“Rebuilding America’s infrastructure is not just filling potholes or shoring up bridges. A great leader will engage partners and followers about transformational system change, for better transportation to all help people access better food, get education, improve their skills, connect more regularly with their families.” (Photo credit: Getty)
4. Run experiments, and keep learning . Matassoni insists that system reinvention must be an ongoing process of learn-by-doing. “Why aren’t our leaders running more experiments to redesign the systems of healthcare or higher education? Why aren’t we learning more from norm-breaking pilot programs in every major social domain? For example, restructuring the astronomical costs of attending college by learning from so-called income-share agreements , pioneered by Ashoka entrepreneurs and Purdue University --making loans to students, secured and paid off to 'investors' with slices of their later career earnings?”
5. Embrace the energy of capitalism. Traditional approaches to complex and dynamic issues without a known solution—be they societal or commercial dilemmas—often employ the multi-stakeholder discipline of “ wicked problem-solving .” Matassoni’s prescriptions echo some of that methodology—getting all the stakeholders around the table, understanding their different goals, engaging in adaptive learning—but he also criticized potential pitfalls. First, too much collaboration for collaboration’s sake: “In search of building trust, you can devolve into self-defeating incremental and ‘play nice’ compromises. You need stakeholders around the table to fight each other, to get better solutions. And you have to keep sorting for winners, and then fire people who can’t deliver or just want to obstruct things. Who’s ‘around the table’ has to keep evolving.” (Photo credit: Getty)
Second, avoid the feel-good corporate social responsibility : “When businesses participate—as they must—you want them pushing for everything they can get to help their bottom line—supported by the redesigned system. At the same time, though profit is important so is supporting the dignity and self-worth of everyone in the redesigned system. Healthcare reform that punishes drug companies, humiliates doctors or treats patients as stupid will fail.”
Third, beware a zero-sum game : “The key is rethinking systems for more growth, constantly making the overall pie bigger, so everybody gains more from the reinvention. The clever leader knows how to keep selfishness and even greed in the center of things, while at the same time finding ways so everyone wins what they’re due—both tangible and intangible rewards.”
Final Thoughts
Matassoni closed our conversation with a brief inspirational summary.
“The marketers of tomorrow are the best people to communicate why 'problem-solving' has to shift towards redesigning systems that can become self-sustaining. If you seek out other people who break the rules, look beyond older frameworks of just products and markets, and have some brains and guts to call out the deeper needs of our fellow human beings, the sky will be the limit.” (Photo credit: Getty)

Is It Better To Buy A Home With Cash Or A Mortgage?,www.forbes.com,Kristin Mcfarland,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinmcfarland/2019/04/21/is-it-better-to-buy-a-home-with-cash-or-a-mortgage/,"The idea of living mortgage-free can be particularly enticing for individuals nearing retirement. At this time, it’s also common for empty-nesters to consider selling the large family home in favor of a smaller property or condo that’s easier to maintain. Homeowners who have lived in a house for a long time and now have a low mortgage balance or perhaps no mortgage at all may consider whether it’s advantageous to buy a new property with sale proceeds in cash instead of getting a mortgage. Although pre-retirees may be hesitant to carry debt into retirement, the leverage can pay off.
Using leverage
Leverage is when your expected rate of return on your investment portfolio is greater than the interest rate for a loan. If you can borrow money for less than an amount you can reasonably expect to earn by investing the funds instead, then it makes sense to consider the loan. Of course, deciding whether to buy with cash or get a mortgage involves more than the spread between your expectations and the current interest rates, but it’s a useful starting point.
Ultraconservative investors, buyers during periods of high interest rates, or individuals seeking variable rate mortgages may find it more difficult to make leverage work for them with any level of reasonable certainty.
Here’s an example:
Assume that the Miller’s, age 60, are selling their house for $700,000 and their mortgage payoff is $200,000. They’re planning to buy a condo for $500,000 and put 20% down. The Miller’s can get a 30-year fixed mortgage for 4.5% interest and their expected average annual return on their investments over the long-term is 6%. The couple plans to work through age 66.
If they obtain a mortgage, they’ll make the mortgage payments out of their income while they’re working. Without a mortgage, they’ll invest the funds instead. If they retire with a mortgage, the Miller’s will tap their investment account for the payments once they stop working.
The question is: should they get a mortgage or purchase the new home with the cash proceeds from the sale of their old house?
In this example, it’s best to use leverage. Through the power of compounding, after 30 years, the Miller’s investment account would be nearly $260,000 greater if they bought the home with a mortgage compared to if they paid for the condo in cash, excluding taxes.
It’s helpful to note that many of the variables in this analysis are correlated. If the Miller’s increased their purchase price, the benefits of getting a mortgage would also increase. However, if the spread between current mortgage interest rates and expected investment returns narrows, the benefits of getting a loan will shrink.
A complex analysis
Unless you’re comparing a fixed mortgage to holding a 30-year bond, there are several key assumptions that homebuyers must make for the analysis. Since there’s no way to know with certainty what will happen in the future, it’s important to consider every aspect of the decision.
Here are some additional financial considerations:
Taxes. Homeownership has tax benefits and a mortgage plays a key role in realizing those benefits. Taxpayers who itemize their tax deductions can typically deduct mortgage interest on the first $750,000 of first or second home indebtedness, though there are other considerations following the 2017 tax reform legislation. This can be especially valuable for retirees who have lost many of their other options to reduce their taxable income (e.g., 401(k) contributions). Though tax implications are an important part of any financial decision, it’s important not to let the tax tail wag the dog: the laws can change at any time. Market volatility. Even if an investor realizes an average annual return of 6% (as assumed in the example above), the actual return will vary considerably from the average in any given year. The sequence in which the returns occur can have a dramatic impact on the outcome of the analysis. For example, in the Miller’s case, if their rate of return was -4% in year one and 6% for the rest of the 30-year analysis, the benefit of getting a mortgage would be reduced to $56,000, down from $260,000! Similarly, if the market were to outperform the average return in the first year of the simulation, the relative advantage of getting a mortgage versus buying with cash would increase. Adjustable rate mortgages. An ARM changes the analysis a bit as additional complexities and unknowns are introduced. An adjustable rate mortgage is usually most advantageous when homeowners don’t plan to live in the house for much longer than the initial fixed period. In this situation, buyers will also need to consider the likelihood of remaining in the home longer than expected, how the rate increases are determined, and their expectations of future interest rates. Although the risk is increased, when an ARM is appropriate, it’s a great example of using leverage. Practical considerations when buying a home
Buyers may also face logistical challenges or the pressure of a competitive market. Especially for individuals who have lived in their home for a very long time, decluttering, downsizing, and moving can be quite a challenge. Unless you can negotiate a sale-leaseback, or manage to perfectly align both home closings, cash buyers may be forced to stay in a hotel or rent during the gap.
Getting a mortgage may make the transition easier for some buyers who already have a down payment and still qualify for their loan while carrying both homes, as they may be able to buy a new home before selling their old one . Convenience has a price though, and there’s a risk the home won’t sell as quickly or at the price you expected.
All cash offers are the preferred tool for buyers in competitive markets. If a mortgage is preferable but you’re struggling to compete with noncontingent offers, one option might be to buy the new house or condo with the cash proceeds from the sale of your old home and apply for a loan after closing.
While buying or selling a home is an emotional decision, it’s important not to let your personal feelings cloud your better judgement. Buying too much home or deciding to purchase with cash solely because you can could dampen your retirement lifestyle in the long run."
Struggling To Attract Top Tech Talent? Here Are The 7 Recruiting Mistakes You're Making,www.forbes.com,Heidi Lynne Kurter,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/heidilynnekurter/2019/04/20/attract-top-tech-talent/,"In a tight labor market driven by tech talent, it’s a dog-eat-dog world and companies are struggling to attract quality candidates to drive their business forward. According to a study by Bersin by Deloitte , the average recruitment process takes about 52 days. Yet, top candidates only last on the market about 10. It’s no surprise technology is impacting the way recruiters and HR professionals do their jobs today. To be successful, they need to embrace technology and use it to improve the speed, efficiency and presence of their recruiting practices. Companies are no longer able to get away with keeping their internal culture a secret. In fact, the more transparent companies are about their business, the more likely they’re able to attract high potential candidates.
Technology enables candidates to see how engaged companies are online with their audience. It also publicly displays the presence companies have on social media and job rating websites such as Kununu and Glassdoor . Tech talent are more likely to apply to companies with a positive reputation and active presence than those who lack one entirely.
The importance of a strong online presence is indisputable but it doesn't commit candidates to accept job offers. How companies require candidates to engage with their recruiting process is ultimately what converts candidates into employees. Poor processes cause companies to lose talent due to these 7 common mistakes.
Lacking A Solid Recruiting Strategy
If companies wing their recruiting plan, they risk losing high potential candidates to companies who have one. Nothing makes a candidate second guess a company like a disorganized interview process.
Companies can prevent losing talent by creating a strategy involving the hiring manager and interview team to develop an agreed-upon process from start to finish. A solid recruiting strategy requires the participation and buy-in of everyone involved in the process.
Recruiters should set time aside to review the role with the hiring manager and interview team to lay out a clearly defined process with a clear idea of how the candidate will navigate the process. When everyone has a clear understanding of their role and responsibilities it reduces the stress and creates a seamless flow for the candidates who go through it.
Relying On Old Practices
Companies like Google and Microsoft are retiring college degree requirements in favor of more hands-on experience. Hackathons and online academies such as Coursera , Udemy and EDX make it easy for passionate learners to expand their skill set. With a mix of paid and free courses, it allows candidates to improve and expand their knowledge and access quality content from top universities for affordable prices.
Passing over resumes and applications because candidates don’t check all of the boxes is the easiest way to miss out on top talent. It’s unfair to assume candidates who have all the educational requirements outsmart candidates with more drive and hands-on experience.
A majority of tech professionals are active in public online communities such as GitHub and Stack Overflow , giving recruiters a firsthand look at their knowledge and skill set. Stack Overflow is a public online community for developers and engineers to ask and answer each other's technical questions. GitHub is an online open source community where tech talent can build, update and modify code as well as experiment with others code.
These two resources are simple and effective ways for recruiters to evaluate potential candidates on the quality of their code, how active they are in contributing to repositories and their engagement in the online community. According to a Stack Overflow survey , 69% of developers are self-taught and less than half hold a bachelor's degree. If companies value candidates on their degree alone they risk missing out on quality tech talent.
Using Jargoned Descriptions
Many leaders are revamping their job titles and descriptions to invoke a sense of fun and excitement for the applicant. The issue that arises is when candidates gloss over jobs with titles they’ve never heard of or don’t connect with. When creating new job titles for roles, make sure they’re ones that translate well into the role.
Leaders who seek the feedback of current employees to help brainstorm new titles benefit greatly when it comes to putting together a solid job description that speaks to ideal candidates. Current employees are able to bring a different and honest perspective to the discussion. They can accurately present any possible challenges with jargoned or unique job titles and introduce trendy titles on the market that competitors are having success with. Those currently in the role can also help create concise bullet points that speak the language of ideal candidates while accurately painting a picture of what the position entails.
Optimizing Postings For Mobile Devices
It’s no surprise technology has taken the lead in how workplace activities are conducted. This is no different to how recruiting candidates is done either. The new generation of workers have a short attention span when it comes to reading through novel-like job descriptions and want something that speaks to them while concisely getting their point across.
According to HR Digital Tech , 90% of job seekers use their mobile device to search for jobs and 89% of those believe mobile compatibility is crucial to how the job search is done. Companies who neglect to optimize their job posts for mobile devices risk them never being seen.
Creating A Lasting Impression
Recruiters and professionals tend to focus solely on candidates who progress through interview stages and neglect providing feedback to those who haven’t. Not only does this create a poor candidate experience but it prevents them from referring others who might be a better fit for the position. This causes companies to lose out on potential star talent.
Recruiters and HR professionals can prevent this by scheduling follow-ups and rejection emails as a mandatory part of the process. Dedicate one day a week to sending rejection emails with brief feedback to those who didn’t make it to the next stage. It's easy to forget just because they may not be the companies first choice, the company could be their only choice.
Making False Assumptions
Failing to ask applicants what their long-term goals are and making assumptions about their career interests is the easiest way to lose a good candidate. Henna Pryor, Recruiting Director and Career Coach at kforce has seen numerous mistakes in her 14-year career as a Finance and Accounting Recruiter. Pryor says, where most relationships go wrong is when recruiters don’t take the time to get to know their candidates.
Instead of directly asking them about their goals and motivations, they make false assumptions. This almost never works out well for the company. Dedicate one question to inquiring about their goals and career ambitions to make sure should they take the position, they're aligned with the development and career progression the company is able to provide.
Forcing Candidates Through A Poorly Designed Process
Poor candidate experiences aren’t exclusive to the interaction a recruiter has with a candidate . It’s also the way candidates navigate the application process. Companies who lack a visible link to the career page on their website risk losing applicants before they find it.
Stephanie Troiano at The Hire Talent says “in a tight labor market, forcing candidates through a cumbersome, lengthy and disjointed process is the easiest way to lose good candidates to other opportunities and competitors.” Troiano recommends a strong focus on creating a smooth and easy process without barriers and hoops to jump through.
At a recent HR event hosted by Join Solutions AG , Margarida Pfaumann, Head of HR at Travelcircus , spoke about the various ways companies can create a positive applicant experience. Pfaumann stressed the importance of candidate centricity and mentioned the challenges surrounding application processes.
She said, one of the reasons companies lose great candidates is because they create mazes for applicants to jump through such as requiring a login for user accounts and a lack of containerization for business units when searching open positions on websites.
If companies want to attract and win over tech talent, they must start by assessing their current recruiting strategy from start to finish and close any gaps that pose challenges for potential candidates. Developing a smooth and easy flow helps strengthen the way applicants navigate the recruiting process creating an overall positive candidate experience."

'Shazam' Flies High To $300+ Million Worldwide,www.forbes.com,Mark Hughes,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2019/04/21/shazam-flies-high-to-300-million-worldwide/,"Warner Bros.' and DC Films' latest superhero release Shazam! passed another milestone this weekend, flying high to $300+ million and beyond. But with Avengers: Endgame right around the corner, can Shazam! to maintain enough momentum to carry it to a $400 million finish?
Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer star in Warner's ""Shazam!""
Source: Warner Bros. Shazam! looks to finish the weekend with $15-17 million domestic, bringing its stateside cume to $120+ million. Worldwide, it seems Shazam! will end the weekend around $310-315 million. [UPDATE: final weekend estimates are on the high end of potential again, raising the total global box office to an estimated $322 million.]
At this point, and in the face of Avengers: Endgame's imminent domination of the global box office starting next week, it appears likely Shazam! will add another $20+ million to its domestic haul and about $40+ million from foreign territories, to lift its final worldwide tally to somewhere in the vicinity of $380+/- million.
That figure is lower than I would've expected, to be frank. I believed the film's A Cinemascore from audiences, plus its 90% ranking at Rotten Tomatoes, signaled such buzz that (combined with how fantastic the movie legitimately is) it would exceed expectations and hit at least in the $500 million range. After it opened notably ahead of tracking and most estimates, with about $55+ million including early screenings (which I count toward the total opening cume, since those are sales that would've otherwise happened during the first weekend anyway) as I personally predicted in my pre-release review, I thought word of mouth would ensure enough attendance to help Shazam! overachieve in a much bigger way.
Asher Angel leaps into action in Warner's ""Shazam!""
Source: Warner Bros. But this is why it's important to remember the distinction between expectations of overperformance, and the reality of what it takes to be successful in its own right. Because with a lower budget and conservative P&A costs, Shazam! hit break-even somewhere between $235-250 million, so a finish north of $350 million makes it a successful investment and something at least close to $400 million is a win for a modestly budgeted smaller-scale family-friendly superhero movie.
It's worth noting that while Shazam! has been a comic staple for decades, the frequency of his appearances and the familiarity among younger fans is limited. Likewise, although the character featured in a TV show in the 1970s, few people except middle-aged fans really remember that program (although it's available to watch on the DC Universe streaming service, for younger fans interested in what older folks grew up with as live-action comic book entertainment prior to this modern golden age of superhero cinema).
The point is, Shazam! features a lesser-known hero for modern mainstream audiences around the world, in a lower-budgeted film with more moderate stakes and scale, with a much smaller marketing campaign. It's also probably relevant that the trailers and marketing did such a good job of keeping secrets and avoiding giving much of the movie away, that it might've been slightly too secretive -- if the final trailers before release had revealed more of the ensemble of kid actors, and the larger Shazam family of costumed heroes, then that might've provided a little extra boost to the opening numbers and more buzz about this as a movie featuring an entire family of kid superheroes.
Jack Dylan Grazer and Zachary Levi star in Warner's ""Shazam!""
Source: Warner Bros. Hindsight being 20/20, it's not really fair to nitpick the marketing choices too much, since obviously there's much to praise when trailers refuse to reveal all of the big moments and let audiences discover the best stuff for themselves in the theater. And had the trailers actually given away those surprises, then a lot of folks would be complaining and criticizing that decision. Lastly, the marketing as-is was generating terrific buzz already without having to expend additional resources, and it did open far ahead of estimates, so there's no telling how much or how little more revelations would've moved the needle.
With world of mouth being so positive already, it's hard to imagine there is some sizable audience out there who would've showed up in large numbers and added tens of millions more to Shazam!'s final cume anyway. But if there is anyone out there who still hasn't seen it yet because none of the marketing and word of mouth they've heard sounded compelling enough, then by all means pay attention to the spoiler that yes, there are actually additional superheroes who show up in Shazam! , and it's splendid fun.
It's possible, however, that Shazam! will manage to hold on stronger in the coming weeks despite Endgame sucking most of the air out of the room, so $400 million isn't out of the question. And Japan having just been added to Shazam!'s international markets means it will enjoy a little bit more of a boost in the final weeks of release, so if Japan delivers better-than-expected results then it could inch Shazam! closer toward the $400 million mark.
Mark Strong and Zachary Levi square off in Warner's ""Shazam!""
Source: Warner Bros. Which raises the point again about marketing, since a final ad push in Japan featuring the larger slate of kid superheroes might increase interest and add several extra million bucks to the receipts.
I hope it surprises and reaches $400 million, because it deserves to and that will help mute some of the rumblings from certain quarters -- mostly disgruntled fans and trolls -- who insist Shazam! is a failure and a sign of DCEU weakness. While there are examples of breakout results for films like Deadpool that came in on smaller budgets yet pulled down MCU-level box office results, we cannot judge everything by extreme standout examples.
Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer star in Warner's ""Shazam""
Source: Warner Bros. A movie with under $100 million budgeting and a small marketing campaign is a very healthy success if it can top $350 million, and fans -- and many journalists -- need to move past the obsession with monster-level results as the bar for what they falsely believe defines success.
Shazam! still has several weeks left in its run, so I'll be bringing you additional information in the days and weeks to come. We'll see how it legs out against Avengers: Endgame and a resurgent Captain Marvel , so stay tuned and be sure to check back here for updates.
