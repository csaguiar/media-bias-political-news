"Border Closure Delayed, But Anxiety Still High For El Paso Community",www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/border-closure-delayed-but-anxiety-still-high-in-el-paso/," The president's rhetoric and long wait times on international bridges has affected the mental health of some living on both sides of the border. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Jennifer Mercado is a music lover. She's an instructor at an El Paso middle school during the week and travels across the U.S.-Mexico border on the weekends to perform with her quartet.
Mercado supplements her income by doing events in Ciudad Juárez, just south of El Paso. But getting there has been a bit more difficult recently.
""I was stressed out last week. They were saying they're going to close the border. And I needed to go to Wednesday. So what if I get stuck in Juarez and I'm not able to come back? Like, a long time — hours.""
Mercado is a part of El Paso's mobile community, which consists of people of traveling back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico border.
""Most of us have family or friends or activities in Juárez. You can go to shopping, or go to the movies, live that expensive life. You can do more things with less money.""
She and others have experienced longer than normal wait times on international bridges because of fewer Customs and Border Patrol officers at ports of entry. The DHS reassigned officers help process migrant families.
""I'm pulling on all of the department's in the federal government asking them to fill those resource needs that we have because we have declared the emergency.""
That emergency stems from the 76,000 migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border in February, the highest number in more than a decade — and that number could go up.
This prompted President Trump to issue a series of head-spinning declarations about closing the U.S.-Mexico border.
""The border is going to be closed.""
""We're going to give them a one-year warning.""
""I've never changed my mind at all. I may shut it down at some point.""
President Trump's rhetoric, along with Nielsen's decision, has added to growing anxiety about what's next for people living on both sides of the border.
""Mentally it is bad. You feel stressed out. And I was telling my mom, I called her and I was like, 'I think I had an anxiety attack the other day.' I wanted to get out of the car and just run. And then when I finally cross the bridge, I was crying. I was in tears. I don't know what happened. But I was there for, like, three hours. That had never happened to me before. And I got scared, you know? Mentally, it is not healthy.""
""Our community has to deal with the fact that they have this cross-mobile, cross-border-mobile life. They are able to enjoy family and friends on both sides of the border. They're able to gain meaningful employment on both sides of the border. And this is an imminent threat to their, their well-being, to their way of making, you know, making their ends and means.""
Dr. Eden Robles is a psychology professor at the University of Texas at El Paso. She helps provide regional health care to people living in El Paso and Juárez.
""If you, you know, are looking at the El Paso community, you can see messages being relayed on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram. And there is a sense of fear. And there is a sense of hopelessness. And you can hear in their messages, you can hear that they're losing sleep, they're feeling restless, and they're having a hard time concentrating at school, or they're having a hard time concentrating at work. And these are all things that are physical manifestations of anxiety or depression.""
Mercado said that she's relieved that the president isn't closing the border right away, but she knows she could see this situation play out all over again. So all she can do is prepare for the next time.
""I'm just thinking we need to have precautions. … So we're not stressed out about, 'I have to be there, I have to be OK.' While the income, ... it's not going to get fixed. If I don't go, I'm not going to get paid. But at least I'm going to have some peace of mind that I'm not needed. And ... I'm not required to be there."""
Judge Says NY County Can't Ban Unvaccinated Kids From Public Places,www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/judge-says-ny-county-can-t-ban-unvaccinated-kids-from-public/,"Judge Says NY County Can't Ban Unvaccinated Kids From Public Places By Alec Larson ​The ban was meant to help staunch the spread of a measles outbreak that began in October. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
On Friday, a state judge blocked a Rockland County, New York, ban on unvaccinated minors in public places.
The ruling came in response to lawsuits filed by local parents that alleged that the ban was beyond the county's legal authority.
The ban originally went into effect last month, and it was meant to staunch a measles outbreak that started back in October. The outbreak reportedly began when an unvaccinated resident of the county was exposed to the disease on a trip to Israel and brought it back to New York.
Since then, the county's confirmed nearly 170 cases of residents being affected by the highly contagious virus. But on Friday, the judge said the outbreak has not yet hit the levels needed to authorize a ban or any other emergency declaration.
The state judge says the county can't enforce the controversial ban until a hearing is held on April 19. County officials are still mulling their potential legal recourse."
Nancy Pelosi Has A Plan And She’s Guaranteeing That Democrats Keep The House In 2020,www.politicususa.com,Jason Easley,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/07/nancy-pelosi-has-a-plan-and-shes-guaranteeing-that-democrats-keep-the-house-in-2020.html,"Barely three months into her second turn in charge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already mapped out a plan to overwhelm Republicans in the 2020 elections.
“I’m going to have our races won by this November,” the California Democrat said.
…
By Thanksgiving, if all goes according to her plan, potential GOP challengers will “think twice” about running against Democrats. And then she will deliver a stern warning to Republicans who remain in swing seats.
“We fully intend to win this election, and some of you are vulnerable. It’s going to cost you millions of dollars, to win or lose. And if you win — say you win — you’re in the minority, probably want to teach at the university,” Pelosi said, drawing out every syllable like the daughter of a Baltimore mayor who watched her father stare down rivals. “So we get the A-team, and they get the retirements. That’s my plan.” Many of the problems that Republicans had in 2018 are getting worse ahead of 2020
As Trump pushes the Republican Party more to the right, the GOP is increasingly becoming toxic in the swing state and suburban districts. Republicans are struggling to recruit good candidates, and Trump is monopolizing the fundraising for himself and not doing nearly enough work to build the war chest for Republican House candidates.
The presidential election and the Senate race will suck up most of the Republican money, and House candidates will be left to fend for themselves. Speaker Pelosi is laying the groundwork for Democrats to take full advantage of all of the Republican weaknesses.
Pelosi has a plan, and if all goes well, Democrats will keep the House in 2020."

"Man Who Bribed His Son Into UPenn Found Guilty Of ""Largest Healthcare Fraud Ever"" | Zero Hedge",www.zerohedge.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-07/man-who-bribed-his-son-upenn-found-guilty-largest-healthcare-fraud-ever,"0 SHARES
It may be the case that all those parents who bribed to get their children into select prestigious universities, may not have had the highest ethical standards when it comes to other avenues in life.
On Friday, Philip Esformes, a 50-year-old Miami Beach resident was convicted of running a massive 18 year, $1.3 billion healthcare fraud that prosecutors called ""the largest such scheme ever charged"" by the DOJ, according to Bloomberg . The kicker? Esformes used proceeds from his fraud to bribe the University of Pennsylvania's basketball coach into helping get his son into the school.
Esformes used a network of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in South Florida to defraud U.S. government health-care programs, while at the same time providing inadequate and unnecessary care to patients, according to prosecutors. He funneled out at least $37 million between 1998 and 2016, using the money to finance a lifestyle that included fancy cars and a $360,000 watch.
The University of Penn's basketball coach plead guilty to money laundering last year in connection with the case.
Esformes is said to have bribed doctors to admit patients to his facilities, where they didn't get appropriate care and sometimes received unnecessary services, which Esformes then billed the U.S. government for. He also bribed a Florida regulator to get advance notice of surprise inspections of company facilities ahead of time. The sum of his fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid exceeded $1.3 billion. Esformes and his South Florida tan
A jury found him guilty on 20 counts in U.S. district court in the Southern District of Florida. He was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, receiving kickbacks, money laundering and conspiracy to commit bribery. Two co-conspirators also pleaded guilty and Esformes has yet to be sentenced.
Over 4,000 Medicare fraud cases have been charged since 2007 by federal investigators and more than $700 billion, or 17% of federal spending, went through Medicare in 2017. Of that $700 billion, about $48 billion was deemed by the GAO to be improper: payments that shouldn't have been made at all or payments made in the wrong amount.
The inclusion of Penn's basketball coach in this case shines a light on a University that previously had not been mentioned as part of the large, ongoing college admissions scandal currently in the news. We have been following the admissions scandal at length. We recently wrote about how financial speaking gigs and elite high schools helped facilitate the scam for years.
As a result of the scandal, UCLA's Men's Soccer Coach and former U.S. Men's national team player Jorge Salcedo recently resigned from his position at the university. We also wrote about how students were being encouraged to fake learning disabilities in order to cheat on college entrance exams.
We also profiled one Harvard test-taking ""whiz"" that was responsible for helping students at the center of the scandal get high scores on admissions tests. Prior to that, we reported on the tipster who gave the SEC the lead on the admissions scandal. He was in the midst of being investigated for a pump and dump scam at the time.
We reported last month that the universities involved were facing class action lawsuits from their students. Additionally, we reported on major tax implications that could be waiting for the parents involved - including potential civil tax fraud penalties and interest charges on any bribe amounts they wrote off.
Finally, after the scandal was reported, we unveiled that William Rick Singer was the man who brokered and facilitated many of the bribes. Our original take on the entire scandal can be read here . Tags "

Gang leaders from Crenshaw, Compton, L.A., and Englewood gathered for a peace march on Friday to celebrate the rapper’s life and to pledge to ease off the warfare, TMZ reported.
Not many details of any agreements between the gangs were released, but it is the first wide-spread ceasefire seen since the 1990s.
The rapper was shot and killed as he stood outside his L.A. clothing store last week. Four days later, the alleged shooter, a man named Eric Holder, was arrested for shooting Hussle and wounding two others.
The death of the Victory Lap rapper even brought laments from L.A. Lakers star LeBron James who called the murder “one of the most unfortunate events” in American history.

This Post Was Syndicated Under License Via QuoteMedia NEW YORK, April 07, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Weight Watchers International, Inc. (“Ferroglobe” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: WTW) and certain of its officers and directors. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and indexed under 19-cv-02528, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities, other than Defendants and their affiliates, who purchased or otherwise acquired Weight Watchers between May 4, 2018 and February 26, 2019, inclusive (the “Class Period”) seeking to pursue claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”). If you are a shareholder who purchased Weight Watchers securities during the class period, you have until May 3, 2019, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com . To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. Weight Watchers offers a subscription-based weight loss program. Enter Your E-mail Address To Subscribe * indicates required Email Address * The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: : (i) deceived the investing public regarding Weight Watchers’ business metrics and financial prospects; (ii) artificially inflated the prices of Weight Watchers securities; (iii) allowed Artal and certain Weight Watchers executives and insiders to sell more than a billion dollars of their personally-held Weight Watchers shares at fraud-inflated prices; and (iv) caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Weight Watchers securities at artificially inflated prices. On November 1, 2018, after the close of trading, Weight Watchers issued a press release announcing its 3Q18 financial results. Weight Watchers reported that it had now lost another 300,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing its subscriber count down to 4.2 million (from 4.6 million at the end of the 1Q18), causing the Company’s reported net revenues of $366 million to significantly underperform the $379 million Defendants had led the market to expect. The Company also reported an adjusted net income of just $0.94 per share, while investors had been led to expect adjusted earnings of $0.99 per share on revenues of $365.8 million based on defendants’ bullish Class Period statements. Though Defendant Hotchkins tried to reassure investors that day that “[h]istorically, approximately 40% of [the Company’s] annual member recruitments have occurred during the first quarter,” and “[t]herefore, each year first quarter is [its] peak for end of period subscribers and each year end is [its] low point,” that only emphasized the problem. With average subscriber contracts lasting nine months, many, many more subscriptions would be lapsing during 4Q18, precisely when the Company would be signing on the fewest number of new subscribers. As such, the Company’s ability to retain four million subscribers at the end of FY18, much less meet its end-of-2020 goals of five million subscribers driving in excess of $2 billion in revenues, was greatly diminished. On this news, the price of Weight Watchers common stock declined almost 30% from its close of $68.49 per share on November 1, 2018 and closing down at $48.13 per share on November 2, 2018. On February 26, 2019, after the close of trading, Weight Watchers issued a press release and conducted a conference call with investors and stock analysts revealing the Company’s actual 4Q18 and FY18 results and financial prospects. The 4Q18 subscriber count had again declined down to 3.9 million subscribers. Defendants finally conceded that enrollment would continue declining during FY19, with Defendant Grossman revealing that while January is typically the best time for health-focused brands and when 40% of new subscribers typically join due to New Year’s resolutions, January 2019 had been a “hard month” for Weight Watchers. The Company said that it was now only targeting revenues of $1.4 billion during FY19, nowhere near the $2 billion in annual revenues it had been projecting to achieve by the end-of-2020 and well below the nearly $1.7 billion it had led the market to expect for FY19. Weight Watchers also disclosed that it was now only targeting EPS of $1.25 to $1.50 per share for FY19, far lower than the EPS of $3.36 defendants had led the market to believe even following its prior misses in August and November 2018. During the conference call, Defendant Grossman acknowledged that the “January time period [was] such a critical component of [the Company’s] recruitment for the year,” emphasizing that she finally “had to be realistic and transparent about what that meant for the balance of the year,” when issuing the dour FY19 guidance. In response to this news, the price of Weight Watchers common stock declined from its close of $29.57 per share on February 26, 2019, to close down at $19.37 per share on February 27, 2019, on unusually high trading volume of more than 37.4 million shares trading. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com CONTACT:"

Lieutenant governor’s power derives from senators; lawmaker says chamber must take back its authority,mississippitoday.org,Bobby Harrison,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://mississippitoday.org/2019/04/07/lieutenant-governors-power-derives-from-senators-lawmaker-says-chamber-must-take-back-its-authority/,"Subscribe to Commentary Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today/ Report for America Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, said it’s time for senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to regain control of the Senate chamber.
Minutes before the 2019 legislative session recently ended, Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, went to the presiding officer’s podium in the Senate chamber to whisper to Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves that he wanted to take a point of personal privilege.
Speaking to the full chamber, Reeves told Bryan he was going to recognize him but warned that the reason for taking a point of personal privilege is narrowly defined in the Senate rules. It essentially is reserved for members who believe they had been personally attacked in their official capacity or the rights, integrity or dignity of the chamber had been brought into question.
The implication was clear that Reeves would cut him off if he veered from that narrow focus. Bobby Harrison
Bryan used the point of personal privilege to urge his fellow senators, both Democrats and Republicans, to regain control of the Senate chamber. He said the 52 senators had essentially ceded all of their authority to the presiding officer – the lieutenant governor.
He made it clear he did not blame the current lieutenant governor and that it did not begin with Reeves. He said ceding that power has been a gradual process that has grown progressively more obvious.
It is no secret in the halls of the Capitol that Reeves controls the Senate’s processes and policy direction. Some might argue that is good. Others might disagree.
But the fact is that the power that Reeves or any lieutenant governor has is derived from those 52 senators.
The Mississippi Constitution essentially gives the lieutenant governor two powers – to preside over the Senate and to serve in the absence of the governor. Plus, of course, he can vote in the case of a tie.
The powers to appoint committee chairs, who are beholden to the lieutenant governor, and to assign other committee members and to assign or not assign bills to committee are granted to the lieutenant governor by the Senate.
In the early 1990s there was a lawsuit by members of the Senate, including former U.S. Rep. Gene Taylor, arguing that for the lieutenant governor, a member of the executive branch, to have so much authority in the legislative branch violated the separation of powers clause in the Mississippi Constitution.
The state Supreme Court ruled that the lieutenant governor could serve as a type of “super legislator” if the members of the Senate chose to make him one.
Bryan was among a group of senators arguing for the lieutenant governor, a statewide elected official, to have such powers.
And Bryan stressed he was not arguing now in his point of personal privilege that those powers should be stripped from the lieutenant governor, but perhaps contained.
“I am suggesting to the body that we could this summer meet with the candidates for lieutenant governor and let them know we would like to reverse a trend,” Bryan said.
The two primary candidates vying to replace Reeves, who is running for governor, are Republican Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, who is considered the favorite, and Democratic Rep. Jay Hughes. There is not much of a likelihood that the Democrats can garner control of the Senate in this election cycle. To capture the majority they would almost have to win every race where they fielded a Senate candidate.
Hughes might be saying to himself that Bryan should keep quiet. If Hughes wins, it is likely that at least some members of the expected Republican majority would try to strip his powers.
Bryan said that is not his intent. But Bryan said he does believe there could be more of a collaborative partnership between the senators and the lieutenant governor.
When Republican Phil Bryant was elected lieutenant governor in 2007, Democrats still held a majority in the Senate. There was some talk that year of Democrats trying to change the rules to take some power from Bryant. That effort, though, never garnered much support.
Whether it would have been successful is not clear. About Bobby Harrison
