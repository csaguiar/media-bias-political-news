For as long as climate change has been a part of America’s national consciousness, it’s been talked about in dire terms, evoking images of some hellish, Mad Max-style dystopia. The title and much of the content of David Wallace-Wells’s recent book is a variation on the same theme, stirring up hundreds of pages of images worth of an “Uninhabitable Earth” to make the case that the conversation has not been dire enough.
If you buy scientists' claims that an economy-wide mobilization is the only thing that can stave off full-blown catastrophe, there are some obvious reasons to believe that a Green New Deal... will make us happy.
In describing the nature of the problem, drastic terms are of course necessary. Annihilation looms, and the chaos it threatens to bring about—stronger storms, more fearsome floods, unbearable heat—is truly the stuff of nightmares. But the apocalyptic framing of the problem has also shaped how we talk about solutions to it. From carbon taxes to consumption cuts, climate policy has long been framed as an issue of stiff-lipped sacrifice: What will we have to give up to save our skins? The right takes this characterization to extremes, accusing climate hawks of wanting to ban cars and hamburgers and throw civilization back into the Dark Ages.
While its critics like to pretend otherwise, the Green New Deal—an economy-wide mobilization to decarbonize the United States as soon as possible—turns that question on its head, asking instead where we need to invest society’s vast resources.
But could a plan to curb emissions also make us happier? Could the things we cut back also be the things that make us miserable?
If you buy scientists’ claims that an economy-wide mobilization is the only thing that can stave off full-blown catastrophe, there are some obvious reasons to believe that a Green New Deal—the only call for that on the table—will make us happy, at least in the long run. Averting civilizational collapse, that is, is a happier outcome than the alternative. Provisions like a federal job guarantee, improved public transportation, and reining in pollution could improve millions of lives in the shorter term. A growing body of research, though, points to some more unexpected reasons why a Green New Deal could make us more cheerful.

Flooding In Iran Leaves 70 Dead And Thousands Displaced,www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/flooding-in-iran-leaves-70-dead-thousands-displaced/,"Flooding in Iran has caused 70 deaths and left thousands in need. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Heavy rainfall and floodwaters across Iran have killed at least 70 people... and it's not looking like it's going to stop anytime soon.
Authorities issued flood warnings in the southern part of the country, which has a number of rivers and dams.
The rain started in mid-March, leading to continuous flooding. It has since reportedly destroyed nearly 2,000 cities and villages across the country, displacing thousands of people. One Iranian news agency said the heavy rain has also caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to water and agriculture infrastructure.
The agency said some 140 rivers have burst their banks, and people have reported hundreds of landslides.
The Iranian Red Crescent Society says ""volunteers and staff have evacuated hundreds of people to safety"" and are handing out items like tents, blankets and health kits to thousands.
Iran's Foreign Ministry has accused U.S. sanctions of blocking international aid and relief efforts. The head of the Iranian Red Crescent Society said the agency has several accounts connected to a bank that is subject to U.S. sanctions, making it impossible for countries and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to transfer money.
In a statement earlier this month , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed his condolences to the Iranian people and said the U.S. ""stands ready to assist and contribute"" to the IFRC for relief.
The aid network said it's ""released"" nearly $500,000 to quote, ""bolster local Red Crescent relief efforts"" in Iran, but the speaker of Iran's Parliament says the country hasn't ""received even a dollar from the Red Cross due to U.S. measures and sanctions.""

"Netanyahu Says If Re-elected, He'll Annex Part Of West Bank",www.newsy.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/netanyahu-says-if-re-elected-he-ll-annex-part-of-west-bank/,"April 7, 2019 April 7, 2019 Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he'll annex part of the West Bank if re-elected, stoking an already violent conflict. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says if he's re-elected, he'll annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
The disputed land is a significant part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel controls land as a result of the 1967 Six-Day War. But Palestinians believe the West Bank is theirs and that Israel is controlling those territories illegally.
Israel hasn't officially annexed the territory yet, and there's a complicated history behind who officially controls what. To put it simply: Palestinians see the West Bank as the future independent Palestinian state, but there are about 400,000 Israelis living in West Bank settlements.
This announcement from Netanyahu is stoking the already violent conflict, but many, including some Palestinian leaders, saw it coming. The U.S. recently flipped its policy and said it supports Israel instead of a two-state solution, which some people believe emboldened Netanyahu to move his policy further right.
The timing suggests he could be trying to appeal to right-wing voters, and a political analyst told Al Jazeera it may just be an ""election gimmick."" The vote is Tuesday, and Netanyahu is neck-and-neck with the more moderate Blue and White party."

NOTICE TO SURRENDER AIRGUN OR ANTIQUE FIREARM
PURSUANT TO SECTION 41, ARMS ACT 1983
I, Inspector Olaf Karl Jensen, a Commissioned Officer of Police, hereby give notice that in my opinion you are not a fit and proper person to be in possession of an airgun or an antique firearm. Police are currently holding the following described airguns
1x Ruger Blackhawk .177 calibre Air rifle
1x Hatsun Striker .177 calibre Air Rifle
You may within three months after the date of this Notice or such longer period as the Commissioner of Police may allow, sell or otherwise dispose of any airgun or antique firearm owned by you to a person approved for this purpose by a member of the Police.
Failing that, all airguns or antique firearms delivered to a member of the Police may be detained for such a period as the Commissioner of Police thinks fit, or may, in the discretion of the Minister of Police, become the property of the Crown, free and discharged from all right, title or interest possess in respect thereof by any person.
You may by way of origination application, appeal to a District Court Judge against this Notice. (Section 62, Arms Act 1983 refers).
My reason for this decision is as follows;
1. I do not believe you to be a fit and proper person to be in possession of an airgun.
2. Police hold serious concerns regarding your mental and emotional wellbeing.
Should you wish me to review my decision or you dispute the facts you may make written submissions or arrange an appointment with me within two weeks of the date of this notice.
Any submissions you do make must be accompanied by a letter from a medical practitioner attesting to your mental and emotional wellbeing at this time.
That’s right, police can seize your property based solely on their opinion, with no judge, jury, or other legal proceeding. Then you need to jump through hoops and pay for legal representation in order to prove that you’re a “fit and proper person.”

Ryan made the remarks in what was described as a rare conference call three days after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape emerged in October 2016, according to an excerpt from the new book ""The Hill to Die On"" by Politico's Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, as reported by Axios . ADVERTISEMENT
""I am not going to defend Donald Trump,"" Ryan said, according to the book. ""Not now, not in the future.""
The details reveal new insights about how Republican lawmakers reacted to the tape, which included Trump bragging about groping and kissing women without their consent. Trump would later describe his comments as ""locker room talk.""
Ryan's office said at the time that the congressman was ""sickened"" by Trump's remarks.
""Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,"" his office said in a statement. ""I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests. In the meantime, he is no longer attending tomorrow’s event in Wisconsin.""
Ryan and Trump were known to have a rocky relationship during Trump's first two years as president. Trump once asked the former Speaker why he wasn't more ""loyal"" to him in 2017, according to a book written by Cliff Sims, formerly a White House communications staffer.
The interaction reportedly occurred after Ryan criticized Trump's response to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., that turned deadly. Ryan said that Trump ""could have done better"" in his response. ""Paul, do you know why Democrats have been kicking your ass for decades? Because they know a little word called 'loyalty,'"" Trump told Ryan, according to the book. Axios, citing ""The Hill To Die On,"" noted that Trump said he was able to give Ryan a pass for his disloyalty ""because it's life and we sort of need each other a little bit."" Ryan predicted in March that Trump would win reelection in 2020 because of his ideas and ""record of accomplishment."" ""We’re clearly better off because of [Trump],"" he tweeted. ""His record of accomplishment is why he’ll win re-election especially when compared to Dems’ leftward lurch."""

South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg is eager to ""change the channel"" from what he says is Washington’s ""mesmerizing horror show.""
""Here you have this moment, probably the only moment in American history where it just might make sense for somebody my age, coming from experience in the industrial Midwest, non-federal, different background, bringing something that will actually help Americans envision the world as it will be in 2054,"" the 37-year-old mayor said Sunday, referring to the year he’ll be the current age of President Donald Trump, ""and just change the channel from this mesmerizing horror show that’s going on in Washington right now.”
Appearing on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Buttigieg said he was motivated to seek the Democratic presidential nomination after witnessing a ""loss of decency"" in the White House under Trump.
Buttigieg discussed his experience revitalizing his hometown after its decline following the departure of auto industry in the 1960s. That kind of turn around and empathy for those left behind, he said, would help him combat the divisiveness that helped Trump win the White House in 2016.
Buttigieg’s campaign is still in an exploratory stage, with a formal announcement expected this month in South Bend.

Rudy Giuliani wants the full Mueller report to go to Congress — because ""believe me, there was nothing there.""
Appearing on CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, the former New York mayor who is one of President Donald Trump’s personal lawyers, argued the president has nothing to hide and has demonstrated ""unprecedented"" cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the 2016 election.
Trump, though, has repeatedly derided the probe as a partisan witch hunt and celebrated when Attorney General Bill Barr said in his summary of Mueller’s findings that the special counsel could not find any criminal charges to levy against the president.
""If Andrew Weissmann, who was crying at Hillary Clinton’s losing party, couldn’t find anything,"" Giuliani said, referring to a lawyer on Mueller’s team, ""believe me, there was nothing there.""
Asked by CBS host Margaret Brennan if the president has any qualms with the whole report released, Giuliani said ""no Republican is pushing back on full disclosure of the report.""
Congressional Democrats have been urging Barr to send them Mueller’s findings in their entirety, unsatisfied with the attorney general’s four-page summary of an approximately 400-page report.
The New York Times reported members of Mueller’s team were upset with Barr’s report and that it left out key details of their investigation. Barr, meanwhile, says he’s tied up on how much information he can release, arguing grand-jury testimony and ongoing investigations must remain secret.
Though Giuliani said he wants Democrats to get the full report, he continued to attack them Sunday, calling their continued suspicions against the president unfounded.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) has called for the full report, and his committee has granted him subpoena power to get it. On Sunday, Giuliani dismissed the congressman as ""biased.""
""Does he want us to believe that he’s going to give us a fair hearing?"" Giuliani asked.
Asked what he had against Nadler’s call to have some members of the special counsel’s team testify before the committee, Giuliani bristled.
""What? For a political show? Why?"" Giuliani asked. ""Can we listen to the report first?""

Sen. Bennet says Biden controversy is no joke,seriouslypolitics.com,Matthew Choi,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/07/08/22/16/sen-bennet-says-biden-controversy-is-no-joke/,"This post is by Matthew Choi from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Likely Democratic presidential contender Michael Bennet on Sunday criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for joking about the controversy swirling around his touchy, avuncular style that some women say made them uncomfortable.
""I don’t think anyone should make jokes about it,"" the Colorado senator told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""""This is an important time in our country’s history when women are coming forward and able to say when they’ve been made to feel uncomfortable, whether in a sexual way or a nonsexual way. People’s voices should be heard on that.""
Numerous women have come forward to say Biden touched or kissed them in ways that invaded their personal spaces. Responding, Biden and his defenders have argued he’s a tactile person who physically shows affection to everyone, including men, women and children.
During a speech to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on Friday, Biden twice about the controversy. After hugging union President Lonnie Stephenson and a boy, Biden said each had given him permission, prompting laughter from the crowd.
But other Democrats were not laughing. Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator who has said Biden had smelled her hair and kissed her on the back of the head, lambasted the former vice president for failing to grasp the seriousness of the situation.
“It’s clear @JoeBiden hasn’t reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable,” Flores tweeted. “To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have.”
The controversy has raised questions about Biden’s stature as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, adding to a characterization that had already been gaining traction of the 76-year-old as out of touch in a changing Democratic Party. On whether the controversy should disqualify Biden from another presidential bid, Bennet said that would be up to voters to decide.
Bennet also discussed his own timeline for announcing a presidential bid. He was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, but said he doesn’t have any symptoms and is eager to launch his campaign after treatment and a couple weeks of rest.
""I’d like to get on with this,"" he said.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday no one in the White House has requested from the Justice Department a copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report — but he also noted that “anything could change” in the days before a redacted version of the document is delivered to lawmakers.
“No,” Mulvaney said on “Fox News Sunday,” when asked whether any West Wing personnel had asked Attorney General William Barr for an advance copy of Mueller’s findings.
“Mr. Barr is going to make those decisions,” Mulvaney added.
“Will that change?” asked Fox News host Bill Hemmer.
“Anything could change,” Mulvaney responded. “But our position is that Mr. Barr runs this process because that’s the way the law is, and we’re very interested in following the law.”
Barr late last month said he is prepared to hand over a redacted copy of the Mueller report lawmakers and the public by mid-April — ""if not sooner"" — and indicated he would be ready to testify to Congress by early May.
Mulvaney added Sunday that he does not “really have much interest in seeing” the highly anticipated, roughly 400-page report, as he directed the Office of Management and Budget until January and was removed from much of the White House’s political and legal response to the special counsel’s 22-month probe.
“I don’t really have much interest,” Mulvaney said. “I know what it says, and it says ‘no collusion’ and ‘no obstruction.’”

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Sunday defended President Donald Trump’s controversial picks for the Federal Reserve Board, citing their experience and demurring on personal allegations.
""President Trump has every right to put people on the Federal Reserve Board with a different point of view,"" Kudlow told CNN’s Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""
Trump’s picks, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, are both strong allies of the president and have been the subject of criticism for unorthodox proposals.
Cain, a former restaurant executive and 2012 Republican presidential candidate, has called for a return to the gold standard and a 9 percent national sales tax. Moore, a tax-policy specialist, who worked on Trump’s tax plan during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Cain’s proposal to return to the gold standard has been criticized as antiquated, but Kudlow said Cain’s main goal is to decrease inflation next to ""nil"" while encouraging growth.
""We have two open seats on the board. The president has every right in the world to nominate people who share his economic philosophy — that is more people working is a good thing, not a bad thing,"" Kudlow said.
Moore has come under increased scrutiny for his personal finances, including owing the IRS over $75,000. Cain drew scrutiny during his presidential bid when several women accused him of sexual misconduct.
Pressed by Tapper if he found the allegations against Cain troubling, Kudlow deflected, saying Cain is undergoing a vetting process with the White House and will be further scrutinized by Congress.
""Lord knows, in this town, you know, I come here to work in the White House every 35 years. It’s very toxic here. More than I’ve ever seen,"" Kudlow said.
""Larry, nobody has made allegations like this about you or me,"" Tapper retorted.

Trump’s lawyer: Tax returns request oversteps Congress bounds,seriouslypolitics.com,Matthew Choi,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/07/07/11/16/trumps-lawyer-tax-returns-request-oversteps-congress-bounds/,"This post is by Matthew Choi from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, on Sunday dismissed House Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns, charging the probe sets a precedent for using the IRS for political purposes.
""What stops another party from doing the same thing?"" Sekulow said on ABC’s ""This Week.""
On Wednesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) requested six years’ worth of Trump’s personal and business tax returns, responding to the party’s long-held cries for Trump to release them himself. Though the president is not required to make public his tax returns, past presidents have done so voluntarily for the past half century.
Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, said Sunday the probe was a legitimate policy inquiry and that House Democrats were not considering releasing the returns to the public. He said it would be likely not even other of the committee would see the returns, and Neal would keep them to himself.
""There’s a real question, George, as to whether the president’s personal financial interests impact his decision-making,"" Kildee told ABC host George Stephanopoulos. ""The public has the right to know whether the president’s interests are impacting the decisions he makes using the authority that we have granted him by electing him as president.""
Trump’s legal team has argued Congress could not force the IRS to hand over the tax returns without a legislative reason, and that Congress was overstepping its bounds by acting as law enforcement.
On Sunday, Sekulow dismissed any notion the request had any policy value and characterized it as weaponizing the president’s personal finances. He also pointed out that several House Democrats have not made their taxes public and that it’s illegal for Congress to disclose others’ tax returns, including public officials, without their consent.
""The president has not asked for Nancy Pelosi’s tax returns,"" Sekulow said, referring the Democratic House speaker from California.

Mulvaney: Issue of Trump’s tax returns ‘already litigated’ in 2016,seriouslypolitics.com,Quint Forgey,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/07/06/57/23/mulvaney-issue-of-trumps-tax-returns-already-litigated-in-2016/,"This post is by Quint Forgey from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that congressional Democrats will “never” see President Donald Trump’s tax returns, arguing that any controversy surrounding the elusive financial statements was “already litigated” during the 2016 campaign.
“Oh no. Never. Nor should they,"" Mulvaney told host Bill Hemmer on ""Fox News Sunday.""
""Keep in mind, that’s an issue that was already litigated during the election,"" Mulvaney said. ""Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns, they knew that he didn’t, and they elected him anyway — which, of course, is what drives the Democrats crazy.”
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) demanded Wednesday in a letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig that the agency deliver six years’ worth of Trump’s individual and business tax returns by April 10.
Trump later that day told reporters in the White House that he would not be his returns public, and claimed that he was still under audit by the IRS — an explanation he has used for years to justify his refusal to release the statements.
“We’re under audit, despite what people said, and we’re working that out. I’m always under audit, it seems. But I’ve been under audit for many years because the numbers are big, and I guess when you have a name, you’re audited,” Trump said. “But until such time as I’m not under audit, I would not be inclined to do that.”
Trump on Thursday dug in on his noncompliance with the lawmakers’ request, saying they could take up the issue with his personal attorneys and the Justice Department.
“They’ll speak to my lawyers. They’ll speak to the attorney general,” Trump said.
Mulvaney acknowledged Sunday that the president “could always allow people to see” his tax returns, but “that’s not what’s happening here,” he said.
“The Democrats are demanding that the IRS turn over the documents, and that is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt by my former colleagues,” said Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman and White House budget chief.
“They just want the attention on the issue because they don’t want to talk to us about policy,” he added.

PADUCAH, Ky. (WSIL) -- Keyon Menifield has been arrested again, in Flint, Michigan, after assaulting a referee.
The McCracken County Sheriff's Department upgraded Menifield's charges to felony assault. He faces up to 10 years in prison.
The Sheriff's Department upgraded his charges, after medical professionals determined Kenny Culp's injuries were more extensive than originally reported.
ORIGINAL: April 7, 2019
PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) - Authorities say a Michigan youth basketball coach accused of punching a Kentucky referee, knocking him unconscious, has been charged with assault.
News outlets cite a statement from the McCracken County sheriff's office in Kentucky that says 40-year-old Keyon Menifield of Flint, Michigan, had a disagreement Saturday with the referee, 61-year-old Kenny Culp of Paducah. The statement says Culp turned to walk away when Menifield struck him.
Culp was taken to a hospital for treatment, and deputies charged Menifield with assault of a sports official. It wasn't immediately clear whether he has an attorney.
Culp's niece, KaSondra Barnett, said on Sunday that he was being treated for a broken collarbone, a crack in his sinus cavity, and a concussion.
McCracken County Sheriff Matt Carter says the investigation is ongoing.

Researchers Claim Revolutionary War Hero Was Actually An ‘Intersex’ Female,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Guest Post,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/researchers-claim-revolutionary-war-hero-was-actually-an-intersex-female/,"0 comments

Researchers from Georgia Southern University claim to have solved a centuries-old mystery surrounding Revolutionary War hero Casimir Pulaski after finding a feminine looking body they believe to be Pulaski.
For more than 150 years, researchers wondered whether the Revolutionary War hero had been buried at sea or in an unmarked grave in Savannah , Georgia, according to a March press release from Georgia Southern University . A 1996 investigation reportedly shocked researchers when they uncovered the remains of a biologically feminine looking skeleton within the Pulaski Monument in Savannah. (RELATED: Revolutionary War-Era Ship Uncovered In Maine)
Georgia Southern University held a film screening on April 3 of “America’s Hidden Stories: The General Was Female?” The film examines the claim that Pulaski was an “intersex” female, meaning Pulaski had a condition known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, according to The New York Post . The condition causes women to produce large amounts of male hormones that give them more masculine features and enlarged genitalia, Georgia Southern Assistant Professor of Anthropology Virginia Hutton Estabrook told The New York Post.
Pulaski’s jawline was round, and the general had “a petite frame and a feminine pelvis — all signs of an intersex person,” Estabrook told The New York Post. Pulaski’s great-niece provided DNA, which the researchers used to confirm the skeletal remains were Pulaski’s, according to Fox News .
“This is one of the first majorly influential people in history who we know was intersex,” Estabrook said Friday to The New York Post. “Chromosomally, Pulaski would have been XX — as in biologically female.”
“It’s not often that you get to rewrite the history books,” said Smithsonian Channel Executive Producer Tim Evans, according to the press release. “We are pleased to have Smithsonian Channel walk the final mile with this talented team of anthropologists who have finally uncovered the truth about one of America’s great war heroes.”"
"Bitcoin Is On the Rebound, But Litecoin Is Leading the Way",thelibertarianrepublic.com,Squiggly Line Guy,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/bitcoin-is-on-the-rebound-but-litecoin-is-leading-the-way/,"0 comments
In the last 3 months, we’ve seen great strides from Crypto making a comeback into Bull Market territory.
Bitcoin has once again risen above the $5,000 mark. This is a 35% increase in the last three months.
Crypto is known for its volatility and wild swings, but the good news is that this growth has been on a consistent rise over the last quarter rather than being the product of sudden swings.
While this is great news for Bitcoin, there is even better news for Litecoin. It’s leading the way, and it’s not even close.
Litecoin has risen 170% in the last three months.
Even better news is that Litecoin has created a much clearer plot chart. It has risen above two cliffs in the last year, making a much better case for a continuous upward momentum. This is a pretty positive indicator that Litecoin is going to continue to rally.
The struggle, though, is that there are very few good ways to to transfer dollars to crypto without using a site like Coinbase, which charges fees for transactions. Although once you have traded for crypto, you can then send it to whatever wallet you want. But to change it back to dollars, you’re stuck going back through a site like Coinbase again.
The App Robin Hood however allows you to buy Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and a small assortment of Alt Coins with no fee. It’s also the same App that I use for trading stocks, which has no trading fees as well. I think it’s an easy app to use for diversifying investments. However Robin Hood does NOT allow you to send to a wallet outside of their App at this time.
When you sign up for Robin Hood through this link , you’ll get a free share of a random stock as a reward to get you started. Either keep it as a stock, or sell it and put it in crypto.
Keep Calm and Hodl."

They only say that to try to convince OTHERS that they're not killing children. They simply want one thing: Sex without consequences. It's as simple as that.
After all, it is utterly simple for any woman to avoid pregnancy: Do not engage in sexual intercourse.
But that will not do. They want TOTAL freedom without ANY responsibility.
They want what can never be."

This false contention flies in the face of all scientific fact. Development is very much a part of the human life cycle. At no point in the development cycle does the baby possess anything other than unique HUMAN genetic qualities. If the left is going to rule out the genesis and prenatal phase of human development, they may as well rule out the entire human growth process as being a part of human ""life."" This essentially means that human life doesn't start until a ""clump of cells"" reaches 27 years of age.
Protecting and nurturing you're child demonstrates normal human behavior. Aborting your child demonstrates abnormal human behavior. The Socialist left is determined to redefine normal as abnormal and abnormal as normal...good as evil and evil as good."
