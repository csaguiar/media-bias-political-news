"Turkey's Voters Stun Erdogan, Stoking His Ire",www.nysun.com,BENNY AVNI,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.nysun.com/foreign/turkeys-voters-stun-erdogan-stoking-his-ire/90635/,"| April 3, 2019 https://www.nysun.com/foreign/turkeys-voters-stun-erdogan-stoking-his-ire/90635/ Turkish voters punished their ruling party in municipal elections over the weekend. That could be a good omen for America  unless the strategically crucial country has already drifted too far from Washington. Click Image to Enlarge
For the first time in a quarter-century, parties opposing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan scored major victories in local elections. Erdogans Islamist Justice and ­Development Party, or AKP, lost eight major cities to secularist candidates. Especially stinging for the AKP were losses in the capital, ­Ankara, and in Istanbul, the countrys economic nerve center.
The Istanbul mayoralty was where Mr. Erdogan in 1994 launched his meteoric political career, one that has brought middle-class prosperity to millions of Turks  but at the price of the countrys democratic institutions and Western alliances.
The people have spoken, and now they must be punished, Mayor Ed Koch of New York bitterly quipped after losing an election. But in Turkey, things no longer work that way.
Mr. Erdogan has jailed journalists and packed independent institutions with cronies. An election defeat? Not so fast.
The government has yet to certify results in Ankara, where the Republican Peoples Party, or CHP, bested Mr. Erdogans AKP by 2 points. Same in Istanbul, where the CHPs victory was razor thin  but still a win.
Instead, a recount has been ­ordered, perhaps to be followed by another re-recount and another  until the desired results are in.
Reversing century-old secularist traditions that created an imperfect but working democracy, Mr. Erdogan presides over a system in which the number of votes counts for much less than who counts the ballots.
The question for America and its allies: Provided he accepts the ­results, will the shellacking force Mr. Erdogan to reassess his dreams of restoring Turkeys lost Ottoman glory, with himself reigning as sultan? Will he rethink his ever-growing ties with ultra-nationalists at home and anti-Western forces in the region?
Mr. Erdogan has spurned former Mideast allies while extending a hand to Russia, Iran, and unsavory Sunni-Muslim groups.
Early on, his foreign-policy slogan was zero problems with neighbors. His affection for the Muslim Brotherhood, though, irked Egypt and the Persian Gulf countries. His persistent feuds with Israel (often accented by venomous anti-Semitism) strained once-tight relations with the Jewish state.
Mr. Erdogan has been at odds with pretty much all his neighbors, Iran included, though at various points he also helped the mullahs evade sanctions. Worse, his Turkey, a NATO member and once one of Americas most important allies, is now at best a frenemy.
When Ankara was trusted, America made Turkey a major partner in developing the F-35 fighter jet. Now Turkeys foreign minister, Mevlüt Cavusoglu, who will attend a two-day NATO session at the State ­Department starting Wednesday, is struggling to finalize a delivery of these top-of-the-line aircraft.
Why? Mr. Erdogan has purchased Russian-made S-400 anti-aircraft systems  a threat and an affront to the Atlantic Alliance, not least because the system could make the F-35s advanced evasion technologies vulnerable to Russian theft.
Last week, General Curtis Scaparrotti, head of the US European Command, advised the Senate Armed Services Committee not to follow through with F-35 sales to allies that are working with Russian systems, particularly air-defense systems. Dont even train with such allies, he warned.
As Aykan Erdemir, a former Turkish parliamentarian who is now with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, says, Erdogan has realized for some time that his authoritarian regime is only welcome among other authoritarian regimes, such as Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Turkey, he adds, will have to wait until the post-Erdogan era to rebuild a trusting relationship with its NATO allies.
The next presidential election is still nearly five years away. Mr. Erdogans hubris, which has ballooned during too many years of almost absolute power, may well prevent a foreign-policy course change. Will the weekends political blow give Washington some leverage over him? Will he even accept the loss?
uld-be sultan seems more likely to tighten alliances with fellow anti-Western dictators.

Fifty-one percent of registered voters in a new survey said they think it’s likely that Russia has compromising information on Trump.

51% of voters still say it’s likely Russia has dirt on Trump; 46% still say he tried to obstruct Mueller’s investigation.
49% say they’ve heard a lot about the completion of Mueller’s work, up 14 points from last week.
GOP voters have grown more likely to say the probe was not conducted fairly.
As news about the completion of the federal probe into Russian interference of the 2016 election reaches more of the public, a new Morning Consult/Politico survey indicates Attorney General William Barr’s summary of special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings has done little to change the electorate’s perceptions about President Donald Trump and Russia.
Fifty-one percent of registered voters in the March 29-April 1 poll said they think it’s likely that Russia has compromising information on the president, while 40 percent believe Trump’s campaign worked with Russia to influence the outcome of his victory over Hillary Clinton and 46 percent believe the president has tried to impede or obstruct that investigation.
Those figures are all roughly in line with views expressed in a February survey and another conducted last week during the immediate aftermath of the March 24 release of Barr’s summary, which determined that there was not sufficient evidence “to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense” and said Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Each survey had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
That lack of movement comes as voters have grown more likely to hear news about Mueller wrapping up his investigation. Nearly half (49 percent) of respondents in the latest national online survey said they’d heard “a lot” about Mueller submitting his report to Barr, up from 35 percent in last week’s poll. Most partisans on either side of the aisle said they’d heard a lot about it, compared with 35 percent of Democrats and 41 percent of Republicans last week.
As GOP voters digested more of the news, they’ve also grown more wary over questions concerning the probe’s fairness.
A slim majority of that voting bloc (51 percent) said they don’t believe the investigation was conducted fairly, compared with 42 percent last week — and 32 percent now say it was a fair investigation, down 12 points from the previous poll. Perceptions of the probe’s propriety among Democrats, meanwhile, was statistically unchanged.
And while voters remain divided on perceptions of the investigation and Trump’s relationship with Russia, 81 percent still agree on one thing: The report should be made public. MC/Washington: Subscribe

Trump has had many an issue during his presidency with the activist 9th Circuit Court of Appeals – where liberals love to go to try and stifle the his agenda.
But now, over two years into Trump’s presidency, the court finally a significant makeover:
FOX NEWS – For the first time in more than three decades, Republican-appointed judges will soon occupy nearly half the seats on the left-leaning 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — dealing a setback to progressive legal advocates who have long seen the court as a safe bet for favorable rulings.
The radical transformation of the San Francisco-based court is largely the result of President Trump’s aggressive push to nominate conservative judges and bypass traditional consultations with Senate Democrats — a practice that has led to repeated howls of protest from California’s two Democratic senators, Kamala Harris and Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein. The 9th Circuit has a sprawling purview over cases arising in nine western states, including California, Hawaii, and Oregon.
Once Trump’s latest picks to the 9th Circuit, including Ken Lee and Dan Collins, are confirmed as expected and remaining vacancies are filled, 13 of the 29 active seats on the key appellate court will be filled with judges picked by Republican presidents. At this time last year, 16 judges on the 9th Circuit were appointed by Democrats, with only six chosen by Republicans.
Republicans have long been discussing how to deal with the issue of the 9th circuit and others being so activist. And Trump has certainly been unabashed in his criticism as well.
So it seems quite fitting that almost half of the court will now be filled with judges who understand that the Constitution is the highest law of the land and not liberal ideals.
In related news, there’s a report out there that suggests Trump is planning on nominating Amy Coney Barrett if Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat ever comes open. "

Two more women stepped forward on Tuesday and accused former Vice President Joe Biden (D) of sexual harassment. The women, Caitlyn Caruso and D. J. Hill, told their stories to The New York Times.
Here's what took place, according to The Hill :
Caruso, 22, told the Times that Biden rested his hand on her thigh even as she attempted to show her discomfort by squirming in her seat during a sexual assault event at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. Caruso, who was 19 at the time, added that Biden hugged her ""just a little bit too long.""
She told the newspaper that the interaction was uncomfortable because she had just discussed a time she was sexually assaulted and expected Biden to be aware of physical boundaries.
“It doesn’t even really cross your mind that such a person would dare perpetuate harm like that,” she told the paper. “These are supposed to be people you can trust.”
Hill, 59, told the Times that while taking a photograph with Biden in 2012, the then-vice president placed his hand on her shoulder and began moving it down her back, something she said made her ""very uncomfortable.""
“Only he knows his intent,” she added.
The two women came forward after Nevada state lawmaker Lucy Flores and Amy Lappos, a former congressional aide to Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) accused Biden of sexual harassment.
After the initial reports, Biden released a statement saying he didn't think he acted inappropriately. Recommended Police Aren't Enough Walter E. Williams
""In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, I have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort,"" the statement said. ""And not once – never – did I believe I acted inappropriately. If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully. But it was never my intention."""
CNN finally admits there’s a crisis at the border!,therightscoop.com,The Right Scoop,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/cnn-finally-admits-theres-a-crisis-at-the-border/,"
It’s amazing just how much it’s taken for CNN to finally do a decent job discussing the border.
Decent, I said. Not amazing.
Last night CNN’s Chris Cuomo went on location in Hidalgo, Texas to show his viewers what is really going on there. He even interviewed a border patrol agent. For one of the first times CNN viewers began to get a sense of the crisis that exists there that CNN had been denying all year long: . @ChrisCuomo : This migrant situation is called a ""crisis,"" but that word is overused. It doesn't do the situation justice.
It's not easy to see what's happening, but the only thing harder is to realize what isn't happening: Shameful inaction. pic.twitter.com/ctB2i9apt6
Here’s more, via Free Beacon :
CNN host Chris Cuomo on Monday night said there was a border crisis, acknowledging that there have been more border crossings in the last month than there have been during any month in the last decade.
Cuomo hosted his show, Cuomo Prime Time, from the U.S.-Mexico border in Hidalgo, Texas, where he talked about how U.S. immigration law was negatively affecting the role of border agents and forcing them to free apprehended illegal aliens into American communities.
“The numbers tell you the story. There are believed to be more crossings in just the last month here than any month in over a decade,” Cuomo said. “As I sad, here in Hidalgo, Texas in the Rio Grande Valley, this is the hot spot. Right behind us is Mexico. It’s actually this weird area where Mexico is actually north of Texas, the way the land bends around. The authorities say they have never faced the combination of threats, challenges, and federal inaction that they are facing right now.”
Of course it wouldn’t be CNN without taking a swipe at Trump.
But FB also notes that he took a veiled jab at Pelosi too:
Cuomo then hit President Trump and said that he should be doing more than just cutting funds to the countries involved in illegal immigration and closing the southern border before taking a thinly veiled shot at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) for saying,” It’s certainly not immoral to build barriers where they are needed.” Pelosi said back in December that Democrats were not going to fund Trump’s “immoral” border wall.
Cuomo also interviewed Deputy Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz and he explained just how bad it’s gotten there.
Watch the video for more on that.
Cuomo even asked why Democrats “why the hell are you so quiet” when talking about this with Don Lemon.
I’m going to also make this an open thread for those of you who’d like one. In light of that, here’s a video that I’ve been wanting a reason to post all day long and I’m sure you’ll love: "

This issue of infaticide, not immigration in my opinion, even though extremely important, is the issue President Trump needs to hammer every single day. Rs can sweep on this issue. Where are the companies threatening to leave states that support infaticide? Where is Hollywood? I would wager this is a 80% issue that the Ds will be obliterated on. The media should be pummeled and ridiculed daily by President Trump not only on the Russia scam, even though it was obviously a set up, but INFATICIDE!!!!

We must stop calling them liberals, and don't let them try to call themselves liberals. People who consider themselves as liberals need to take a good look at what the Democrat party has become. There is nothing liberal about their desire for power and control, and their willingness to use force to get it. Conservatives are MUCH more liberal than these new leftist thugs. Screaming profanity and violence is not at all liberal, or American. Some of the Democrat ""causes"" aren't even human.
They are hard left, nihilistic Mao-flavored ""cultural Marxists"", aka fascists, aka communists."
