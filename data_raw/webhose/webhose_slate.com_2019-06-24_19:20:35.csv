Ark Encounter: Owners of Noah’s Ark replica sue insurers over rain damage.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/ark-encounter-noahs-ark-replica-sue-insurers-rain-damage.html,"Clarence Thomas Pens Screed Comparing Women Who Obtain Abortions to Eugenicists The owners of the 510-foot-long Noah’s Ark replica in Northern Kentucky have been suffering problems due to heavy rain and are now suing their insurers for refusing to cover the damage. The wooden ship modeled after the ark in the Bible is perfectly fine, according to Ark Encounter, the theme park that houses the giant replica of Noah’s Ark . The problem is the “significant landslide” that took place on the property where the massive wooden vessel is standing due to heavy rains in 2017 and 2018 that ended up affecting access to the replica. The repairs cost around $1 million, according to court documents that claim insurers told the owners of the ark that opened in 2016 to go ahead with the repairs. But since then, the insurers have only paid “a very small portion” of the total cost. Ark Encounter came out to dismiss initial reports that seemed a bit too good to be true and claimed that the damage was caused by flooding . “Contrary to some reporting, the damage to certain areas of the Ark Encounter themed attraction was not caused by a ‘flood’,” a representative of Ark Encounter told CNN . The ark itself was also not at risk. “The ark was built on bedrock and was never in jeopardy,” she said. Support our journalism

Trump says he is not worried about recent North Korea missile tests.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-not-worried-recent-north-korea-missile-tests.html,"Clarence Thomas Pens Screed Comparing Women Who Obtain Abortions to Eugenicists President Donald Trump seemed to contradict his national security adviser Saturday, claiming he was unbothered by North Korea’s recent missile tests essentially because he trusts dictator Kim Jong Un . In a tweet while he was in Japan, Trump also espoused a view that is at odds with his host country. “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote on Twitter . “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me.” North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 Japan had said that North Korea’s recent test of short range missiles amounted to a violation of United Nations resolutions. And Trump’s own national security adviser John Bolton agreed with that assessment , telling reporters on Saturday there was “no doubt” that the missile test violated Security Council resolutions. Vipin Narang, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is an expert on nuclear proliferation and North Korea, said that Trump’s message was “disturbing” for one key reason. “There is a lot that is really disturbing here, but the most important bit is ‘Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me’,” Narang wrote . “Kim never promised to unilaterally disarm, and the problem is Trump continues to believe he did. THAT is why this is so dangerous.” There is a lot that is really disturbing here, but the most important bit is “Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me.” Kim never promised to unilaterally disarm, and the problem is Trump continues to believe he did. THAT is why this is so dangerous. https://t.co/1nqTizNsDa — Vipin Narang (@NarangVipin) May 25, 2019 Trump also took the opportunity to mix a little domestic politics with a national security issue, although he misspelled the name of former vice president Joe Biden (he later deleted the tweet and reposted it with the spelling corrected). Trump says he “smiled” when Kim “called Swampman Joe Bidan (sic) a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?” With the words, Trump seemed to be referring to North Korean outlet KCNA that on Tuesday called Joe Biden a “ fool of low IQ ” after the former vice president called Kim a tyrant.

We are asking for an expedited appeal!” Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime, drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!

Todd wondered whether Americans should be “concerned that the president of the United States is essentially siding with a murderous authoritarian dictator over a former vice president of the United States.” Sanders dismissed the premise of the question. “The president doesn’t need somebody else to give him an assessment of Joe Biden,” Sanders responded. “He’s given his own assessment a number of times. I think you’ve seen it. I’m sure you’ve covered it on your program.

Poll: Support for abortion rights increases as restrictive laws spread.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/poll-support-abortion-rights-increases.html,"Trump’s Judge Whisperer Promised to Take Our Laws Back to the 1930s Support for abortion rights among Americans has risen over the past year as several state governments are moving toward restricting access. According to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll , 58 percent of Americans say abortion should be legal in most or all cases, an increase of eight percentage points from a similar poll in July 2018. The poll suggests Democrats are the most passionate about the issue, with 81 percent saying it should be legal in most or all cases. That compares to 55 percent of Republicans who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases. The poll comes as eight Republican-controlled states have passed restrictive new laws on abortion this year, a move that many see as an effort to get the Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue. The Reuters/Ipsos survey confirms though what several others have said , which is that Americans as a whole are opposed to very restrictive laws on abortion such as the one recently approved in Alabama that bans abortion in pretty much all cases. Eighty percent, for example, said they support abortion rights for cases of rape or incest. Even though the recent wave of anti-abortion measures has helped rally conservatives, the poll also makes clear the strategy may not be very effective to win over voters. Only 9 percent of Republicans said their first preference would be to vote for a candidate who made banning abortion his or her main focus. Democrats also don’t seem to see it as the most pressing issue since only 11 percent said they prefer to vote for a candidate whose main focus would be to protect abortion rights. This most recent poll is in line with other recent surveys that found Americans don’t support restrictive laws on abortion and the vast majority want Roe v. Wade to be left in place . A recent Morning Consult/Politico poll found that 56 percent of registered voters are opposed to other states passing similar laws to the one approved in Alabama. Little wonder then that many conservatives have distanced themselves from these laws. Even President Donald Trump said he is in favor of exceptions in cases of rape and incest .

German official warns Jews against wearing kippah in public due to rising anti-Semitism.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/german-official-warns-jews-against-kippah-yarmulke-skullcap-public.html,"So Far, Models Are Predicting a Trump Victory in 2020 Germany’s anti-Semitism commissioner suggested that Jews should think twice before wearing the traditional kippah skullcap in public due to a rise in attacks against Jews. “I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere, all the time, in Germany,” Felix Klein said in an interview published Saturday by the Funke regional press group . Klein said that his “opinion has unfortunately changed compared with what it used to be” on the issue. Klein, whose position was created last year, said the increased attacks against the Jewish community was due to a rise in “social disinhibition and coarseness” that Is helped along by “the internet and social media.” In an earlier interview with CNN , Klein had said that while “anti-Semitism has always existed in Germany,” it is now “showing its ugly face more openly.” As an example, Klein said that the word Jew is once again being used as an insult. “The word Jew as an insult was not common in my time when I went to school,” he said. “Now it is, and it’s even an insult at schools where there’s no Jews, where there are no Jewish students. So that is a growing concern and of course we have to develop strategies to counter that.” Klein’s warning was rejected by Israeli politicians, Jewish leaders, and even the U.S. ambassador to Germany. “The statement of the German government’s anti-Semitism commissioner that it would be preferable for Jews not wear a kippah in Germany out of fear for their safety, shocked me deeply,” Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said . “We will never submit, will never lower our gaze and will never react to anti-Semitism with defeatism — and expect and demand our allies act in the same way.” Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, also rejected Klein’s advice and called on Germans to take a completely different stance in the face of rising anti-Semitism. “The opposite is true,” Grenell wrote . “Wear your kippa. Wear your friend’s kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society.” The opposite is true. Wear your kippa. Wear your friend’s kippa. Borrow a kippa and wear it for our Jewish neighbors. Educate people that we are a diverse society. https://t.co/vd9nV9AvPG — Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) May 26, 2019 The rabbi of Berlin, Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal, also rejected Klein’s advice and called on Jews to not hide their identity. “The combating of anti-Semitism is a top priority so it is appreciated that this is being addressed by top representatives of the government,” Rabbi Teichtal wrote on Facebook . “At the same time, the KIPA is a clear symbol of Jewish identity and should be worn with PRIDE.” Even though everyone needs to be aware of their surroundings, “hiding our identity was never the solution.”"

The 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful went on to describe the commander in chief as “somebody who thinks it’s all right to let somebody go in his place into a deadly war and is willing to pretend to be disabled in order to do it.” That amounts to “an assault on the honor of this country,” Buttigieg, who served as a Navy intelligence officer in Afghanistan, added.

Yeah. At least not that one,” he said jokingly. Trump was exempted from military service five times during the Vietnam War, including a medical deferment for having bone spurs. Former Trump attorney Michael Cohen told Congress that when he asked Trump for medical records, “he gave me none.” ""You believe [Trump] faked a disability [to avoid serving in Vietnam]?"" @PeteButtigieg : ""Do you believe he has a disability? At least not that one...""Yes, yes, yes. 👇👇 pic.twitter.com/X6ls0k0Rvo — Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) May 23, 2019 In the interview that aired Sunday, Buttigieg also criticized Trump for considering pardoning servicemembers who have been accused or convicted of war crimes. “The idea that being sent to war turns you into a murderer is exactly the kind of thing that those of us who have served have been trying to beat back for more than a generation,” Buttigieg said. “Frankly, his idea that being sent to fight makes you automatically into some kind of war criminal is a slander against veterans that could only come from somebody who never served.” Buttigieg also described the current situation in Washington as a “continuing horror show.” He said Trump “ has turned the entire thing into a reality show ” and Democrats have to “completely change the channel and make sure we respond to all of the distractions and the nonsense coming out of the White House.” The mayor, however, also recognized that the strategy has served Trump well. “He provokes us in ways that make it very hard for us to do anything but respond in kind, the nicknames, the tweets, the insults,” he said. “And what we’ve got to remember is that the more we’re talking about him, the less we’re talking about voters.” Pete Buttigieg on @ThisWeekABC : ""It's a continuing horror show right now in Washington.

"Hope Hicks is facing an existential question or a subpoena, depending on whom you ask.",slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/hope-hicks-congressional-subpoena-existential-question.html,"Sharing credit. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Hope Hicks, one of the best-known but least visible former members of President Trump’s White House staff, is facing an existential question: whether to comply with a congressional subpoena https://t.co/8NXpfQvxQL pic.twitter.com/L7aWVMsIdq — NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) May 24, 2019 Congress subpoenaed me today. Or yesterday maybe, I don’t know. I got a telegram from the House Judiciary Committee: “You’re subpoenaed. June 19. Faithfully yours.” That doesn’t mean anything. Maybe it was yesterday. For the third time I refused to see the New York Times. I don’t have anything to say to them; I don’t feel like talking, and I’ll be seeing them soon enough as it is. I was lying down, meticulously highlighting every appearance of Donald Trump’s name on a stack of news stories I’d printed out from Google News out of force of habit, and I could tell from the golden glow in the sky that evening was coming on and also that I was probably going to get away with everything. It was at that exact moment that the reporter came in. When I saw her I felt a little shudder go through me. She noticed it and told me not to be afraid over a congressional subpoena. I told her that I’d shuddered at her off-the-rack wardrobe and furthermore wasn’t speaking to the press. She replied that it was just a friendly visit and had nothing to do with the subpoena, but if I would like to chat with her about it, she would be very interested in making sure the public heard my side of the story. She sat down on my couch and invited me to sit next to her. I refused. All the same, there was something very gentle and credulous about her. Suddenly she raised her head and looked straight at me. “Why have you refused an on-the-record interview?” I said that I didn’t have much respect for the New York Times. She looked away and without moving asked me if I wasn’t talking that way out of extreme despair. I explained to her that I wasn’t desperate, I was contemptuous, which was only natural . “But the Times can help you,” she said. “Everyone I have known in your position has talked to us, or at least written a disingenuous op-ed.” I acknowledged that that was their right. It also meant they must have had the time for it. As for me, I didn’t need anybody’s help and I just didn’t have the time to talk to people who weren’t on my side. “But Ms. Hicks,” she said, putting her hand on my shoulder. “We are on your side. We just have no way of explicitly expressing our sympathies, because we’re still dining out on an antiquated conception of press neutrality, so the public has to infer the conscious and unconscious biases informing our coverage based on how far we bend over backwards to treat your decision whether or not to ignore a congressional subpoena like you’re Hamlet in the fucking chapel or something. We shall also arrange a glossy photoshoot.” Then, I don’t know why, but something inside me snapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and I insulted her and told her not to waste her column inches on me. I was pouring out on her everything that was in my heart, which was almost enough to fill a thimble. The New York Times seemed so impartial and fair about everything, didn’t it? And yet its theatrical judiciousness was worth exactly as much to me as one hair on the head of one of the immigrant children I’d helped murder: nothing. I wasn’t even sure the press was still alive, because it reacted to what we’d done and were still doing like a dead man. In the press, it might look I was facing an existential question. But I was sure it was just a congressional subpoena, sure I could ignore it, and sure the media would trick people into thinking it was some kind of important moral dilemma or interesting legal question instead of just another example of Republican lawlessness. I had been right, I was still right, I was always right. I had lived my life one way and I could have lived it another. I had done this and I hadn’t done that. I had worked for the Trump administration and I hadn’t not worked for the Trump administration. And so? Nothing, nothing mattered, and I knew why. So did she. Throughout the whole absurd life I’d lived, a dark wind had been rising toward us from somewhere deep in our future, across years that were still to come, and as it passed, it leveled every opportunity for a world that was more just and less vicious, in timelines no more real than the one in which Donald Trump was president. What did other people’s deaths or a congressional subpoena mean to me; what did the New York Times or the lives people choose or the presidents they think they elect matter to me when we’re all ruled by the same ideology, me and millions of white people like me. Couldn’t she see, couldn’t she see that? Everybody was white. There were only white people. The others would all be condemned one day. The New York Timeswould be condemned too. What would it matter if a newspaper was branded an enemy of the people and razed to the ground because Donald Trump was feeling cranky one morning? The press was just as guilty as the electorate, or as the Democrats who treated us as some kind of anomaly instead of the next step in a long progression … And that sometime in the not-too-distant future … All the shouting had me gasping for air. But my publicist had already decided the interview was over and was showing the reporter the door. She looked at me for a minute without saying anything. Her eyes were full of tears, and I knew I could expect sympathetic coverage. Then she turned and disappeared. With her gone, I was able to calm down again. I was exhausted, and threw myself on my Ralph Lauren Home “Sonoma Valley” Duvet, paired with the Ralph Lauren Home “Cortona” bed blanket and accented with a Ralph Lauren Home “Watney” throw pillow. I must have fallen asleep, because when I woke up, the only light in the room came from my Ralph Lauren Home “Westbury” chandelier. The sound of my Ralph Lauren Black Tie Collection promotional CD softly playing on an endless loop was drifting in from the living room. Smells of Ralph Lauren Home Amalfi Coast scented candles, Ralph Lauren Home Joshua Tree scented candles, and Ralph Lauren Home Rhinelander Flagship candles were cooling my temples. The wonderous peace of aspirational lifestyle branding flowed through me like a tide. Then, in the dark hour before dawn, my iPhone beeped. It was announcing a tweetstorm from the president, gloating about doing stupid and terrible things to people who now and forever meant nothing to me. For the first time in a long time I thought about the Donald. I felt I understood why at the end of his term he was talking about “infrastructure,” why he was playing at beginning again. So close to impeachment, Donald must have felt free and ready to run for president once more. Nobody, nobody had the right to cry over him, not that anybody ever would. And I felt ready to run for president, too. As if that blind rage had washed me clean and rid me of Hope, for the first time, in that night alive with Twitter notifications, I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the Donald’s sociopathy. Finding him so like myself—so like a big brother, really—I felt that I had been the White House Communications Director and I would always be the White House Communications Director. For everything to be made great again, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be the largest audience to ever witness congressional hearings—period—on the day of my testimony, and that they greet me with chants of “Lock her up.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience breaks new ground in the field of novelty songs about Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/unauthorized-bash-brothers-experience-lonely-island-monster-bash.html,"Pioneers? Netflix On Thursday, comedy trio the Lonely Island—Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone—released a surprise “visual poem,” in the tradition of Beyoncé’s Lemonade or Fergie’s Double Dutchess: Seeing Double: The Visual Experience . Lonely Island’s entry in the burgeoning genre, The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience , now streaming on Netflix , is about baseball players Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, the so-called “Bash Brothers” mentioned in the title. The duo earned the nickname in the summer of 1988 because of both the home runs they were hitting for the Oakland A’s and their custom of bashing their forearms together instead of high-fiving. Their story is an epic tragedy: In 2005 Canseco blew Major League Baseball wide open with his memoir Juiced , in which he alleged that he and McGwire had been using steroids . McGwire angrily denied Canseco’s claims for five years before finally coming clean in 2010 , and the former teammates have never reconciled . The Lonely Island’s take on this presents itself as a previously-unreleased rap album from the Bash Brothers recorded at the height of their fame, a framing that plays to their greatest strengths: roasting the Licensed to Ill -era Beastie Boys and making dick jokes . Consider this verse from “Uniform On,” ostensibly performed by Mark McGwire:
You know I’m not a hamburger but they call me Big Mac,
Got the one ton jimmy and the itty bitty sack.
My balls shrinky-dinky ’cause the ’roids so strong,
But it makes the aforementioned jimmy jam look long. If there’s a better musical distillation of the complicated way professional baseball players of the late 1980s navigated the tension between their fans’ expectations, the grueling demands of their sport, and their own ideas of masculinity, I would be extremely surprised. Here’s the full video for that song: But although the Lonely Island may be the first group to record songs about the effects of anabolic steroids on Mark McGwire’s testicles, they were not the first group to record a novelty song about the Bash Brothers. That honor goes to the marketing department of the Oakland A’s and the staff of San Jose television station KICU-TV , who beat them to the bash by 30 years with “The Monster Bash,” back in April of 1988. The song, yet another spinoff of Bobby “Boris” Picket’s 1962 hit “Monster Mash,” was recorded and paired to a music video of baseball highlights in a two-week sprint at the start of the 1988 season, a few months before Canseco and McGwire posed for their famous Bash Brothers poster . It debuted on the Oakland Coliseum’s giant Mitsubishi DiamondVision scoreboard on Friday, April 15 of that year, at the top of the second inning of a game between the A’s and the Chicago White Sox, the first of a weekend series. The score was 0 to 0 when “The Monster Bash” played, but the White Sox went on to clobber the A’s, 11 to 3. That Saturday, “The Monster Bash” soundtracked another White Sox victory; Sunday was the same story, and the song was temporarily retired. But whatever “The Monster Bash” lacked in motivational power, it made up for in “sounding enough like ‘Monster Mash’ that people immediately got the joke,” and it bashed its way onto local radio station playlists that summer, eventually triumphantly returning to the DiamondVision. Then it disappeared from the face of the earth. You won’t find the original video on YouTube or the song on a battered cassingle on eBay. It doesn’t seem to have ever gotten a commercial release—despite the success of “The Super Bowl Shuffle!”—and for whatever reason the Oakland A’s current stadium entertainment doesn’t spend a lot of time reminding fans about the team’s ’roided-out champions of the 1980s. But there’s one place “The Monster Bash” survives, at least in part: in the audio of a TV special called The 1988 Oakland Athletics: A Bashing Success . First aired in April of 1989 (on KICU, naturally), A Bashing Success eventually made its way to VHS and from there, to the internet. Here, then, are some of the last surviving traces of “The Monster Bash,” mankind’s first crude attempt to chronicle Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire’s athletic prowess through the power of novelty songs: It’s clear that novelty song technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the ensuing decades. But it’s also clear that the old saying, often attributed to Isaac Newton, is true: If the Lonely Island have seen a little further than others, it is only because they have stood on the shoulders of the marketing department of the 1988 Oakland Athletics, who were themselves standing on the shoulders of Bobby “Boris” Pickett, probably without his knowledge.

How to talk about salary with co-workers.,slate.com,Alison Green,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/salary-transparency-wage-gap-inequality.html,"What Should You Do if You’re Asked to Complete Free Work for a Job Interview? When was the last time you talked with colleagues about how much money you earn? If you’re like most people, your answer is “never.” As a society, we’re incredibly weird about discussing how much we earn. It feels gauche or intrusive to ask other people what they make, and a lot of us feel uncomfortable sharing our own numbers. Given that, it’s no coincidence that so many people find it difficult to figure out a fair market rate for their work, which leads to anxiety in salary negotiations and leaves people lowballing themselves. Without any real data to rely on, they’re afraid of shooting too high. It also allows people to go on being underpaid for years, often without realizing it, and perpetuates wage gaps by race and gender. If we talked more freely with each other about our salaries, workers wouldn’t be at such a disadvantage when negotiating with employers. And people desperately want more information about the going rate for their work. This person who wrote to me is pretty typical:
I’ve found salary websites to be really inaccurate. There’s such a wide range of responsibility that can come with any given title, and just too much variation. It’s so frustrating not having any reliable sources of information about salary. For something so important, you’d think we’d have a better system. How are we supposed to find out what a fair pay range is for our work? In fact, when I recently ran a survey on my website asking people to anonymously share their salaries in a Google form (along with their job titles, industry, and geographic area), 1,000 people responded within the first half-hour and 27,000 people responded in just a few days—with answers flooding in so quickly that at times the spreadsheet kept freezing. Clearly there’s a hunger to exchange salary information. So why, then, don’t more of us talk openly about what we’re earning? This person summed up the way a lot of people feel about it:
Unless it was someone I was very close with and trusted, I would not share this information. It’s no one’s business but my own. Once you share it, it’s outside your control who that information is passed to. You can ask someone to keep it confidential, but there’s no guarantee that your request will be honored. Maybe the person will use it to try and justify getting a raise—as in, “Ann makes $X and I should too!” I don’t want to be any part of anything like that, nor do I want there to be any hint that I’m on the sidelines, egging it on.
Then on the flip side, what if you’re sharing that information and you find out that your colleague makes more than you do? Unless you feel that person’s skills and talents are truly superior to your own, it’s going to be hard for that to eat away at you. Personally, I’m very satisfied with my salary, and I don’t need to know what anyone else makes. In fact, I’m one of the few IT people in my company who has access to that information for every employee, and I stay the hell away from it because there are just some things that aren’t any of my business and this is one of them. Even people who believe in transparency in theory can find it hard to put into practice, as this reader reports:
I too believe in salary disclosure and not being taboo and being able to talk about it, but one time I was out with friends and we were talking about salary and they were all open about what they were making. Two of them had been working about 5-6 years more in their chosen line of work then I have in mine, but my salary was $10-15,000 more then all of the people at that table. Part of it is my chosen career path—you make way more being in operations than lower level admin just based on requirements of the job, but man oh man did I feel uncomfortable talking about it after that. I copped out and ended up saying “oh yeah around there” and not giving any number. Of course, the only parties likely to benefit from this secrecy are employers; it’s to everyone else’s detriment. (No surprise, though, that many employers actively discourage employees from talking with one another about what they earn, even though federal law makes it illegal for employers to prevent nonsupervisory employees from discussing their pay with each other.) Those who do talk openly about salary generally find it incredibly useful :
I will forever owe a colleague who gave me information on her salary that revealed how much I was underpaid. I brought this information to my boss—without naming her—and just said, look, if this info is true, then I would argue I’m bringing you a lot more value than I’m being paid for, please make it right (couched in nicer language of course).
I got a 25% raise that year. Here’s an account from someone who chose to share—and is glad they did:
I once offered to share with a coworker what I make. … She was fighting our boss to reclassify her position and give her a raise, but the boss was telling her it wasn’t in the budget. She shared with me what she was making, and I let her know I was making nearly double that. Having that information was the kick she needed to look for other jobs and fight for her worth. She found a lateral transfer and was able to use market analysis for the new role to get a higher compensation. I felt terrible for her, but I’m glad I gave her that information. Even when people aren’t willing to share hard numbers, they’re often more comfortable talking about ranges :
When I was promoted at a marketing agency from VP to SVP, the pay bump was much lower than I expected (I am a woman). I asked a close friend to tell me his salary range but he was concerned about doing so. However, when I told him my salary, he was shocked. I then said the range I was planning to request and he said it was well within the band. I made my case and got the raise I wanted. And yet, it’s hard to initiate a conversation about what you earn or, harder still, what the person across from you earns. One way to do it is to say something like, “I have the sense my salary is below-market, and I’m trying to test that with real data. Would you be willing to discuss what we’re each earning, as a way of better understanding how salaries work here?” These conversations are critical if employees are to have any shot at evening the playing field with employers, getting paid what they’re worth, and shrinking pay disparities by race and gender.

"Leonard Leo, Trump’s judge whisperer, promises to take us back to the 1930s.",slate.com,Jamal Greene,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/leonard-leo-federalist-society-new-deal-trump-judges.html,"Pelosi Is Kidding Herself if She Thinks Congress Can Investigate Trump Without an Impeachment Inquiry One week before the 1980 presidential election, toward the end of his lone debate against Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan stared into the camera and implored Americans to ask themselves, “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” The question is widely believed to have ended Carter’s presidency. Last week, the Washington Post published a profile of Federalist Society Executive Vice President Leonard Leo, focusing in part on a speech he gave to the Council for National Policy in which he warmly predicted the Supreme Court would soon return to the pre–New Deal era of “limited, constitutional government.” Leo believes, in other words, that the court’s view of the Constitution was better off 85 years ago than it is today. “I think we stand at the threshold of an exciting moment in our republic,” Leo told the council at a closed-door meeting in February, audio of which was obtained by the Post. “This is really, I think, at least in recent memory, a newfound embrace of limited constitutional government in our country. I don’t think this has really happened since probably before the New Deal.” The average American doesn’t know who Leo is, but as the Post piece makes clear, he‘s one of the most influential lawyers in the country. A longtime leader within the Federalist Society, Leo has had Donald Trump’s ear on judicial appointments and has been the main curator of the president’s list of Supreme Court candidates. Two of Leo’s personal picks, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, have been elevated to the highest court in the country since Trump’s election. So when Leonard Leo says he wants to return to a pre–New Deal Constitution, you should listen. And you should be alarmed. As Leo knows, constitutional law was very different in the 1930s from what it is today. And in a word, it sucked. In the 1930s, the courts were fully complicit in maintaining the country as a thoroughgoing ethnocracy, governed openly for the benefit of white men. Public schools in 21 states were racially segregated by law. “Separate but equal” schools had been affirmed by the Supreme Court as late as 1927, in a unanimous decision allowing Mississippi to kick a Chinese American girl out of her local “white” school for being a member of the “yellow” race. The outlawing of segregation is settled law in our country, and nobody would dare dream of returning to those antiquated judicial interpretations, you might say? Several of Trump’s judicial nominees have conspicuously, outrageously, refused to say whether they thought Brown v. Board of Education , which ended legal school segregation in 1954, was correctly decided. Leo believes that the court’s view of the Constitution was better off 85 years ago than it is today. In the 1930s, through a combination of discriminatory literacy tests, poll taxes, “good character” requirements, and straight-up violence, less than 1 percent of black people in the Deep South—where they represented more than a third of the population—were registered to vote. The Supreme Court had blessed these intimidation practices for decades, ever since a 1903 decision in which the court said it couldn’t do anything about Alabama’s self-described effort “to establish white supremacy in this state” by refusing to register black voters. Discriminatory voting practices of this sort weren’t banned until the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the most significant provision of which was gutted six years ago in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts (whom Leo also helped elevate to the court). In the 1930s, women had no constitutional right to equality. They could legally be kept off juries, given different work hours, paid less money, and imprisoned for using birth control. It would be another four decades before the Supreme Court struck down even a single law for discriminating against women. Kavanaugh and Gorsuch—again, both products of Leo’s vetting—recently dissented from the court’s temporary blocking of a Louisiana law that would have left the entire state with just a single doctor able to perform abortions. In the first half of the 20 th century, the police could beat confessions out of arrestees. Poor defendants had no right to a lawyer. Evidence could be illegally seized and used in prosecutions. In 1944, for example, South Carolina executed a 14-year-old black boy named George Stinney for the murders of two white girls. He was questioned alone, without his parents or a lawyer present, and convicted by an all-white jury after a two-hour trial and 10 minutes of deliberation. He wasn’t allowed to appeal. He had to sit on books to fit into the headpiece of the electric chair. Only in 2014, 70 years too late, did a circuit court judge vacate the 14-year-old Stinney’s murder conviction . The Stinney case tells you all you need to know about criminal justice in the age Leo wants to bring back. The 1930s was of course the decade of the Great Depression, when unemployment hit 25 percent and most Americans lived in poverty. The post–New Deal court decisions Leo wishes to repudiate are the ones that gave the government the power to enact minimum wage laws, to create unemployment insurance and Social Security, to provide health insurance to the aged and destitute, and to give workers collective bargaining rights. In the 1930s, those too old to work and too poor not to could often expect a quick but painful death . This is the human toll of “limited government.” If we’re looking for Reagan’s shining city upon a hill, we won’t find it in America’s now-distant past. Not most of us, anyway. And if it’s what Leo is promising us, we can only hope it’s not in America’s future. Support our journalism

Trump cites Ian Bremmer tweet as example of why libel laws need to change.,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-cites-ian-bremmer-tweet-libel-laws.html,"Army Gets Heartbreaking Answers After Asking, “How Has Serving Impacted You?” President Donald Trump on Monday slammed pundit, journalist, and New York University professor Ian Bremmer for publishing a “completely ludicrous quote” that he attributed to him. In the early morning tweet while he was still in Japan, the president said the fake quote that Bremmer published and then deleted shows “what’s going on in the age of Fake News” and how something must be done to prevent similar instances in the future. “@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP ‘a completely ludicrous quote’, attributing it to me. This is what’s going on in the age of Fake News,” Trump wrote. “People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really, the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!” . @ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP “a completely ludicrous quote,” attributing it to me. This is what’s going on in the age of Fake News. People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really, the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2019 Bremmer, the founder and president of Eurasia Group who is also a columnist and editor-at-large for Time , published a tweet over the weekend that contained a false quote from Trump about North Korea. In the since-deleted post , Bremmer quoted Trump as saying “Kim Jong Un is smarter and would make a better President than Sleepy Joe Biden.” The quote was shared by Rep. Ted Lieu of California and several popular pundits, including Ana Navarro-Cardenas.When Bremmer was confronted on the fake quote, he defended it by saying it was “plausible” and somehow made a point about the larger state of news media. “This is objectively a completely ludicrous quote. And yet kinda plausible. Especially on twitter, where people automatically support whatever political position they have. That’s the point.” Bremmer wrote in a tweet that he has also since deleted . When you put out a fake Trump quote without any indication you were making it up, and then blame the readers for not realizing you were making the quote up.Nice work, @ianbremmer . You're only helping the cause of people like Trump who want to label everything ""fake news."" pic.twitter.com/BYYKmNmDNU — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) May 26, 2019 UPDATE: @ianbremmer has now admitted that he fabricated this viral Trump quote.

The President correctly quoted me as saying it was a “completely ludicrous” statement. I should have been clearer. My apologies. — ian bremmer (@ianbremmer) May 27, 2019 This is not the first time Trump has called for a change in libel laws. In fact, he has been pushing the message since he was a candidate. “One of the things I’m going to do if I win … I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,” Trump said in February 2016 . He has repeated that threat several times since he moved into the White House. Support our journalism

North Korea: John Bolton is a “war monger” and “structurally defective guy.”,slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/north-korea-kcna-john-bolton-war-monger.html,"Army Gets Heartbreaking Answers After Asking, “How Has Serving Impacted You?” North Korea on Monday made its displeasure with National Security Adviser John Bolton clear after he said recent sort-range missile tests amounted to a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. An unnamed North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement that was published by the state KCNA news agency calling Bolton a “war monger” and “structurally defective,” adding that his statements were “more than ignorant.” Bolton told reporters on Saturday that there was “no doubt” that North Korea’s missile tests violated the U.N. resolutions. But then President Donald Trump appeared to express disagreement with his adviser as he made an effort to downplay the tests . “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote on Twitter. North Korea fired back at Bolton, saying that his claims were “more than ignorant” because North Korea has never recognized the U.N. Security Council resolutions. “If any object is launched, it is bound to fly in trajectory. What the U.S. is taking the issue is not about the range but the prohibition of the launch itself using ballistic technology,” read the statement. “This is, after all, tantamount to a demand that the DPRK should give up its self-defensive right.” The tests “neither targeted anyone nor endangered the surrounding countries” and Bolton’s words show how he is “impudently poking his nose into other’s internal matters.” The statement goes on to blame Bolton for playing a key role in the collapse of a nuclear deal between North Korea and the United States reached in 1994 and says he is known in the country as a “war maniac.” Beyond North Korea, Bolton has an “obsession with other wars in the Middle East and South America” and he is now “whispering war to the president.” Bolton should be called “not a security adviser striving for security but a security-destroying adviser who is wrecking peace and security,” the statement notes. “It is not at all strange that perverse words always come out from the mouth of a structurally defective guy, and such a human defect deserves an earlier vanishing.” On Monday, Trump once again suggested he disagreed with Bolton about the seriousness of the tests that took place earlier this month. “My people think it could have been a violation, as you know,” Trump said at a news conference in Japan . “I view it differently. I view it as a man, perhaps he wants to get attention. Perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn’t matter. All I know is that there have been no nuclear tests, no ballistic missiles going out, no long-range missiles going out. And I think that some day we’ll have a deal.” Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made clear he disagreed with Trump, saying the missile tests were “ of great regret .” Support our journalism

"So Far, Models Are Predicting a Trump Victory in 2020",slate.com,Daniel Politi,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/models-predicting-trump-victory-2020.html,"Army Gets Heartbreaking Answers After Asking, “How Has Serving Impacted You?” Three analysts who set up and look at predictive models say President Donald Trump is likely to win reelection in 2020. The secret? A combination of favorable economic data as well as the normal advantage that incumbents enjoy, according to Steven Rattner, a counselor to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. In a column for the New York Times , Rattner notes that “one of the best” models to predict election outcomes makes clear that Trump is likely to receive a significant tailwind from the economy. Ray Fair, a professor at Yale, has come up with a model that takes into account GDP growth rates, inflation, and incumbency and has been quite accurate in previous cycles. In 2016, for example, the model accurately predicted a victory for Trump although it overestimated his share of the popular vote. According to that model, Trump’s vote share should be as high as 56.1 percent in the next election, although in reality the divisiveness of the candidate means the actual number won’t be as high. Fair isn’t the only modeler to see Trump with a clear advantage in 2020. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics analyzed 12 models and found that Trump comes out on top in all of them. Donald Luskin of Trend Macrolytics analyzed the Electoral College and came to the same conclusion. “So the question for 2020 may well be whether Mr. Trump can overcome the majority of voters’ poor perception of him and use a good economy and incumbency to win re-election,” Rattner writes.

Duncan Hunter of California came out to defend a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes with a curious strategy: saying he had also taken photos of dead bodies while serving in the Marine Corps. Hunter, like many fellow Republicans, has defended Edward Gallagher in the past against war crimes charges and he did it again over the weekend during a town hall meeting. “Eddie did one bad thing that I’m guilty of too—taking a picture of the body and saying something stupid,” Hunter said. Hunter, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he has taken photos “just like that when I was overseas” although he did not send it to anyone or post it on social media. “But a lot of my peers … have done the exact same thing,” Hunter said, according to the Times of San Diego . Gallagher is actually accused of a lot more than a photograph. He is facing murder charges for allegedly killing a wounded teenage ISIS prisoner in Iraq in 2017. “Good story behind this, got him with my hunting knife,” Gallagher allegedly texted to a fellow SEAL alongside a photograph of himself next to the dead fighter. He is also accused of shooting two civilians in Iraq, indiscriminately opening fire on crowds, and intimidating witnesses, including fellow SEALs. Although Hunter said Gallagher should be pardoned, he wants his court-martial to proceed so everyone can see “how disgusting the military justice system is when it’s run by lawyers and bureaucrats.” Hunter says the trial could “maybe give an example of how they can change the system.” Hunter is also facing his own legal troubles as he and his wife were indicted in 2017 on allegations of using campaign funds for personal spending. They both pleaded not guilty. Support our journalism

Steve King criticizes Katrina victims using racist dogwhistle,slate.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/steve-king-hurricane-katrina-victims-criticism.html,"Buttigieg: “No Question” Trump Falsified Disability Status to Avoid Serving in Vietnam War Rep. Steve King—a man who makes news with openly racist , white supremacist , and otherwise offensive comments often enough that his own party finally stripped him of his committee assignments —dredged up an old racist complaint while speaking at a town hall in the overwhelmingly white city of Charter Oak, Iowa, Thursday night:
[H]ere’s what FEMA tells me: We go to a place like New Orleans, and everybody’s looking around saying, “Who’s going to help me? Who’s going to help me?” We go to a place like Iowa, and we go see, knock on the door at, say, I make up a name, John’s place, and say, “John, you got water in your basement, we can write you a check, we can help you.” And John will say, “Well, wait a minute, let me get my boots. It’s Joe that needs help. Let’s go down to his place and help him.” While King, in praising Iowans for their response to the recent flooding along the Missouri River , did not say explicitly why he singled out residents of New Orleans 14 years ago, the majority-black city has long been subject to racist tropes about laziness and reliance on government handouts. King, who in his comments boasted that he had visited New Orleans after the hurricane and participated in relief efforts, was one of a small number in Congress to oppose a bill providing federal aid to the victims, according to the Washington Post . Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. in nearly eight decades: According to CNN , at least 1,833 people, mainly in Louisiana, died from the storm and its floods; nearly half of those who died in Louisiana were older than 74. The government estimated the cost of damage at $125 billion . Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards called King’s comments “ disgusting and disheartening ” on Thursday. “When communities are affected by disasters, we come together to help each other, not tear each other down,” he tweeted. U.S. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who represents a suburban New Orleans district, also quickly condemned King’s statement. “His comments about Katrina victims are absurd and offensive,” he told the Advocate . “[They] are a complete contradiction to the strength and resilience the people of New Orleans demonstrated to the entire nation in the wake of the total devastation they experienced.” Support our journalism

But Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle juggernaut is undeniably for some women. Its homepage currently offers advice on DIY blowouts and women’s swimsuits. It sells “ performance cashmere ” ruffled sweaters and a $400 “super-serum,” organic tampons, and a vibrator it prefers to call a “wellness solution.” Some of its content is plausibly co-ed, but its vibe is self-consciously feminine, with all that self-care, “ medical intuition ,” and endless emotional processing. Now Goop is expanding into a new frontier: men. “It feels like we’re at a point in the culture where men are rejecting that sort of toxic masculinity,” the company’s chief content officer, Elise Loehnen, told Fast Company last week. “We wanted to do something that was more about the emotional health of men, the importance of vulnerability, and this acknowledgment of how hard these things can be.” Enter Goopfellas , a new interview-based podcast that puts a masc gloss on femme Goop. The first episode dropped this week. A men’s newsletter and clothing line are coming up. In Episode 1, hosts Will Cole and Seamus Mullen project a gentle bro energy as they discuss ego, trauma, and small setbacks they called “the paper cuts of life.” I listened twice to this inaugural episode and couldn’t repeat back a single concrete idea, but I definitely got the gist: transformation, feelings, something about vulnerability? The episode opened with some slow banter about the weather (“I’m so stoked that spring is finally here”) and ended with a listener question about how to combat overeating (“you have to heal the past” … “mindfulness”). These men seem extremely, extremely relaxed. Both of the hosts have knocked around the extended Goop universe for a while before launching the podcast. Mullen is a sort of roving Goop house chef, making dishes like grain-free jicama-shell tacos in the Goop test kitchen and providing snacks for partygoers at the Goop Aspen pop-up shop. He gamely bantered about fecal transplants and adaptogenic herbs in a “ How Goop Are You? ” video last year. Cole has been interviewed several times on the website, usually under the website’s “Speculative but Promising” rubric, about topics like the possible existence of an “ autoimmune spectrum .” (“Speculative but Promising” seems to be one notch more legit than “ Fascinating and Inexplicable .”) Goopfellas takes the core values of Goop—wellness, self-acceptance—and overlays them with an acknowledgment that getting there poses specific challenges to men. The hosts have come by their goopy sensibilities honestly. Cole is a “functional medicine practitioner,” runs a “practice” in which he sees “patients,” and uses the honorific “Dr.,” all of which might make you think he graduated from medical school. In reality, he has a doctorate of chiropractic from Southern California University of Health Sciences, which is a private school of alternative medicine. His postdoctoral training includes a stint at Functional Medicine University, an online “university” in which you can enroll today for a down payment of just $150. Mullen, a New York chef, has a foothold in alternative medicine culture, too. After years of what he describes as confusing pain and health problems, he was diagnosed in 2007 with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder. As a chef, Mullen opened restaurants including a Spanish restaurant in New York’s West Village, now closed; recently, his career has shifted away from food prep and toward “wellness.” (He published a cookbook of Paleo-inspired “healing” meals.) He was recently interviewed about his health journey on Goop’s flagship podcast, of which Goopfellas is a spinoff. The Goop Podcast is basically a new age–y chat show with a knack for framing lavish 1-percenter lifestyle tips as generic female empowerment. Paltrow and Loehnen trade off interviewing “leading thinkers, culture changers, and industry disruptors” about “shifting old paradigms and starting new conversations.” Their guests have included Julia Roberts, Howard Schultz (Paltrow praised him as “strong and fit”), and Oprah. Other episodes have focused on “how to become your future self,” fasting, “detox without deprivation,” avoiding endocrine-disrupting chemicals , and processing trauma (“in partnership with our friends at Swarovski”). Goopfellas , meanwhile, takes the core values of the Goop ethos—wellness, self-acceptance—and overlays them with an acknowledgement that getting there poses specific challenges to men. The inaugural episode mentioned anger, distant fathers, and the expectation that you’re nothing without your career. The pair’s first guest was Keith Mitchell, a former NFL linebacker who took up meditation and yoga after suffering a career-ending injury in 2003. Mitchell now pushes back against the “gladiator mentality” that pressures athletes to ignore their own bodies. But when Cole and Mullen asked him if he would welcome his own children playing football, he said it would be fine as long as when “you go out and do the damage you have to come back also and do the healing.” I had no idea what that meant, and it sure didn’t sound like an airtight medical antidote to, say, CTE , but the hosts murmured, “I like that,” “That’s great.” At another point, Mitchell briefly referred to a doctor in Honduras who helped him heal from the concussions he sustained as an NFL player; he has written elsewhere about applying a paste to his head and eating raw orchids to treat past concussions. Very Goop! The episode would have been more intriguing to me—more “authentic,” to use a Goop word—if the men had gone deeper into the real bumps in their own biographies, rather than just opaquely discussing the concept of personal growth. Mullen has closed several restaurants: What did that feel like? Mitchell made it sound like his NFL career would have been great if not for a single dramatic injury, but the reality seems more complicated : What did that feel like? Goopfellas hasn’t announced its future lineup, though Cole and Mullen told Fast Company that their dream interviews include Robert Downey Jr. and Barack and Michelle Obama. (Hey, mine, too!) In the meantime, they recently chatted onstage at a Goop event with director Kevin Smith about weight loss and veganism. That conversation was moderated by the founder of a “ hair wellness ” startup for people with thinning hair. Repackaging Rogaine as “wellness”—it doesn’t get goopier than that."
"This One’s for the Ladies Is More Than Just a Real-Life, NC-17 Magic Mike",slate.com,Nichole Perkins,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/this-ones-for-the-ladies-review-male-stripper-documentary.html,"Sundance Breakout The Souvenir Is One of the Best Movies of the Year So Far Let’s just get this out of the way early: Yes, the NC-17 rating for This One’s for the Ladies is justified. You will see full frontal, and it will be impressive. But it will not be what audiences talk about the most after seeing this documentary. The strippers’ dance moves and abdominal muscles are the spoonfuls of sugar that help make the film’s slices of American life easier to stomach. You’ll go into the film ready to see some shiny, rippling flesh, and you will not be disappointed, but you’ll leave thinking about community and justice. Directed by Gene Graham, the movie follows not only a select crew of exotic dancers but also the community of women who follow and support them. Twins Tyga and Raw Dog are founding members of the New Jersey Nasty Boyz, a troupe that includes entertainers like Young Rider, Satan, Mr. Capable, Fever, and lesbian “dom” Blaze. Sweet Tea serves as a crowd-pleasing master of ceremonies. Meanwhile, loyal fans with nicknames like Double Trouble, Poundcake, and C-Pudding show their love with pithy one-liners, sponsored events, and perhaps most important, money where their mouths want to go. It’s easy to compare the documentary to the Magic Mike franchise, loosely based on the former life of star Channing Tatum . Like those movies, This One’s for the Ladies is best viewed with a group of friends who can gasp and giggle together. And these films all have “stripper with a heart of gold” storylines, dedicating significant chunks of screen time to the dancers’ entrepreneurial dreams of how they will pull themselves up by their G-strings to elevate themselves out of dire circumstances. But where the Magic Mike movies focus on the power of male friendships, This One drills into the dancers’ backgrounds. Fever glows with pride when he reveals he is the first in his family’s generation to graduate high school. Tyga and Raw Dog give a tour of the shuttered housing projects they once called home, worming through locked fences and telling stories about the effects of their mother’s drug addiction on their lives. The brothers talk about the homophobia that almost kept them from pursuing the career that ultimately provided the means to get her sober. Young Rider reveals that his flashy showmanship is a direct result of growing up watching his uncle perform drag. And Blaze voices her frustration when male dancers resent her appearance at shows, or when her mother futilely pressures her to marry a man. The dancers may have a variety of origin stories, but the women who pay to see them only see them as superheroes. Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Those patrons are profiled just as lovingly. One of them, Michele, is a white speech pathologist whose father has long since given up on the idea that she’ll bring home a white man to marry. She has a special thing for Mr. Capable, sponsoring an event to raise money for Autism Speaks with him as the main attraction. C-Pudding, youth choir director, shudders and needs a special kind of timeout any time the dancer Satan is mentioned. Poundcake, married to Big Daddy, says she turns gay any time Blaze performs. Big Daddy has no problems with his wife’s favorite pastime. The two joke that it’s why they have so many children. You’ll go into the film ready to see some shiny, rippling flesh, and you will not be disappointed, but you’ll leave thinking about community and justice. With all of these characters, we learn the reasons why the escape offered by the booty shaking is so welcome. The women deal with the challenges of homelessness and police brutality, and the men sound off about the challenges of trying to make an honest living after incarceration. But don’t think the documentary is another reason to bemoan the difficulties of black life in America. As soon as you feel the high from watching the entertainers dance and the women react wear off, and the lights begin to come up to reveal more painful realities, Tyga and Raw Dog tell an amusing anecdote about, say, turning themselves into a bowl of fruit. Because of the film’s budget constraints, there is no easily recognizable music on the soundtrack, so don’t expect to watch another equestrian routine to Ginuwine’s “Pony.” But director Gene Graham pieced in music from various SoundCloud artists and worked tirelessly to sync the dancers’ movements to the songs, and it pays off. Between the entertainers’ mesmerizing moves and women’s arresting storytelling, the need for popular music disappears. This One’s for the Ladies slips in commentary about black American life as smoothly as a dollar bill slides into a waistband. Watch it to learn more about the lives of exotic dancers, but know that you’ll fall in love with the women supporting them, too. It’s a great film for a girls’ night out, with plenty of fun to make up for any uncomfortable truths and no hangover."

The end-of-high-school romp is a movie genre that includes comedies like American Graffiti from the 1970s, Dazed and Confused from the 1990s, and Superbad from the 2000s. They’re movies that follow a certain template: There’s a megaparty to be had, and it’s a wild, wacky, booze-fueled odyssey to get there. But these movies are also stories focused on boys’ lives—rueful, horny boys wanting to break the rules, get the girl, and get out of town. But this summer, finally, the template has been updated. Booksmart is a new movie directed by Olivia Wilde, about two smart young women, Molly and Amy, who are best friends finishing at the top of their class because they spent high school doing homework and volunteering instead of partying so they could get into good colleges—only to realize that their hard-partying classmates also got into those same good schools. Queue the wild, wacky, booze-fueled odyssey to get to the megaparty. But the depiction of the two girls and their friendship is not generic, but specific and fresh and believable. The stars, Beanie Feldstein ( Lady Bird ) and Kaitlyn Dever ( Justified ), talk with Kurt Andersen about stereotypes, role models, and how they decided to become roommates before shooting the film and actually became friends before portraying them. They also share their favorite on-screen friendships that inspired the enchanting bond between their characters. “This movie was never, ever for two boys,” Kaitlyn Dever says. “It was always in the female voice and these characters are so, so strong.” This podcast was produced by Studio 360’s Lauren Hansen.

William Barr’s New Authority to Declassify Anything He Wants Is a Threat to National Security,slate.com,Joshua A. Geltzer and Mary B. McCord,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-william-barr-declassification-national-security-dan-coats-threat.html,"Robert Mueller Was Telling Nancy Pelosi to Begin Impeachment Proceedings Over the weekend, President Donald Trump suggested that he trusted North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to “keep his promise” to Trump about the country’s nuclear program more than he trusted his own national security officials who have warned him about that program. It was just the latest example of Trump demonstrating disdain for the U.S. intelligence community and broader national security apparatus, but it came on the heels of a perhaps even scarier one. Trump’s decision last week to hand over unilateral authority to declassify America’s intelligence secrets to an attorney general who continues to act as if he’s Trump’s personal lawyer threatens to endanger intelligence sources, frighten our allies, and irreparably harm our national security. Late Thursday, at Attorney General William Barr’s request , the president granted him carte blanche not only to obtain all “assistance and information” he desires from the intelligence community in support of his “review” of intelligence activities related to the 2016 election, but also to declassify any information he chooses to—even if that information was originally classified not by the Justice Department but by, say, the Central Intelligence Agency or National Security Agency. Barr doesn’t even have to consult with the head of the intelligence agency or department whose information is at stake unless he deems it “practicable.” Trump’s approach is out of sync with proper executive branch leadership and, more importantly, dangerous to American security . Barr was not in government in early 2016 when red flags started to flutter about Russia’s successful attempts to meddle in our election, warnings that included Russian efforts to contact people associated with Trump. And he wasn’t in government when those red flags were straining against their moorings. He wasn’t part of any discussions or decisions, made in real time, about how to address the threat posed to the core of this country’s very democracy: free and fair elections without foreign influence. Now, rather than respectful deference to the women and men who had to make those decisions in the moment, Barr has demanded—and been handed—the power to rummage through classified materials, second-guessing the judgment calls of those who have spent decades combating foreign intelligence threats. It’s clear he intends to use that power for the benefit of his political patron, Donald Trump. This is just the latest manifestation of Trump’s dismal view of our nation’s intelligence community. Barr, in his first three months as attorney general, has demonstrated that he is more interested in being Trump’s lawyer than he is in being the American people’s lawyer. He released a four-page letter to Congress misleadingly summarizing the “principal conclusions” of the Mueller report, which even the circumspect Robert Mueller objected to as threatening a central purpose of his probe. On the morning of the redacted report’s release, he held an unprecedented press conference defending the president’s obstructive abuses described in the Mueller report as the reasonable actions of a “frustrated” man. He did everything he could to lend the authority of the Justice Department to Trump’s main political talking points of “no collusion” and “no obstruction.” And he stoked the “witch hunt” flames long fanned by Trump by telling Congress he thought that “spying” on the president’s campaign had occurred and promising to interrogate the origins of that intelligence inquiry. Now he appears prepared to fulfill that promise using the unprecedented and dangerous new powers given to him by Trump. To be clear, oversight of the intelligence community’s activities is critical. But that oversight has happened. Indeed, it continues to happen. Both the Senate and House have reviewed extensively the origins of the investigation into Russian election interference, and their probes continue. The Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General is nearing completion of its review of the investigation , especially as related to U.S. persons such as Carter Page, who briefly was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. If the inspector general’s report turns up something worthy of continued investigation, then a decision about next steps should be made at that time. But what need could there be for Barr to get ahead of his own Justice Department’s inspector general? It’s hard to fathom a reason other than the purely partisan one of keeping alive the president’s “witch hunt” theme amid an ongoing oversight battle with Congress and heading into the 2020 election. Now, it seems, Trump’s efforts in both arenas will be supported by selectively declassifying and disclosing whatever materials might tend to make the president look a bit better, while withholding those that don’t. This is just the latest manifestation of Trump’s dismal view of our nation’s intelligence community. Time and again, he has shown disregard and disrespect for the assessments of intelligence professionals. Recall the president’s Helsinki meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when Trump publicly embraced the position of the Russian leader that no interference had occurred, over the contrary opinions of his own intelligence community. Or remember his bizarre personal letters exchanged with Kim Jong-un . To its credit, the intelligence community has generally stood firm in its views despite Trump’s preference for the promises of foreign dictators. That history underscores what last week’s order reveals about Trump’s view of Barr. As a practical matter, the order gives Barr supremacy over the intelligence community by allowing him to declassify its secrets at will. As a conceptual matter, the order may be even more extraordinary by empowering Barr to “direct the declassification” of the intelligence community’s secrets. Trump is thus making one Cabinet member—Barr—superior to his fellow Cabinet members on the matters of their own agencies. If this involved the exercise of their statutory authorities, it would be clearly unlawful. However, because this is a delegation of the president’s own authority to classify and declassify—as implemented via earlier executive orders—it may be lawful. But it’s a terrible and dangerous approach to governance. Trump is rewarding the Cabinet member who’s been most political, most “loyal,” most obedient, by elevating him over other Cabinet members who have been providing nonpartisan intelligence assessments to keep our country safe. As alarming as last week’s order must have been to the U.S. intelligence community, imagine what our foreign allies must think. On Friday, Trump made clear that he wants Barr to use his review to “look at” the role British and Australian intelligence services played in the Russia probe, “because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.” This represents an extraordinary threat to the intelligence these and other countries share with us and often help us to acquire and protect as well as to the people gathering that intelligence. It—quite reasonably—seems certain to decrease their trust in Washington’s will to protect sources, methods, and intelligence; in turn, it’s likely to decrease how much they share. Ultimately, politically driven declassification and a decrease in intelligence sharing by U.S. partners—and especially the combination—could endanger the lives of Americans. Although Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has expressed confidence that the attorney general “will work with the IC in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,” it’s unclear if those standards will in fact be respected by Barr, given that the order requires him to consult with the intelligence community about declassification only, as noted above, if Barr himself deems it “practicable.” To our closest allies, and to the women and men who have risked their lives—and in some cases, died—to acquire intelligence to protect our nation, the president’s order says a lot about his view of national security: not as a sacred responsibility of an American president, but as something that can be exploited for political advantage. That’s a terrible price for the rest of us to pay. Support our journalism

Amazon is reportedly shopping for office space in Manhattan.,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/amazon-new-york-city-office-space.html,"McConnell Says He’d Confirm an Election-Year Trump Supreme Court Nominee Because He’s a Republican and Obama Wasn’t Amazon is reportedly back in the market for office space in New York City, which, if true, is a sweet bit of vindication for critics of the company’s whole HQ2 fracas. In February , Amazon dropped its plans to build a massive office complex in Queens amid political blowback over a package of state and city subsidies the project would have received. Now, according to the New York Post , the company is shopping for real estate on the West Side of Manhattan. “The tech giant has been in talks with owners of two shiny new skyscrapers located just one block west of Penn Station — the newly built One Manhattan West and its soon-to-be sister project, Two Manhattan West,” the paper reports, citing “sources.” The company, which already has 5,000 employees in the city, is apparently looking for 100,000 square feet or “much more.” That footprint is significantly smaller than the 4 million to 8 million square feet of space Amazon planned to build out for its HQ2 project. But the fact that the company is still planning to grow its New York presence without a large, specially crafted subsidy package seems to prove the basic point many of the deal’s critics made, which is that major cities with large pools of business and engineering talent do not need to stoop to corporate welfare in order to attract major tech companies, which tend to go where they can find enough employees. The sweeteners that New York offered Jeff Bezos to move to Queens—some of which, to be fair, would have been open to any company by law—may have encouraged him to plan a bigger immediate expansion in the New York area. But the “much more” in the Post report implies that Amazon may well add more space and workers in New York over time. Meanwhile, the real estate the the company was eyeing in Long Island City, which was already one of the fastest growing residential neighborhoods in the country, can still be used for another productive project like housing, and we don’t have to worry about the bad precedent of HQ2 encouraging other companies to sweat the state and city for tax breaks. Personally, I’m feeling pretty good about what I wrote last year:
Even if the incentive package [Cuomo] gave Amazon convinced it to pick New York over, say, Dallas, something else probably would have grown in the company’s absence. The counterfactual to consider isn’t Amazon or nothing. It’s probably Amazon or a bunch of new housing, or some other tech company and a smaller Amazon office. The Post is framing its scoop as a giant black eye for left-wing politicians who opposed the HQ2 deal. “Amazon’s renewed focus on Manhattan so soon after dropping its plans for Queens is an apparent rebuke to the politicians who helped scuttle Amazon’s plans to build a 4 million-square-foot campus in LIC, including US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, sources said,” the paper writes. It is unclear who those sources are, or if they speak for the company, but the line isn’t especially convincing since, again, having Amazon lease open office space in Manhattan while leaving more room for rental development in Queens is a pretty happy ending for all involved. But if tech giants want to own New York’s libs by moving to the city without billions in subsidies, more power to them. Support our journalism

Data exchanges promise to reward you for your information.,slate.com,Garrett Hazelwood,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/data-exchanges-streamr-ubdi-ocean-protocol-privacy.html,"Join Us for an Event on Data, Power, and Governance The Facebooks and Googles of the world are getting rich off your data. Market researchers at PwC estimate that in 2018, companies that collect personal data to use for targeted advertising brought in $178 billion in revenue. Data brokers last year earned a further $21 billion. And these numbers are only trending up. By 2025, PwC expects the global data economy to be worth more than $400 billion. So it’s about time we get in on the action, right? Enter the so-called data exchange, a new breed of tech startup promising to cut us in on a share of the vast wealth being created by the sale of our personal data. Billing themselves as disruptors of a top-heavy and exploitative industry, these companies promise to build platforms where we can collect, store, and ultimately sell our browser histories, Fitbit analytics, bank statements, Instagram posts, Spotify habits, and all the other data points that drop from us like skin cells and hair follicles as we go about our lives. Each startup in this nascent economy has staked out a niche. Streamr wants to let you sell data in real time—every lane change in your Tesla and adjustment to your smart thermostat can be added to the aggregated data sets it will offer to corporations on a subscription basis. A company called UBDI (it stands for Universal Basic Data Income) brings analytics in house, selling only the insights it can glean from its users’ data rather than the data itself. And Ocean Protocol is on a mission to sell your data to A.I. companies, “equalizing access to data for all,” as its website announces, so megacorporations like IBM and Microsoft won’t be the only kinds of companies with access to massive stockpiles of our personal information. In return, you’ll get some crypto tokens that might be worth something one day if enough of us decide to sell access to our lives. That’s because the data exchange market doesn’t actually exist yet. Though a number of these companies have already launched, data is only valuable in aggregate, so these startups will need to attract users—and lots of them–before they can start compensating people in any kind of meaningful way. Until then, all we have are the hopeful predictions of evangelizing entrepreneurs like Roger Haenni, the co-founder of a startup called Datum, who vaguely estimates our data might be worth about $2,000 a year, though others have put the number much lower. Not to mention that many potential buyers in this market are currently awash in free data and have no trouble recruiting volunteers to give up intimate personal information for very little, as Facebook recently proved by offering e–gift cards of $20 per month to young people in exchange for permission to monitor all the data passing through their phones. The kind of data these companies want you to sell is not just some inert commodity. Jaron Lanier—author, tech philosopher, and pioneer of virtual reality—has been an outspoken critic of the way platforms like Google and Facebook exploit their users, and he’s advocated for a reciprocal model in which users pay for the services they receive while also being paid by these sites for the content they contribute. In considering future markets in which individuals might sell their personal data, Lanier sees potential but says, “You can’t really have viable capitalism without organized labor, because then everyone ends up working almost for free.” Rather, he told me, “The way this would have to work is the people who are giving data have to be able to form into organizations in which they collectively bargain, so that they have power, and it’s not just a bunch of individuals against a tech giant.” Many of the entrepreneurs behind these exchanges see themselves as building infrastructure for the kind of collective bargaining Lanier has in mind—and they, too, are thinking of data in terms of labor. Shiv Malik, for example, head of communications and strategy for Steamr, told me that he views the current structure of the data economy as analogous to the inequality decried by the Occupy movement: 1 percent of tech moguls control 99 percent of data wealth. “We’re all info slaves,” he said. According to this view, the picture you post of your daughter blowing out candles on her birthday cake, the route you take on your morning commute, the amount of time you spend standing in front of a display at the mall—all of it is the fruit of your labor, a commodity just lying around, waiting for someone like you (or Apple, or Amazon, or Google) to pick up and exchange for cash. The problem is that the kind of data these companies want you to sell is not just some inert commodity. It is not the product of your labor. It is the product of surveillance, and surveillance is a tool of manipulation. Shoshana Zuboff’s The Age of Surveillance Capitalism spends 700 pages making just this point, examining how our personal data has been weaponized against us by profit-driven corporations in ways that entrench inequality, damage our interior lives, and undermine the foundations of democracy. Although discrimination on the basis of race and gender is illegal, the more metrics these companies can use to track us, the more legal opportunities they have to identify and further disadvantage marginalized communities for the sake of their bottom lines. The example of health insurance companies raising premiums for customers who are struggling financially is perhaps the most flagrant instance of big data being used in discriminatory ways. But subtler examples, like findings that advertisements for junk food are overwhelmingly targeted at black and Hispanic children, speak even more explicitly to Zuboff’s warnings about the harmful ways in which our data is being used to shape our culture. When I spoke to Dana Budzyn , the 23-year-old wunderkind CEO and co-founder of UBDI, she acknowledged the ugly results of selling data to advertisers. But she says that selling anonymized information to market researchers (as UBDI will) is different because the focus is on understanding trends rather than targeting individuals, and companies might use the information in ways that benefit society. Budzyn suggested, for instance, that a firm researching transportation trends could pay people through her app to share data that would be used to enhance their local transit systems. And it’s true. In the right hands, our data can yield invaluable insights for researchers and policymakers. The Apple Watch’s ability to identify and track Parkinson’s symptoms is a promising use case of exactly that potential. But when money starts to enter the equation, Budzyn’s aspirational argument collides headlong with the facts of how our data is actually being used by the corporations of the world we live in—namely, to sell us shit, mitigate financial risk, and increase ROIs. These commercial data exchanges extend the exploitation inherent in the current system by incentivizing passivity. The model is one in which an individual’s agency extends no further than saying, Yes, I consent to sell this amount of my data to this company for this reason or No, I will keep this information private . The assumption is that our identities are like land in which a mineral deposit has been found: Data exchanges offer us the chance to sell mining rights. A truly ethical data market would be one in which contributors have real agency. Jaron Lanier proposes that such a market would allow you to sell data that is “beautiful and unique to you,” and which reflects something you can become excellent in and proud of. He imagines, for example, a collective of gardeners who sell data that helps program gardening robots others can buy—data, in other words, that actually does represent the fruits of labor. Sadly, today’s emerging exchanges are a long way from the markets Lanier hopes for. But the good news is that this new wave of startups is still in its infancy, still agile and able to adapt. Or still young enough to die and be replaced by a better model. A model, perhaps, that rewards our good actions rather than buying our acquiescence."

Britney Spears seeks renewed restraining order against Sam Lutfi.,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/britney-spears-renewed-restraining-order-sam-lutfi.html,"What’s Fact and What’s Fiction in the Elton John Biopic In the wake of the #FreeBritney fiasco, Britney Spears and her family are seeking to extend a temporary restraining order against Sam Lutfi, a former family friend who said he once served as Spears’ manager. The family’s petition alleged that Lutfi, a prominent voice in #FreeBritney, had been sending harassing texts to the Spears family and disparaging them on social media. On May 8, Lutfi was ordered to remain at least 200 yards from Britney, her parents, and her two sons after the family claimed that Lutfi had acted as a persistently disruptive force in their lives. CNN reported that the filing even disputed Lutfi’s professional link to Spears: “Beginning over a decade ago, Lutfi began pretending to have a professional association with Ms. Spears, even falsely claiming to have been her manager, when in reality he was only a parasite attempting to gain attention by associating himself with her celebrity.” Get Slate Culture in Your Inbox We encountered an issue signing you up.

Lutfi was a central figure in Britney’s life during the height of her fame, and the Spears family has long held him responsible for encouraging her down the destructive path that ended in her 2008 breakdown. The family cut itself off from Lutfi in 2009, when they were granted a three-year restraining order against him. The petition for the latest order alleged that Lutfi was trying to undermine Britney’s conservatorship and had caused the singer “severe mental trauma” during a period of high stress surrounding her father’s poor heath. The order arrived with a new wave of fan furor over Britney’s situation, including West Hollywood City Hall protestors and a contingent of Twitter supporters calling for Britney to be “freed” from her conservatorship. Lutfi has been vocal in his support of the movement, stoking the outcry by urging his Twitter followers to “raise hell.” Support our journalism

Earn Passive Income. What Could Go Wrong? Data and online connectivity are increasingly crucial drivers of the global economy. But there is tremendous debate and uncertainty over data governance—that is, how governments should interact with the private sector through data policy and law. Emerging data governance regimes around the world will have sweeping consequences not only for the economy but also for geopolitics, as countries jostle for influence in setting rules for new data-intensive technologies, including artificial intelligence, 5G wireless networks, the internet of things, and cloud technologies. There are open questions about how data governance should balance security, competitiveness, and privacy. A global patchwork of rules for how data is shared across borders will also shape trade and investment, technological development, and access to data around the world. Data itself is becoming an increasingly important element of national power. Yet there is a need for deeper discussion of how that power manifests, the implications for geopolitics, and the implications for U.S. policy.

Booksmart box office: Annapurna set the movie up for failure.,slate.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/booksmart-movie-box-office-superbad-disappointment.html,"How France Became the Women’s World Cup Favorite If you passed within hailing distance of Twitter over the holiday weekend, you might have heard a collective sigh from fans of smart, female-focused comedies as Booksmart sputtered to a sixth-place box-office finish. The movie’s $6.9 million weekend was a dismal haul for a movie that opened on more than 2,500 screens and a gutting disappointment for critics, who’ve been raving about the movie since its debut at South by Southwest in March, and for anyone who’d been hoping that the success of a movie created by and starring women might blaze a trail for others to follow. The movie to which Booksmart has most frequently been compared, including in Slate’s own review , is Superbad , which opened on nearly 3,000 screens in 2007 and ended up making more than $120 million domestic. But while measuring one comedy about two nerdy high-schoolers having one raucous night at the end of the school year against another seems like an apples-to-apples comparison (and a natural one when one of the two stars of Booksmart , Beanie Feldstein, is the younger sister of Superbad co-star Jonah Hill), there are vast differences between them, more consideration of which might have set expectations for Booksmart somewhere closer to reality—and, consequently, made it seem like a lot less of a failure. For one thing, Superbad followed only a few months after the $200 million-plus success of Knocked Up and was successfully sold as an extension of the Judd Apatow–Seth Rogen brand. (Apatow directed Knocked Up and produced Superbad , and Rogen starred in one and co-wrote the other, and Superbad co-star Jonah Hill had a small but memorable role in Knocked Up .) Superbad was released in the dog days of August, not on Memorial Day weekend against a phalanx of major-studio juggernauts—in a time before Netflix had trained an entire generation of teenagers to seek out content about themselves via streaming instead of in movie theaters. Booksmart is also an indie, while Superbad was a midbudget studio film. Finally, not to overlook the obvious, Superbad is about boys, and Booksmart is about girls. The movie industry’s conventional wisdom has been for years that women will see movies about men, but men won’t see movies about women, and in this case that seems to have been borne out to a degree: 61 percent of the film’s opening weekend audience was female, whereas Superbad ’s opening weekend audience was about 57 percent male .

Audiences who did see Booksmart came away impressed: The film got a B-plus from the audience rating service CinemaScore, and an A from women 17–34. (Superbad got an A-minus.) But despite an overt entreaty from director Olivia Wilde that a less-than-stellar result might “give studios an excuse not to green-light movies made by and about women ,” those audiences stayed small. The movie not only finished behind Aladdin , Detective Pikachu , and the latest entries in the Avengers and John Wick sagas but also the gory superhero knockoff Brightburn . There are any number of ways to explain it, beginning with Booksmart ’s marketing (always the first suspect), the low profiles of its stars, Wilde’s lack of a track record as a director, or the failures of the film itself, like its blind spot with regard to social class . (Although, as Slate’s review pointed out, movies like Superbad aren’t without their own blind spots, as Seth Rogen has himself admitted .) But the real culprit seems to be its distributor, United Artists Releasing, a joint venture between the film’s producer, Annapurna Pictures, and MGM.* In the midst of reported turmoil , Annapurna has badly fumbled the release of movies like If Beale Street Could Talk , Barry Jenkins’ follow-up to his Oscar-winning Moonlight , and seemed to abandon others, like the Nicole Kidman–starring Destroyer . (It’s only fair to note that the studio also steered Vice to more than $76 million in worldwide earnings and eight Oscar nominations—and that the studio’s founder, Megan Ellison, has accused reporters focusing on the company’s failures of sexism.) Instead of swinging for the fences by opening wide, United Artists could have let it expand into more theaters slowly, as A24 did with Lady Bird , whose $78 million take ought to silence any notions that audiences simply won’t turn out for movies about young women. Given that Booksmart was simultaneously released on Netflix in other parts of the world, a slow theatrical expansion would likely have exacerbated issues with online piracy, but it would have been preferable to what now looks like a highly public belly-flop. It might not have changed the movie’s fate overall, but in a few weeks, we could have been talking about its $15 million or $20 million take as a success story rather than a failure. It’s not fair or even sensible to hold every movie that isn’t about straight white men as a referendum on inclusiveness—nor, with rare exceptions, does guilting ticket buyers into supporting the cause seem to be an effective marketing tactic. But as long as so many seem intent on doing that, it’s better to shoot for the middle and let audiences spread the word than aim high and have a movie’s entire fate rest on who shows up in the first 72 hours.
Correction, May 28, 2019: This article originally misstated that Booksmart was distributed by Annapurna Pictures. It was produced by Annapurna and distributed by United Artists Releasing."
Planned Parenthood: Missouri is on the verge of losing its last abortion clinic.,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/planned-parenthood-missouri-last-abortion-clinic.html,"Clarence Thomas Pens Screed Comparing Women Who Obtain Abortions to Eugenicists The last abortion clinic in Missouri is on the verge of shutting down, threatening to make the state the first in the country to have no legal abortion access since Roe v. Wade , Planned Parenthood said in a statement Tuesday. According to Planned Parenthood, Missouri is “refusing to renew” the one remaining clinic’s license, which expires Friday. If it is not renewed by then, Missouri will be the first state without a functioning abortion clinic since 1973, the year of the Supreme Court decision. According to CBS News , the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services alerted Planned Parenthood on May 20 to three issues that it said could affect its license. Two days later, the organization said it would add another pelvic exam for patients and change their protocol for providing state-mandated counseling in order to satisfy the first two demands from the agency. But the organization rejected the third, a request to interview doctors who provide care at the clinic, saying it could only offer interviews with the two doctors who are employed by Planned Parenthood, as outside doctors who provide services at the center had not agreed to interviews. (Planned Parenthood said the state meant to “interrogate” doctors as an “intimidation tactic,” according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) A Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the organization filed a lawsuit Tuesday in an attempt to keep the clinic open. In the filing, Planned Parenthood argued that Missouri is “unlawfully conditioning” the renewal of the license on the completion of an investigation of a patient complaint that hasn’t been shared with the organization, according to the Post-Dispatch. If the clinic closes, women seeking abortions would have to travel to Kansas or Illinois. According to CBS News, several of the state’s other clinics previously closed down when the state implemented requirements for pelvic exams for pill-administered abortions, which Planned Parenthood argued are unnecessarily invasive. The organization refused, and the state went from five abortion providers in 2008 to just the one today. Missouri recently passed one of the country’s strictest abortion laws, joining five other states in a spate of near-complete bans on the service. On Friday, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill that bans abortions after eight weeks, with exceptions only for medical emergencies and not for rape or incest. While women would not be prosecuted under the law, doctors could be, and those found in violation could face five to 15 years in prison. On Tuesday morning, the ACLU of Missouri filed a notice that it would seek a referendum to repeal the law. It has until Aug. 28—the date the law is scheduled to go into effect—to collect 100,000 signatures. If successful, the law would be put on hold until the 2020 election, at which point it would be placed on the ballot for a simple yes-or-no vote."
Bernie Sanders Is Really Not That Rich for Someone His Age,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/how-rich-is-bernie-sanders-wealth-comparison-millionaires.html,"McConnell Says He’d Confirm an Election-Year Trump Supreme Court Nominee Because He’s a Republican and Obama Wasn’t There are many things that make this whole pseudo-controversy a bit silly. But one of them is that Sanders really isn’t that wealthy for somebody his age. He’s well-off, to be sure. But his level of affluence is pretty normal for a college-educated American in his 70s. The man earned a windfall, but he doesn’t suddenly have plutocrat money. According to Politico, Sanders has a net worth “approaching at least $2 million, taking into account his publicly outlined assets and liabilities along with the real estate he owns outright.” To find out where that would put him in the U.S. wealth distribution, I asked People’s Policy Project founder Matt Bruenig to pull data from the Federal Reserve’s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. Assuming, for argument’s sake, that Sanders has exactly $2 million to his name, that would place him in the 93.9 th percentile for net worth among all American households (a family’s net worth equals their assets minus their debts). To even qualify for the top 1 percent, he’d need more than $10 million. Jordan Weissmann/Slate An important thing to remember about wealth, though, is that older people tend to have more of it. Even if they have high incomes, younger workers are often stuck paying down student loans and mortgages, which lowers their net worth. Many older adults, on the other hand, have spent years piling up retirement assets and building home equity. Among Americans 65 and older, having $2 million would place Sanders in the 89.7 th percentile for net worth. He’d need more than $12 million to qualify for the top 1 percent. Jordan Weissmann/Slate And what about college graduates? Among that slice of the country, Sanders’ wealth isn’t that remarkable at all. Among those 65 and older with at least a bachelor’s degree, $2 million is enough to hit the 75 th percentile of net worth, according to the People’s Policy Project analysis. When you’re in your golden years, having a low-seven figure nest egg pretty much makes you part of the upper-middle-class. Of course, the premise of the piece is a ridiculous one. Even if Sanders was suddenly a member of the wealthiest 1 percent, I don’t think it would really make him a hypocrite. The man wants to make America look a bit more like a Scandinavian social democracy, and last I checked, Swedes and Norwegians don’t have any problem with authors earning a payday. They just tax more of it. But the bottom line is that Sanders’ rhetoric about millionaires and billionaires has always been a shorthand for the power of extreme wealth, the kind that can buy you political influence. And he doesn’t have anywhere close to that kind of money. Support our journalism

Thus, the editors who keep it updated take their jobs seriously—and just like everything else surrounding the president, the battle over the information included is chaotic and emotionally charged . Aaron Mak, speaking to editors and moderators, reports on the inner workings of the Donald Trump Wikipedia page. Toe-may-toe, eugenics: Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a scathing 20-page screed comparing women who have abortions to eugenicists. His opinion, part of an judiciary abortion rights trade-off at SCOTUS today , strikes Mark Joseph Stern as going against the hand-wavy grain when it comes to normal anti-abortion rhetoric “about how women are really the victims of abortion. To Thomas, women who undergo abortions are villains who must be stopped by the state.” Intelligence: Last week, President Donald Trump granted his favorite lawyer, Attorney General William Barr, unprecedented power to receive and potentially declassify all information he requests regarding investigations of 2016 election. As Joshua A. Geltzer and Mary B. McCord explain, this action undercuts intelligence officials, provides yet more favors for Trump, and, more drastically, is a direct threat to the country’s national security . Not so smart: Booksmart had a lot going for it: a star directorial billing by Olivia Wilde, a raving debut at SXSW, and favorable comparisons to raunchy high school comedies like Superbad .

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 26, 2019 (The first part of the tweet is about North Korean weapons testing that, according to national security adviser John Bolton and others , has undermined the U.S.-N.K. nuclear disarmament process by violating a United Nations resolution. The second refers to a hyperbolic, insulting statement North Korea released after Biden criticized Kim during a campaign appearance.) Accusations that someone is being unpatriotic or anti-democratic are often made in a glib or bad-faith way. (For instance, a lot of the criticism that Trump has taken for purportedly undermining America’s role in promoting democracy abroad has been hypocritical in that it has glossed over America’s rich history of not promoting democracy abroad .) That said, having a consensus baseline expectation that the president will think of other Americans as being on “his side”—and that he won’t try to boost his reelection campaign by amplifying propaganda comments made about other Americans by foreign heads of state with dubious human rights records—does not seem unreasonable or unrealistic.

Transportation Secretary Chao pledged to divest from company doing business with government. She didn’t.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/transportation-secretary-chao-pledged-divest-vulcan-conflict-of-interest.html,"Why Society Goes Easy on Rapists Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao continues to hold stock in one of the nation’s biggest construction-materials suppliers despite pledging to divest from the company in the 2017 ethics agreement she signed before being confirmed to the Trump cabinet, the Wall Street Journal reports . Chao had served on the board of Vulcan Materials Co. before going to Washington and, in April 2018, received shares in the company as deferred payment for nearly two years on the company board worth nearly $400,000. “Ms. Chao’s 2017 ethics agreement , which she signed before her confirmation, said she would receive a cash payout in April 2018 in exchange for the deferred share units she earned while serving on the board, effectively severing her financial ties to the company,” the Journal notes. Here is the portion of Chao’s ethics agreement that pertains to Vulcan:
Upon confirmation, I will resign from my position with Vulcan Materials. I hold vested deferred stock units with Vulcan Materials. I do not hold any unvested deferred stock units, stock options, restricted stock or common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the company’s Directors’ Deferred Stock Unit Plan, I will receive a cash payout for all of my vested deferred stock units in April of the year following the year of my separation from service. The cash payout will be determined based on the closing price of the company’s common stock at the time payment is made that April. Instead of divesting however, Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, kept the stock, which has since appreciated. This puts the Secretary of Transportation in the ethically dubious position of overseeing a broad portion of America’s infrastructure, including its highway system, while also owning a portion of a company that profits from government contracts to build that very infrastructure. “The federal government pays for about one quarter of annual spending on highways, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with state and local governments picking up the remainder. Most of the DOT’s $86 billion budget is spent on grants to states and municipalities, whose spending on road projects is a major source of business for Vulcan, according to the company,” the Journal reports. “Vulcan sells products including asphalt and crushed stone that are critical to road-building and paving, as well as other heavy construction, and says that 45 percent to 55 percent of its shipments have been used in projects that are funded by the government, including highways and airports.” “Chao’s decision to retain the shares and recuse herself from matters that might affect Vulcan,” the Journal notes, “stands in contrast to the way previous transportation secretaries have handled potential conflicts of interest.” "

McConnell says he’d confirm an election-year Trump Supreme Court nominee because he’s a Republican and Obama wasn’t.,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mcconnell-says-hed-confirm-a-trump-supreme-court-nominee-during-election-because-hes-a-republican-and-obama-wasnt.html,"Trump Betrays America Again Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a Paducah Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Kentucky Tuesday that he would confirm a Trump Supreme Court nominee if a seat on the bench opened up next year during the presidential election. The galling hypocrisy of the very man who once reinvented the Constitution to prevent President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland from ascending to the Supreme Court, would be even more enraging if it weren’t so utterly predictable. It was, of course, just over three years ago, in March 2016 that Obama nominated Garland to replace Antonin Scalia following his death. The Republican-controlled Senate, under McConnell’s leadership, refused to even hold a hearing on the nomination, much less a vote, because McConnell concocted the idea that the next president should get to choose the Supreme Court justice. McConnell’s rationale went that it was an election year and… a Republican might win and that would be better for Republicans if they picked Scalia’s successor? In sum, there wasn’t a good faith rationale for McConnell’s stonewalling. Even still, Garland’s nomination languished for 293 days until the term ended on Jan. 3, 2017. On Tuesday however, when McConnell was asked by an attendee “Should a Supreme Court justice die next year, what will your position be on filling that spot?” the Majority Leader was signing a different tune. From CNN :
The leader took a long sip of what appeared to be iced tea before announcing with a smile, “Oh, we’d fill it,” triggering loud laughter from the audience. So what gives? Anything other than the obvious? “David Popp, a spokesman for McConnell, said the difference between now and three years ago, when McConnell famously blocked Judge Merrick Garland’s ascension to the Supreme Court, is that at that time the White House was controlled by Democrat and the Senate by a Republican,” CNN reports . “This time, both are controlled by the GOP.” Oh right. Just the obvious then."

Charles McQuillan/Getty Images British actor Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow on Game of Thrones for the last eight years, reportedly checked into a rehab facility in Connecticut for treatment of stress and alcohol problems, Page Six reports . One of Harington’s friends told Page Six that the end of the long-running show was a factor:
The end of Game of Thrones really hit Kit hard … He realized, “This is it—this is the end,” it was something they had all worked so hard on for so many years. He had a moment of, what next? Harington’s reps told Page Six in a statement that he was “spend[ing] some time at a wellness retreat to work on some personal issues.” The wellness retreat in question, Privé-Swiss , includes private beachfront villas, Viking appliances, and personal chefs , and according to Page Six, runs more than $120,000 a month. Harington has been seen out and about in Madison, Connecticut, near the facility, and according to local residents seems to be doing fine. The actor has been open in the past about mental health struggles, telling Variety that he sought out therapy because of the public scrutiny he underwent during his meteoric rise to fame, particularly after Game of Thrones fifth season, when his character was ostensibly dead. (Spoiler: he came back.)
It wasn’t a very good time in my life. I felt I had to feel that I was the most fortunate person in the world, when actually, I felt very vulnerable. I had a shaky time in my life around there—like I think a lot of people do in their 20s. That was a time when I started therapy, and started talking to people. I had felt very unsafe, and I wasn’t talking to anyone. I had to feel very grateful for what I have, but I felt incredibly concerned about whether I could even fucking act. Harington reportedly checked in weeks before the Game of Thrones finale aired, and has been “undergoing psychological coaching, practicing mindful meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy to combat stress and deal with negative emotions” ever since.

"Robert Mueller press conference: Not ""no obstruction.""",slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/robert-mueller-press-conference-obstruction-trump-statement.html,"Louisiana’s GOP-Controlled State Legislature Passes Restrictive Abortion Ban. Its Democratic Governor Says He’ll Sign It. In a surprise press conference at the Department of Justice, special counsel Robert Mueller announced that his office’s investigation into 2016 election interference is complete, summarized its findings about Russia’s attacks on the Hillary Clinton campaign, emphasized that he had not cleared Donald Trump of committing obstruction of justice, and said he would prefer not to testify to Congress. On the subject of obstruction, Mueller reiterated the previously issued special counsel report’s text by noting that “if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so” and that the special counsel did not “make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.” He then referred to a preexisting DOJ Office of Legal Counsel document which holds that, under existing law, a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted by the federal government. (The president, of course, can be impeached.) Said Mueller: “The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that too is prohibited. The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.” Mueller’s account adds some clarity, if you will, to earlier comments made by Attorney General William Barr, who said the following at a previous press conference:
When we met with [Mueller] … we specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion. And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position. He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. What appears to be happening here is parsing, or spin, in which Barr is using Mueller’s statement that the OLC opinion prevented him from considering whether to accuse Trump of a crime to imply that Mueller wouldn’t have charged Trump with a crime even if the OLC opinion didn’t exist. But that does not appear to be Mueller’s position. (According to CNN , Barr did not ask Mueller to make the statement but was briefed on its contents.) After discussing the report, Mueller made clear that he would prefer not to testify about its contents before Congress:
I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter. There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress. In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office. So beyond what I have said here today, and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress. Mueller concluded by asserting that his office’s allegation that Russia made “multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election” is one that “deserves the attention of every American.” He then declined to answer a reporter’s shouted question about whether he would appear before Congress if subpoenaed, left the lectern, and walked out of the room. And that’s that. Support our journalism

The Department of Energy is calling fossil fuels “molecules of freedom” and “freedom gas”,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/freedom-gas-molecules-of-freedom-department-of-energy.html,"Like Climate Change and College Debt, the California Housing Crisis Is Generational Warfare The Trump administration loves fossil fuels, but apparently has decided that they need some rebranding.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Freedom gas . It appears that turn of phrase originated earlier this month, when Secretary of Energy Rick Perry signed an order aimed at doubling U.S. liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe. At a press briefing in Brussels, he explained that the move would help European nations diversify their energy supply away from Russia, the region’s major supplier of gas. “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent,” he said. “And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.” Afterward, a cheeky reporter from EURACTIV asked whether “freedom gas” would be a correct way to describe the new fuel shipments. “I think you may be correct in your observation,” an apparently inspired Perry responded. And now it’s the Trump administration’s official line. As one of my colleagues put it, spreading freedom gas sounds like what happens when you’re newly single and suddenly have the apartment to yourself. Which raises the question: Did the Department of Energy mean to make a fart joke in an official statement? Or are we just lucky? The world may never know.
This post has been updated with additional context about Perry’s remarks."

Robert Mueller was telling Nancy Pelosi to begin impeachment proceedings.,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/robert-mueller-to-nancy-pelosi-begin-impeachment-proceedings.html,"Trump Betrays America Again Special counsel Robert Mueller issued a final statement on Wednesday before resigning from the Department of Justice, which clearly appeared aimed at one person: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Mueller’s simple message to Pelosi is that it is the constitutional duty of Congress—and her sworn duty as speaker of the House—to begin an investigation of the president and seriously consider impeaching him. Unlike Attorney General William Barr’s early characterization of the Mueller report’s decision not to find criminal behavior on the part of the president as having nothing to do with the Department of Justice policy against indicting a sitting president, Mueller’s statement made clear the special counsel’s office believes “it was bound” by department policy not to indict the president—or even accuse him. “It would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge accuse him of committing a crime,” Mueller said, reemphasizing something he had already directly stated in his report. But coupled with this statement from Mueller were three points aimed at Pelosi: First, given DOJ policy, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.” That process is impeachment, though Mueller was again oblique about this. Second, “as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” Third, “when a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.” Put it all together and Mueller was saying: Russia interfered in our election. Trump obstructed that investigation. Mueller’s office could have said Trump didn’t commit a crime, but did not reach that conclusion. The ball is in Congress’ court. This is as close to a call for Pelosi to begin impeachment proceedings as we are likely to hear from someone as circumspect as Mueller, and it makes Pelosi’s foot-dragging not just untenable but a dereliction of her constitutional duty. Initially, I could see reason to go along with Pelosi’s implicit argument that an impeachment inquiry against the president would be pointless if the Senate would not consider impeaching, and if public opinion was strongly against it. But the Mueller report offers substantial evidence Trump obstructed justice, and this is an impeachable offense. Members of Congress take an oath to uphold the Constitution and it is their constitutional duty to determine if Trump’s conduct merits impeachment, regardless of the political consequences. Mueller’s emphasis that this is the only way our system currently has for holding an allegedly criminal president accountable while in office points to why fulfilling that duty is more than just empty idealism. Without consequences and a full accounting of potentially criminal actions, what is to stop a criminal president from more and greater abuses of power and ultimately a breakdown of our entire legal regime? Of course, the president should not be impeached if members of Congress conclude Trump did not do the things listed in the report, or if members conclude that the obstruction was not serious enough to merit impeachment given both the legal and political considerations. Perhaps censure is in order. But with the department and Mueller taking the position that indicting the president for crimes is off the table, an impeachment inquiry is the only way the American people will know that Trump’s potential crimes have been fully investigated and appropriate punishment considered. No one knows if a fairly done impeachment inquiry will hurt Democrats politically. No one knows if failing to seriously pursue an impeachment inquiry will hurt Democrats more. So it makes sense to do what is constitutionally required. After all, it is not as though Pelosi is saying she doesn’t believe Trump obstructed justice or that these are not serious enough charges to merit impeachment. It seems a pure political calculation, which is arguably a dereliction of Congress’ responsibility to investigate. If the House impeaches Trump though a fair process based on strong evidence of obstruction of justice, let the American people watch Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell run a sham Senate trial—with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding—and let Republican senators vote against conviction in the face of that evidence. Even if McConnell runs no trial, every senator will be asked her position on whether or not the evidence adduced by the House merits removing the president from office. Sure that’s a political risk for Democrats, but so is doing nothing. More importantly, it’s the right thing to do as a matter of constitutional responsibility. Mueller was saying no less.

"Jimmy Kimmel Live's ""Can Young People Read a Clock"" is just more millennial-bashing.",slate.com,Marissa Martinelli,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/jimmy-kimmel-millennials-kids-analog-clock.html,"The Best Movies and TV Shows Coming to Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime, and Hulu in June Someone over at Jimmy Kimmel Live must have finally looked up the word millennial and realized it has a definition beyond “young person I want to laugh at and feel superior to,” but the spirit of segments such as “ Can Millennials Open a Can of Paint ?” and “ Can Millennials Open a Can of Tuna ?” is alive and well. The latest instance of on-the-street ineptitude in this genre is “Can Young People Read a Clock?,” which features selectively edited footage of pedestrians struggling to use slightly outdated technology on the spot for the audience’s entertainment purposes. Again. “Now we all have phones and we just look at it and we know [the time],” said Jimmy Kimmel in his introduction to the segment. “And it made me wonder if young people even know how to read an old-time clock anymore.” Does Kimmel have amnesia? His show already did the whole “young people can’t read an analog clock” schtick just a year ago with an extremely similar on-the-street segment called “ Kids Can’t Tell Time .” Why is he still wondering this? More importantly, why are we still watching as though these segments don’t smugly show us a handful of the worst-performing participants and then pretend that the sample is representative of “young people” in general? At least the segment gets one thing right: Analog clocks are definitely on their way out . Technology moves on, and I for one can’t wait for the inevitable segment hosted by Kimmel’s great-grandson: “Can Generation Glorp Figure Out How to Use a Cellphone?” "
"Mueller spoke, and two Americas heard two very different things.",slate.com,Dahlia Lithwick,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/robert-mueller-spoke-and-we-heard-what-we-wanted-to-hear.html,"Why Society Goes Easy on Rapists Robert Mueller gave a surprise press conference at the Justice Department on Wednesday morning, in which he essentially offered up the CliffNotes of his 448-page findings. There was nothing particularly new or surprising revealed, so instead, we watched this become yet another example of the Yanny versus Laurel –ification of everything in America. By that, I mean we all listened to the same brief prepared statement, and the left heard that the president would have been cleared had the special counsel been able to determine that he had not committed a crime, and he was not cleared, which implies that perhaps the president in fact committed a crime, even though Mueller was constitutionally barred from saying so. The right heard what it has heard since the day Attorney General William Barr first “summarized” the findings in the initial report: “No collusion, no obstruction.” In under an hour, the president tweeted, again, that he had been cleared: “Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.” Robert Mueller is a man who wants nothing to do with the incipient decline of norms, civility, and the rule of law. That’s why we never should have been surprised when he originally tried to put out his meticulous report and then, essentially, ghost us . That is also why we shouldn’t be surprised that he spent this morning essentially repeating exactly what he put in his report two months ago, a report he would really like us to read. Mueller wrote his special counsel report for a world in which it is assumed that facts and truth will inform actions . As his speech this morning made clear, he still believes that we live in this world. We do not. We live in the world where, for the next few hours, Fox News will continue its witch-hunt narrative while offering up the view that there should be show trials for former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. And MSNBC will insist that Robert Mueller all but said that the president obstructed justice and could not constitutionally be charged. For anyone who’s been hoping that Mueller is going to lead us out of this morass, well, no, he’s not. Perhaps the only thing that will break through the Yanny-v.-Laurel divide is the sound of Congress stiffening its collective spine after weeks of incoherent claims that the nation is in the grip of a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions about which it does not intend to act. With Republican Rep. Justin Amash already there, the question is whether this moves congressional Democrats, who hold the majority, or if they will instead settle for strong feelings about infrastructure. For anyone who’s been hoping that Mueller is going to lead us out of this morass, well, no, he’s not. What he seems to have reinforced is that he doesn’t want to testify and that he didn’t want to talk publicly and that if Congress cannot show leadership on this question, that’s on Congress, not him. So, congressional Democrats waiting for a clear sign on what to do from their constituents will probably be waiting for a while—Mueller hardly delivered the resounding closing argument the voting public might have required. In his view, that argument rests in the penumbras and emanations of Volume 2 of his original report. As an institutionalist, Mueller ends his tenure as he began it—defending the institution, up to and including Attorney General William Barr. His short remarks were centered around his explicit claim that “the work speaks for itself.” This implies that people have read the work, or will read it, or at the very least are getting their information from people who actually read it. That too is an aspirational claim in this current age. But mostly, what Mueller proved definitively with his summary of the summary of the report is this: that if Congress opts to do nothing about foreign interference, it is Congress’ failure, not his. One clear message of Mueller’s brief statement, and indeed, the message of the entire first volume of his report, is that “Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system” and that this attack occurred to the detriment of Hillary Clinton. This used to be a fact that would have united the American government behind some course of action. This no longer seems to be the case, and that is to our detriment. Again, Mueller told us all this two months ago. Mueller also made clear that he was tasked with nothing more or less than doing a sweeping investigation. He said, in so many words, that obstruction of that investigation impaired the knowing of truth and that the president could not be cleared of such obstruction. If Congress opts to do nothing about those who obstructed or lied, they aid and abet that which “strikes at the core of the government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable,” the special counsel said today. He is, in a way, linking his own ability to finish the job to Congress’ unwillingness to do its own. Regardless, Mueller’s tenure as America’s Facts Adult is thus over. The role of America’s Facts Adult will now be played by the House of Representatives. Whether anyone heard and understood that the handing over of the baton just happened, it happened. What happens next is solely within the control of Congress, which means we should all buckle in for a continuation of the Yanny-or-Laurel debate, with no particular end in sight.

5G technologies will require spectrum bands—but we’re running low on them.,slate.com,Jane C. Hu,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/spectrum-auction-bandwidth-weather-forecasting-fcc-noaa.html,"Why Are Right-Wingers So Obsessed With Electromagnetic Pulses? 5G is coming, and with it, the promise of faster internet that will support innovations like streaming virtual reality, self-driving cars, and smart home and city infrastructure. But before it rolls out to the masses, critical infrastructure details will need to be ironed out—for instance, what radio frequency bands telecommunication companies can use for this new technology. That’s a decidedly unsexy detail, and one most people don’t think about much. We want our radio and TV broadcasts and cellphone reception to just work . Who cares how? But now might be a good time to start caring. New technologies will require frequency bandwidth, leading to clashes between new, shiny innovations and older technologies we still need but take for granted. Right now, there’s a conflict brewing over a specific spectrum band. Radio, TV, cellphones, satellites, submarines, Wi-Fi, and any other device that can send or receive messages do so using a designated portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to prevent interference between different types of devices. Currently, weather forecasting uses the band between 23.6 and 24 GHz, but in recent years, telecommunications companies have been eyeing the band around 24 GHz for 5G use. NOAA and NASA have raised concerns to the Federal Communications Commission that 5G’s use of nearby bands could affect their ability to keep tabs on hurricanes. Neil Jacobs , the administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told the House Science Committee earlier this month that interference from neighboring bands could result in a 77 percent data loss. Jacobs says that would have both immediate effects, like limiting our ability to predict and track developing storms, and cascading ones, like the potential for government agencies like NOAA to halt the launch of new satellites, since many of them would no longer be effective. But the FCC appears to be pushing on. In April, it auctioned off about 2,900 licenses to use the band between 24.25 and 25.25 GHz, and bidding officially ended Tuesday . In a recent public statement, the Aerospace Industries Association wrote that its members “are excited about the promise of new technologies like 5G, but believe it is critical that the proper testing takes place prior to any FCC auction, to protect existing users of both the specific and adjacent spectrum bands.” Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Maria Cantwell of Washington also wrote a joint letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, urging the FCC to listen to NASA, NOAA, and the American Meteorological Society and halt commercial 24 GHz operations until potential interference effects are better understood and ameliorated. Like land, frequency bands are finite spaces. These conflicts will only happen more often in the future. Bandwidth is a finite resource, our demand for its use is only increasing, and much of the spectrum has already been apportioned . Spectrums currently in use for broadcasting or telecommunications were selected because they’re optimal for their intended purposes, and though some new tech may try to make use of less popular bands, inevitably, there will be competition. Basically, most of the good spectrum bands are taken, yet demand for them will continue to grow. “The iron laws of physics being what they are, we are simply not making more,” says FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel. “So the challenge is to use spectrum we have more efficiently. That also means we have to rethink how we allocate our airwaves.” That allocation is currently up to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , which manages government frequency use, and the FCC, which has granted licenses for commercial frequency use since 1994 . Before that, the government issued licenses via applications (too cumbersome) and experimented with a lottery system (could allow winners to “flip” their licenses). Eventually, it settled on an auction system, which is “intended to award the licenses to those who will use them most effectively.” The idea is that companies’ auction bids reflect their real interest in actually using the license, rather than sitting on it as an investment to sell elsewhere later on. Rosenworcel says the FCC has issued more than 44,000 licenses and raised “billions and billions of dollars” for the U.S. Treasury. Between 1994 and 2000, the FCC’s 24 spectrum auctions raised $20 billion , according to testimony from an adviser to the FCC. Auction 73, a contentious auction in 2008 for use of the 700 MHz radio frequency band, raised another $20 billion on its own. And there are plans to auction off licenses for three more midrange bandwidths (37, 39, and 47 GHz) by the end of the year. But those billions mean it can get pretty expensive to play the auction game at all. The 24 GHz band auction raised nearly $2 billion with just 2,904 licenses ; that averages out to $684,573 per license. The bidding system is anonymous, a feature “designed to give rural service providers and small businesses the opportunity to bid aggressively against larger carriers and included 15-25% discounts for qualified small bidders,” according to the FCC’s website, but even with help, a startup is going to have a hard time competing with AT&T and Verizon. And though the FCC hopes auctions dissuade “flipping” licenses, the system does still allow telecom giants with deep pockets to apply for licenses in certain bands and sit on them as an investment. Like land, frequency bands are finite spaces, and unforeseen future circumstances could drive up demand for that space, netting huge profits. (Indeed, some companies are counting on this .) While issues like net neutrality and digital security have received a lot of public attention (and rightfully so!), bandwidth allocation hasn’t yet broken into the mainstream. But the current concerns around the 24 GHz band show what can happen if it’s up to the government to allocate access: It’s possible that commercial interests (i.e., an avenue for the government to bring in billions) can interfere with technology for the public good, like weather forecasting. Some legal scholars have argued that the radiofrequency spectrum should perhaps be a commons instead, where the government’s role is not to allocate rights but to ensure that users follow the rules. Whether that’s actually a tenable system, let alone better than the current one, is still up for debate. But one recent FCC bandwidth reallocation could be a glimpse into a more “commons”-based use of the spectrum. In 2016, the FCC voted to reallocate a spectrum band around 3.5 GHz that was previously reserved for the U.S. Navy’s radar systems and reclassified its channels for use not only by the Navy but also commercial bidders and unlicensed users, along with a system to manage these different sources of traffic. “The result is on-demand sharing in the 3.5 GHz band—a major milestone in spectrum sharing and management,” says Rosenworcel. This creates the potential for unlicensed users to take advantage of this resource. They could, in theory, develop new technologies using this band without having to pony up the fees to bid in auction. It’s a new way smaller companies could get in at the ground level. It’s also a way for the FCC to figure out how best to handle multiple sources of traffic. But first, they’ll need to address this conflict between 5G developers and weather forecasting at 24 GHz. The example the U.S. sets could have far-reaching consequences. In an internal memo , the Navy worries that other countries will follow suit in developing the 24 GHz band for 5G, and that interference to weather technology will “eventually be worldwide.” As the U.S. sprints toward “ winning the 5G race ,” perhaps we should ask ourselves: At what cost?"
Mueller press conference: Democrats' impeachment reactions tepid.,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-press-conference-democrats-impeachment.html,"Trump Says Russia Helped Him Get Elected … and Then Immediately Says the Opposite At a Wednesday morning press conference, Robert Mueller all but said outright that it is up to Congress to act on the substantial evidence that Donald Trump obstructed justice by formally accusing him of a crime. Like, as Rick Hasen noted in Slate , Mueller literally said the following three things: • “The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.” • “As set forth in the report, after that investigation [into potential obstruction], if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” • “When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.” The constitutional process for determining whether the president should be formally accused of a crime is impeachment. The House of Representatives’ Judiciary Committee is responsible for initiating impeachment proceedings. Democrats control the House of Representatives. So let’s check in on how the relevant Democrats responded to Mueller’s remarks. • “Congress will continue to investigate and legislate to protect our elections and secure our democracy,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement . She did not mention impeachment. • “House Democrats will continue to fulfill our constitutional obligation to hold the Administration accountable,” Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said in a statement. He did not mention impeachment. • “We are following through in our investigation,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said at a press conference. In response to a question about impeachment, he said only that the Judiciary Committee will “make decisions as they seem indicated.” Got that? They’ll make decisions, as indicated, in order to fulfill and secure the —oh, sorry, I just died of banality poisoning for a second there. Now, you may note that the subject which the Democrats are claiming they need to investigate further before initiating impeachment—whether Trump committed obstruction of justice—is something that Mueller addressed via a two-year inquiry that culminated in a 448-page report. (The report’s volume on obstruction was largely unredacted .) One suspects, then, that the issue the party is really interested in is whether public hearings involving Mueller and various obstruction-adjacent ex-administration officials would affect the polls which say that most voters don’t support impeachment. Mueller said Wednesday that he does not want to testify, though, and one key witness—former White House counsel Don McGahn—has already defied a Judiciary subpoena ordering him to appear, a provocation to which Nadler has not yet formally responded. In other words, talking about accountability may be the order of the day, but actual accountability is not yet on the table. Support our journalism

"Robert Mueller, freedom gas, 5G, GIFs on TV.",slate.com,Slate Copy Desk,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/robert-mueller-freedom-gas-5g-gifs-on-tv.html,"Trump Betrays America Again Mueller, surprise?: There was a surprise Robert Mueller press conference today! And in that surprise press conference, the special counsel … reiterated a bunch of things we already know , according to Ben Mathis-Lilley, then followed that up with a statement that he would prefer not to be subpoenaed by Congress! Richard Hasen thinks the statement was a direct message to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (to start impeachment proceedings). Dahlia Lithwick reiterates that Mueller wrote his report for a world that doesn’t exist—a world devoted to the pursuit of truth—and that it was never up to the special counsel to save us from Trump .

Robert Mueller should still testify to Congress.,slate.com,Fred Kaplan,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/mueller-congress-testimony-report.html,"Trump Betrays America Again He was subtle about it, but, in his terse but straightforward statement to the press on Wednesday morning, special counsel Robert Mueller clearly signaled that he was willing to testify before Congress. Not that he wants to make any more public appearances. “I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner,” he said. However, a few seconds later, he added the following:
There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. … I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress. Notice: He did not say he wouldn’t testify. To the contrary, the sentence above—in which he says what he would or would not say “in any appearance before Congress”—assumes that he would appear before Congress, if asked or ordered to do so. In other ways, which many have already noted, Mueller tossed the ball to Congress. For instance, he said that he was barred from indicting President Donald Trump because the Justice Department’s administrative rules—which Mueller is a stickler at following—prohibit indicting a sitting president. But Mueller wrote several times in his report —even if he didn’t say so explicitly on Wednesday—that Congress has many ways of going after a corrupt or obstructive president. For instance: “The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President’s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.” And: “Congress can permissibly criminalize certain obstructive conduct by the President, such as suborning perjury, intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence.” And: “We concluded that Congress can validly make obstruction-of-justice statutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the President without impermissibly undermining his Article II functions.” And though he notes that impeachment is a “drastic” measure to take against such a president, “Congress is not restricted to relying only on impeachment” Despite its bestseller status, few people managed to read the Mueller report—much less make it through to the end. So few people read it, in fact, that Mueller’s words on Wednesday—which came straight out of the report—struck many people as news. It helps to have the author read crucial portions of his report out loud. It would also help to have a panel of well-briefed senators asking the author to clarify certain passages that were written in legalistic prose. And it would be especially useful if these questions and answers were broadcast to an audience of millions of Americans, who might regard the clarifications as not just enlightening but shocking and enabling. Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Jerry Nadler: Take Mueller up on his offer—call him to testify now."
"James Holzhauer is my one true TV love, the Roger Federer of Jeopardy!",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/jeopardy-james-holzhauer-love-letter.html,"Meet the Sandwich the Internet Can’t Stop Talking About It’s 7:30 p.m., and Johnny Gilbert is announcing tonight’s Jeopardy! contestants. The first two don’t really matter, and I will forget about them the moment the episode ends. Then the camera moves on to the reigning champion, James Holzhauer. James flashes a toothy grin, then feigns surprise, almost embarrassment, as Johnny describes his record-smashing totals—currently $2,254,938 over 29 games. The audience applauds. I swoon. Alex Trebek takes the stage, and the game begins. It is another beautiful night of Jeopardy! with my crush, James Holzhauer. Many commentators have described the particular joys of watching James play: his bottomless font of knowledge; his precise hunt for the Daily Doubles; his quirky, canny wagers. But it is James’ demeanor that entrances me. Self-possessed and unflappable, he radiates serenity even as he brutally trounces his competition, a kind of soothing confidence that seems to bewitch even Trebek. The other contestants fidget and fret; they mash their buzzers and bite their lips and bobble their heads in frustration. Not James. He is still and assured. He is poised but relaxed. We never see him press the buzzer because he is one with the buzzer. He is in the zone, and it is beautiful to watch, because he is beautiful. Have you seen the picture of James that the New York Times dug up ? The one at his college graduation, where he’s wearing sandals and shorts under his robe? I think about that photo at least twice a day. That is the James Holzhauer I adore. He is goofy underneath the imperturbable demeanor, sweet and silly and delightful. You can tell because he writes his name differently every time. One night the J was a hockey stick hovering over a wee cartoon puck; another night he added inverted exclamation points. ¡James! used to go by Jamie, the Times revealed, which is as adorable as the monochrome sweaters and button-downs he wears almost every episode. We are back from the commercial break, and Trebek is doing his forced banter thing with the disposable contestants, who have nothing interesting to say. Then he gets to James and starts by lavishing him with praise—say what you will about Trebek, but he enjoys this spree as much as we do. He tosses out a softball, and James reels off a prepared answer without pausing for breath, always the same stilted yet lilting cadences, often ending on a self-deprecating half-joke. The audience loves it. Trebek loves it. I assume that Gilbert, who is 94 years old and clearly in the prime of his life, loves it too. Then it’s back to the game.

As everyone now knows, James starts with the most valuable clues to rack up the cash, a tactic his competitors sometimes ape, but rarely with any success. It only works for James because James knows everything, for reasons that remain cryptic. He has said that he read lots of children’s books to prepare, which seemed somewhat plausible but, upon further scrutiny, a little ridiculous, especially when he reveals he can identify and spell the names of arcane English prime ministers. He’s a professional sports gambler, so he knows a lot about sports, which is somehow not at all irritating. But what about his vast knowledge of trees, flowers, birds, food, geography, physics, chemistry, history, politics, cinema, and (we learned recently) bees? Where did that come from? He has probably mastered the ability to regulate his own body temperature. Best not to ponder it for too long. James is the Roger Federer of Jeopardy , both flesh and not , an otherworldly creature who possesses talents heretofore unknown to humankind (at least on one game show). He is ethereal, floating through the game with peerless grace. Unlike Federer, he does not remind me of my own clumsy body’s all-too-human limitations, because his mastery of the game manifests as pure intellect—the platonic ideal of a trivia brain at work. That is not to say that James has no physical elegance. Quite the contrary. It is cliché to say a player doesn’t break a sweat, but James literally never sweats, and I am, in fact, not convinced he is capable of sweating. He has probably mastered the ability to regulate his own body temperature. James is apparently straight, but he’s the kind of straight guy who would appreciate his adoring gay fans, of which he deserves many. He has a wife and a child whom he seems to cherish. He frequently travels with his family because, as he explained in one of those breathless monologues, he wants his daughter to appreciate other cultures. (That was the moment I fell in love with him.) He smiles equably, never smugly, and evinces nothing but warmth toward the other doomed contestants. I am certain that if I met him and babbled something embarrassing, he would make me feel smart and special. He is my TV husband. There isn’t much tension when James plays Jeopardy . The biggest question each night is whether some evil contestant will steal a Daily Double from James, cruelly and pointlessly lowering his daily winnings. He will nail Final Jeopardy and, when the show is complete, turn to chat politely with his vanquished foes. For half an hour each night, he has calmed my nerves and restored my belief that kindness and intelligence matter in this world. One day, hopefully no time soon, James may finally lose a game. But I will never lose my faith in him."
Ma review: Octavia Spencer movie is the best kind of trash.,slate.com,Sam Adams,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/ma-movie-review-octavia-spencer-horror-blumhouse.html,"The Live-Action Aladdin Improves in Many Ways on the Original Between the exhilaration of great movies and the disappointment of bad ones lie the particular pleasures of trash. Ma isn’t a bad movie, and it’s sure as hell not trying to be a good one, but it scratches a particular itch that neither noble failures nor cranked-out hackwork can touch. Diana Silvers, last seen (or not seen ) in Booksmart , plays Maggie, a lanky 16-year-old whose mother, Erica (Juliette Lewis), has just dragged them both back to the run-down town where she grew up. Maggie arrives awkwardly on her first day, and some of her classmates catch her unwrapping a sandwich with a handwritten note from her mom, but they’re so desperate for any variation in their monotonous routine that they invite the new girl to party with them rather than making fun of her. “Party” here means lingering outside liquor stores begging adults to buy them booze, then schlepping their cinnamon whiskey to a pile of rocks outside of town, but that’s where Sue Ann (Octavia Spencer) intervenes. First she just takes their money and returns with a box full of bottles, but before long she’s offering the basement of her house as a safe place to get wasted. One boy, his jock’s confidence sharpened by tipsiness, baldly suggests that her basement could be a real party spot if she’d just make some adjustments: shove the couch over there, string some lights from the ceiling, maybe a table for beer pong. The next time they arrive, the modifications have been made. That there’s more room for Spencer to create a complex character in Ma than in the movies in which she’s been nominated for Academy Awards, winning one, is a self-contained commentary on the state of the art. The kids quickly take to calling Sue Ann “Ma,” a nickname suggested by Darrell (Dante Brown), who tries to play on their being two of the few black people in a largely white town to build familiarity between them. But Sue Ann seems especially drawn to Maggie and her eventual boyfriend Andy (Corey Fogelmanis), and she isn’t interested in merely fetching a tray of pizza rolls and letting the kids have their fun. Tate Taylor’s movie, which was written by Scotty Landes, doesn’t sound the klaxons as quickly as the movie’s trailers, but it’s clear from the moment Sue Ann data-mines the kids, joining Andy’s overheard first name with the surname written on the van from his father’s security company to stalk him on Facebook, that she’s got an agenda beyond making sure the town’s high school students don’t drink and drive. At first, she just seems to want to be one of them. As the group in her basement grows, Ma wades in and gets down, and if the teenagers have any compunctions about her blasting ’70s funk instead of current pop, they don’t show it. It would be easy to make a woman in her late 40s doing the robot with a group of Gen Z kids a figure of fun, but Spencer doesn’t condescend to her, and she doesn’t take the turn into camp, either. Seeing Spencer in nurse’s scrubs triggers a sense memory of all the no-nonsense institutional figures she’s played, always with grace and often a knowing humor, but without the emotional bandwidth she takes up here. (That there’s more room for Spencer to create a complex character in Ma than in the movies in which she’s been nominated for Academy Awards, winning one, is a self-contained commentary on the state of the art.) Even when Spencer’s sole purpose in a scene is to lurk around a corner and spook an unsuspecting teenager, she brings a sense of intention to the role.

Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. As Sue Ann’s plan comes into focus—I won’t spoil it except to say there are purposeful flashbacks to her own high school experience, and the character doesn’t work at a veterinary clinic by accident— Ma tilts further toward the absurd, eventually verging on Grand Guignol. (In auteur heaven, What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ’s Robert Aldrich is looking down and wishing he’d gotten his hands on the script.) Taylor, whose past credits include Get On Up and The Help , doesn’t have an especially firm grasp on the extremities of tone, and the movie is full of gaps and loose ends, but it hits home in a way a more dare-we-say-“elevated” treatment of the same material might not. A more high-toned version of this story would be more at pains to settle our feelings about its characters, to make sure we knew that when Maggie speaks cruelly to Sue Ann, she regrets it—or that if she didn’t, that she learned the lesson of her unkindness. Instead the movie takes place in a world where even the good people aren’t especially nice, where everything is gray and worn-down and even the nice part of town doesn’t look that nice. Everyone’s a bit of a jerk, which means no one walks away feeling clean. But it also means that the movie doesn’t force us to pretend that we’re better than we are. Its characters enjoy being cruel, and at least sometimes, we enjoy watching them. There’s truth in trash. "
An insurer just squashed the effort to create a public option in Connecticut,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/an-insurer-just-squashed-the-effort-to-create-a-public-option-in-connecticut.html,"New Memo Reveals the Census Question Was Added to Boost White Voting Power Just last week, it seemed as if Connecticut might follow Washington’s footsteps and become the next state to pass some version of a public health insurance option. Gov. Ned Lamont and a group of Democrats lined up behind a bill that would create a new, government-backed insurance plan and offer subsidies to some families that don’t currently qualify for help under Obamacare. “This is a bill that gives us the best opportunity in a long time to expand access to people who don’t have access to affordable health care and to bring down the cost of health care,” Lamont said. Now, following a swift and fierce pushback from the state’s powerful insurance industry, the effort appears to have collapsed. Connecticut Comptroller Kevin Lembo, whose office would have played a key roll in implementing the legislation, told the Hartford Courant Tuesday that the legislation was effectively dead after the CEO of Cigna, which is based in the state, suggested he would move the company elsewhere if the bill passed. According to Lembo, the insurance giant’s chief “threatened to send a public letter to Lamont that if the public option bill moves forward, ‘they would reconsider where they’re domiciled.’” Cigna’s spokesman “said the insurer lobbied hard against the bill, but denied that any threat was made.” The insurance industry is a major employer in Connecticut and holds an enormous amount of political sway. But if Lembo’s description of what happened is true, it may be a preview of just how vicious any battle over federal health reform would be. I happened to be on the phone with a Connecticut state Sen. Matt Lesser to discuss the proposal when the news of its demise broke. As he explained it to me, the most recent version of the bill would have required insurers that sold any coverage on the state’s Obamacare exchanges to also offer a standard, state-designed health plan, called the Connecticut Option, structured to be 20 percent less expensive than other options on the market. The government would have assembled a network of providers willing to accept the new coverage, and provided some additional subsidies to households above and beyond what Obamacare offers. It was not a plan to push private carriers out of Connecticut’s individual insurance market, which is fairly small to begin with. We’re talking about very incremental change. Nonetheless, a group of carriers wrote to Lamont last week urging him to kill the bill. It might not have posed any kind of serious danger to their bottom lines, but judging by the comptroller’s comments to the Courant, Cigna’s CEO at least seems to have viewed the fight as an early skirmish in a bigger national battle over health reform:
Lembo accused Cordani of acting more from political impulse than to protect his business.
“This is not an existential threat to them,” he said. “It’s an ideological threat to the CEO of Cigna.” That tracked with what Lesser told me earlier in the day when I asked him what he thought the bill’s chances of passing might be. At the time, he said it was 50-50. “We have an incredible amount of political support,” he told me. “But I don’t want to kid myself. We are a state that’s synonymous with the insurance industry. And there are some in the industry who are afraid that any health reform effort is a step down the path to their biggest fear, which is Medicare for all.” Support our journalism

Trump betrays America again.,slate.com,William Saletan,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-betrays-america-again.html,"You Thought Kris Kobach’s Immigration Czar Demands Were Ridiculous? Check Out the Job Application. President Donald Trump swears he’s a patriot. He hugs the flag , preaches “America First,” wages trade wars, and builds up the military. He points out, correctly, that the Mueller investigation failed to prove that he criminally conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election. But a president can betray his country without engaging in a secret conspiracy. He can do it out in the open, just by being pathologically disloyal. That’s how Trump has sold out America to a series of dictators , starting with Russian President Vladimir Putin . This week, while visiting Japan, Trump again made himself a tool of foreign influence, by joining North Korea in a verbal assault on former Vice President Joe Biden. The Japan trip showcased three elements of Trump’s personality that make him an easy mark for foreign exploitation. The first is narcissism. Trump routinely abandons the people around him: wives, employees, officials, and aides. He applies the word treason not to betrayals of the Constitution, but to any threat to himself , including the FBI’s decision to open an investigation into his campaign in 2016, when Trump was just a candidate. He spurns NATO, scorns American war heroes, and ridicules U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump believes he is the state. Therefore, he feels nothing for any part of the state beyond himself. This makes it easy to turn Trump against the U.S. government. Over the weekend, he flew to Japan, along with national security adviser John Bolton and other aides, to discuss regional concerns. When reporters asked about North Korea’s recent launches of short-range ballistic missiles, Bolton confirmed that the launches violated U.S.-backed United Nations Security Council resolutions . Bolton assured the press that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would step in to protect “ the integrity of the Security Council resolutions .” At a joint press conference with Trump, Abe affirmed that the launches were violations . Trump cares more about beating his domestic rivals than standing up to foreign enemies. But Trump didn’t. Before the press conference with Abe, the president disowned Bolton’s statement. “ North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me ,” Trump tweeted. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me.” Then, during the press conference, when Trump was asked whether North Korea had “violated U.N. resolutions with the short-range missile launch,” he said no. “ My people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently ,” the president declared. Reporters pressed him: “You’re not bothered at all by the small missiles?” Trump replied, “No, I’m not.” In Trump’s self-absorbed mind, U.S.-backed international resolutions don’t matter. Nor does the opinion of Trump’s host, Japan, which faces a direct threat from Kim’s arsenal. Nor do the assessments of “my people,” including Bolton. All that matters is what Kim pledged “to me.” And Trump is willing to act on his impulses. In March, he overruled North Korea sanctions that had been announced by his administration . To reverse U.S. policy, all a dictator has to do is suck up to Trump. Second, Trump cares more about beating his domestic rivals than standing up to foreign enemies. And to win these domestic fights, the president is happy to claim America’s enemies as his allies. He consistently sided with Putin against President Barack Obama . In 2016, Trump openly urged Russia to help him defeat Hillary Clinton . This year, Trump declared that the Chinese government was “ far more honorable ” than U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the rest of what Trump called “the opposition party.” In Japan, Trump took Kim’s side against Biden. On May 22, a commentary in North Korea’s state-run news service called Biden a “ fool of low IQ .” Days later, while Trump was in Japan, he tweeted that he had “smiled when [Kim] called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?” (Trump was incorrect: The North Korean statement wasn’t attributed to Kim.) Later, at the press conference with Abe, Trump was asked, “Does it give you pause at all to be appearing to side with a brutal dictator instead of with a fellow American, the former vice president, Joe Biden?” Again, Trump endorsed the insult. “ Kim Jong-un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record ,” said Trump. “His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster.” That’s how Trump thinks: The real enemy is Biden. By insulting Biden, Kim is, in Trump’s words, “sending me a signal” of support. So the best route to getting on Trump’s good side, if you’re a foreign government, is to help the president in his domestic wars. And if you don’t, Trump will say you did anyway. Returning from Japan, he tweeted , “Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed.” (There’s no evidence that Japanese officials said any such thing.) Third, Trump is a reflexive liar. He’s happy to contradict U.S. intelligence when it gets in the way of his interests. He has denied intelligence on Russia’s election interference , intelligence about the persistence of ISIS , and intelligence implicating Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi . Trump has been lying about North Korea for a year. He consistently contradicts intelligence that shows Kim is pushing forward with nuclear and missile development. In Japan, the president compounded his lies. The Department of Defense says that on May 9, North Korea “ flight-tested multiple ballistic missiles .” But when reporters in Japan asked Trump about the launches, he insisted, “ There have been no ballistic missiles going out .” Trump also claimed, contrary to a Pentagon statement , that the United States was “ continuing to get the remains ” of U.S. military personnel from North Korea. Trump’s corrupt habits—narcissism, deceit, obsession with domestic rivalry—have taught foreign malefactors how to manipulate him. Look at the North Korean commentary that attracted his interest during the trip to Japan. It parroted Trump’s mockery of Biden, calling the former vice president sleepy, gaffe-prone, and low-IQ. It appealed to Trump’s sense of rivalry, claiming that Biden’s criticisms of Kim were “politically motivated” and driven “by ambition for power.” It painted Bolton as a menace to Trump, calling the aide a “security-destroying adviser” who conspires with the United Nations to drag the United States into war. Bolton foolishly imagines that he speaks for Trump. “The president’s view,” Bolton declared in Japan, was for “keeping sanctions in place and in force until North Korea shows it has made a strategic decision to give up its nuclear weapons.” At the press conference with Abe, Bolton chuckled when Trump endorsed North Korea’s insults of Biden. But Bolton has no idea what Trump’s position will be a month from now, because Trump has no true commitments. And like every aide before him, Bolton will soon be out in the street. He’s just another American in Trump’s way. Support our journalism

Louisiana’s GOP-Controlled State Legislature Passes Restrictive Abortion Ban. Its Democratic Governor Says He’ll Sign It.,slate.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/louisianas-republicans-passes-heartbeat-abortion-ban-democrat-governor-bel-edwards.html,"Trump Betrays America Again The Louisiana state legislature, on Wednesday, joined the procession of conservative state legislatures challenging abortion rights, voting to pass a so-called heartbeat abortion bill, severely restricting women’s access to an abortion in the state. The Republican-controlled legislature voted 79-23 in favor of the bill and the state’s Democratic governor John Bel Edwards, who has long-opposed abortion rights, said he will break with his party and sign it into law. The new restrictions will outlaw abortions after a fetus’ heartbeat can be detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women are even aware they’re pregnant. The current legal standard for when an abortion is no longer legally permissible, as established by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade , is roughly 24 weeks. “I know there are many who feel just as strongly as I do on abortion and disagree with me—and I respect their opinions,” Edwards said in a statement after Wednesday’s vote. “As I prepare to sign this bill, I call on the overwhelming bipartisan majority of legislators who voted for it to join me in continuing to build a better Louisiana that cares for the least among us and provides more opportunity for everyone.” Even with Edwards signature, the new restrictions will not go into effect until a federal appellate court rules on a similar Mississippi law passed in March that is being held up by a court injunction. Louisiana joins a number of mostly southern states—Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio—to enact fetal heartbeat bills in an effort to curtail access to abortion services. Missouri, which approved an eight-week ban on abortion, is on the cusp of being the first state in the country since Roe v. Wade in 1973 not to have a single abortion clinic. And then there’s Alabama. The state passed a law just weeks ago that essentially outlaws access to abortion altogether—even in cases of rape or incest—in an effort to get the Supreme Court to take the case and reconsider Roe . Federal courts have typically reined in similarly overreaching state laws, recently in Arkansas, Kentucky, Iowa and North Dakota."

The Navy Reportedly Tried Hiding USS John McCain Warship With a Tarp During Trump’s Visit,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/navy-reportedly-tried-hiding-name-of-uss-john-mccain-warship-with-a-tarp-during-trumps-visit.html,"Trump Betrays America Again As if you needed a reminder, here’s where we are: Donald Trump is the president and when he, as president, visited a Navy ship on a recent trip to Japan, the White House instructed the Navy to hide a warship bearing the name of late senator and war hero John McCain during Trump’s visit, according to the Wall Street Journal. In a May 15 email to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official issued the directive: “‘USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.’ ‘Please confirm #3 will be satisfied,’ the official wrote.” The request to hide visual evidence of John McCain’s legacy ultimately made its way to the highest reaches of U.S. government; acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan reportedly signed off on the order. The problem with carrying out that order, however, was that the USS John McCain—a.k.a. Trump’s maritime nemesis—was being repaired after it was damaged in a collision, making it extremely hard to move, so “a tarp was hung over the ship’s name ahead of the president’s trip … and sailors were directed to remove any coverings from the ship that bore its name,” the Journal reports. “After the tarp was taken down, a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. Sailors on the ship, who typically wear caps bearing its name, were given the day off during Mr. Trump’s visit, people familiar with the matter said.” A tarp. Hiding a warship. That’s a real thing that happened. Just a 100-percent normal president doing normal president things."

Trevor Noah: The Mueller press conference makes a lot more sense if you think about it in terms of sexually transmitted diseases.,slate.com,Matthew Dessem,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/trevor-noah-daily-show-robert-mueller-press-conference-obstruction-herpes.html,"Case closed! Comedy Central Robert Mueller held a surprise press conference on Wednesday to announce that if he believed that President Trump did not commit obstruction of justice, he would not not have said so, and similarly, if he determined that President Trump did not not not commit obstruction of justice, he would not not not not have included that information in his report. As per usual, everyone heard what they wanted to hear , odds are pretty good that no one will do the right thing , and Donald Trump seems no closer to not not leaving office. But Trevor Noah figured out a simple way to parse what Mueller was saying: imagining Mueller was discussing sexually transmitted diseases. Here’s Noah’s explanation of Mueller’s statement:
Imagine you were about to have sex with someone and you asked them, “Hey, do you have herpes?” And their response is, “Well, if I had confidence that I did not have herpes, I would have said so.” You’d be like, “Okay, this motherfucker has herpes.” That’s what happened here. Case closed: Donald Trump obstructed justice and should probably get tested. Here’s Noah’s segment on Mueller: Although it turns out to be useful in this specific instance to imagine that a Justice Department official is talking about sexually transmitted diseases instead of their purported topic of discussion, please note that this technique has only limited utility as a general approach to understanding Justice Department statements. Take this 1947 testimony before HUAC from J. Edgar Hoover, for example: Hoover’s claim that Communism is “a condition akin to disease that spreads like an epidemic” and that “a quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting this nation” doesn’t make any more sense if you imagine he’s talking about a gonorrhea outbreak.

The California housing crisis is a crime against the young by the old.,slate.com,Henry Grabar,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/california-housing-crisis-boomer-gerontocracy.html,"What Do We Call It When the Rich Displace the Middle Class? The numbers in California tell a dire story these days: In 2018, despite low unemployment and high wages, the state’s population grew at its slowest rate in history. Fewer people are coming and more people are leaving because it’s very hard to find a place to live. In the past two years, homelessness is up 17 percent in San Francisco and 43 percent in Oakland’s Alameda County. Counties in Silicon Valley and the Inland Empire also recorded double-digit homelessness increases. Compared with the national figures, the state’s home prices are 2.5 times above average, while rents are 50 percent above average. “While many factors have a role in driving California’s high housing costs,” the nonpartisan state Legislative Analyst’s Office concludes , “the most important is the significant shortage of housing, particularly within coastal communities.” How many people must live in the street before we can build new homes? More was the answer earlier this month from the California State Senate, which punted — again —on a popular, radical solution to end the state’s debilitating housing shortage. Right now, apartment buildings are banned in most of California. By allowing them near mass transit, SB 50 would have increased California’s feasible annual housing output by a factor of six . But that would have changed the character of many neighborhoods with bus routes, according to state Sen. Anthony Portantino, a Democrat from the L.A. suburbs who last week halted the legislation’s progress to maintain the status quo of single-family zoning. “It was the time to take a breath, and we took a breath,” he said. Portantino is the former mayor of a town that has not built an apartment in a decade , one where the median home sells for $1.6 million. A breath or three. In a letter to the Los Angeles Times, Mar Vista resident Glenn Zweifel summed up a view that has pervaded meetings and online discussions on the subject: “I have always maintained that there is not necessarily a shortage of housing but an excess of people. Just because you want to live somewhere doesn’t mean you can.” In short, California is full. In the New York Times, Farhad Manjoo writes that “this sort of nakedly exclusionary urban restrictionism is a particular shame of the left.” Manjoo and many others blame wealthy liberals for throwing up the gates—not just in California, but in other high-cost cities and suburbs as well. Apartment bans are a case of rich vs. poor, longtime resident vs. newcomer, and, all too often, white vs. black, but they are something else too: generational warfare, a showdown in which older homeowners are telling younger renters that there’s no more room. Seen that way, the housing affordability crisis serves as a useful framework for understanding a handful of urgent American issues that have stalled out, particularly intraparty conflicts on the left like those over student debt and climate change. Whether by intention or simply in effect, it has begun to feel like the politics of an older generation saying, “Fuck you, I got mine.” American gerontocracy has levels. There is the president, who has not processed new information since 1990. There is Congress, which has an average age of 58 in the House and 63 in the Senate—among the oldest group of legislators in U.S. history. There has until recently been an enormous age gap in voter participation, and a familiar divide between older and younger Americans on issues like race, immigration, religion, and America’s place in the world. It all adds up to two different ideas of the country. But there is a parallel struggle at work, driven not by competing ideologies but by older Americans’ apparent indifference to the challenges facing their younger counterparts. In principle, at least, everyone basically agrees that housing and college should be affordable and that the air and water should be clean. But older Americans have already enjoyed an affordable college education, a choice of affordable neighborhoods, skies full of monarch butterflies, and oceans with fish living in them. So when it comes to addressing the fact that reality has changed—that housing near good jobs is no longer affordable, that going to college now entails decades of debt, that Miami will be underwater in 30 years—their resistance to address the changing reality reads as a collective shrug of self-interest. I got mine. For most of the 20 th century, America been run by elder statesmen , with the average representative now 20 years older than the median resident. What’s changed is that for once, things are not getting better with each passing generation. Even on the left, our elected officials don’t seem to quite get it. One sign of their disinterest is the continued inaction in Washington, in statehouses, and at the polls on issues like housing affordability, college costs, and climate change. But sometimes they are more explicit, as Joe Biden was when he said he has “no empathy” for millennials talking about how tough things are. Biden’s presidential campaign has the support of almost half of Democrats over 45 , four times the support of his closest opponent. Let’s review how things have changed for young Americans since the wunderkind from Delaware became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history in 1973. The median income for young men is lower now than it was then. Average net worth for young households in 2016 is 20 percent lower than it was for boomers in 1989 and 40 percent lower than for Gen X families in 2001. Relatedly, the cost of getting a college education more than doubled between 1985 and 2015. Student loan debt is approaching $1.5 trillion —up from $90 billion in 1999 , a 1,500 percent increase. While some Democratic candidates are proposing versions of a debt jubilee, for the moment, the best young Americans can hope for is the largesse of random billionaires or debt forgiveness from a hamburger chain sweepstakes . On housing, the ratio of median home price to median income—the years of salary it takes to buy a home—is 4.2, a full point higher than it was in 1988. In the nation’s best job markets, the barriers are higher still: Miami’s price-to-income ratios are up from 2.9 to 6.3 since 1980; Denver’s are up from 2.7 to 5.5; Seattle’s are up from 2.5 to 5.7. In wealthy cities and suburbs, (mostly older, mostly white) homeowners have successfully made housing the investment of a lifetime—their lifetime. Not coincidentally, the share of home equity owned by Americans over 60 has risen 17 percentage points between 2006 and 2018. That’s in part because we are building fewer homes per capita than at any time since World War II, a situation that seems unlikely to change anytime soon. Nowhere is this tendency of older Americans to shrug off a crisis more pronounced than in their reluctance to address the climate change crisis they helped create. Unlike Republicans, however (where there is a big generation gap over the issue), older and younger Democrats basically agree that climate change is man-made and affecting the United States. When it comes to dealing with it, though, it’s a different story. Biden, the avatar of that older cohort in the Democratic primary, is reportedly seeking a “middle ground” approach to addressing climate change. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Dianne Feinstein have also urged a moderate approach. That lack of urgency has angered younger climate activists, who will bear the worst effects of the crisis. In April, a Harvard Institute of Politics survey asked voters in their 20s to evaluate whether various groups “care about people like me.” Boomers as a group scored lower than the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and Donald Trump. Of course, it’s unfair to judge all Americans over 55 by the incompetence of our wizened legislatures: Many older Americans do get it. Many have been sounding the alarm about climate change for decades. The leading voices of progressive federal policy on the campaign trail are Bernie Sanders (77) and Elizabeth Warren (69), and the best climate policy belongs to Jay Inslee, who is 68. It’s also true that inaction on housing and climate harms older people too. The affordability crisis is in some ways hardest on the elderly, and the lack of diverse housing options makes it impossible for even well-off seniors to downsize in their own neighborhoods. Older Americans are also more vulnerable to the extreme weather associated with climate change. And in the largest possible sense, the inability of younger Americans to secure long-term financial stability is bad news for everyone. To solve this problem, younger people need to keep voting like they did in 2018—when, for the first time, Gen X, millennials, and Gen Z cast more votes than boomers and older generations, with millennial turnout doubling from 2014. It doesn’t feel like an accident that the youngest woman ever elected to Congress has done more to advance climate change discourse in Washington in six months than Democrats have done in a decade. But they can also try to make the case—in community meetings, in statehouses, and in Washington—for empathy. Young people in college, at planning meetings in Palo Alto, or protesting in Dianne Feinstein’s office , aren’t asking for anything radical—just for what their parents and grandparents already had.

"When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Central Park Five series, reviewed.",slate.com,Willa Paskin,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/when-they-see-us-central-park-five-netflix-review.html,"Game of Thrones ’ Finale Cloaked an Old Idea in More Modern Clothing When They See Us , Ava DuVernay’s four-episode dramatization of the true story of the Central Park Five—five boys of color between the ages of 14 and 16 who were coerced into confessing to a brutal rape they did not commit, and then were convicted of that crime—is impassioned, worthy, and at times very moving. It is also regularly excruciating. A particularly pointed example of a new kind of Must-See TV, When They See Us appeals not to our pleasure centers but to our higher minds, our civic responsibility, our duty to watch for the greater good. It challenges TV’s mandate to be fun: Does it really have to be? Might it entertain us—or educate or challenge us—in more complicated ways? We already have a category of movies that we expect to artfully, if painfully edify—think of 12 Years a Slave , or Schindler’s List —but we’re not acculturated to it on television. (This may be why those exact movies are notorious for going unwatched at home , while you wait until you’re “in the mood” for Schindler’s List .) You only have to make a decision to see a movie in a theater once. But with TV, you have to decide to begin every episode, and then you have to decide, minute by minute, not to distract yourself with, say, Level 973 of Candy Crush Soda Saga , of which I desperately availed myself all series long, trying to create just enough emotional distance to keep watching. On April 19, 1989, a 28-year-old white woman was brutally raped and left for dead in the north end of Central Park. The crime was swiftly pinned on five boys—Antron McCray, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise—who lived in the neighborhood. Though they confessed to the police on video and were described in the tabloids as a “wolf pack” out “wilding” for the night, they were innocent. Coerced confessions were the only evidence against them, but racism made the boys convenient scapegoats and metaphors for all that had gone wrong in a stratified, corrupt, crime-ridden, rape-infested, and fearful New York City. When They See Us , which arrives on Netflix Friday, is not interested in the boys as symbols. DuVernay, who took on the project after Santana suggested it to her via tweet , wants to dramatize what the criminal justice system and New York City stole from these innocent teenagers. The series begins on the day of the rape. Antron (Caleel Harris and, as an adult, Jovan Adepo), Raymond (Marquis Rodriguez and Freddy Miyares), Kevin (Asante Blackk and Justin Cunningham) , Yusef (Ethan Herisse and Chris Chalk), and Korey (Jharrel Jerome) are going about their regular lives: talking about the Yankees with a father and dreaming of becoming a shortstop; kissing a girlfriend; lugging an instrument around after school. Though they don’t know each other particularly well, they all wind up in a group of about 25 boys who head into the park that night, where some goof around, while others harass bikers or a homeless guy. The police descend, arresting a handful of them, but the cops don’t consider any of them suspects in anything particularly serious.

That changes after the rape victim is discovered in the early hours of the morning and Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein (Felicity Huffman, whose recent extracurricular misbehavior only adds to the part) decides the boys’ presence in the park that night can’t be a coincidence. Despite there being no physical evidence that the boys were involved, the police set out to make the facts fit the theory of the case. They start trying to get confessions and names, which they use to pick up additional suspects. Korey Wise, whose name is not on the police’s list, goes down to the precinct with Yusef just to be a good friend. He won’t leave police custody for more than a decade. For his act of kindness he will spend years at Rikers Island awaiting trial and then 13 years in an adult prison, the only one of the five who was 16 and so sentenced as an adult. The first episode is primarily concerned with chronicling the interrogations that resulted in the boys’ coerced confessions. It’s like watching a horrible trap being sprung in slow motion. The police questioning lasted more than 24 hours, in some cases without giving the boys food or access to their parents, and in all cases with enormous pressure from the police, who continuously promised that if the boys just said what they were instructed to say they would get to go home. The confessions barely make sense; the kids’ stories don’t align, some place the crime in incorrect places or at incorrect times. But the story was one that the police, the city, and many of the people in it wanted to believe, and so the confessions, however false, however swiftly denied, were enough. The second episode focuses on the trial. Perhaps because the story is so grim—the boys arrive at court every day with people, including our current president, calling for their execution—the series makes the lawyers significantly more competent in fiction than they were in real life, which means there are some strong moments of cross-examination. Nonetheless, the boys are found guilty. The third episode follows the four boys who were convicted as juveniles into and then out of jail, where life remains extremely challenging and unjust, not just for them but for their families: Michael K. Williams, Niecy Nash, and John Leguizamo all play parents, part of the large cast upon whom the case has tentacular effects. The fourth and final episode turns to Korey and his experience in adult prison, the series’ painful emotional climax. Having been convicted of an extremely high-profile sex crime, Korey is a target from the beginning. He begs for help, again and again, but no one will give it to him. He spends years in solitary confinement rather than be killed in general population. He keeps changing prisons in the hope he’ll be closer to his mother, and it continuously backfires. It’s heartbreaking how much succor he receives from the most basic kindnesses. (Less effective is the introduction, in flashback and memory, of his noble, loving transgender sister. Along with an extremely knowing extended conversation about Donald Trump, this lays the wokeness on anachronistically thick.) The story ends with a swift examination of how the Central Park Five’s convictions were vacated: not because of further investigation by the press, lawyers, or the police, but because the actual rapist—who was arrested close to the time of the original crime, whose DNA matched that found at the crime scene, and who was only not considered because the police and DA’s office were so smugly sure they had the right kids—encounters Korey in jail and comes forward to confess. A horrifying rapist and murderer has more of an innate sense of justice, in this instance, than the justice system itself. Though the movie ends with a feel-good sequence—the five men, free, raise their arms in front of a cheering crowd—the series is effective enough at showing what was taken from them to temper this ending, if not make it downright risible (and yet tear-jerking). When They See Us may be making an appeal to our duty to attend to this not-at all-ancient history—but is not, itself, dutiful. In one aspect, in particular, DuVernay’s approach is refreshingly unencumbered. Unlike, say, the various works about O.J. Simpson— OJ Simpson: Made in America and The People vs. O.J. Simpson— which explicated Los Angeles’ long racial history to help explain what happened, DuVernay is only passingly interested in the sociocultural moment, the New York City history that led to this catastrophe. In this specific instance, that’s actually a withering assessment of those very sociocultural forces: They were, simply, racist. There’s no reason to overcomplicate it. For more context and complications about New York City and the case, you could read Joan Didion’s perceptive, hard-nosed essay or watch Ken Burns’ documentary (it suggests, for example, that large swaths of the black community thought the boys were guilty too, which is underplayed in DuVernay’s series). But their conclusions are similar, and there’s a power to DuVernay’s relative lack of interest in what made so many of the white people involved in this incident so abjectly horrible and wrong. Racism, straight up, made the city, its servants, and its citizens stupid, evil, and blind. "
Trump Says Russia Helped Him Get Elected … and Then Immediately Says the Opposite,slate.com,Molly Olmstead,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/donald-trump-russia-2016-presidential-election-help.html,"Trump Betrays America Again For what appears to be the first time, President Donald Trump acknowledged on Thursday morning that he had been elected president with the help of the Russian government. “Russia, Russia, Russia!” Trump tweeted . “That’s all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax…And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.” But barely 20 minutes later, as Trump was heading out on a trip to the United States Air Force Academy, he denied what he had just said. “Russia did not help me get elected,” he said to reporters. “You know who got me elected? I got me elected.” Trump has maintained that Russian interference in the 2016 election did not affect its outcome and has even repeatedly questioned whether Russia was attempting to help his campaign at all, despite U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion to the contrary. Trump’s comments came as he again attacked Robert Mueller, who announced Wednesday that he had concluded his role as special counsel, and any supporters of Mueller’s investigation. “The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “After spending $40,000,000 over two dark years, with unlimited access, people, resources and cooperation, highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!” In reality, Mueller said in a surprise press conference Wednesday that he had not concluded that the president had committed a crime, citing as part of his reasoning a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel document asserting that, under existing law, a sitting president cannot be criminally indicted by the federal government. He also noted that “if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”"

New Memo Reveals the Census Question Was Added to Boost White Voting Power,slate.com,Richard L. Hasen,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/census-memo-supreme-court-conservatives-white-voters-alito.html,"The Worst Smears and Falsehoods in William Barr’s CBS Interview If we had a fair Supreme Court not driven by partisanship in its most political cases, Thursday’s blockbuster revelation in the census case would lead the court to unanimously rule in Department of Commerce v. New York to exclude the controversial citizenship question from the decennial survey. Those newly revealed documents show that the Trump administration’s purpose in putting the citizenship question on the upcoming census was not its stated one to help Hispanic voters under the Voting Rights Act, but rather to create policy that would be “a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” It’s difficult to produce a greater smoking gun than explicitly saying you are hoping to help the GOP by increasing white voting power. But this revelation, coming from the hard drive of a deceased Republican political operative and made available to Common Cause by his estranged daughter, is ironically more likely to lead the Republican-appointed conservative justices on the Supreme Court to allow the administration to include the question that would help states dilute the power of Hispanic voters. As I explained in Slate back in March, the U.S. government is defending the inclusion of a question about citizenship for the first time since the 1950 census as needed to provide accurate demographic information to the Department of Justice to help it protect Latinos in Voting Rights Act lawsuits. Two lower courts had found that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross insisted on including the citizenship question for undisclosed reasons and that the DOJ voting rights claim was a mere pretext. Republicans have again lined up in favor of including the question, which Democrats oppose as likely to inhibit a complete and accurate count of all persons in the United States as explicitly demanded by the Constitution, leading to lower representation in Democratic-leaning areas and fewer federal resources based on population. The case should be an easy one for the Supreme Court. The Commerce Department’s decision to include the citizenship question is a textbook example of arbitrary and capricious action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The only justification that the department has offered for including the question—aiding in DOJ efforts to help Latinos in voting rights cases—had already been shown to be a pretext. But at the Supreme Court oral argument, as Mark Joseph Stern reported for Slate , the conservative justices on the court offered disingenuous arguments in favor of the government. Those justices, who are usually hostile to the Voting Rights Act, took at face value the government’s assertion that the question was necessary to protect Hispanic voters, despite uncontradicted evidence that voting rights advocates don’t need the census data to defend their cases and despite the Trump administration not bringing a single Voting Rights Act Section 2 case defending Hispanic voters. They pointed to foreign practices despite an aversion to citing other countries’ cases in opinions. Most disingenuously, some of the conservative justices rejected the uncontradicted scientific evidence—some offered by those working for the Census Bureau itself—that adding the question will depress turnout, especially among Hispanics. These justices signaled that they were willing to defer to agency decision-making even when they have questioned such deference in other contexts. Never mind Ross’ real reason for including the citizenship question if Congress gives him broad discretion over how to craft the questionnaire. And here is where Thursday’s revelations fit in. The New York Times reported that the hard drive of the late Republican redistricting guru Thomas B. Hofeller contained documents indicating that the real purpose of including the citizenship question was to allow Republicans to draw new congressional, state, and local legislative districts using equal numbers of eligible voters in each district, not equal numbers of persons , a standard that would greatly reduce the power of Hispanics and Democrats in places like Texas. According to the Times, files on Hofeller’s hard drives, subpoenaed in litigation concerning North Carolina redistricting, show that Hofeller “wrote a study in 2015 concluding that adding a citizenship question to the census would allow Republicans to draft even more extreme gerrymandered maps to stymie Democrats. And months after urging President Trump’s transition team to tack the question onto the census, he wrote the key portion of a draft Justice Department letter claiming the question was needed to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act—the rationale the administration later used to justify its decision.” Indeed, the new documents should make that case indisputable. Hofeller’s documents describe how obtaining citizenship data would allow those drawing district lines to specifically harm Hispanic voters by packing even more of them into “Latino districts to bring their populations up to acceptable levels.” Common Cause also discovered a direct paper trail from the Hofeller documents to the pretextual DOJ request for the census question. The DOJ version of the Voting Rights Act enforcement request cited a paragraph from Hofeller’s work verbatim and included much of the exact same substance of Hofeller’s research presented in the exact same order. In the court proceedings, though, administration officials actively hid Hofeller’s involvement. Again, all of this should be a slam dunk. For the court’s conservatives, though, it likely won’t be. The case should be an easy one for the Supreme Court. The question whether it is permissible to draw districts in the way Hofeller wanted is an open one. Ed Blum brought a 2016 case, Evenwel v. Abbott , in which the court unanimously rejected Blum’s argument that the state of Texas was constitutionally required to draw districts with equal numbers of eligible voters. But the majority opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg did not go further and reach the question whether drawing districts in this way—which would exclude not just noncitizens but also children and felons from the count—violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause. “Because history, precedent, and practice suffice to reveal the infirmity of appellants’ claims, we need not and do not resolve whether, as Texas now argues, States may draw districts to equalize voter-eligible population rather than total population,” Ginsburg concluded. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, however, wrote concurrences affirming their belief that states have the right to draw districts in this way. There is good reason to believe that the other conservative justices would come along should they have to decide the issue. The newly revealed census documents may now give them the opportunity to do just that. All of that means that the Supreme Court will likely go along with Ross’ true purpose in including the citizenship question on the census: to allow states to draw districts with equal numbers of voter-eligible persons rather than total persons. The smoking-gun evidence showing that government officials lied in offering the Voting Rights Act excuse for including the question likely will be seen by these justices as irrelevant if the real reason is a permissible one. This is not how the census case should be decided. The government should have to offer its real reasons for taking government actions and defend its actions on those terms. And even if it is otherwise constitutionally permissible to experiment with different understandings of how to draw districts with equal populations under the equal protection clause, the government should not be able to do so if the purpose is to dilute the power of political adversaries and minority voters, as demonstrated in this case by the new revelations. Thursday’s revelations should be damning. The ACLU is already seeking sanctions in the trial court in the census case for government officials lying about the real reason for including the citizenship question.

"New Hampshire legislature overrides governor's veto, abolishes death penalty.",slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/new-hampshire-legislature-abolishes-death-penalty.html,"Trump Betrays America Again The New Hampshire Legislature repealed capital punishment on Thursday, becoming the last state in New England to abolish the practice.Twenty other states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, have also eliminated the death penalty. In two more states, California and Pennsylvania, the governor has imposed a moratorium on executions. Even as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority makes capital punishment easier to carry out , states seem to be moving away from executions , leaving America’s broken death penalty system to collapse under its own weight. New Hampshire’s path to abolition was repeatedly blocked by Republican Gov. Christopher Sununu. Although he often touts his centrist credentials, Sununu is a staunch defender of the death penalty, asserting that crime victims and law enforcement deserve to see certain offenders killed. In 2018, a bipartisan coalition of Democrats and Republicans voted to rescind New Hampshire’s death penalty law. But Sununu vetoed the bill, declaring that “those who would commit the most heinous offenses” should not “be guaranteed leniency.” When Democrats gained large majorities in the November election, they renewed their push for repeal, joined by moderate and libertarian Republicans. This year, they easily passed a bill ending capital punishment—which was promptly vetoed by Sununu, who stated that to “repeal the death penalty today would deprive future victims of the justice they deserve.” In May, however, the House overrode Sununu’s veto after a handful of Republicans bucked the governor to vote with Democrats. And on Thursday, the Senate followed suit, with four Republicans (Senators Bob Guida, Harold French, John Reagan, and Ruth Ward) joining Democrats to abolish the practice by a vetoproof two-thirds vote. The bipartisan vote converts the maximum penalty in New Hampshire to life in prison without parole. Sununu issued a statement decrying the override and stating that he was “incredibly disappointed.” New Hampshire has not executed a prisoner since 1939 and has no death chamber. There is, however, one individual on its death row: Michael Addison, who was convicted of killing a police officer in 2008. The repeal bill does not formally convert Addison’s sentence from death to life imprisonment. But criminal justice advocates expect the state judiciary to convert Addison’s sentence now that the death penalty has been abolished. In 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court converted remaining death row inmates’ sentences to life imprisonment after the Legislature repealed capital punishment. It seems likely that the New Hampshire Supreme Court will do the same for Addison. (The state Constitution prohibits “cruel or unusual punishments,” and it is difficult to see how a punishment that cannot be applied today could be lawfully carried out against past offenders.) Thursday’s vote was the result of a long campaign that brought together progressives, libertarians, and religious activists. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and the Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty steered the advocacy fight alongside local religious leaders . Democratic Rep. Renny Cushing, executive director of Murder Victims’ Families for Human Rights, led the legislative battle, bringing his pro-life GOP colleagues on board.Cushing’s father and brother-in-law were murdered, but he pushed relentlessly to end “the cycle of pain” caused by capital punishment. On Thursday, in New Hampshire, that cycle was halted for good. Support our journalism

Tiffany Haddish Secretly Recorded What People Said About Her After Auditions,slate.com,Natalia Winkelman,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/tiffany-haddish-secretly-recorded-audition-criticism.html,"We Tricked Ourselves Into Believing Game of Thrones Mattered While auditions—and the inevitable barrage of rejections—are a standard part of a budding actor’s career, most aspiring performers aren’t privy to what’s said about them after they leave the audition room. Not so for Tiffany Haddish. During a Hollywood Reporter roundtable interview with comedy actresses, the Girls Trip star revealed her wily trick for listening in on private casting team criticism: secretly record the conversations. “You know what I’d do?” she asked the group, which also included comedy heavyweights Jane Fonda , Natasha Lyonne , Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Maya Rudolph , Regina Hall , and Alex Borstein . “I would put my phone on voice memo, put it in my bag, do the audition, walk out the room, leave my bag, come back and be like, ‘Oh, I forgot my purse in there.’ ” ""It was my like M.O."" #TheLastOG star @TiffanyHaddish reveals her ""sneaky"" way of getting true feedback after an audition https://t.co/hDhyXVcPTY pic.twitter.com/XcL2jSg7dT — Hollywood Reporter (@THR) May 29, 2019 “Oh, you’re nasty,” Rudolph remarked, as others probed for details. Some of the responses Haddish captured were, predictably, less than constructive. “ ‘She is not as urban as I thought she’d be,’ ” the actress recalled hearing. “Or ‘She’s so ghetto, I just can’t.’ ‘Her boobs aren’t big enough.’ ‘I really think we should just go with a white girl. This role should be changed to white.’ ” “Wait, how many rooms did you leave it in?” Rudolph asked. “A lot. A lot. It was like my M.O.,” Haddish said.

The story was a surprise to Fonda, who shared that she is often hesitant to overhear feedback, even the post-movie chitchat in theater restrooms. But Haddish insisted that though some comments hurt her feelings, listening in was valuable. “I want to hear so that I can grow,” she said. “And also so that I can write jokes about it and I can use it to my advantage. Like all this, ‘Jeez, she can’t read. Jeez, if she just could read it would work. She said every word wrong.’ And I’m like, ‘They’re right.’ So, I start reading out loud more and practicing. And it helps me in the long run.”"
Clarence Thomas Just Voted With the Liberals in a Big Consumer Rights Case. Why?,slate.com,Mark Joseph Stern,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/clarence-thomas-home-depot-consumer-rights-class-action-liberals.html,"New Memo Reveals the Census Question Was Added to Boost White Voting Power On Tuesday, the Supreme Court issued a surprising 5–4 decision in Home Depot v. Jackson that progressive advocates view as a win for consumers and class actions. The lineup in Home Depot was unusual: Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, joined only by the liberals; the other conservatives dissented. Home Depot marked the second time this term that Public Justice, a public interest advocacy firm, has triumphed at SCOTUS. Earlier this year, the firm won a unanimous victory in New Prime v. Oliveira , an important labor rights case . How did it nab Thomas’ vote this time around? The story of Home Depot is a tale of greed, grift, and civil procedure. It centers on a scheme that involved three companies: Home Depot, Citibank, and Carolina Water Systems Inc. Here’s how it allegedly worked. Representatives from Home Depot or CWS called homeowners and claimed that “contaminants” were found in nearby tap water. They urged homeowners to let them perform a test for “contaminants,” which was really just a test for water hardness; almost all tap water tested positive, even if it was perfectly safe. But CWS told homeowners the positive result proved their water was unsafe and required a $9,000 water purification system that other companies sell for $1,400. The company then told homeowners they had been approved for a Home Depot–branded Citibank credit card, which they could use to pay for the system with deferred interest. George Jackson got suckered into this alleged scam and, like many others, couldn’t afford to pay off the charges he put on the credit card to pay for the overpriced water purification system. A company representative allegedly told Jackson the Citibank card had zero interest for two years—but in fact, the interest rate jumped to 25.99 percent after one year. Jackson couldn’t afford to pay, so Citibank sued him in state court to collect the debt. Eventually, he secured the representation of consumer protection lawyers who filed a counterclaim against Citibank, as well as class-action claims against Home Depot and CWS on behalf of about 290 other homeowners targeted by the alleged scam. He claimed that the companies, working together, had violated North Carolina laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Republican lawmakers also think state courts are too favorable toward class actions. Home Depot promptly tried to move the case from North Carolina court to federal court—a typical corporate tactic , since federal courts are widely considered to be more business-friendly than state courts. F. Paul Bland, the executive director of Public Justice who argued Home Depot at the Supreme Court, told me that there’s a strong perception among most corporations that “federal courts are more hostile to consumer class action.” Federal judges “are overwhelmingly former prosecutors, corporate lawyers, and law professors,” and “very few ever represented a consumer or worker against a corporation.” By comparison, “about 40 percent of state court judges were plaintiffs’ lawyers.” State courts, as a result, are considered much friendlier to consumer class actions, hence Home Depot’s desire to get the case before a federal judge instead. Republican lawmakers also think state courts are too favorable toward class actions, which is why the GOP-controlled Congress passed the Class Action Fairness Act in 2005. CAFA was designed to expand the kinds of class actions that corporations could move from state to federal court. It has, Bland said, “been a great boon to corporate America.” And predictably, in response to Jackson’s claims, Home Depot argued that CAFA allowed it to move the entire case out of North Carolina court and get it before a federal judge. But Home Depot had a problem. Under a long line of cases going back to the 1940s , only a defendant can move a case from state to federal court. And a defendant is defined as the party sued by the original plaintiff. Here, Jackson is the defendant; remember, Citibank sued him to collect the debt he owed—that’s how the whole case started. Under the usual rules, then, Home Depot can’t escape North Carolina court. Home Depot tried to wriggle out from under this issue by arguing that CAFA changed everything with a single word: “any.” The law states that “any defendant” can move a case to federal court. And according to Home Depot, the word any changed the long-standing definition of defendant to encompass third parties slapped with a counterclaim. By adding just one word, Home Depot argued, CAFA upends nearly 80 years of law, granting corporations facing class action counterclaims a new right to move cases into federal court. Thomas’ opinion rejected this argument in a brief opinion laser-focused on CAFA’s plain text. Nothing in the statute, Thomas explained, altered the well-established “limitation on who can remove, which suggests that Congress intended to leave that limit in place.” By adding the word any , Congress “did not expand the types of parties eligible to remove a class action.” Instead, it altered an old rule that a case can only be moved to federal court if “all defendants” consent, granting “any defendant” the ability to move a case. But because Home Depot is not a defendant under the law, it still has no right to move the case to federal court. In his lengthy dissent, Justice Samuel Alito railed against this conclusion, accusing the majority of “inventing an ersatz … rule” with a “logical gap.” His opinion focuses on CAFA’s history and legislative purpose, condemning class actions and state courts without mounting a coherent textual argument. Indeed, Bland told me, Alito’s dubious reading of CAFA would move many cases to federal court that aren’t even class actions. It would federalize a “gigantic number” of individual claims, including run-of-the-mill personal injury cases, by allowing corporations to drag disputes into federal court when they face a counterclaim. There is no indication Congress intended such sweeping consequences. I asked Bland why he thought Thomas—who has often sided with the conservatives and corporations when the text seems to favor a liberal outcome—voted as he did in Home Depot . “I do like to think that he really just read the statute and felt that it was the right result,” he said. “In terms of policy, though, Thomas has shown a particular interest in respecting states’ courts.” Bland further noted that unlike Alito, who simply seems to think “class actions are bad and state courts are untrustworthy,” Thomas “respects state law in state courts, even if he doesn’t particularly agree with their policies.” Whatever the reason for Thomas’ vote, the justice has given George a chance to pursue his claims in state court. He won’t “get a free ride,” Bland said; “we still have to prove this case.” But Home Depot failed to yank the case from a North Carolina judge who might actually give George a fair shot at justice. And at this Supreme Court, that’s a rare victory that puts consumer advocates in the curious position of praising Clarence Thomas. Support our journalism

Netanyahu-Lieberman feud forces new elections in Israel.,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/netanyahu-lieberman-orthodox-elections-israel.html,"Trump Betrays America Again In retrospect, maybe we shouldn’t have been surprised that Benjamin Netanyahu—who is likely facing multiple criminal indictments and who only a third of Israelis think should be prime minister—has had some trouble rallying allies to his side. But after all the comebacks and near escapes he has pulled off in his long career, it seemed foolish to bet against him after April’s election . Now, however, his career, and possibly his freedom, are in jeopardy after he failed to form a coalition government by the deadline Wednesday, forcing parliament to dissolve itself and call a new election in September. To recap, Netanyahu’s Likud party won 35 Knesset seats on April 9, a total that was tied with the centrist Blue and White alliance led by Benny Gantz. But President Reuven Rivlin asked Netanyahu to attempt to form a government because he had the much clearer path to victory, with right-wing parties controlling 65 seats. (Only 61 are needed for a majority.) Some horse-trading would certainly be required, but it was widely assumed that the right-wingers would fall in line. Much has been written about the dramatic overall shift to the right in Israeli politics, and that narrative is true, but “the right” in Israel contains multitudes, and many of those multitudes hate one another’s guts. Just because Israel’s traditional leftist parties have been decimated in recent elections doesn’t mean that there’s any sort of consensus among the parties that remain. The parties that are lumped in as “right” or “far-right” in media coverage (particularly international coverage) include religious West Bank settlers, secular West Bank settlers, Sephardic ultra-Orthodox, Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox, centrist neo-liberals, pot-smoking ultra-Zionist libertarians , and outright terrorists . Many of the disagreements between these parties have little to do with the Israeli-Palestinian issues that much international coverage of Israel tends to focus on. In this case, the role of spoiler was played by Avigdor Lieberman, the controversial former defense and foreign minister whose Yisrael Beiteinu party draws most of its support from Russian-speaking émigrés who arrived in Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union. (Lieberman was born in what is now Moldova.) Lieberman, a secular West Bank settler, has railed against the growing clout of the ultra-Orthodox in Israeli society. Most controversially, while military service is mandatory for all 18-year-old Jewish Israelis, students in ultra-Orthodox yeshivas are exempt. Lieberman, who controlled five seats after the last election, refused to join Netanyahu’s coalition unless the prime minister committed to passing his bill, without amendment, that would conscript more ultra-Orthodox men and impose penalties on yeshivas that don’t comply. That would have been a red line for the two ultra-Orthodox parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, who jointly controlled 16 seats and were critical for Netanyahu’s coalition. (The schism over the bill was what led to the election being held in April in the first place.) Netanyahu spent several days desperately bargaining, offering ministries and law changes in attempts to win over parts of Gantz’s party, the moderate Kulanu, and even the left-wing Labour Party. The leading Arab politician Ayman Odeh got some laughs on the floor of the Knesset by joking that Netanyahu had called to offer withdrawal from occupied territories and recognition of the Nakba if Odeh would join the government. While Lieberman probably does feel strongly about ultra-Orthodox conscription, he may also just relish being the one to stick the knife in Netanyahu. Although he got his start in politics by working in Netanyahu’s office, the ultra-hawkish Lieberman has become a staunch rival of the prime minister, accusing him this week of fostering a “cult of personality.” Lieberman resigned as defense minister in November—and pulled his party from the coalition—over Netanyahu’s handling of a recent round of fighting in Gaza . Lieberman accused Netanyahu of “surrendering to terror” for accepting a cease-fire with Hamas and allowing Qatari investment in the beleaguered Hamas-controlled territory. Netanyahu had less room to maneuver than he normally would because of the pending corruption indictment against him. If he had formed a government, Likud had planned to push for a law that would have shielded the sitting prime minister from prosecution. That gave political rivals little incentive to support him. Netanyahu’s pre-indictment hearing is currently scheduled for October , and while he could theoretically continue to govern while he’s on trial, pressure on him to resign will likely grow, even if he wins another election in September. On July 17, Netanyahu will break David Ben-Gurion’s record to become the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history. In light of that fact, normally I would say it would be a mistake to count him out. But after this week’s humiliation, it would be just as much of a mistake to assume that he’s invincible."

2018 election millennial turnout doubled over the 2014 election.,slate.com,Rachelle Hampton,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/2018-election-millennial-turnout-record.html,"The Well-Endowed Guys I’ve Been With All Seem to Have the Same Problem. What Am I Missing? In the days leading up to the 2018 midterm election, New York magazine published a series of as-told-to interviews with 12 young adults on the reasons why they “probably” weren’t voting. As I wrote when the piece began to set a particular subsection of Twitter on fire, the interviews “combined two of the Politically Online’s favorite foils: maddening nonvoters and the apathy of the Youth toward treasured institutions.” For days, pundits and journalists lambasted both the people interviewed and young people writ large for their bankrupt sense of civic duty. Democracy will die not with a bang, but with millennials who didn’t know how to use the postal system, the irate commentators claimed. Well, folks, I have some news. According to recent analysis of Census Bureau data from the Pew Research Center on 2018 voter turnout , that entire online outrage cycle was largely baseless. In the midterm elections, millennial turnout among eligible voters nearly doubled from 22 percent in 2014 to 42 percent last year. And younger generations—Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X—actually outvoted boomer and prior generations, 62.2 million votes to 60.1 million votes. As Pew notes, “the number of eligible voters among [older] generations fell by 8.8 million between the elections.” With fewer members of older generations, it’s fair to expect turnout rates to go down, but for the first time since 1994, boomer and older generations showed up in larger numbers than the previous midterm—in fact, boomers had their highest-ever midterm election turnout. But even with the extra votes cast by galvanized elders, younger generations still outvoted them to the tune of 2.1 million votes. For those young generations, higher turnout rates largely accounted for the increase: The number of eligible Gen X and millennial voters did increase by 2.5 million between 2014 and 2018, but the two generations together cast more than 21.9 million more votes than in 2014. And Gen Z is already turning out more than previous generations: Though only 4 percent of those born after 1996 were eligible to vote in 2018, a third of those voters made it to the polls. Compare that to millennials, whose midterm turnout rate had hovered in the low 20s since 2006. This latest generation’s impact will likely be most felt in the 2020 election, when the number of eligible voters will have doubled. This new data dispels the easy myth that today’s young voters don’t care or aren’t significantly invested in the political process, as appealing as it may be to rail against the youngs online. Even with the return of arcane voter suppression tactics , turnout increased across generations, with that increase most pronounced in younger generations. Now imagine how many more of the Youth would vote if they didn’t have to learn how to buy stamps to mail in their absentee ballots. "
Always Be My Maybe review: Netflix’s rom-com stars Ali Wong and Randall Park.,slate.com,Inkoo Kang,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/always-be-my-maybe-review-netflix-rom-com-ali-wong-randall-park.html,"The Live-Action Aladdin Improves in Many Ways on the Original The first time that I can remember encountering a protest about Asian American representation was in the late ’90s, about the ABC sitcom Dharma & Greg . On the eve of the show’s Season 3 premiere, multiple Asian American groups criticized its “whitewashing” of San Francisco , whose population was then, as it is now, about one-third Asian. George Takei didn’t mince words when he accused Dharma & Greg , along with the similarly Bay Area–set Suddenly Susan —neither of which had any characters of Asian descent—of “present[ing] a version of America that’s a bald-faced lie. … This reinforces the notion that we are a white nation and feeds into delusions of white supremacy.” Activist Guy Aoki took another tack by observing that “including people of color is not a creative imposition, but a creative opportunity. … Think how many more story ideas you’ll have.” The new Netflix romantic comedy Always Be My Maybe , starring Ali Wong and Randall Park, is as much a love letter to San Francisco’s long-ignored, now-imperiled Asian immigrant neighborhoods as it is a love story about childhood sweethearts rediscovering home in each other. (In a 2016 profile, Wong said she had long discussed with Park, an old friend, making “ our version of When Harry Met Sally .”) Despite the leads’ less-than-freaky-deaky chemistry—their characters’ growing up together as best friends and next-door neighbors amplifies the sibling vibes—the hip-hop– and R&B-soundtracked film is moving, thoughtful, tender, and hysterical. And unsurprisingly for a project that doubles as an unofficial Fresh Off the Boat reunion—between director Nahnatchka Khan (that series’ creator), Wong (a former writer), and Park (a cast member), with the latter two penning the script with Michael Golamco—it’s loaded with enough culturally specific details (plastic-encased sofas, shoes taken off at the door, asking people point blank how much money they make, the healing power of kimchi jjigae ) to inspire dozens of listicles cataloging them. Apart from the noteworthiness of their being Asian American, Sasha (Wong) and Marcus (Park) initially make for a rather unexceptional rom-com duo. After a teenage back-seat sex session turns sour, the pair don’t meet again until they’re in their mid-30s. She’s become a celebrity chef in a dominatrix ponytail , known as much for her fusion dishes as for her engagement to an equally successful restaurateur (Daniel Dae Kim) who doesn’t seem all that into her. Marcus, meanwhile, has continued living with his dad (a scene-stealing James Saito), smoking weed, performing with his dork-rap band, and railing against hipster bars taking over San Francisco between handyman gigs. Sasha’s friend Veronica (Michelle Buteau) reunites them by hiring Marcus to fix the air conditioning in a house the chef has rented while preparing for the launch of her new Bay Area restaurant, aptly (by which I mean, annoyingly) called Saintly Fare. When Marcus lightly mocks Sasha after overhearing her talk about her “trans-denominational” dishes, you immediately get the sense that no one’s dared to push back on her ideas in a while.

Always Be My Maybe ’s ideals about culinary “ authenticity ” might be about five years behind, but its relish in cutting down foodie pretensions is bracing and all too relevant. Marcus blanches at a quail-egg parfait, and his eyes just about roll out of his head when someone at his table inquires about dishes that play with the concept of time. (That someone is Keanu Reeves, playing himself in an exquisite self-parody that reintroduces the action icon as a comic actor.) Even more refreshing is the film’s unapologetic embrace of female ambition. Unlike many a rom-com in which the busy heroine finds herself settling for less once she returns to her hometown, much of the tension comes from Sasha challenging Marcus to support her aspirations rather than disparage them because they’re not what he would’ve chosen for himself. (And in contrast to many cross-class romances, Always Be My Maybe is attuned to what Marcus wouldn’t be able to afford in his efforts to woo Sasha.) She never shows much vulnerability—Wong and Park seem to have written for their considerable comic talents and around their lesser dramatic chops—but Sasha has to acknowledge her faults, too, which are poignantly rooted in a particular type of Asian American childhood defined by latchkeys and immigrant striving. The script relies too often on Sasha’s bestie or Marcus’ father pushing the destined couple toward each other, but its smaller moments of naturalistic riffing make up for the rigid plotting. (If Netflix suggests you start watching another movie as the credits start to roll, know that one of the movie’s funniest bits comes during the credits.) Those more intimate moments gradually transform these rom-com archetypes into human beings with mature conflicts and complicated relationships to their origins. There’s no reason why Always Be My Maybe couldn’t have existed 20 years ago, but as Sasha and Marcus could say of their relationship, better late than never."
"New data shows Chicago police use more force against black citizens, whites resist more.",slate.com,Rob Arthur,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/chicago-police-department-consent-decree-black-lives-matter-resistance.html,"Why Do Children Keep Dying in U.S. Custody? Maybe Because Nobody Is Holding CBP Accountable. Earlier this month, a New Jersey teenager was beaten by police in Dover, prompting street protests . Footage of the beating showed police officers punching 19-year-old Cyprian Luke, who reportedly identifies as Afro-Latino, in the head as one of the officers repeatedly shouted “Stop resisting!” The mantra “stop resisting” is a familiar one to anybody who has assessed police violence. The premise that if black people simply complied during police interactions there would be no police brutality is a common trope. According to newly revealed data on use of force cases in Chicago, it’s a story that has no basis in reality. As dozens of studies have shown , police tend to use more force against black citizens. Often in these cases a claim that the suspect “resisted arrest” is used to justify the violence. In 2014, a New York man named Eric Garner was famously charged with resisting arrest even as officers used a chokehold that prevented him from breathing and ultimately killed him. Indeed, some police advocates have gone so far as to claim that black people are more hostile or noncompliant with law enforcement, and that—as such—greater force is justified against black communities. “[O]fficers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in [minority] communities, raising officers’ own risk of using lethal force,” the Manhattan Institute’s Heather MacDonald wrote in the Wall Street Journal in a 2016 piece titled “ The Myth of Black Lives Matter .” A new cache of data released by the Chicago Police Department, however, shows that the claim that black people are more likely to face police violence because of noncompliance is itself a dreadful myth. According to the new numbers, Chicago police officers used more force against black citizens, on average, than any other race—even though black citizens tended to exercise less resistance than whites. Under the same circumstances and faced with the same level of danger, cops tended to resolve the situation without firing their weapons much more often for white citizens than black citizens. This analysis was based on Chicago PD’s own descriptions of the incidents in question. In 2016, the Invisible Institute —a police accountability nonprofit based in Chicago—filed an open records request on officer use of force for the CPD. The institute received the reports on each of the more than 60,000 times police officers pushed, stunned, shot at, or otherwise used force on civilians from 2004 through part of 2016, including the level of force used and the amount of resistance reportedly encountered. Officers are required to use force appropriate for the level of danger they face, but they were much more likely to show such restraint for white subjects than black subjects given the same sets of circumstances. Using the data acquired by the Invisible Institute, I quantified the level of resistance along a simple scale, ranging from passive resistance to attacking an officer with a deadly weapon. I also measured level of force along a range from physical restraint to shooting at the subject. I converted these levels to a simple scale. Passive resistance was measured as a 1, more active resistance like fleeing was a 2, physical assault was a 3, and deadly force like firing a weapon was a 4. (The original officer-reported numbers were along a complex 0.0 to 6.0 scale, which I converted to 1-4 for simplicity sake without taking into account race when I made the conversion.)* For officer use of force, verbal commands were measured as a 1, chasing or physical restraint was a 2, physical force like the use of a baton or stun gun was a 3, and firing a weapon was a 4. (The original officer-reported scale was also 1-4.) This analysis was based on Chicago police’s own descriptions of the incidents in question. Ultimately, comparing the two scales, officers tended to use more force against black subjects even though they presented less resistance than white subjects. For instance, black subjects offered Level 1 or 2 resistance in 47.5 percent of cases, as compared to 44 percent of white subjects who offered the same lower levels of resistance. Meanwhile, black subjects faced Levels 3 or 4 use of force 91.6 percent of the time, as compared to white subjects who faced those levels of force in 89.2 percent of cases. “It’s no surprise that African Americans are having more force used against them,” said Sam Walker , a professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska and frequent consultant to police departments. “The fact that officers are reporting … less resistance than white subjects—that’s surprising,” A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department declined to comment, stating that the department had not independently authenticated my analysis. The disparities were especially pronounced in the use of lethal force. According to the analysis of the police reports, black subjects were deemed to present a deadly threat to police officers slightly more often than whites. But when faced with a white subject deemed to present a deadly threat, officers used lethal force in just 28 percent of cases. Meanwhile, officers fired upon black subjects in 43 percent of similar situations. Subconscious bias might help to explain this enormous disparity. “There’s a whole host of research that shows that black men are perceived to be more threatening because they are black men,” said Samuel Sinyangwe , a co-founder of Campaign Zero , a group that advocates for police reform and reductions in police violence. Structural differences in poverty and crime rates in black communities are also often used as a justification for disproportionately more aggressive policing. Those differences are real, even if that rationale itself does not hold water. “[It’s] several hundred years of racist housing policy, and economic policy, and education policy, and criminal justice policy that set the stage for a racially disparate type of interaction today,” said Seth Stoughton , a law professor at the University of South Carolina, former police officer, and co-author of a forthcoming book on police uses of force. Because the analysis is based off of officers’ self-reporting—which may not be fully accurate—the racial bias could be even worse than the data indicates. How can police departments put a stop to the disproportionate use of force against black communities? Many law enforcement agencies employ specialized training in an effort to reduce unconscious biases. In these programs, police officers run through fictional scenarios set up to challenge preexisting biases. Until recently, Chicago did not require officers do this kind of training after they graduated the police academy. But after an investigation by the Department of Justice following the 2014 murder of Laquan McDonald, the city agreed to a consent decree that included such anti-bias training annually. The decree also requires revisions to the city’s use of force policy and mandates that the department analyze use of force statistics to identify trends related to racial biases. The department’s own data on these interactions, and my analysis based off of those numbers, would be a valuable place for them to look next. Chicago’s reforms have come only after years of officials laying the blame for disproportionate use of force on “resistance,” an argument that is refuted by the new analysis. Former Police Commissioner Garry McCarthy, for instance, would blame police shootings on “ noncompliance ” on the part of arrestees. This was while his own department was shooting a far lower percentage of the time when the noncomplying subject was white. Former police union chief Dean Angelo, meanwhile, denied charges of racial bias in the department by saying that police use force more often against black or Hispanic subjects because of higher crime rates in black and Hispanic communities. Again, the Invisible Institute data clearly demonstrates that “noncompliance” on the part of black subjects does not explain the higher levels of relative force. “There are narratives about police encountering more danger when they’re encountering black people,” said Sinyangwe. “There are narratives about police using force strictly because of the resistance they encounter.” As Sinyangwe, concluded, though, those police narratives “can’t withstand the actual data.”

We don’t need hard evidence to know 13 Reasons Why had problems.,slate.com,Shannon Palus,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/technology/2019/05/13-reasons-why-suicide-rates-research-netflix-wrong-right.html,"Wait, You Can Still Get the Plague? In April, a study was published that suggested Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why , a show that is centered around the main character’s suicide, might be linked to a “ significant increase in monthly suicide rates” among teen boys that occurred following the release of the show. A study published just this week in JAMA Psychiatry found, like the April study, that the show was linked to an increase in teen suicide—though the authors of this study think the show potentially had a greater impact on girls, not boys. These studies have been covered with concern but caution: the research is not definitive. Also this week, the show’s creator and executive producer Brian Yorkey took to the Hollywood Reporter to defend himself . Along with Rebecca Hedrick, a psychiatrist who served as an adviser to the show, he offers the same critique of the April study that others , including the original study authors, have : Correlation is not the same as causation. It’s not clear that fictional stories can function as a suicide contagion, Yorkey writes, and he’s right (the authors of the JAMA study said the same—“caution must be taken in interpreting these findings.”) Netflix having the blood of teens on its hands would be an extraordinary claim, for which extraordinary evidence should be required. But Yorkey and Hedrick make a different extraordinary claim: They think 13 Reasons Why is actually having a positive impact. That’s not right, either. Their argument is that the show is starting an important conversation around mental health, a thesis that has been a central tenet of the program’s press strategy for years. In 2017, following the show’s premiere, producer-slash-celebrity Selena Gomez responded to the resulting backlash by saying the same thing: She hopes the show’s unflinching approach opens a “door for people to actually accept what’s happening and actually go and change it, talk about it.” (Incidentally, encouraging “conversation” around mental health resulting from the show is conveniently similar to encouraging conversation around, and viewership of, the show itself.) Yorkey and Hendrick note that there are “numerous independent pieces of research” that support their theory that the show is having a positive influence. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to evaluate this body of work because they describe it only briefly and do not link to any actual papers. But one might be a study published recently in Social Science and Medicine, which found that folks who watched the second season of the show all the way through reported less suicidal ideation than before. The findings weren’t straightforward though: Viewers who stopped partway through “exhibited greater suicide risk and less optimism about the future,” the authors write (and either way, we’re still stuck in a correlation-isn’t-causation place). Another example of Yorkey and Hendrick’s data might be an online survey out of Northwestern’s Center for Media and Human Development that was commissioned by Netflix itself. The resulting report, perhaps unsurprisingly, paints a rosy picture, suggested that the show resonated with parents and kids, provided relevant information, and, yep, “supported conversation.” I have to wonder who would voluntarily admit in an online survey that they watched the show and were, as a result, more likely to bully someone. But even given the questionable methods of the survey, the data found in the middle of the report tell a more negative story: One-third of teens and young adult viewers surveyed in the U.S. found a rape scene in the show too graphic, didn’t agree that watching the show was beneficial, and didn’t find that the suicide to be depicted in a way that “was appropriate for me personally.” These figures, which represent a rather large swath viewers, tended to be higher among folks with social anxiety. The researchers did not go much further than that. What about the kids grappling with depression and suicidal ideation—the people who stand to be the most harmed by the program? They didn’t ask. I don’t think it’s impossible that there are some upsides to the show for some people. The PSA that aired at the start of the second season was well-received, though that was arguably a response to backlash—meaning that if the show is doing helpful things, it’s precisely because of pressure from viewers who found it lacking. But it’s too simplistic to argue that flinging any depiction of suicide into the world counts as starting a positive conversation. Instead, we need to acknowledge that the show offers a mess off “complex trade-offs,” as the authors of a JAMA Psychiatry editorial that ran alongside the most recent paper explain. Trying to precisely calculate what those trade-offs are, and whether they present a net positive or a net negative, will be extremely hard. For one thing, it’s nearly impossible to prove any direct relationships between suicide rate and watching 13 Reasons Why because it’s nearly impossible to place blame squarely anywhere after a suicide. But we don’t need hard research proving that the show had a negative impact on enough people’s lives to understand that it could have, especially for more vulnerable teens. Instead of waiting for evidence proving that Netflix did a net good or net bad job with this one, we should consider what mental health professional after mental health professional has noted: There are issues with the plot that spread iffy ideas about suicide and mental health. Specifically, that the show depicts the act as a revenge fantasy and suicide as a means to exercise some control over your social circle. We don’t need to show that the program led to a spike in suicides to be concerned about the ramifications. We can just call it what it is: a piece of entertainment that’s constructed around a dangerous message. Support our journalism

One of my cats died. Is the other grieving? Pet advice from Beast Mode.,slate.com,Nick Greene,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/my-cat-died-another-lives-pet-grief.html,"My Cats Only Sleep Outside. How Should I Transition Them Indoors? Dear Beast Mode, For eight years we had two female cats. They always got along fine, but I wouldn’t describe them as devoted to each other. They had occasional spats, but never any real fights. Maybe that is what devotion between cats looks like? Recently, one of the cats became suddenly and seriously ill and died. Our surviving cat is a bit needier than usual but otherwise seems OK. While none of us humans are quite ready to look for a new kitty just yet, we enjoyed having two pets and likely will want to add to the family at some point. Our cat is approximately 13 to 14 years old. My husband is convinced she’s terribly lonely and that we should adopt again soon, but I worry that she may be happy on her own and we would ruin her remaining years by making her adjust to a new pet whom she may or may not click with. Are there any clues from her we could be looking for to help us decide? —Three’s Not a Crowd Dear Three’s Not a Crowd, Grief is odd, right? It’s not a singular emotion, but a cocktail of memories and doubts and stomach aches and the occasional burst of random laughter. I think that’s why people say, “I’m sorry for your loss.” You’re not going to solve anything, so it’s easiest to just issue a blanket apology. Now, allow me to offer two apologies: I’m sorry for your loss, and I am sorry I can’t think of anything more comforting to say. I understand where your husband’s coming from. If you put yourself in the cat’s shoes, this loss must feel tectonic. Her entire universe exists within your home, and the cat population was just halved in one fell swoop. I mean, being the last person on Earth is a terrifying thought. That’s why it’s such a popular trope in science fiction: Loneliness is universal. That’s in regards to humans, though. Cats don’t read or write sci-fi. Your cat isn’t Tom Hanks in Cast Away ; she’s Tom Cruise in Risky Business . To better understand the feline grieving process, I called certified cat behaviorist Ingrid Johnson and told her about your situation. “This is a super common misconception of humans,” she says. “The cat might be missing her housemate, but it doesn’t mean that she wants another cat.” It’s one thing if she was howling, refusing to eat, or otherwise acting strangely in response to the loss. But, by the sounds of it, she’s doing great. What you see as “neediness” is probably just her living her best life. “Sometimes when there’s a pair, one is a little more outgoing and steals the show,” Johnson says. “Then that one dies and the other one is like, ‘Oh, this is fantastic.’ It can be pretty fun for them. They finally have the limelight.” Your cat isn’t Tom Hanks in Cast Away ; she’s Tom Cruise in Risky Business , and her life is now “Old Time Rock and Roll” on a loop. Do you really want to shut off the Seger? The cat may be fine, but you guys can grieve her old companion any way you want. This includes adopting another one, but you should make this decision carefully to avoid ruining your current cat’s renaissance. Johnson says that you have three options when it comes to adoption: “another old codger, a pair of kittens, or nothing at all.” A senior female cat will be well-matched, behaviorally, as they will both be content to keep to themselves. A pair of kittens, meanwhile, will have each other to play with so they won’t have to bug their older roommate for attention. “This allows her to watch them like kitty TV and babysit them if she’d like,” Johnson says, “but she also can remove herself if she’s not feeling it.” Or there’s the simple solution: Keep the current situation going. Whatever your decision may be, don’t rush into it. We’re not cats; we need time to adjust. "
Kevin Durant: Congress must do what's right and ban him from the NBA Finals,slate.com,Ben Mathis-Lilley,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/culture/2019/05/kevin-durant-nba-finals-warriors-congress-must-act.html,"The New Orleans Pelicans (???) are Going to Get Zion Williamson (!!!) There’s been a lot of talk recently about whether Congress is ready to take the big step . It would be an unprecedented move, and one that a substantial number of Americans believe would be unnecessarily severe . It would generate intense backlash in a key voting bloc and among wealthy and powerful individuals —not to mention angering its subject, who is known for reacting aggressively when challenged by rival sources of authority . It is, put simply, not a choice to be taken lightly. But sometimes our representatives are called to do what is right even when it is risky. And right now it is clear that what is right for the country is for Congress to remove Kevin Durant from the NBA Finals, which start Thursday night in Toronto. When Durant is on the floor with the Warriors in playoff games, they are simply so good that it’s boring. The full-strength Warriors came within one loss of sweeping both the 2017 and 2018 Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, a team led by LeBron James, who is not only one of the best players ever but was in peak form, coming six rebounds over four games in 2018 short of averaging a triple double in both series. This season, the Warriors were obviously as bored as everyone else, spending much of the year arguing with referees and with each other and losing games against inferior teams. They clunked their way through a first-round matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers mostly by relying on Durant to score a lot . But on May 8, with the Warriors’ second-round series against the Houston Rockets tied at 2-2, Durant strained his calf. Golden State went on to win that game, and then the next one, and then the next four in a row against the Portland Trail Blazers, a string of wins that has inspired some hot-take artists to argue that the team is better without him. Research by Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight and Kevin Pelton at ESPN , though, has shown that this is probably not really true: Silver found that, since Durant joined the team, the Warriors have been four points better per 100 possessions when he and Stephen Curry are on the floor together than when Curry is playing without Durant; Pelton notes that the team’s top performances as measured by “ game score ” almost always take place when both are starting. What the Warriors have been over the last five games is more fun to watch. Their offense, without Durant around to dominate 1-on-1 matchups, hasn’t been as efficient—but it has involved fewer post-ups , faster movement , and almost twice as many Stephen Curry pick and rolls . As Pelton notes, the team’s defense is typically sharper when Durant is out, as is its consistency of effort from game to game. In the Western Conference Finals, the Blazers led the Warriors by double digits three times—but Golden State, feeling the urgency, came back in each game. It was a Warriors series that, for the first time since 2016’s classic “ 3-1 lead ” loss to LeBron’s Cavaliers, involved uncertainty and narrative reversals rather than grim inevitability. Durant is still recovering from his calf injury and has been ruled out for Game 1 against Toronto. According to FiveThirtyEight’s experts , this actually makes the Warriors underdogs against the Raptors, which is a great twist for the viewing public and a new challenge for a team that has clearly been needing one. But if Durant comes back, which he could do as early as Game 2 , they will not be underdogs anymore, which would be boring, which is why Congress needs to put Kevin Durant in jail until the series is over. Do the right thing, Nancy !"
New relationship sex: advice how to keep that intense forever.,slate.com,Stoya,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/05/new-relationship-sex-intensity-advice.html,"My Sister and Her Husband, Both Virgins, Can’t Figure Out How to Have Sex. What Do I Tell Them? Dear How to Do It, I’m a 35-year-old man, and I just met a woman, and we’ve been hanging out, and the sex is … absolutely mind-blowing. I’ll spare you the details because it will seem like I’m bragging (I am), but it is fun, lighthearted, passionate, and completely amazing. Not to mention we go for hours. But it’s also new. And I’m experienced enough to know that a sexual relationship can’t sustain itself with this level of intensity forever. (Can it?) We both want it to last. We’ve talked about it. She’s talked about her penchant for getting bored with men. I know I’ve lost interest in women. I lost sexual interest in my last partner when the fights and accusations started being a daily occurrence. But with her, I really feel comfortable, and I really feel a sense of joy that I haven’t experienced in a long time. And we both want it. But we also both know that we can be our own worst enemies and self-sabotage and so on. So my question is this: How do we keep it fresh? Knowing ourselves, knowing that sometimes your body rebels against your mind, how do we sustain the intensity and excitement? But also, how do we grow and move into something more? In short, I want to be with this woman. What can I do to keep that a reality? —New Relationship Smell Stoya : I want this writer to be more specific about what he wants. He says vague things about “growing” and “moving” into something more, but he doesn’t specify what that looks like to him. Rich : Because it’s so early! How could he even know? I’m of two minds about this letter: The loudest mind is saying: Chill out! Live in the moment! Enjoy the nonstop boning! Stoya : Right. I’m just … I’m full of antibiotics right now and inclined to say, “Dude. You’re fine.” Pay attention to her. Treat her well. Don’t borrow trouble. If you lost interest in your last partner when the relationship began to fall apart, do better at building and nurturing this relationship. Rich : Totally! But that’s why I’m kind of glad he is writing to us. The quieter mind says: Good. This is a sign that you’re willing to work on staying engaged. Relationships, including sexual ones, require effort. In her book Mating in Captivity , Esther Perel writes, “committed sex is intentional sex.” So I like where he’s pointed. Stoya : I think he’s a little overfocused on the sex. If they want it to last, there has to be more than chemistry (which they do seem to have in excess). All that marathon boning can cut into getting-to-know-each-other time. Without a foundation, it will almost certainly fizzle. At least find time for some intimate emotional sharing while you’re resting or taking a water break. Actually, I know why I’m being a brat about this. Rich : Why! Stoya : I just broke up with someone because he was prioritizing the sex over getting to know me as a person. And things degenerated to the point where I’m a little rattled. So I’m pattern-matching and assuming this dude is also the sort of person who will say, “I almost told you I loved you” when he’s being broken up with after a month. Rich : Oh God. I’m sorry to hear that a guy put you through that. Hopefully we catch our letter writer before he gets there. Again, it’s a good sign that he wants something more than just a sex partner, and it does sound like they’re talking. But it requires striking a balance, right? Stoya : Our letter writer is raising my hackles because he talks about sex, he talks about issues both partners have had in previous relationships, and he talks about how she makes him feel, but he doesn’t talk about hopes, dreams, or who his partner is as a person. That’s important stuff. Maybe he also could speak to those things and just chose to stay focused on the subject at hand in his question, but I’d be less hissy if he mentioned at least one thing he likes about her other than the sex. Because that has to be fostered so it can grow—otherwise, things will almost certainly peter out. Rich : Maybe this is idealistic, but I believe that you know when you’re becoming more than just buddies? If that’s not happening here, perhaps she is intentionally holding back the relationship’s development (because she isn’t interested, for example). Regardless, you can’t quite will it to grow. You can give it water and sunlight, but whether it flowers is kind of up to nature. Stoya : Agreed. What is sunlight and water to romance? Rich : I think just what you said­—engaging with your partner as a person and not an object. Dealing in humanity and not operating out of some fantasy of a relationship. Being able to find and name qualities that you enjoy beyond sex. There are many ways to keep sex interesting. True emotional connection is one. Stoya : Appreciative leering helps, too. Watching your partner, gazing at her, while she moves around in the world. Extended eye contact. Rich : Display your thoughtfulness, but don’t be overbearing with it. Stoya : Exercise that knowledge gleaned from paying attention to her as a person. Rich : It’s probably also useful to set your intentions by having these conversations about where things are going with her. You have to be careful there so as not to suffocate her, but checking in about where her head is at is useful. Stoya : Agreed. That’s definitely a thing he should continue to do. Rich : So for the sake of the thought exercise, do you want to touch on the other component here? Say he does all this and they parlay their sexual relationship into a life partnership. How to keep things fresh? Stoya : Keep exploring and following sexual impulses. If they’re monogamists, Perel is the go-to resource. If they’re open, that can sometimes provide enticement (the joy of jealousy, the libido fire of knowing someone else is fornicating with one’s partner). I do think monogamists have to work to prevent themselves from becoming sexually lazy and taking their partner for granted. Rich : And it can take many forms, but all of them involve a sense of play—sometimes role-play, sometimes keeping sex thrilling by taking it outdoors or spending a designated night every week at a hotel. You have to make like a shark and keep moving, and when you’re being kept in a tank, the enormity of your task is especially apparent. But it’s doable! Stoya : Yes. There are many ways to keep sex interesting. True emotional connection is one. Rich : Also, not freaking out during a dry spell is key. Sex in committed relationships can ebb and flow, and you kind of just have to be at peace with that. Very little in life stays one way forever. Stoya : Totally. Rich : And finally, sometimes having less sex with a partner is reflective of your actual interests and intentions. Anxiety is fear of what’s yet to manifest—the reality isn’t always quite as fraught. Stay active and engaged and work toward a sex life without end, but if you find yourself perfectly content staying with a partner you’re not having sex with, it might just be your “love style,” as they say. Stoya : Like a life-bed balance? Rich : Yeah. I just think these things are much scarier when viewed from outside, but I know that sometimes people find themselves in these kinds of relationships—particularly later in life—and don’t mind one bit. I just mean to say that anxiety has a way of distorting the reality. Stoya : And reality is what you want to be living in if you want a long-term, healthy, mutually loving relationship."
"Trump now says, not at all hysterically, he’s going to slap tariffs on Mexico over illegal immigration.",slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-mexico-tariffs-illegal-immigration-what.html,"Navy Acknowledges Request to Hide USS John McCain During Trump Visit On Thursday, Donald Trump got on the horn and tweeted the U.S. into another trade war, this time with southern neighbor Mexico. Trump announced that in 10 days’ time he will impose a 5 percent tariff on goods coming into the U.S. from Mexico as punishment for what he sees as insufficient help in stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country. On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied,.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019 ....at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019 Needless to say, this seems like a political stunt that will surely not have the outcome Trump is demanding and may never even come to fruition. Not really anyway. Mexico, after all, was the second largest importer of goods into the U.S. last year, totaling $346.5 billion in trade, and the largest importer of agricultural products. Americans will, of course, still need fresh fruit and vegetables imported daily from Mexico and would surely really like beer and wine that comes along with it. The White House issued a statement expounding upon Trump’s tweets:
To address the emergency at the Southern Border, I am invoking the authorities granted to me by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Accordingly, starting on June 10, 2019, the United States will impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods imported from Mexico. If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed.
If the crisis persists, however, the Tariffs will be raised to 10 percent on July 1, 2019. Similarly, if Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on August 1, 2019, to 20 percent on September 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on October 1, 2019.
Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory. Workers who come to our country through the legal admissions process, including those working on farms, ranches, and in other businesses, will be allowed easy passage. The 5 percent threshold seems essentially arbitrary, as is the sweeping demand that Mexico put an end to illegal immigration to the U.S. Since the barometer for success is up to Trump’s “sole discretion and judgment,” who knows how this ends. Surreally, the proposed move comes as U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is trying to get updates to the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress. Earlier in the evening, Trump tweeted out a video that purported to show undocumented immigrants crossing the border. Yesterday, Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever: 1,036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am. Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border! pic.twitter.com/6K1rIUzorM"
Raptors prove beating the Warriors is easy (if you make every clutch shot and play insane defense).,slate.com,Elliot Hannon,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/toronto-raptors-golden-state-warriors-nba-finals-game-1-defense-clutch-shots.html,"Kevin Durant’s “Very Divisive Mikey”: a Rallying Cry for Anyone Who’s Been Left Out of Something Fun The Toronto Raptors deployed a novel game plan Thursday night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Golden Warrior Gods of Basketball—have lots of players who play awesome defense! It seems simple enough: Force the other team into scoring fewer points than your team. But against the Warriors, the best defensive intentions often get derailed from 30 feet—over and over again. The Raptors, loaded with long, mobile defenders, managed to strong-arm the Warriors into missing shots and fumbling through their offense with stifling perimeter defense. Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry also took, like, nine charges. The result: The Warriors were never really able to get very Warrior-y. And when they did look like they were about to start getting rolling, the Raptors came up with clutch shot after clutch shot down the stretch to stay just out of reach. The 118–109 win was the first Finals win for the Raptors franchise that is appearing in its first NBA Finals. If the Raptors were going to win this series—are going to win this series—they had to win Game 1 at home. They managed to clear that first hurdle. And thank goodness, the Warriors have only lost a single game in their last two Finals appearances against the Cavs. The NBA needed this. I needed this. A loss would have been a real dagger, as the Warriors, without Kevin Durant, are a less good team than the Warriors are with the best player in the league. Spotting the Warriors an MVP and a series lead makes it almost impossible to turn around a series, unless you’re LeBron James. Speaking of which, this is the first NBA Finals in eight years where a LeBron-led team isn’t representing the East. The best news for the Raptors? They managed to hold on for the win Thursday without Kawhi Leonard making buzzer-beater miracles come true. Without Leonard at his best, forward Pascal Siakam was basically unguardable, going for 32 points on 14-of-17 shooting. Siakam, who at one point had made 11 shots in a row, also threw in seven rebounds and five assists on the night to lift the Raptors. Not to mention with footy skills like this, you can see why the third-year Cameroonian forward might be hard to beat to the basket. — Major League Soccer (@MLS) December 8, 2017 The real takeaway here is: G l! Now that we’ve awakened the sleeping Drake-themed Canadian giant to our north, Raptors in 7?"

What the Fate of Two Democratic Attempts at Health Care Reform Tells Us About the Future of Fixing Insurance,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/health-care-reform-connecticut-washington.html,"I Can No Longer “Perform” in Bed Once I Start Caring About Someone. What’s Wrong With Me? Since 2016, the conversation about health care on the left has focused on big, sweeping reforms. On the internet, you either support “Medicare for All” or you’re a neoliberal sellout. On the campaign trail, presidential candidates are talking about ideas that were once considered too radical to pass Congress, like a public option, as prudent compromises. Two news stories out of Washington and Connecticut this month are a reminder that, back in the real world, eking out even incremental progress on health care is very, very difficult. In both states, Democratic lawmakers sought to create what might be called sorta public options—government-designed health plans that private insurers would sell to individuals and small businesses. In Washington, the effort succeeded, but only after politicians made a major tweak to appease hospitals that will make the coverage more expensive. In Connecticut, meanwhile, the attempt flamed out in an episode that may foreshadow just how hard large insurers will fight even small-bore attempts at reform. Let’s start on the West Coast. On May 13, Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that will let residents in Washington buy a state health plan called Cascade Care, starting in 2021. Under the program, the government will craft the benefits package, then contract with private insurers to sell it. Inslee, who is making a dark horse bid for the White House, has touted Cascade Care as the country’s first “public option.” That’s stretching things a bit; when experts use that term, they usually mean a health plan where the government is responsible for both setting benefits and covering the cost of claims. Washington won’t do the latter—the private insurers will take on all the financial risk and reap the profits—and the state isn’t offering any subsidies beyond what the Affordable Care Act provides (though the law requires the state to study the possibility of doing so in the future). Insurance companies won’t be required to offer Cascade Care either, and providers won’t be forced to accept it. If that sounds like a tentative step into the world of government-backed insurance, well, that’s because it is. “We wanted to try and develop something that we could do within current law and would not require some major outlay from the state, because we don’t have that kind of money,” Jason McGill, a health policy adviser to Inslee, told me. The near-term hope, McGill explained to me, is that if the state works with carriers to offer a standard, low-cost health plan, hospitals will feel obligated to accept it. But because Democrats didn’t want to force hospitals to accept the new insurance plan, they had to make other concessions as well. Originally, lawmakers had wanted the program to save more money by limiting Cascade Care’s payments to providers at exactly the Medicare rate. That triggered “a lot of pushback” from the medical community, Mary Clogston, a senior policy aide for the state’s House Democratic Caucus, told me. There were concerns that unless they raised the cap, no hospitals would accept the insurance in some parts of the state, or other providers would try to make up for the low payments by charging more to patients who get coverage from their employer. In the end, legislators settled on payments that were moderately lower than the rates private insurers currently offer providers in the state but more than what Medicare pays. The goal is to offer coverage up to 10 percent cheaper than other options on the state’s Obamacare exchange, but that’s not a guarantee, and it won’t change the insurance market overnight. “Cutting costs is hard,” Clogston said. Whatever Cascade Care’s limitations might be, the new law is still a victory for health reformers who would like to see a larger role for government in offering coverage. In Connecticut this week, the reformers were less lucky. There, one of the nation’s largest insurers scuttled a proposal to create a public option similar to Washington’s, which had been supported by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont and the state’s Democratic legislators. Exactly what happened in Connecticut is a bit murky. One of the public option’s key proponents, state Comptroller Kevin Lembo, declared the proposal dead on Wednesday afternoon in an interview with the Hartford Courant and blamed Cigna CEO David Cordani for killing it. According to Lembo, Cordani had said that if lawmakers went ahead with the bill, his company would release a letter threatening to move its headquarters out of the state. A Cigna spokesman denied that claim and told the Courantthat the carrier had only lobbied against the bill, not issued a threat. But Connecticut state Sen. Matt Lesser, another supporter of the legislation, told me Cigna had in fact made the same threat to him during a phone call. “It’s just sort of stunning to me,” he said. What makes this incident especially shocking is that even though Cigna is based in Connecticut, the company doesn’t sell any coverage on the state’s individual or small group markets. In other words, its business would have been totally unaffected by the bill. The company simply seemed to be opposed to any additional government role in the private market. “They had nothing at stake except the principle of the thing,” Lesser told me. “The idea that the state would get involved in market-setting seemed like a step on the road to socialism.” According to Lesser, other insurers in Connecticut were interested in negotiating details of the new public option, rather than derailing it entirely. But Cigna’s decision to, in his telling, squash the effort by using its heft as a major employer in the state shows that at least one of the country’s biggest carriers is willing to take a militant stand against anything that even resembles public health insurance. It’s not clear if the company could be as effective at intimidating politicians outside of Connecticut, where insurance is a key local industry. But Cordani, Cigna’s CEO, also chairs the board of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the sector’s top lobbying group. His views on these issues will likely carry plenty of weight whenever health care reform pops up again on Capitol Hill. We should all expect the fight to be brutal. "
This Week in Brexit: How Do You Solve a Problem Like Nigel Farage?,slate.com,Joshua Keating,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/brexit-farage-johnson-trump-may.html,"The Worst Smears and Falsehoods in William Barr’s CBS Interview Remember how on Game of Thrones, one episode would be a massive battle with dragons and carnage and major characters dying, then the next week’s episode would just be characters walking around amid the carnage, spouting exposition and getting in position for future plotlines? This week in Brexit was like the second kind. This week’s aftermath: Britons voted in EU elections on May 23, shortly before Prime Minister Theresa May announced her resignation, but the results weren’t announced until Sunday, and they were just as bad for the country’s two main political parties as everyone expected. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party came in first place with 31.6 percent of the vote. Labour came in third behind the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives came in fifth behind the Greens. But as dramatic as this result was, it doesn’t provide all that much clarity about the way forward for Brexit or who should replace May as prime minister. The strong showing for Farage shows that Leave voters are fed up with the government’s failure to deliver Brexit, and it has bolstered the chances of pro-Brexit prime minister candidates like Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab. But that doesn’t mean it’s a majority view in the country. The parties with a staunchly pro-Remain platform—the Liberal Democrats, the Greens, the Scottish National Party, and the newly formed Change U.K.—actually combined for more votes than the staunchly pro-Brexit parties. So, the country is divided and polarized, but we knew that already. This week in Labour: Labour may have lost votes to parties that were openly advocating a second referendum, but party leader Jeremy Corbyn isn’t backing off his ambiguous stance on the issue, saying this week during a visit to Ireland that Labour still wants to negotiate a better Brexit deal and that a new referendum is “some way off.” This also suggests that if there were a referendum, Labour might campaign for a soft withdrawal from the EU—if one can be negotiated—rather than staying in the union. There are fears that a firm pro-Remain stance could permanently alienate traditionally Labour, working-class areas of the country that voted Leave. Meanwhile, Labour’s anti-Semitism controversies continued with the punishment of a Corbyn ally, Pete Willsman, who was suspended from the party’s National Executive Committee after saying the Israeli Embassy was likely behind the anti-Semitism allegations that have roiled the party. This week in Boris: Former Foreign Secretary and London Mayor Boris Johnson, the current favorite in the contest to succeed May as prime minister, was ordered to appear in court this week for a hearing on allegations that he lied to the public during the original Brexit campaign. In the lead-up to the 2016 referendum, Johnson campaigned on a bus emblazoned with the message, “We send the EU £350m a week: Let’s fund our NHS instead.” The 350-million-pound figure was a major part of the Leave message but also wasn’t true . Next week in Trump: The American president will be visiting the U.K. from June 3 to 5, and the itinerary includes “lunch with Queen Elizabeth, tea with heir Prince Charles, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and a tour of Westminster Abbey.” Trump’s main policy aim for the trip is to discourage the U.K. from allowing controversial Chinese telecoms firm Huawei to have a role in building its 5G network. But he’s also already waded into British politics. When asked before his departure if he would be meeting with Farage and Johnson, Trump replied, “I may. Nigel Farage is a friend of mine, Boris is a friend of mine, they’re two very good guys, very interesting people.” Farage was an unlikely campaign surrogate for Trump during the 2016 election, even appearing on his behalf at a rally in Mississippi . Trump once suggested he could be U.K. ambassador to the U.S.—an idea that wasn’t met with much enthusiasm in London. Trump has said in the past that he believes Johnson would make a good prime minister, an implicit dig at May. Trump has suggested on several occasions that he could have negotiated a better Brexit deal than May, and reportedly once told her she should sue the EU . This is likely to be May and Trump’s last meeting as prime minister and president, and Trump doesn’t seem likely to make things pleasant for her on her way out. Days until next deadline: 154."
Supreme Court makes it easier for police to arrest you for filming them.,slate.com,Brian Frazelle,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/supreme-court-nieves-police-abuse-case.html,"Why Do Children Keep Dying in U.S. Custody? Maybe Because Nobody Is Holding CBP Accountable. The First Amendment makes it unconstitutional for government officials to retaliate against you because they dislike your speech. At the same time, federal law gives you the right to sue state officials for compensation if they violate constitutional rights such as your right to free speech. But on Tuesday, the Supreme Court invented a rule that will often allow police officers to arrest people in retaliation for disfavored speech without liability. By enabling police officers to target viewpoints they dislike with near impunity, the decision could be catastrophic for protesters and the press. The justices, meanwhile, didn’t even try to ground their decision in the text or history of the statute they were interpreting. Instead, the court was surprisingly frank about its rationale: The justices simply don’t want police officers to have to defend themselves in court against these types of allegations. In Nieves v. Bartlett , a divided court ruled that individuals can’t sue police officers for retaliatory arrest if those officers had probable cause to arrest them for any crime, no matter how minor—and that’s true even if the real reason for the arrest was speech the officers didn’t like. In other words, if you are jaywalking in violation of a local ordinance, officers can arrest you without fear of liability even if they’re making the arrest only because you’re participating in a Black Lives Matter demonstration or wearing a “Make America Great Again” cap. Because local laws are full of minor infractions, like “ loitering ,” that are frequently violated without incident, police will often have a pretext to arrest people engaged in speech the officers don’t like. By immunizing such abuse, Nieves may have devastating effects on demonstrators, press photographers, and anyone who wants to exercise their speech rights in public, like the right to film the police or verbally challenge officer misconduct. The power to arrest is a potent tool for suppressing speech because even if charges are later dropped, arrestees must undergo the ordeal—and dangers—of being booked and jailed, and they may have to disclose the arrest on future job and housing applications, among other ramifications. Congress long ago recognized that making officers financially liable is the most effective way to deter such misconduct. And that’s why a federal law called Section 1983 enables lawsuits against state officers for violating constitutional rights. This landmark statute was enacted during Reconstruction when Southern states were refusing to respect basic liberties. As one congressman said, the federal government could not directly compel these states to fall in line, but it could “deal with the offenders” by giving “the injured party … an original action in our Federal courts.” Section 1983 therefore authorizes suits for violations of “any rights” that are “secured by the Constitution.” The Nieves decision takes a red pen to the statute Congress wrote, based on some justices’ fear that police actions taken “during a legitimate arrest could land an officer in years of litigation.” That objection, though, was already made in the proper forum—Congress—when it debated and passed Section 1983 many years ago. Opponents claimed that “this bill … puts in jeopardy the officers of the States, though in the conscientious discharge of their duties” and would lead to “vexatious, expensive, and protracted litigation.” Those objections failed in the political process. Stepping into Congress’ role nearly a century and a half later, the Roberts court revived them. There is no evidence that Congress wanted the statute to be interpreted like this. Things were clearly headed in this direction during oral argument last fall, where the justices’ questions suggested that they viewed the case as an opportunity to decide what rules would be best for society. Justice Stephen Breyer made no secret of the fact that he was looking for a “compromise” that would sacrifice some First Amendment rights to limit the number of lawsuits against the police. For an hour, the justices debated the merits of various approaches like legislators crafting a bill. Missing was any substantial discussion of the meaning of the First Amendment or the text and history of Section 1983. In response, the plaintiff’s counsel had to remind the justices of a truism they have often repeated: If a law produces socially undesirable results, it’s the job of Congress—not the court—to amend that law. This prompted a stunning but revealing question from Chief Justice John Roberts: “What law is Congress supposed to change?” Amid all the policy debate, it seemed the chief had completely forgotten this case was about interpreting a federal statute. Unfortunately, six months of reflection since that argument didn’t change things. So how did the court attempt to justify the new rule it announced? First, it relied on an earlier decision that imposed a similar rule for retaliatory prosecutions. But that earlier case involved federal , not state, officers, and thus had nothing to do with the statute the court was supposed to be interpreting in Nieves . Crucially, since a 1971 case found a right to sue federal officials for constitutional violations, the Roberts court has been chipping away at the ability to seek damages from federal officers . Its justification for that erosion of federal liability? Congress, not the courts, should decide when officials can be sued for compensation. Got that? When Congress has not authorized lawsuits against officials, it’s wrong for the Supreme Court to supplant Congress’ role by allowing such lawsuits. But when Congress has authorized lawsuits, it’s fine for the court to cut back on what Congress has authorized if the justices don’t like the implications. Second, the justices in Nieves drew a convoluted comparison between First Amendment claims for retaliatory arrest and personal injury torts that are designed to compensate people for unauthorized imprisonment. To win on those tort claims, you have to show there was no probable cause to arrest you. Ergo, the court said, the same should be true for a First Amendment claim. There is no evidence that Congress wanted the statute to be interpreted like this. As my organization, the Constitutional Accountability Center, explained in an amicus brief , Section 1983 was meant to vindicate the unique rights protected by the federal Constitution—like free speech—not the very different rights protected by state tort law. Justice Neil Gorsuch, to his credit, was having none of this, insisting in dissent that there is “no legitimate basis for engrafting a no-probable-cause requirement onto a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim.” Adopting a central point of our amicus brief, Gorsuch explained that “a First Amendment retaliatory arrest claim serves a different purpose” than claims based on a lack of legal authority to arrest and that “that purpose does not depend on the presence or absence of probable cause.” The only silver lining in all this is that the court did create an exception to its harsh new rule. Even if police have probable cause to arrest, a plaintiff can still prevail by showing that the police “typically exercise their discretion” not to make arrests in similar circumstances. It’s unclear how this vague exception will be applied by the lower courts and whether it will have enough teeth to prevent cops from feeling free to operate with impunity. Gorsuch expressed optimism that the exception would be read broadly and “commonsensically” in future cases. Let’s hope he’s right. Support our journalism

Stephen Miller’s Racism Might Cause a Recession,slate.com,Jordan Weissmann,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/trump-mexico-tariffs-stephen-miller.html,"Pastor David Platt Prayed for Trump While Trying Super Hard Not to Sound Like a Trump Supporter Nobody is happy about Donald Trump’s new threat to slap tariffs on Mexico unless it clamps down on migrants crossing the border. Well, almost nobody. Investors? They’re panicking. Stocks are down . So are treasury yields, which is a sign that folks are worried and fleeing to safe assets. Mexico? What do you think? Republicans in Congress? Senate Finance Chair Chuck Grassley says the move is a “misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent.” The business lobby? It’s peeved . Trump’s own advisers? Some of them are reportedly furious. Specifically, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a free trader, and U.S. Trade Rep. Robert Lighthizer, known for his protectionist streak, are both apparently opposed. So who’s pleased? Presumably Stephen Miller, the spiritual keeper of this administration’s anti-immigrant flame. Like many of the Trump administration’s worst ideas, CNBC reports this Mexico one belonged to him. He apparently sprang the plan while Vice President Mike Pence was traveling and Larry Kudlow, the White House’s top economic adviser and another free trade advocate, was busy having surgery . It seems the adults went away for the week and Miller decided to throw a xenophobic rager that might sink the economy. Up until very recently, I haven’t been too worried about the effect of Trump’s trade war on growth. Yes, his tariffs on China are a rather large tax on American businesses and consumers. But they’ve only slowed the economy a bit so far. Beijing’s retaliation has made life complicated for farmers, but they’re getting bailed out. Now, though, I’m starting to feel anxious. Trump announced that on June 10, he plans to place a 5 percent tariff on all Mexican goods and leave it there “until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP.” According to the White House, the rate will rise to 10 percent by July 1 “if the crisis persists”—whatever the heck that means—then keep ratcheting up to 25 percent, unless the border situation is somehow resolved to the administration’s liking. This could all be extremely disruptive to the U.S. economy—especially the auto industry, which relies on the ability to move cars and parts seamlessly and tariff-free back and forth across the southern border. Forget the cost of avocados and tomatoes: Trump is basically threatening to throw a bomb at GM and Ford’s North American supply chains. It’s not clear he sees that as a bad thing. Some have wondered if this is just a bit of bluster; migration through Mexico tends to tail off in the summer, so it’s possible that Trump could make his tariff threat then declare victory based on that seasonal decline. But Trump also really seems to like imposing tariffs just for the sake of imposing tariffs, and while this move might risk blowing up the new version of NAFTA he negotiated, that deal was already stalling in Congress, so he might not be overly worried about that. Meanwhile, the president is tweeting about companies leaving Mexico. In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2019 It’s not just the Mexico tariffs themselves that have me worried, though. It’s the cumulative effect of everything Trump is up to at the moment, and his timing. He’s already placed 25 percent tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and as both sides of that conflict have dug in, he’s threatened to do the same on the remaining $300 billion of the country’s U.S. exports. Growth in U.S. business investment, meanwhile, was weak during the first quarter, and the U.S. Treasury yield curve was already inverted , which reliably tends to happen prior to a recession, and at least signals that investors are feeling pessimistic about growth. Oil prices have been taking a hit thanks to fears about global growth and demand, which, while good for drivers, could lead to further cutbacks on business investment by U.S. drillers. It’s not hard to imagine us hitting a tipping point soon. Trump places his tariffs on our third largest trading partner, markets freak further, executives dial back their plans for investment—after all, nobody knows what the heck the global supply chain is going to look like—the auto industry staggers, and under the weight of it all, growth grinds to a crawl. I’m not saying everything will necessarily go down that way. But I am saying the administration is on the verge of taking all the steps necessary to sabotage its own economy, all to keep desperate central American migrants from trying to claim asylum. Stephen Miller’s racism might just cause a recession. Support our journalism
