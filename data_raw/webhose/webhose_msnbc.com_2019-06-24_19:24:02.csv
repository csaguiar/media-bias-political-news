Evan Vucci Trump admin finds loophole to advance Saudi arms sale 05/28/19 11:20 AM By Steve Benen Yemen’s brutal civil war has caused a staggering humanitarian catastrophe. As we’ve discussed , the crisis is complex – civil wars, especially in the Middle East, usually are – though it’s clear that Saudi Arabia’s intervention in the conflict has exacerbated the nightmarish conditions.
The United States is not a detached observer. We have, after all, extended considerable military support to our partners in Riyadh, which in turn has helped fuel the Saudis’ campaign in Yemen.
In recent months, the U.S. Congress has effectively said, “Enough.” In a historic use of the War Powers Resolution, both the Democratic-led House and Republican-led Senate voted to end American involvement in the war in Yemen, defying Donald Trump’s wishes.
That was last month. This month, the Trump administration decided to move forward with an arms sale worth roughly $8 billion for Saudi Arabia and its allies in the United Arab Emirates.
The Trump administration on Friday cited a national security “emergency” allegedly caused by Iran to bypass Congress and rush through arms sales worth billions of dollars to Saudi Arabia and other Middle East allies, in a move that drew condemnation from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
Citing a rarely used provision of arms control law, the administration informed lawmakers it was declaring a national security emergency, allowing it to go ahead with the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan without congressional approval, according to administration letters sent to senators and obtained by NBC News.
In a tweet published late on Friday afternoon – ahead of a holiday weekend – Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complained that the administration didn’t have a choice. “We presented some of these sales almost 18 months ago to Congress,” the Kansas Republican argued , “but it has failed to act.”
That’s one way to look at it. The other way is to acknowledge the qualitative difference between lawmakers “failing to act” on a Trump administration request and lawmakers putting a hold on a request because they’re uncomfortable with it .
Pompeo added in his notification to Capitol Hill that the sale is legal, despite Congress’ wishes, because “an emergency exists” due to “the malign influence of the government of Iran throughout the Middle East region.”
Of course, there’s little evidence pointing to an actual Iran-related emergency, and there’s nothing stopping Saudi Arabia from using these weapons in Yemen.
In theory, this would be around the time that Congress – made up of Republicans who were convinced Barack Obama was a dictatorial tyrant who had no use for the legislative branch of government – makes its dissatisfaction known.
Indeed, it comes on the heels of a related Trump effort to spend taxpayer money on a border barrier against lawmakers’ wishes (an effort that suffered a major legal setback on Friday night).
Where are the GOP lawmakers whose outrage over executive overreach seemed to magically disappear in January 2017?

Why Republican tactics on disaster relief funding matter | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-29-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/why-republican-tactics-disaster-relief-funding-matter,"By Steve Benen Congress’ pending disaster-relief package – traditionally the sort of thing that passed easily – was stuck for months because of Donald Trump. The president had some specific demands related to border funding and excluding aid for Puerto Rico ; Democrats balked; and so the bill languished.
Last week, however, the clouds parted. Trump caved ; the Senate passed the legislation with overwhelming bipartisan support; and communities affected by recent natural disasters suddenly felt some hope, knowing relief was on the way.
There was, however, a small problem. By the time the president dropped his objections, much of the House had already left town for the chamber’s Memorial Day break. To pass the bill and get the aid to Americans who need it, the House would need to use a procedure known as “unanimous consent.”
And the trouble with this approach is that it allows just one member to derail important legislation, which is precisely what’s happened .
For the second time in less than a week, the House on Tuesday failed to pass the Senate-approved $19 billion bill providing disaster aid funding to parts of the United States hit by hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes and wildfires after a Republican lawmaker objected.
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., objected to a request to pass the measure by unanimous consent during a pro forma session.
The bill would’ve passed late last week, but Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) blocked it. It would’ve passed yesterday, but Massie blocked it. Democratic leaders will try again tomorrow, but some individual Republican is likely to delay the process again. [ Update : on Thursday afternoon, another GOP House member blocked the legislation .]
If so, Democratic leaders will take up the bill next week when the Memorial Day break ends and lawmakers return to their usual work schedule. Republicans won’t be able to derail the bill at that point, because it’ll pass on a majority-rule vote.
All of which suggests a handful of GOP members are engaging in a stunt for the sake of engaging in a stunt.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked in a statement. “How many more communities need to suffer before Republicans end their political games?”
Even some Republicans seemed annoyed by the antics. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga), who’s up for re-election next year, chastised Massie’s move yesterday, calling it an example of a politician “putting their own self-interest ahead of the national interest.”
The practical implications of these delays matter: there are Americans in many communities that need these relief funds. They were asked to wait, needlessly, because of Trump’s pointless tactics, and now they’re being asked to wait some more because of a handful of House Republicans want to play purposeless games.
What’s more, the road ahead appears discouraging. Disaster-relief packages are becoming much harder to pass just as the climate crisis makes the need more acute .

Trump wanted his physician to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. He tapped his personal bankruptcy lawyer to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Trump’s former golf caddy became the White House social media director. Trump’s former bodyguard oversaw “Oval Office operations.” The president even considered his pilot to lead the FAA.
And then, of course, there’s Lynne Patton, a Trump family “event planner” who organized Eric Trump’s wedding, whom Trump tapped for a senior position at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, helping oversee federal housing policy for New York and New Jersey.
Patton has proven to be controversial for a variety of reasons , though last week the HUD official made headlines for an entirely new reason. Her boss, Secretary Ben Carson, had just embarrassed himself during congressional testimony, reminding everyone how little he knows about housing policy.
Patton apparently thought it’d be a good idea to defend him .
Defending Carson from his post-gaffe criticism, Patton retweeted a message that praised the HUD director and made a joke at the expense of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
She then posted on Facebook on May 22 that her comment “may be a Hatch violation. It may not be. Either way, I honestly don’t care anymore.”
“I honestly don’t care anymore” is one of those unfortunate sentences that captures a much larger problem.
In context, Patton’s reference to “a Hatch violation” refers to the Hatch Act, a nearly century-old ethics law that prohibits nearly all federal employees from engaging in political activities. It’s a law that some officials close to this president have already been accused of breaking .
And while I’ll leave it to experts to assess whether Patton crossed any legal lines, my principal concern is her indifference. The senior HUD official, by her own estimation, realizes there’s a law limiting her political activities, but she no longer cares whether her actions are permissible.
“I honestly don’t care anymore,” she said.
I can appreciate why the Hatch Act may seem obscure and perhaps trivial. Those who break it are not felons, and violators are not subject to prison sentences. When compared to some of the other offenses Donald Trump and his team have been accused of, it’s easy to see an ethics law like this one as unimportant – the practical equivalent of political jaywalking.
But my concern is less about the Hatch Act itself and more about the conditions that allow powerful federal officials to publicly declare their indifference to legal limits.
Donald Trump has already indicated that, in some cases, he believes following the law is optional . The more that sentiment spreads to others in his administration, the larger the scope of the problem.

Congressional report: GOP tax cuts didn't fuel economic growth | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-29-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-report-gop-tax-cuts-didnt-fuel-economic-growth,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined by, from left, Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and Rep. Kristi Noem, R-S.D., smiles as they unveil the GOP's tax overhaul, Nov. 2, 2017. J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congressional report: GOP tax cuts didn’t fuel economic growth 05/29/19 10:03 AM  Updated 05/29/19 01:36 PM By Steve Benen For many Republicans, it’s simply assumed that the party’s tax breaks are responsible for the nation’s economic health. That’s not, however, what the non-partisan Congressional Research Service found in its latest report – which Democrats have been eagerly touting for a reason.
“In 2018, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.9%, about the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO’s) projected rate published in 2017 before the tax cut. On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy. Although growth rates cannot indicate the tax cut’s effects on GDP, they tend to rule out very large effects particularly in the short run.”
As a Washington Post analysis of the report noted, the CRS – basically, Congress’ in-house think tank – didn’t do the Republican Party’s talking points any favors. The data showed the GOP’s tax plan didn’t pay for itself, didn’t make much of a difference on American workers’ wages, and didn’t boost domestic capital investment.
The tax policy did, however, deliver a massive break to big corporations, which didn’t amount to much for those businesses’ employees.
All of which brings us back to a familiar point : did any of the Republican predictions surrounding their tax cuts prove to be correct?
Let’s see, there were promises about the plan paying for itself. And promises about how politically popular the policy would be with voters. And promises about the flood of new capital investments Americans could expect to see.
And assurances that corporate tax breaks wouldn’t go toward stock buybacks.
A year and a half later, pretty much everything Democrats said about the Republican policy has proven to be true .

"Amash's primary rival hasn't read the Mueller report, either | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-29-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/amashs-primary-rival-hasnt-read-the-mueller-report-either,"By Steve Benen Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/28/19, 9:00 PM ET Republican calls for impeachment after reading Mueller report Rachel Maddow reports on how actually reading Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia report convinced Republican congressman Justin Amash of the need to impeach Donald Trump, and to speak out about his conclusions despite considerable blowback from Trump and his share tweet email save Embed One of the most important aspects of Rep. Justin Amash’s (R-Mich.) support for Donald Trump’s impeachment is also the most basic: the Republican congressman read Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report , saw the scope of the president’s wrongdoing, and drew a fairly obvious conclusion based on the document’s findings.
For his trouble, Amash has been slammed by his party and its leaders, abandoned by donors, and confronted with intra-party rivals who are eager to challenge him in a 2020 primary.
The Washington Post reported yesterday on one of the Republicans who hopes to replace Amash on Capitol Hill.
Two Republicans have filed to run against him in the primary; one of them, state Rep. Jim Lower, told The Washington Post that he raised $60,000 since Amash’s impeachment tweets. The wealthy DeVos family, a force in western Michigan and supporters of Amash’s previous campaigns, said through a spokesman last week that they would support another Republican for the 3rd Congressional District seat; Lower said he’d been in touch with the family.
In an interview, Lower said he had not read Mueller’s report but agreed with the assessment of most Republicans that it ended questions about Trump’s conduct.
It’s that last part that stands out for me.
The Republican state representative hasn’t read the Mueller report, but he’s confident that Trump’s partisan allies must be right about the document’s findings.
That’s problematic, of course, not just because it’s evidence of laziness, but also because some of the White House’s allied Republicans – the ones Amash’s rival is counting on to assess the document for him – haven’t read the Mueller report, either.
Indeed, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recently conceded during a congressional hearing that he hadn’t gotten around to reading the report, despite his official responsibilities.
Donald Trump, who’s never expressed much of an interest in the written word, also conceded last month that he hadn’t read the Mueller report, either.
Now state Rep. Jim Lower wants to run against Justin Amash in a GOP primary because of Amash’s assessment of the Mueller report, which Lower is certain is wrong, despite not having read the document himself.
There’s obviously a deep partisan divide when it comes to gauging the president’s alleged misdeeds, but what if the fight over Trump’s fate is less about party and more about those who’ve bothered to read the Mueller report and those who haven’t?

* The Democratic National Committee has announced new threshold standards for presidential contenders who wish to compete in the third debate, scheduled to air on ABC in September. By that point, the party expects participants to “register at least 2 percent in four major polls conducted this summer and receive donations from at least 130,000 individual donors, including at least 400 in 20 states.”
* A fascinating catch from the Wall Street Journal : “The majority of senior aides and advisers on the top-tier Democratic presidential campaigns are women, and roughly a quarter identified as women of color.”
* Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) unveiled a plan yesterday for a Reproductive Rights Act that would be shaped like the Voting Rights Act: states with a history of restrictions on reproductive rights would need to get Justice Department approval before implementing new abortion laws.
* In his first policy address since launching his national campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden (D) yesterday unveiled his education plan . It includes, among other things, a provision on universal pre-K.
* Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) is unveiling a new immigration plan today, which includes a call for comprehensive immigration reform in his first 100 days.
* Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is rolling out a new proposal today intended to give workers a greater ownership stake in their private employers.
* As disgraced former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (R) inches closer to another U.S. Senate campaign in Alabama, Donald Trump is pleading with him not to run . In a pair of tweets this morning, the president said he has nothing against Moore, but Trump believes the right-wing Alabaman, who lost a Senate race in 2017, “probably won’t” and “cannot” win.
* And as Rachel noted on the show last night, Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), another presidential hopeful, has begun talking about his experiences with PTSD after his combat deployments in Iraq. As part of the same message, the Massachusetts Democrat unveiled a plan yesterday to expand access to mental health services for veterans.

But before exiting the public stage, Mueller took several minutes to emphasize a handful of points he seemed eager for the public to know.
Close video The Rachel Maddow Show, 5/28/19, 9:00 PM ET Republican calls for impeachment after reading Mueller report Rachel Maddow reports on how actually reading Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia report convinced Republican congressman Justin Amash of the need to impeach Donald Trump, and to speak out about his conclusions despite considerable blowback from Trump and his share tweet email save Embed That, in and of itself, was no small development – and not just because Americans never heard the special counsel utter a public word during his lengthy investigation. Mueller had the option of simply issuing a written statement announcing his departure. He also could’ve delivered perfunctory remarks, thanking his team and professional staff, before walking away.
But he didn’t. Mueller carefully chose some key areas of interest for the public to better understand. That makes his choices that much more important.
He began by emphasizing a point that Donald Trump has repeatedly denied.
“As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers, who were part of the Russian military, launched a concerted attack on our political system.”
He added that obstruction of justice is a serious matter.
“When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of the government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.”
Mueller soon after addressed the investigation into obstruction of justice, highlighting the fact that he and his team did not exonerate the president.
“As set forth in our report, after that investigation, if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that.”
He then made it abundantly clear that Trump wasn’t charged, not because he’s innocent, but because the special counsel’s office lacked the legal authority to indict him.
“We did not … make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime. The introduction to volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing Department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office…. The Special Counsel’s Office is part of the Department of Justice and, by regulation, it was bound by that Department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”
He added soon after that, according to the DOJ, “[T]he Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”
It sure did seem as if Mueller was saying Trump could have – and perhaps would have – been charged if he weren’t a sitting president.
If you’ve read the Mueller report, none of these individual assertions stood out as new – because they weren’t. On the contrary, they were familiar because we’ve read them in the redacted document.
But that doesn’t make them unimportant. There is, for example, a qualitative difference between reading findings on the page and hearing a special counsel declare them on camera for the American public.
More important, though, is the fact that Mueller specifically framed the evidence in a way that told us exactly what he considers important.
And in this case, what Mueller considers important is the fact that Russia attacked our elections; obstruction of justice is a serious crime; Trump hasn’t been cleared; and Trump wasn’t indicted because he can’t be indicted while in office.
As for the road ahead, there’s been considerable interest in recent weeks in Mueller’s possible congressional testimony, but he added this morning that he does not want or expect that to happen:
“I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak about this matter. I am making that decision myself – no one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.
“There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself.
“The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.”
Whether lawmakers find this satisfactory remains to be seen, though the subtext of his remarks wasn’t altogether subtle: Mueller’s done and he expects Congress to take it from here.

The point, by all appearances, was for Barr to give a pre-spin on then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report shortly before its release. The Republican A.G. argued at the time:
“[T]he Special Counsel’s report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations. In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign ‘collusion’ with the Russian government’s hacking.”
And while I don’t doubt that the White House was pleased with Barr’s characterization of the Mueller report, consider Mueller’s own words this morning:
“[T]here was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.”
I don’t mean to sound picky, but there’s a world of difference between “no evidence” and “insufficient evidence to charge.”
If this were the only evidence of Mueller contradicting Bill Barr, it’d hardly be worth mentioning, but it’s actually the start of a long list.
In the attorney general’s initial non-summary summary to congressional leaders, for example, Barr wrote, “The Special Counsel considered whether to evaluate the conduct under Department standards governing prosecution and declination decisions but ultimately determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment.”
This morning, Mueller seemed to reject this assertion, too, telling the public that he felt bound by Justice Department guidelines: “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”
There are plenty of related examples. Jon Chait noted , for example, that a reporter asked Barr last month if Mueller was leaving it up to Congress to consider possible actions against the president. “Special Counsel Mueller did not indicate that his purpose was to leave the decision to Congress,” the attorney general replied. “I hope that was not his view, since we don’t convene grand juries and conduct criminal investigations for that purpose.”
And yet, there was Mueller this morning, hinting without much subtlety that Congress was the next appropriate venue: “The [Justice Department’s OLC opinion] says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”
TPM’s Allegra Kirkland highlighted some related examples, noting, “In congressional testimony, public letters, and press conferences over the past months, Mueller and Barr have offered strikingly different characterizations of the 488-page report summarizing the Russia probe.”
And for the attorney general, that’s a problem. There was already ample evidence that Barr’s public characterizations of the special counsel’s findings were deceptive ; now we have additional breaks between the AG’s assessments and Mueller’s own words.
Bill Barr, painfully eager to do the White House’s bidding, already had a credibility problem. This morning, Mueller has made it worse.

* Historic tornado outbreak : “Since May 17, 225 tornadoes have been confirmed in an outbreak sequence that has been tormenting the country.

* Andrew Miller : “A former aide to Trump confidant Roger Stone has agreed to testify this week before a grand jury initially used in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, his attorney said Wednesday.”
* I’m glad to see some follow-up on this : “The Navy says it is reviewing whether service members violated Defense Department policy or regulations by wearing a uniform patch with the words ‘Make Aircrews Great Again’ during President Donald Trump’s visit to their ship in Japan.”
* Scott Lloyd , “whose nearly two-year tenure leading the Department of Health and Human Services refugee office sparked lawsuits and congressional inquiries, will leave the Trump administration next week, HHS announced Wednesday.”

* TPM reports that some of those Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) follows on Twitter are “out-and-out white nationalists.” Perhaps he should take a moment to explain why.

Former GOP senator: party's posture on scandals untenable | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-30-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/former-gop-senator-partys-posture-trump-scandals-untenable,"By Steve Benen William Cohen had a rather extraordinary political career. He was first elected to Congress in 1972 as a moderate Maine Republican, and he soon after found himself on the House Judiciary Committee during the Watergate impeachment inquiry. He later served nearly two decades in the U.S. Senate, before becoming secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration.
Yesterday, Cohen wrote a piece for the Washington Post on his party’s posture toward Donald Trump’s scandals, which he clearly sees as unacceptable.
With the exception thus far of Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Republicans have taken the position that Mueller’s redacted report has resolved all issues of alleged presidential collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice. Case closed.
This is not a tenable position. The Mueller report has raised nearly as many questions as it has answered.
Cohen’s op-ed offered some useful historical context, explaining in some detail that while many Americans were uncomfortable with the idea of impeaching Richard Nixon, public attitudes shifted as the facts came to light.
At the same time, Cohen added, six Republicans om the committee “felt compelled to place loyalty to the rule of law above our political affiliation and political futures.”
He went on to write , “The silence of Republicans today in the face of presidential behavior that is unacceptable by any reasonable standard is both striking and deeply disappointing.” He added that Republican members privately “express their disdain” about Trump, but they’re too afraid to “speak out publicly even in the face of behavior they would find intolerable by any previous occupant of the Oval Office.”
Cohen didn’t literally endorse impeaching the president, but he came awfully close: “Congress should not turn away from the central issue of whether Trump has, in word and deed, engaged in conduct that is fundamentally inconsistent with, and antithetical to, the highest office in the land. If Congress cannot secure the cooperation of executive branch officials in the exercise of its oversight responsibilities, it will have no choice but to enter the temple and remove the fabled sword.”
The Maine Republican joins a very small club of current or former GOP lawmakers who’ve made the case that Trump may have crossed the line into impeachable misconduct.
The Washington Post piece, incidentally, was also published in the Bangor Daily News in Cohen’s home state of Maine, which I mention for one reason: it means Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and many of her constituents likely saw it.
Indeed, it’s worth noting for context that Cohen was a mentor to Collins, who succeeded him in the Senate.
He certainly didn’t single out Collins in his piece, but Cohen nevertheless called on congressional Republicans to step up and take the allegations against the president seriously. Will Collins answer that call?

"In the Trump administration, liquefied natural gas becomes 'freedom gas' | MSNBC",www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-30-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/the-trump-administration-liquefied-natural-gas-becomes-freedom-gas,"By Steve Benen The Trump administration has dabbled in Orwellian language from time to time , but the New York Times reports today on a rather dramatic new example.
According to the Department of Energy, the next critical export from the United States is made from “molecules of U.S. Freedom.”
You may wonder, what are these molecules?
The technical answer is liquefied natural gas. Or, if you are in charge of energy policy for the Trump administration, “freedom gas.”
The trouble started a few weeks ago, during an event in Brussels. Energy Secretary Rick Perry announced plans to double U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which the Texas Republican foolishly compared to U.S. efforts to liberate the continent during World War II.
“The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent,” Perry said.
With this in mind, a European reporter asked the American cabinet secretary whether the liquefied natural gas should be described as “freedom gas.” Perry replied, “I think you may be correct in your observation.”
For some, it was a lighthearted exchange. For Trump administration officials, it was a rebranding opportunity.
In fact, earlier this week, E&E News’ Ellen Gilmer flagged a press release from Perry’s Energy Department on a seemingly boring topic: the administration authorizing additional liquefied natural gas exports from the Freeport LNG Terminal in Texas. It included, however, an official quote from Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes:
“Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.”
That’s right, “ freedom gas .”
The same statement quoted Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world.”
Look, it’s entirely possible that some folks at the Department of Energy are having a little fun and they’re not serious about rebranding fossil fuels with silly references to “freedom.”
But in this administration, the lines between farce, accidental farce, and deliberate Orwellian schemes are often so blurred, it’s difficult to know what to think.

Trump still thinks the courts can prevent impeachment (they can't) | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,05-30-2019,2019,5,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-still-thinks-the-courts-can-prevent-impeachment-they-cant,"By Steve Benen About a month ago, Donald Trump tried to address the Mueller report by falsely claiming it “didn’t lay a glove on me.” The president quickly added , however, “If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court.”
That didn’t make any sense, though the Republican doesn’t seem to realize that. Consider this exchange between the president and a reporter this morning during a brief Q&A on the White House South Lawn:
Q: Do you think they’re going to impeach you? Do you think they’re …
TRUMP: I don’t see how. They can, because they’re possibly allowed, although I can’t imagine the courts allowing it. I’ve never gotten into it. I never thought that would even be possible to be using that word. To me, it’s a dirty word, the word ‘impeach.’ It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word and it had nothing to do with me.
The president’s etymological feelings notwithstanding, if he thinks “the courts” can block a congressional impeachment process, Trump is likely to be disappointed.
Right off the bat, it’s worth noting that the president, among his many scandals, has been credibly accused of criminal obstruction of justice. Why he thinks federal judges might deem this insufficient grounds for presidential impeachment is unclear.
But even putting that aside, Trump’s assertions are a civics failure, too. As we discussed in April, Congress is responsible for initiating, overseeing, and executing the impeachment process. Lawmakers, and no one else, determine whether a president has committed impeachable acts.
It’s not up to the judiciary to allow or forbid the legislative branch from exercising its legal authority.
When Trump is in a jam, he looks for a fixer. Indeed, he’s spent much of his presidency assuming that everyone from his attorney general to his congressional allies to his White House counsel can simply make his problems go away for him. Now, evidently, he’s making similar assumptions about the courts.
I’m curious as to why. Is the amateur president simply confused again? Is there someone at the White House giving him strange advice? Did Trump hear something along these lines from conservative media?
Whatever the explanation, if Trump plans to sue to make sure impeachment doesn’t happen, he should probably start working on a Plan B.

* Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) yesterday signed into law a measure “allowing any previously incarcerated person to have the right to vote restored upon release from prison.” The new policy will reportedly re-enfranchise for up to 77,000 people.
* Former Vice President Joe Biden (D) was in Texas yesterday, where he picked an endorsement from Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D). With two other Texas Democrats in the presidential race – Julian Castro and Beto O’Rourke – this is a bit of a coup for Biden.
* Following Robert Mueller’s public remarks yesterday, a growing number of Democratic presidential hopefuls have endorsed initiating an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. Yesterday, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) added their names to the list. (For the record, if impeachment proceedings were to begin, second-tier presidential candidates might find it more difficult to break through in the race for the nomination.)
* With the DNC poised to impose tougher standards to participate in the party’s third and fourth presidential debates, only eight candidates – Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O’Rourke, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker – are currently positioned to make the cut. That may change, of course, as the process unfolds.
* Despite his controversy over lying to police about assaulting a journalist, Rep. Greg Gianforte (R) is gearing up to run for governor in Montana next year. It will be his second attempt: Gianforte lost by four points to incumbent Gov. Steve Bullock (D) in 2016.
* Trump argued yesterday that disgraced former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore (R) shouldn’t run for the U.S. Senate in Alabama next year because he can’t win. Moore explained yesterday why he disagrees.
* And the “Trump Make America Great Again Committee,” a joint fundraising effort from the Trump campaign and the RNC, launched an online ad campaign this week asking supporters for their input on the “Official Secure The Border Survey.” The accompanying image showed the Trump administration planning to build a border wall across much of the Gulf of Mexico .
