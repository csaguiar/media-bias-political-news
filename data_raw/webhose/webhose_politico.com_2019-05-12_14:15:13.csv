Geno Yes, it sounds great. But I'm still not seeing specifics on what the total cost will be or how it will be funded. Sanders has proposed taxes on employees, employers, wealthy people, and banks. But he hasn't offered anything on the total cost. I'm not opposed to it, but I can't blindly embrace it, either. There needs to be a specific plan, with dollar amounts attached, to present to the public."

The stress is immense to cover costs since insurance companies pay in 2019 about 1/3 of what they paid for the same procedures in 1989. You have to push more patients through, creating shorter visits and the inevitable malpractice mistakes, as well as increased waiting room time for busy and now disgruntled patients. And paying a small army of assistants $18 an hour to spend an hour on the phone with an IC trying to get you paid $18 isn't sustainable."

Getty Images Law And Order What Will Really Matter in the Mueller Report The public will be looking for salacious details on collusion. But the most important legal questions all have to do with obstruction. By RENATO MARIOTTI Continue to article content
Renato Mariotti is the Legal Affairs Columnist for POLITICO Magazine. He is a former federal prosecutor and host of the “ On Topic ” podcast.
After years of waiting, we will finally get to read the Mueller report—or at least as much of it as Attorney General William Barr is willing to let the American public read. The redacted version of the report may tell us more about Barr than it tells us about President Donald Trump, and the document is sure to shape the legacy of both men. A few key pieces of the report will speak volumes.
Anyone suspicious of the president will no doubt be scanning madly through the 400-page document searching for embarrassing details to support theories that Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the 2016 election. But there might be less than they’re hoping for. Story Continued Below
Why not —and what is likely to be the crux of the report?I wouldn’t expect Barr to reveal anything additional related to Roger Stone’s efforts to coordinate with Wikileaks, given Stone’s pending criminal matter. You can also expect Barr to aggressively redact material that is classified or could jeopardize ongoing criminal or counterintelligence investigations. And if something juicy does emerge related to the infamous Trump Tower meeting, for example, or former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s delivery of internal polling data to alleged Russian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik, these facts will matter more in the court of public opinion than in a court of law, given the sizable gap between publicly reported facts and the high bar needed to prove a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.
As a former federal prosecutor who has been following Mueller’s work closely,my attention will immediately focus on one specific aspect of the report:Mueller’s explanation of why he declined to “make a traditional prosecutorial judgment” regarding obstruction of justice. This is the part of the report that could have the most immediate public consequences, since it bears most directlyon the offense that could cause Democrats to seriously push for impeachment.
The most questionable decision Barr has made so far during his short stint as attorney general has been his rush to reach a conclusion regarding obstruction, even though Mueller indicated there was evidence on both sides and that while his report “does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Mueller showed considerable humility and restraint in declining to “make a traditional prosecutorial judgment,” but Barr exercised poor judgment in making that decision in Mueller’s stead, knowing that his decision would be perceived as partisan.
Barr’s legacy will be forever defined by that decision if the report indicates, contrary to what Barr suggested, that Mueller intended to leave the obstruction decision to Congress or the American people. In that scenario, congressional Democrats are sure to distrust Barr’s redactions, will push even harder to see the full report and could take a harder look at obstruction of justice.
Regardless of what Mueller intended to do, his description of what Barr described as “difficult issues of law and fact,” particularly issues of fact, will also be extraordinarily consequential. To many, myself included, Trump’s public actions established that he obstructed justice. Obviously, Mueller knew much more than we know publicly.
So what gave Mueller pause?
To answer that question, it helps to look at the available evidence from the standpoint of the defense, something any experienced prosecutor would do when building a case. In other words, look hardest at the exculpatory evidence—the evidence in this case most potentially favorable to Trump—to see how strong it is.
One potential factual issue in the obstruction investigation would be a defense by Trump that he had a genuine belief that the Russia investigation was meritless. To be guilty of obstruction, Trump had to have a “corrupt intent” when he undertook actions that undermined the investigation. What if Trump truly believed that the investigation was meritless and a waste of governmental resources? It’s possible that there could be evidence that Trump was aware of facts central to Mueller’s “collusion” investigation and had good reason not to believe a crime had been committed.
If Trump’s lawyers could make a compelling argument that his actions were motivated by a genuine belief that the Russia investigation was meritless, that would cut against a finding that he had a “corrupt intent.” One potential monkey wrench is that Trump allegedly asked former FBI Director James Comey to “let go” of the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. But Flynn pleaded guilty to a felony. Nonetheless, this issue could explain Barr’s reliance on Mueller’s conclusion that he could not prove conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.
A related but more challenging factual issue is that it is hard to determine what Trump actually believes or intends at any given time. Any lawyer representing Trump in a criminal proceeding could be expected to mount some variant of a “Trump being Trump” defense, arguing that his words and actions are inexplicable and random rather than evidence of a plot to do anything criminal. For example, witnesses could have told Mueller that they routinely ignored potentially illegal orders from the president in other contexts because they know he is prone to exaggeration and they didn’t take his statements seriously. In that case, Trump’s own well-documented unpredictability could work to his advantage.
Another potential factual issue that might emerge from the report would be the advice of former White House counsel Don McGahn regarding the firing of James Comey. McGahn reportedly gave Trump a marked-up copy of a letter that Trump aide Stephen Miller drafted at Trump’s direction offering an unvarnished view of Trump’s thinking regarding the firing of Comey. If Mueller’s investigators found that McGahn had counseled Trump not to fire Comey but did not alert the president to any potential criminal consequences, then Trump could argue that he had sought advice from an attorney and did not believe he was obstructing justice because his attorney did not raise the issue. Much will depend on the precise wording of answers to very precisely worded questions.
In the end, the most important part of the report could be what isn’t revealed to the public. Despite Barr’s stated commitment to transparency, we have yet to see a full sentence from the report, and Barr’s redactions are sure to be criticized and questioned.
There is no legitimate reason for Barr to continue to refuse to provide the full, unredacted Mueller report to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. After all, the Constitution gives the “the sole Power of Impeachment” to the House of Representatives, and the House Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over impeachment.
Barr no doubt realizes this and could be trying to bait congressional Democrats to publicly take the position that they need the report to consider impeachment, which Speaker Nancy Pelosi is reluctant to do. Nadler has thus far refused to issue a subpoena for the report, but it appears that he will eventually have no choice.
If the redacted report reveals disturbing new details regarding obstruction of justice, or indicates that Mueller did not intend to leave the decision in Barr’s hands, Nadler and other Democrats could feel more comfortable suggesting that they need to consider impeachment. Barr’s credibility would take a hit, something a court would consider if he does not back off his bizarre refusal to produce the full report to Congress. "

Pfizer hires Jeff Miller,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/04/12/pfizer-hires-jeff-miller-424439,"With David Beavers and Daniel Lippman PFIZER HIRES JEFF MILLER: Miller Strategies has signed four new clients, including Pfizer . Jeff Miller , a Republican fundraiser and former adviser to Energy Secretary Rick Perry during Perry’s presidential campaign in 2016, and Ashley Gunn , a former aide in President Donald Trump ’s White House, will lobby on drug pricing, among other issues, as the Trump administration weighs ideas to cut prescription drug prices. Pfizer has gone on a hiring spree in recent months, adding Empire Consulting Group and the Raben Group to the formidable number of Washington lobbying firms it keeps on retainer.
— Pfizer isn’t the only pharmaceutical company adding lobbying firepower. Teva Pharmaceuticals has hired a team of five lobbyists at Polsinelli . And Gilead Sciences has added the Duberstein Group after hiring the Nickles Group ; Tarplin, Downs & Young ; and W Strategies earlier this year.
MORE NEW BUSINESS: Microsoft has hired former Rep. Ben Quayle (R-Ariz.) and two other lobbyists at HHQ Ventures to lobby on immigration reform and a variety of other issues, according to a disclosure filing. A team of lobbyists at McGuireWoods Consulting have registered to lobby for a new coalition, the Global Alliance for Cannabis Commerce . It’s at least the third cannabis coalition to set up shop in recent months, along with the National Cannabis Roundtable and the Cannabis Trade Federation , each of which have their own lobbying firms. McGuireWoods declined to provide further details.
— And Cermar Investments LLC has hired former Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) and Geoff Verhoff of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld to lobby on an expropriation settlement with the Honduran government. Oscar Cerna , an American businessman, has retained other lobbyists in recent years, including former Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.) of Hogan Lovells and former Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) of the Livingston Group , to help persuade the Honduran government to reach a settlement on his claim that the government illegally expropriated his cement factory there in 2004. It’s Ros-Lehtinen’s first lobbying registration since she left Congress and joined Akin Gump earlier this year.
PATTEN WON’T GO TO PRISON FOR FARA VIOLATION: “A Washington political consultant who helped a Ukrainian oligarch illegally purchase tickets to President Donald Trump’s inauguration escaped jail time from a federal judge Friday in a case stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller ’s probe,” POLITICO ’s Josh Gerstein and Darren Samuelsohn report. The sentence of three years probation, 500 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine for W. Samuel Patten , 47, is the most lenient thus far in a case related to Mueller’s investigation. Patten pleaded guilty last October to a single felony count of violating the Foreign Agent Registration Act for failing to register for his work in the U.S. on behalf of Ukraine’s Opposition Bloc and a prominent oligarch who bankrolled that political party.” Full story .
CRAIG’S INDICTMENT REVERBERATES ON K STREET: “The Justice Department’s indictment of Gregory Craig , who served as White House counsel under President Barack Obama , on Thursday sent a clear signal to K Street that lobbyists who work for foreign interests without registering have reason to be afraid,” POLITICO ’s Theodoric Meyer reports. “Some Washington lobbyists have been on edge since [special counsel Robert ] Mueller indicted Paul Manafort , President Donald Trump ’s former campaign chairman, in 2017 on charges of violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, previously a rarely enforced law requiring lobbyists and others who work on behalf of foreign governments and political parties to disclose their activity to the Justice Department.”
— “Though Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election has concluded, the Justice Department last month signaled its willingness to continue prosecuting potential violations of foreign lobbying law by tapping Brandon Van Grack , a former prosecutor on Mueller’s team, to head its FARA unit.” … A letter from the “unit now ‘has to be taken as seriously as a heart attack,’ said Matthew Sanderson , a lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale who advises clients on the law.” Full story .
FIRST LOBBYIST DISCLOSES CONVICTION DUE TO JACK ACT REQUIREMENTS: POLITICO ’s David Beavers spotted the first report disclosing a prior conviction under the newly enacted Justice Against Corruption on K Street Act — or JACK Act, in a nod to Jack Abramoff . Lawrence J. Smith , a Florida lobbyist, disclosed his conviction of two counts of tax evasion in 1993 on his first quarter report for his client, the city of Pembroke Pines, Fla. Smith did not respond to a request for comment.
ASIAN AMERICAN REPUBLICAN INAUGURAL BALL BROUGHT IN UNDISCLOSED CASH: The Asian Pacific American Presidential Inaugural Gala “drew more than 900 people who paid at least $75 per ticket and a handful of sponsors who shelled out much more” the night before President Donald Trump ’s inauguration in 2017, The Palm Beach Post ’s Lulu Ramadan reports. “But there’s no trace of the money raised that night, as required by law, The Palm Beach Post has found. That includes donations by their biggest listed sponsors. Among them: an embattled Saipan-based casino later raided by the FBI, a Guam-based shipyard and a handful of Pacific Island hotel operators, all of which benefited from a foreign labor bill signed into law by Trump a year later.”
— “Raising the political stakes further, one of the events four chief organizers, onetime Trump campaign aide Jason Osborne , followed up the event by lobbying for the labor bill to help the Northern Mariana Islands, home to the Saipan casino.” (Osborne is now a lobbyist at Turnberry Solutions , which Corey Lewandowski and former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke joined earlier this year.)
— “One man in charge of raising money for the event told The Post that the host, the National Committee of Asian American Republicans , collected between $5,000 and $15,000 each from up to 20 listed sponsors. It also took in hundreds of smaller contributions. As a registered political committee, such contributions must, by law, be reported to the Federal Election Commission. But none were. The committee’s executive director, Boca Raton tech entrepreneur Zhonggang ‘Cliff’ Li , told The Post that he knows where the money went, ‘but I don’t want to tell you.’” Full story .
LOBBYING IN TRUMP’S WASHINGTON ‘NO EASIER THAN UNDER PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS’: The Economist has turned its venerable eyes to K Street and finds that “advancing corporate interests in [President Donald ] Trump ’s Washington is no easier than under previous presidents. In some ways, it has got harder.” The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , for instance, “has successfully championed massive corporate-tax cuts but failed to dissuade the president from imposing tariffs and curbing immigration. Big Pharma, which had managed to raise drug prices regardless of which party controlled the White House, is being pressed by Mr Trump to lower them.” Full story .
URANIUM FIGHT HEADS TO THE WHITE HOUSE: “A melee between U.S. uranium miners and nuclear power plant owners over the impact of cheap uranium imports is headed to the White House, which will decide whether to impose new trade barriers that utilities fear could squeeze their struggling reactors,” POLITICO ’s Darius Dixon reports. “Two mining companies, Ur-Energy USA and Energy Fuels Resources , have contended that the imports are pushing U.S. uranium production to the brink of collapse, potentially creating a national security risk that would undermine the military. The firms have asked the Trump administration to impose a quota requiring that 25 percent of domestic uranium consumption be met by U.S. producers — a tenfold boost in their market share compared to 2017.” Full story .

Court paves way for FEC to reveal anonymous $1.7 million super PAC donor,www.politico.com,MAGGIE SEVERNS,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/12/court-paves-way-for-fec-to-reveal-anonymous-17-million-super-pac-donor-1273473,"Campaigns Court paves way for FEC to reveal anonymous $1.7 million super PAC donor The case involves a donation to a super PAC in 2012 that was routed through a LLC and a conservative advocacy group. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
An anonymous individual who secretly funneled $1.7 million to a super PAC in 2012 will soon be revealed after a lengthy legal fight — if a new appeals court decision in Washington is not put off for further review by the court.
The person’s identity has remained a secret for years as the Federal Election Commission investigated a complaint into how the money was routed through intermediaries to a Missouri-based super PAC, Now or Never PAC. The group spent close to $8 million promoting GOP candidates in the 2012 election, including Missouri Republican Senate nominee Todd Akin. Story Continued Below
Now or Never PAC is supposed to reveal its donors regularly under federal law but never disclosed the original source of the funds, instead filing a disclosure that showed a $1.7 million contribution from the American Conservative Union, the organizers of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.
But ACU was at least one step removed from the original donor. While investigating a complaint from the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, the FEC found the money had originally come from a donor and been routed through a Delaware-based LLC, and then the American Conservative Union, on its way to Now or Never PAC.

The FEC reached an agreement in with ACU in 2017 over its role in moving the donation and the ACU paid the FEC a $350,000 fine. But some parties refused to cooperate with the FEC in the case, Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said in a statement released in late 2017, making it difficult for the FEC to find the original source of the funds.
The slow-moving case has been a major one for transparency advocates including Weintraub and CREW, who see public information about big-money political donors as a fundamental anti-corruption resource. Super PACs are supposed to disclose their donors and are not allowed to use pass-through organizations, called “straw donors,” to obscure their identities.
Two judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia joined an opinion stating the plaintiffs — a trust and a trustee named as “John Doe 1” and “John Doe 2” in the case — should be named by the FEC. One judge dissented. It is not entirely clear whether “John Doe 1 or “John Doe 2” are the original donor, or whether they, too, were pass-throughs for the $1.7 million contribution.
The plaintiffs argued that the FEC did not have the authority under federal election law to disclose their name as it released information on its investigation into what happened at Now or Never PAC. But Circuit Court Judge A. Raymond Randolph rejected that argument on the grounds that the court has in the past recognized “deterring future violations and promoting Commission accountability may well justify releasing more information than the minimum disclosures required by” law.
And the plaintiffs did not make enough of a case that revealing their identity would harm their First Amendment right to participate in campaign giving without experiencing harm, Randolph said.
The plaintiffs “did not allege that they would be subject to threats or reprisals,” wrote Randolph, who wrote the opinion of the court. “They did claim that disclosing their identity would ‘chill’ them from engaging in political activity. But this does not distinguish them from others who make campaign contributions.”
Weintraub, who now chairs the FEC, said in a tweet on Friday that she plans to release the names of the donors “as soon as we know this decision won’t be reviewed.”"

Would the Founders Have Freaked Out About Amazon’s D.C ...,www.politico.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/13/would-the-founders-have-freaked-out-about-amazons-dc-headquarters-226653,"Walk down a busy street in Washington during the week and you could run into a number of powerful people—but only certain types of powerful people. The powerful in Washington have earned that status mostly by what they have done for, with or against the federal government. And as much as Washington is defined by having big government in town, it has also been defined by not having big business in town. If you want to run into the titans of finance, go to New York City. If you want to run into the masters of technology, go to Silicon Valley. If you want to run into the giants of the entertainment industry, head to Los Angeles. This geographic separation of Big Business from Big Government is not a bug—it’s a feature of American democracy at its best. The founders knew that democratic government demands a connection between the powerful and the people to survive and thrive—and that different kinds of powerful people need to be separated from each other to keep that connection strong. They designed the United States with this principle in mind—and for much of American history, it has stuck: We have kept our biggest corporations out of our our capital.
But this could be starting to change, and the reason is Amazon. The online retail giant has announced its decision to place a second headquarters, and therefore tens of thousands of high-level business jobs, in the Washington metropolitan area. The move will flood the capital, already crammed with the politically powerful, with economic elites, deepening the bond between the two groups and making it even harder for those outside the bubble of the rich and powerful to be in or influence the federal government.
Many of the founders would have hated the idea of a megacorporation in such close proximity to Congress and the White House—and they would have been worried about what it means for the country. History had taught the founding generation that democracy faltered when economic and political power centers shared the same address.
In today’s environment, it threatens to erode both democracy and Americans’ trust in it. As corporations like Amazon entwine themselves more closely with government—with CEO Jeff Bezos’ new house just a few blocks away from the president’s daughter—America begins to seem even more like a massive conspiracy of the rich and powerful far from where regular citizens live and work.
***
The geographic separation of powers has been at the core of the American democratic vision from the beginning. Many of the founders believed that smaller countries had failed in their democratic experiments because they did not have multiple places among which to distribute power. The powerful had become corrupt because they were too concentrated. London was the most dramatic example at the time. In combining the political elite with the economic elite, London, according to the founders, had become a bubble out of touch with the rest of the country and the colonies. (Notice that the Declaration of Independence singles out the problems with the “distant” British government.)
James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers that part of the promise of the United States was the presence of many types of places and therefore many types of people. The United States would “[e]xtend the sphere” of democratic government over a larger territory, he wrote, and therefore would feature a “greater variety of parties and interests.” There were significant cities in the United States at the time—led by Philadelphia and New York—but no single place contained more than 1 percent of the population. Making one of these cities the permanent capital would combine the new political elite with an existing economic elite, and the American democratic experiment would have been flawed from the beginning thanks to a concentrated, isolated aristocracy.
These concerns were only magnified when the capital was temporarily located in New York City for the first two years after the Constitution came into force. The new president, George Washington, had always been known for his common touch. But two years rubbing elbows with the elite commercial class in New York City led one commentator to remark that Washington had lost touch with the “rabble” that the president needed to understand in order to rule well. The Boston Gazette reported that when the capital was in a dominant commercial city like New York City it created a “vortex of folly and dissipation” because of how it focused the new federal officials on private business there instead of on the people’s business everywhere.
This is a major reason why Washington, D.C., was chosen as the seat of government—a central location that wasn’t too close to any existing economic power center. (Back then, it took several days of travel to reach New York City from D.C.) Washington was also just 56 miles from the mean center of the U.S. population and 95 miles from the geographical center of the country at the time .
So deep was the commitment to the separation of political and economic power that many states then and now have replicated this commitment, choosing not to place their state capitals in the economic centers of the state. The major state capitals have largely been in places like Albany, Sacramento, and Tallahassee, not in New York City, San Francisco or Miami.
This quality has also distinguished the United States from many other similar democracies. Movements like the Yellow Vest protesters in France, for instance, have a bigger and easier target to attack because the country’s economic and political power is concentrated in Paris. Brexit was very much a revolt against London’s overwhelming concentration of both economic and political power. When Occupy Wall Street took on the concentration of economic power in New York City, though, they were doing so more than 200 miles from where our current president wanted to drain the swamp.
Separating out the places of the political and business elite matters for the same reasons it always mattered. We are still shaped much more by those across the street from us than across the country from us, and placing Big Business across the street from Big Government all but guarantees that its interests would align even more closely. There is plenty of research to assume this will happen. Our neighbors across the street are still more effective than strangers across the country are in shaping what issues we care about , and how we think about those issues .
Of course, Washington has always paid attention to business and money, a trend that was accelerating long before HQ2 announced its arrival. Approximately 80 percent of money spent on lobbying is money spent by business . Between 90 and 95 percent of the 100 organizations that spend the most on lobbying represent business .
The voices speaking for business in Washington, though, have usually been hired hands—political players lobbying for plutocrats elsewhere, not the plutocrats speaking for themselves from Washington. Amazon has already been increasing its presence in town, but largely by hiring the local political elite—starting with Jay Carney, President Barack Obama’s press secretary, who now oversees the company’s public policy and public affairs operation out of D.C..

Julian Assange Might Have Already Won By Jack Shafer
It’s true that Big Business is already present in Washington— there are 15 Fortune 500 companies in the area —but these are firms that survive and thrive on obtaining contracts from the federal government. In other words, they’re here because their main customer is here. This is dangerous in its own way, but in the end, these CEOs are depending on Washington and the government for their success.
Amazon, on the other hand, is different. Amazon is a multinational e-commerce and cloud computing giant that has huge influence on the lives of individuals totally outside government and effectively represents its own power base.
Amazon says it will bring only 25,000 jobs to the D.C. area, but this understates the quantity and quality of its eventual Washington influence. It will take more than 25,000 people to support those 25,000 Amazon workers. These Amazon positions will be higher-level jobs , the kind that make Amazon officials part of the same powerful Washington networks as the higher-level political elite. And several other big companies have said that if all goes well for Amazon in Washington, they are likely to follow soon and substantially.
Once that starts to happen, corporations like Amazon won’t have to rely on the political elite to do their lobbying for them. The top Amazon officials living and working in Washington can themselves talk to the senator or staffer at the annual dinner for the schools they send their children to, or at the coffee shop in the neighborhoods that they will increasingly share.
Washington, D.C. is taking a victory lap right now, after having won Amazon. The city no doubt thinks now it’s a new kind of leading metropolis—the center of government as well as an economic center. But Washington doesn’t realize that in becoming both, it is undermining the very democracy it stands for."

AP/PYONGYANG: “Kim open to another summit with Trump, with conditions”: “North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he is open to a third summit with President Donald Trump, but set the year’s end as a deadline for Washington to offer mutually acceptable terms for an agreement to salvage the high-stakes nuclear diplomacy, the North’s state-run media said Saturday. …
“‘We of course place importance on resolving problems through dialogue and negotiations. But U.S.-style dialogue of unilaterally pushing its demands doesn’t fit us, and we have no interest in it,’ Kim said during the speech.
“According to the Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, Kim blamed the collapse of his summit with Trump in February on what he described as unilateral demands by the United States, which he said raised questions over whether Washington has genuine willingness to improve relations. But Kim said his personal relationship with Trump remains good and that they could exchange letters at ‘any time.’” AP

NEXT UP … ROCHESTER (MINN.) POST BULLETIN: “President Trump to visit facility owned by Rochester man,” by Jeff Kiger in Burnsville: “A Rochester business owner will be hosting a high-profile visitor from Washington, D.C., at his Burnsville facility on Tax Day. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Nuss Truck and Equipment in Burnsville on Monday. The company is owned by Bob Nuss. Nuss and his company, which has eight Minnesota locations, are based in Rochester. …
“With a nod to the date that tax filings are due, the president is expected ‘to tout the success of the American economy under his pro-growth policies, including the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,’ according to information released from the White House.” Post Bulletin
ROSENSTEIN ON THE MUELLER REPORT … BLOOMBERG’S JENNIFER JACOBS (@JenniferJJacobs): “Rod Rosenstein at private lunch [on Friday] at Metropolitan Club said don’t forget what Mueller probe was about: cyber crimes. When it comes out, lot of what we see will deal with *that*; it’ll clear up questions about Russian election interference, he said, people in room told me.”
THE PRESIDENT, at 8:21 a.m.: “Why should Radical Left Democrats in Congress have a right to retry and examine the $35,000,000 (two years in the making) No Collusion Mueller Report, when the crime committed was by Crooked Hillary, the DNC and Dirty Cops? Attorney General Barr will make the decision!”
-- BECAUSE Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and can decide whatever it wants with or without the president’s approval.

JAKE spoke with BOB COSTA about “The Hill to Die On” on Washington Week Extra. 10-minute conversation
CNN'S JAKE TAPPER’S SCOOP: “Trump told CBP head he’d pardon him if he were sent to jail for violating immigration law”: “President Donald Trump told Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan he would grant McAleenan a pardon if he were sent to jail for having border agents block asylum seekers from entering the US in defiance of U.S. law, senior administration officials tell CNN.
“Trump reportedly made the comment during a visit to the border at Calexico, California, a week ago. It was not clear if the comment was a joke. Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he ‘would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying U.S. entry to migrants,’ as one of the officials paraphrased.” CNN
-- TED HESSON, “Trump immigration shakeup lowers DHS morale”: “Morale at the Department of Homeland Security has long ranked lowest among federal agencies. President Donald Trump’s purge of top homeland security officials is making it worse. Workers, from entry-level staffers to managers, have begun sending around their resumes, desperate to exit a leaderless workplace where they expect soon be ordered to implement legally questionable policies pushed by the White House. Some are even willing to take pay cuts.” POLITICO
WHITE HOUSE NOTEBOOK (per NANCY COOK) …
-- TREASURY: Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s chief-of-staff Eli Miller left the department late last week, praising the agency’s “unique and special team” in his goodbye email to staff. For now, the chief-of-staff slot is going to remain vacant but two longtime Treasury staffers, John Baylor and Zac McEntee, will take over parts of Miller’s portfolio and are being promoted to deputy chiefs of staff. Both have worked with Mnuchin since the campaign.
TREASURY IS ALSO PLANNING TO MOVE its well-liked general counsel, Brent McIntosh, into David Malpass’s former role as the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. (Malpass is now the president of the World Bank.) And Monica Crowley remains a top contender for the agency’s key communications slot, spotted at the building late last week.
-- JARED WORLD: As Jared Kushner develops an immigration plan, he’s leaning on an experienced policy team to help him. Soon to be joining the team: attorney George Fishman, according source close to DHS and a White House official. Fishman currently serves as the deputy general counsel at DHS and previously worked on the Hill for the House Judiciary Committee as well as its subcommittees on immigration policy and enforcement and border security.
CNN’S KAITLAN COLLINS: “Former White House aide who mocked McCain as ‘dying anyway’ joining pro-Trump PAC”: “Kelly Sadler, the former White House aide who was let go after she mocked the late Sen. John McCain, is joining the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action to handle communications, CNN has learned. She is expected to start Monday. ... Erin Montgomery, the PAC’s current communications director, is stepping down.” CNN
-- A NUMBER OF TITLE CHANGES and promotions, from the White House. The list … FYI: Dan Scavino’s title has changed. He is now assistant to the president and senior adviser for digital strategy. He was previously assistant to the president and director of social media.
RECESS READING FOR SENATORS … CNN’S ANDREW KACZYNSKI and PAUL LEBLANC: “Trump’s Fed pick Stephen Moore is a self-described ‘radical’ who said he’s not a ‘big believer in democracy’”: “In speeches and radio interviews reviewed by CNN’s KFile, Moore advocated for eliminating the corporate and federal income taxes entirely, calling the 16th Amendment that created the income tax the ‘most evil’ law passed in the 20th century. Moore’s economic worldview envisions a slimmed down government and a rolled back social safety net.
“He has called for eliminating the Departments of Labor, Energy and Commerce, along with the IRS and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. He has questioned the need for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Education. He has said there’s no need for a federal minimum wage, called for privatizing the ‘Ponzi scheme’ of Social Security and said those on government assistance lost their dignity and meaning.” CNN
2020 WATCH -- “Cory Booker, a would-be bachelor president, says Americans are ‘open to lots of different types of families’ in the White House,” by WaPo’s Kevin Sullivan in Newark: “‘My romantic life is evolving, and I’m looking forward to one day having another title: husband and father. I believe both of those are going to happen. And if the American people will it, I’m going to be president of the United States as well.’ For weeks, Booker has been hinting that he has a ‘boo,’ a girlfriend, but on this March day he still hasn’t yet said her name publicly.
“But now, pressed a little bit, he acknowledges what Booker-watchers have long suspected: He’s dating actress Rosario Dawson, who turns 40 in May, a New Yorker who lives in Los Angeles. He says they met at a fundraiser for mutual friend Ben Jealous during Jealous’s unsuccessful 2018 run for governor of Maryland. They didn’t speak much then, but they met up again at a party hosted by another mutual friend, and they started dating just before Thanksgiving.” WaPo
-- MSNBC’S JOY REID will interview Booker at his home in Newark at 10 a.m.
THE INVESTIGATIONS – BEN SCHRECKINGER: “Roger Stone wants to put Assange on the stand”: “Stone hopes to put WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the stand at his upcoming trial for alleged obstruction and witness intimidation, according to a person familiar with the thinking of Stone’s legal team. The prospect of obtaining Assange’s testimony has grown somewhat likelier with his Thursday arrest in London, which paves the way for his possible extradition to the United States. … [F]or the longtime Trump confidant, a connoisseur of political theater, putting the iconic, white-haired hacker on the stand would have the added benefit of producing a pure media spectacle.” POLITICO
-- KYLE CHENEY: “Stone cites Barr, Kavanaugh writings in last-ditch effort to dismiss Mueller indictment”
-- “As Ecuador Harbored Assange, It Was Subjected to Threats and Leaks,” by NYT’s Nicholas Casey and Jo Becker: “The secrets came directly from the phones of President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador: intimate pictures of him and his family on vacation, text messages from his wife, even a photograph of the president himself in a posh bedroom, eating a lobster in bed. The material, published last month on an anonymous website, was particularly embarrassing because Mr. Moreno was in a bruising national fight over his austerity measures.
“But rather than mount a defense, the president played the victim: He blamed WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, had spent the last seven years holed up in the country’s London embassy. WikiLeaks’ actions were ‘despicable,’ said the country’s vice president on television, vowing to take action. The group denied leaking the information, but on Thursday Ecuador made good on its threat — opening the door to British police officers who carted away Mr. Assange.” NYT

SEXUAL HARASSMENT FILES – “Company led by Trump nominee was rife with harassment, including groping and kissing, report says,” by WaPo’s Michael Brice-Saddler: “A federal workplace investigation found rampant sexual harassment and retaliation at AccuWeather, a federal contractor, including groping, touching and kissing of subordinates without consent. AccuWeather’s chief executive at the time of the allegations and investigation, Barry Myers, was tapped by President Trump to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
“The detailed results of the investigation, not previously reported, were compiled last year by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs and obtained by The Washington Post. It determined that AccuWeather, under Myers, fostered a culture ripe for sexual harassment, turned a blind eye to allegations of egregious conduct and retaliated against those who complained. According to the report, the investigation was prompted by a complaint filed Sept. 6, 2016, alleging a ‘hostile work environment and termination based on sexual orientation and sex.’ Many other complaints from AccuWeather employees followed.” WaPo

How Mayor Pete Started to Look Presidential - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/14/pete-buttigieg-2020-226654,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — It was getting dark outside the Currier Museum of Art and the hundreds of people who had come to see Pete Buttigieg were growing restless, maybe even a little testy. They had lined up two hours early, on a Friday night no less, but still they were outside while several hundred luckier fans were inside swilling craft beer and noshing cheese and crackers. Nearly a dozen volunteers circulated clipboards with sign-up sheets to join the campaign while conveying the fire marshal’s edict that the museum was past its capacity of 300. “They’re hot,” I overheard one volunteer warn another. No campaign wants to book a space so large its nascent candidate can’t fill it, but no one wants to tick off potential voters before the candidate has even declared. Into this potentially fraught moment strode the compact, running-fit young mayor of South Bend, Ind., a couple of minutes after the event’s 7:30 p.m. start. Instead of rushing into the museum, Buttigieg did the opposite. He bypassed the insiders to speak to the people in the parking lot. “I heard the way you ingratiate yourself to voters is to stand on things—so I found this park bench here,” he told the overflow crowd, flashing a wry grin. The crowd laughed. It was a subtle, Midwestern-nice jab at Beto O’Rourke’s penchant for climbing on tables and countertops, with an extra touch of ‘the last shall come first’ Christian ethos. And it neatly encapsulated a talent for throwing shade without sounding like a jerk that has turned the 37-year-old into the early surprise of the still-growing field of Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Just a couple of months ago, when he announced his exploratory committee, Buttigieg was a virtual unknown with a puzzling last name and a lane to the presidency that most pundits considered notional at best. His husband, Chasten, not yet a social media phenom, was sometimes mistaken as a staffer on the Iowa hustings. In his first visits to New Hampshire, he could reliably fill somebody’s living room. Today, he’s getting stopped by fans in airports—though they sometimes mistake him for a reporter, he jokes, since he’s on cable news so frequently—and has a dedicated pack of national and international reporters following him, a byproduct of those well-received TV interviews. He passed the 65,000 individual-donors threshold to make the first Democratic debate in June. This week, two polls in New Hampshire and Iowa placed him third behind Bernie Sanders and still-undeclared Joe Biden. Unique among the 2020 field of more than a dozen zero and one-percenter candidates, Buttigieg has vaulted into the pack’s top 10 alongside Cory Booker, O’Rourke, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren. Not only is he outpolling some of them, in the first quarter of 2019 he raised more money than many of them.
And his rocketing profile seems to be coming at an especially helpful moment: On Sunday afternoon, Buttigieg is expected to announce his candidacy for a campaign that is already historic on several fronts. Already, he has positioned himself as both a groundbreaker and traditionalist, a norm-breaker and rule-follower: He’s an openly gay candidate who proclaims the virtues of marriage; the mayor of a midsized Midwestern city and an Afghanistan combat veteran and practicing Episcopalian who is observant enough that he gave up alcohol for Lent.
So how did Buttigieg pull this off?
The answer comes with clues into the nature of the 2020 electorate that might not fit neatly into the progressives-vs.-moderates narrative now preoccupying the media.
“He broke into the top tier because his generation is used to giving money on the internet to advance social causes and candidates they believe in,” Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman who endorsed Buttigieg’s own bid for that position in 2017, told me. “He thinks clearly, is not particularly ideological; open to new ideas. The fact that he is gay and married and running for president is a huge signal to his generation and below that he gets it.”
But he’s also proving adept at picking his targets. In addition to exceeding basement-level expectations for his candidacy, Buttigieg has fashioned a headline-grabbing foil out of his fellow mild-mannered Hoosier Vice President Mike Pence, the former Indiana governor with whom Buttigieg has had a long and not always contentious relationship. Though his critiques aren’t new — he gave me the same critique of Pence nearly two years ago — he has shrewdly challenged Pence by proclaiming his own faith in contrast with the antagonism of evangelical Christians toward homosexuality. “If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,” Buttigieg said recently.
He’s beginning to get attention from the GOP machine, a sure signal that he is no longer considered an absurd long shot. After not mounting any kind of rapid response operation during the CNN town hall, the Indiana GOP churned out emails and tweets this week attacking Buttigieg, calling him “unhinged” (a phrase it began using last August when Buttigieg, pinch hitting for Biden at an Illinois Democratic event, called Trump “a disgraced game show host”) and sending an email with the subject line “Your Vice President is under ATTACK.” Last year, the Republican National Committee gave him a Trump-style nickname: “ Part-Time Peter ,” which may or may not work given that part of his time off from his job was spent serving with the Navy Reserve in in Afghanistan. Some conservatives have even noted how effectively he is separating himself from the Democratic pack. “He worries me from a Republican standpoint,” conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt said on “Meet the Press” last Sunday.
Now, the question facing Buttigieg as his campaign enters a new phase: Can the runner go the distance?
***
“The season for patience has passed,” Buttigieg told those gathered in the room. “At this hour, impatience just might be a virtue.” It was 2010, and Buttigieg—his face a little gaunter back then, his suits a little more ill-fitting—was in the middle of his first campaign for political office: state treasurer. He lost by a 62.4 percent to 37.5 percent margin — to a former geologist who would later lose a U.S. Senate race after saying that a pregnancy from rape is “something God intended.”
Buttigieg, though, never lost that impatience. Friends and critics agree: He has always been a man in a hurry.
He’s a decent runner who posted a 1 hour, 42 minute half-marathon time when he was stationed at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. But it’s the speed with which he hopes to leap from mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city to the White House that made people look askance when he held his news conference in January. Too soon, people said. Give it another two cycles, they said. After all, he could wait until 2032 to run and he still wouldn’t be 50 years old.
He chose not to operate on someone else’s timetable. He did what he had to do to distinguish himself from the crowd of aspiring Trump-slayers. He created an exploratory committee because he actually needed one. And he announced his exploratory committee by video, and later that morning delivering a news conference in Washington, D.C., because he knew that few—if any— national reporters would’ve made the trek to northern Indiana to cover him.
The first question out of everyone’s mouth, of course, was about his experience. Buttigieg came prepared.
“Look, I’ve got more experience in government than the president of the United States,” he said in a Jan. 31 interview on CBS This Morning . “I’ve got more years of executive experience than the vice president. And I have more military experience than anybody behind that desk since George H.W. Bush. It’s not a conventional background, but I don’t think it’s time for a conventional background.”
In Manchester, questions about Buttigieg’s experience became declarations about his future. Buttigieg delivered a five-minute version of his freedom-democracy-security stump speech. He called for “a new vocabulary,” telling supporters that “freedom does not belong to one political party,” that “security is not left or right,” that “we will not be the democracy we claim to be if we tolerate districts where politicians choose their voters and not the other way around.” When he finished, the crowd whooped and hollered: ""Pete! Pete! Pete!"" Someone shouted: ""President Pete!""
A tonal moderate who espouses a progressive program of democratic reforms, the cerebral Buttigieg balances high rhetoric and policy specifics. He talks about cybersecurity but also drops in metacritiques of Trump’s signature campaign slogan: “There is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word ‘again,’” a line he is almost certain to use Sunday when—standing in the Old Studebaker Building 84, once one of the largest car factories in the world and now a technology center—he’ll make his 2020 bid official. “The way he talks about issues is refreshing to a lot of people,” his campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl told me. “It’s not just litmus tests, and platitudes, and what do you want to hear. It's values, and then he goes to ideas, and then he goes to policies.”
There are 10 months until the first primary votes are cast, but last Friday’s event had more of the feel of a general election campaign stop. People had chosen and they weren’t shy about saying so.
Erin Tatum, a 27-year-old writer from Philadelphia, knew who she was voting for before she got in the car for the seven-hour ride north. Tatum talked her mom into making the road trip because she likes Buttigieg’s generational message and his military service. After the event, she and Buttigieg spoke. He stood close to her motorized wheelchair and locked eyes with her. “He’s a respectful man who has lived a principled life,” Tatum, who is bisexual, told me after meeting Buttigieg. “I really felt acknowledged—which as a person with a disability you often don’t—so that was a moment that stood out to me.”
The next day in Concord, I spoke with Mark and Laurie Brown a white married couple from Salem, N.H., who typically vote Democratic and own a screen-printing business. Buttigieg had caught Laurie’s attention when he called for abolishing the Electoral College—one of his signature proposals—on TV. “That was a bold step to take,” she said. When it comes to experience, she told me, “He’ll talk about how senators don’t have any executive experience. He manages more people than most Senate offices. He’s got to multitask and do lots of things. He’s still running South Bend currently while he’s doing this. I don’t think the age is an issue. He’s sort of checked a lot of boxes and he’s appealing to a lot of people. He’s incredibly well-spoken and empathetic.”
“Hats off to anybody who has military experience,” Mark interjected. “It’s something I could never do.”
Laurie is more of the true believer of the two 52-year-olds, Mark told me before Buttigieg arrived. Their son is gay and they appreciated the historic nature of Buttigieg’s candidacy. As Buttigieg delivered his speech, I watched Mark nod his head when Buttigieg talked about the freedom to be able to start a small business. “I would argue that you’re not free to leave your job and start a small business if you’re afraid you won’t have health care,” Buttigieg said.
After the speech, Mark told me that line resonated with him. “You want to see people do well,” he told me. Did Buttigieg convert him? “Yeah. I’m more nervous—or my reservation is—we really want whoever advances to have the country behind them. And I’m just a little nervous about. …” His voice trailed off. “Are people who aren’t in this room or who are down South or different places going to be able to look past his age and stuff like that?”
***
Buttigieg would not have any trouble filling in what “stuff like that” means. His openness about his sexuality has been a boon to raising his profile in the early going, but there are supporters who worry there might be segments of the electorate for whom it has the opposite effect and that it might put a ceiling on his appeal. How he addresses that prejudice could have a huge effect on how far he can push this improbable campaign.
If there is one thing going in his favor, it’s that he seems to have avoided the trap of being pigeonholed. He is making a virtue of not forcing people to choose between progressive and moderate, between wanting to attack the global threat of climate change and wanting to preserve a strong national defense. And yet at some point, people will have to make choices. And so will the candidate: Buttigieg has not alienated Democratic voters by publishing a policy page on his website—a fact several voters at his events in New Hampshire pointed out to me.
In his appeal to New Hampshire voters, almost uniformly white, Buttigieg talked about running the kind of campaign that would unite the country. “Where is it written that a so-called red state, red county, has to be red forever?” Buttigieg asked his audience at a bookstore in Concord. “They didn’t start out Republican, they don’t have to be Republican in the future.”
I’ve talked to Buttigieg about the challenge of being an ambitious Democrat in a red state. I was shadowing him last fall in South Bend before the midterms, when we went for a run along the St. Joseph River, took a driving tour of the city and had beers at Fiddler’s Hearth, the downtown bar where he and Chasten had their first date in September 2015. “I get the wisdom that says that if you do what you have to do to win Democratic primaries, it makes it more difficult to be a statewide candidate in a conservative state,” he told me then. “But I just think from year to year, things change so quickly that you don't want to overthink it. I also don't think you should ever run for an office you don't seek to win.” It was clear to me then that he was mulling the pros and cons of a presidential run given that his opportunities in his home state were so limited. After he spoke in New Hampshire, I asked him again during a media gaggle how he thought he could win in red counties and red states, especially given that he told me last year he had no path to win statewide in Indiana.
“This is not a race that you run by process of elimination,” he replied. “This is about the idea that what the moment calls for just might be somebody like me, and for the same reasons that the first time we got around the polling it [the mayor’s race], I was exactly as popular with Republicans as I was with Democrats back home in South Bend. And I think that it’s possible, even with an unapologetic progressive message, to speak to people on all sides of the aisle.”
He told me he was surprised that he was the first 2020 Democrat to appear on Fox News Sunday . “A lot of people respond powerfully to my message who are not, deep down, ideological. They’re just American. And if we’re not speaking to them, then we’re guaranteed to lose.”
Points earned for entering the lion’s den, but compared with someone like Amy Klobuchar, who won 43 Trump-leaning counties in her 2018 Senate reelection, Buttigieg doesn’t have much of an electoral record bearing out his purple talk. Minnesota has a different political dynamic than Indiana, but St. Joseph County, of which South Bend is the largest city, is a reliably blue island in red Indiana, though it’s becoming less so: In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat there Trump by a mere 0.2 percentage points, winning 47.7 percent of voters to Trump’s 47.5. In a statement on the Saturday before Buttigieg officially announced his bid, the Indiana GOP sent out a statement arguing that the most votes Buttigieg had ever received was 10,991 in the 2011 general election for mayor. “On game day, Notre Dame Stadium draws eight times more fans than votes Pete Buttigieg has ever received in a single successful race for office,” said Indiana GOP Chairman Kyle Hupfer. And yet Buttigieg is betting his nontraditional profile has appeal in the Trump era: To be certain, that’s 10,991 voters more than the current president had ever received before 2016.
In an interview in South Bend a few days before Buttigieg’s New Hampshire swing, Schmuhl, the campaign manager, told me that Buttigieg flipped 3,000 Republican voters during the 2011 mayoral primary. “When Pete runs a race, he often changes frameworks when you think about other candidates or issues,” Schmuhl told me over coffee at Chicory Cafe, a place on the first floor of his Buttigieg’s new campaign headquarters. “The way he talks about issues is refreshing to a lot of people. It’s not just litmus tests, and platitudes, and what do you want to hear. It’s values, and then he goes to ideas, and then he goes to policies.”
Nothing changes the framework of a race like a big fundraising number. The morning before I interviewed Schmuhl, the not-yet-campaign announced that Buttigieg had pulled in an eyebrow-arching $7 million in the first quarter. Not even half of what the seasoned Sanders’ machine had raised, but better than Booker. Better than Warren. Better than Klobuchar.

‘Liz Was a Diehard Conservative’ By Alex Thompson
Later that night, I went to dinner at Fiddler’s Hearth. They were there, sitting in the back corner, at table No. 2. As an eight-piece Irish band played, Buttigieg posed for photos with local well-wishers, celebrating his fundraising total with a few members of his campaign staff under a sign that read “South Bend Wall of Arms.” Hoping for an interview, I asked the bartender to send over a couple of pints of Guinness. Someone else in the restaurant had already tried to do that, she said, but Pete turned down the free beers; he was abstaining from alcohol for Lent. Scrambling, I remembered they had ordered Scotch eggs (a heart-stopping pub staple) on their first date, so I sent over an order. I’m told the Buttigiegs laughed heartily, and the party devoured them, but I didn’t get the interview. The days of nearly unfettered access are over.
The next morning, I toured Buttigieg’s new headquarters: One suite of offices has been named Truman and a second suite has been named Buddy—the names of the Buttigiegs’ Twitter-famous rescue dogs. Flush with cash, the campaign still plans to run lean. The shop has printer-paper signs with Sharpie-scrawled department names like Finance . “We’ve got the resources to grow, and now we got to make sure we continue to have quality people,” Buttigieg told reporters at Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord last Saturday. “We’re always going to work to be a lean and scrappy operation. That’s just our style.”
This has been his style all along, even in that first failed campaign for state treasurer. “We were cheap. We didn’t do yard signs. We were extremely frugal with what we spent money on. Our whole goal was to get on TV,” his then-campaign manager, Jeff Harris, told me. “The more people I knew who would meet Pete, the better I knew he could do. There’s a lot of parallels [with his 2020 campaign]. They’re living off the land.” Indeed, Buttigieg has seemed to have said “yes” to nearly every media and podcast guest request, boosting his name identification in every venue he could get. No opportunity was too small: Once in February, I even sat in on an interview he did with Peter Dunn, a financial planner in Indianapolis who goes by the nickname “Pete the Planner,” in which Buttigieg spent 10 minutes talking about racking up credit card debt and paying off his husband’s student loans.
I asked Dean, who knows what it’s like to experience a rise in the polls similar to Buttigieg’s, what Buttigieg needs to do to keep up his momentum. “He has to go through a grueling process without letting the early success make him too dismissive of other candidates, past and present.”
And what if it all comes crashing down in the second quarter? What if he boots the debate in June, or finishes out of the top three in Iowa next year? Does that mean he should just go home and nurse his wounds over a Scotch egg at the Fiddler’s Hearth? Probably not.
Should Buttigieg fall short of his party’s nomination, he has already positioned himself as an able interrogator of Pence if they should happen to meet in a vice presidential debate next year. “It’s funny because I don’t think the vice president does have a problem with him, but I think it’s helping Pete to get some notoriety by saying that about the vice president,” second lady Karen Pence said on Brian Kilmeade’s Fox News radio show on Tuesday. Pence himself responded to Buttigieg’s remarks Friday, saying in an interview with CNN that the mayor “knows I don't have a problem with him.” He may have a growing rift with Pence, but he doesn’t have a beef with the whole Republican Party. Buttigieg displays photos of himself with former Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels and Republican senator and statesman Dick Lugar in his office—alongside those with Michelle and Barack Obama and former Vice President Joe Biden.
Standing on that park bench back in Manchester—in his campaign uniform of a blue tie and rolled up white dress shirt sleeves beneath an overcoat—Buttigieg wasn’t thinking of the vice presidency. Instead, he began to offer at least the image of a potential commander in chief. “I’m probably not what you pictured when you pictured your next president,” Buttigieg said, self-aware and self-effacing in his Midwestern way.
A few people shouted back: ""You are."""

Inside Trump's hidden life on the golf course,www.politico.com,GABBY ORR,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/14/donald-trump-golf-1273822,"White House Trump's hidden life on the golf course The golf-loving president may be at his most natural and carefree on the links, with an array of politicians, celebrities and family members. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
In June 2017, Bob Corker extended a golf-club shaped olive branch to an angry President Donald Trump.
Corker, then a Tennessee Republican senator, had recently enraged Trump by saying his administration was in a “downward spiral.” Hoping to de-escalate, his aides asked the White House to broker a peacemaking meeting between the men in one of Trump’s most natural habitats: the golf course. Story Continued Below
An outing was soon arranged at Trump’s Northern Virginia course, where the pair were joined on a warm Sunday by the former star NFL quarterback Peyton Manning and Andrew Giuliani, a public liaison assistant at the White House and the son of Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Over an 18-hole, 4½-hour round that featured a clubhouse lunch, Corker and Trump, who sported a red ""Make America Great Again"" hat, chatted amiably until a moment of comic relief: Andrew Giuliani chipped a ball that struck Corker in the neck. Laughing, Trump turned to Giuliani and gestured to some nearby Secret Service agents.
“Thank God you didn’t do that to me — or you’d have two in the chest from these guys!” Trump joked, according to a person familiar with the incident, who said Corker escaped serious injury.
Corker would soon return to feuding bitterly with Trump. But the golf outing had allowed for a brief connection in what aides and associates call Trump’s most relaxed environment. ""You learn a lot about him personally,"" the senator told POLITICO at the time. By ELIANA JOHNSON , DANIEL LIPPMAN and DARREN SAMUELSOHN
By some accounts, Trump — a lifelong golf buff who owns more than a dozen courses — is happiest on the links, which he has hit at least 116 times over his 814 days in office, according to the website TrumpGolfCount . This past week, Trump told reporters that he was looking forward to the annual Masters Tournament in Augusta, Ga., and that his friend Tiger Woods stands a chance of winning. “I think it’s going to be a great Masters. I hope so,” Trump said. (Woods did win and Trump tweeted out congratulations.)
Trump’s golfing has been under scrutiny thanks to the recent publication of a new book that portrays him as a lifelong cheater. But much remains unknown about his golfing as president, in part because the White House has tightly shielded information about Trump’s outings and playing partners. “Sometimes he wants to be able to have a minute without [the press] being in the middle of it,” a senior White House official told POLITICO.
But revealing interviews with more than 10 former and current Trump aides and golf partners suggest that golfing has become an equivalent of Trump’s infamous “executive time,” unscripted hours in which his presidency unfolds in spontaneous conversations, phone calls and occasional policy chats with athletes and celebrities. During one 2017 round with Woods, for instance, Trump asked the golf legend for his thoughts on a tax bill moving through Congress, according to a White House official.
Unlike former President Barack Obama, who almost always played with a tight circle of intimate friends and aides, Trump is happy to play and talk shop with politicians like Corker and several other current and former members of Congress. But he prefers the company of celebrities, professional athletes, the occasional foreign leader and family members, including his rarely spotted youngest son, Barron, and his daughter Ivanka and sons Eric and Don Jr.

Compared with former President Bill Clinton, who rewarded big Democratic donors with time on the links, Trump has refused — much to the chagrin of some aides — to use golf as a fundraising vehicle. One source close to Trump’s campaign said he has resisted his advisers’ efforts to arrange outings with potential 2020 campaign donors. He has, however, held private events with supporters at his golf clubs, such as a dinner at his course in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., during a trip to the state earlier this month.
A secondWhite House official said Trump has golfed with businessmen who previously gave to his now-defunctfoundation or 2016 campaign, like New York Real Estate Institute President Richard Levine, but is “working more on what bills he can get passed and what policies he can push versus raising money” out on the course.
Two sources close to the president said Trump has also used his weekend golf rounds as a way to spend time with his children, including 13-year-old Barron, whose public appearances are few and far between.
“I’ve seen Barron out there with him on a few occasions and he’s a good athlete by his own right,” said a Trump family friend.
Trump often ridiculed Obama’s frequent weekend golfing. And as a candidate, he once told supporters he was “not going to have time” for golf if he were elected president. “It’s funny, in the world of politics, it’s hard to play a lot of golf,” he told Golf Digest three months into his presidential campaign. But since his inauguration, Trump has visited his own golf clubs 167 times, according to TrumpGolfCount , which relies on official White House pool reports, although it is unknown how many of those times he teed up.
Trump has yet to play golf as president at a course he does not own, and some aides suspect he relishes showing off the pristine conditions of his properties.
“I’ve been on the courses with him where he’ll stop the golf cart and say, ‘This tree just got planted,’ or ‘I’m fixing this sand trap.’ He’s very detail-oriented on the course,” a senior administration official said.
When he's finished with his golf outing, Trump sometimes meets with friends at Mar-a-Lago and shows them around his club."

Kamala Harris releases 15 years of tax returns,www.politico.com,CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/14/kamala-harris-tax-returns-1273824,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Sen. Kamala Harris and her husband reported a total income of about $2 million in their 2018 federal tax return, according to a large release of filings on Sunday by the California Democrat that her presidential campaign is billing as the “most transparent” of the sprawling 2020 field.
Harris released 15 years of tax returns in all — three more than any other candidate. Harris’ records cover every year since 2004, when she was the elected district attorney of San Francisco. Story Continued Below
In their 2018 return, Harris and her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, listed an adjusted gross income of $1.89 million, including Harris’ Senate salary and $320,000 she made from writing a book, “The Truths We Hold.” Harris and Emhoff married in 2014, then began filing jointly. In 2018, they paid $563,426 in federal taxes and donated $27,000 to charity.
Their average effective tax rate has been roughly 32 percent since they wed.
Harris’ release comes ahead of Tax Day and the anticipated release of a decade's worth of returns from rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders and his wife have recently entered the millionaire class, largely because of book advances and royalties. During his 2016 run, Sanders released a summary of his 2014 return, pledging to provide more when he became the Democratic nominee. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, released eight years of tax returns going back to 2007.

This time, Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, have publicly released varying years of their tax records. Several more Democrats, including former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey have pledged to do so.
But the volume of Harris’ release, which spans 528 pages with schedules, gives her bragging rights over the other presidential contenders, as well as a claim to transparency over President Donald Trump, who has long rebuffed releasing his taxes. A Harris campaign aide noted the senator supports legislation requiring a president’s tax returns be made public.
Warren’s latest return showed she and her husband, Harvard Law School professor Bruce Mann, listed a total income of nearly $906,000 and adjusted gross income of $846,394, with $324,687 from her book. They paid about $230,000 in taxes.

Klobuchar and her husband, attorney and law school professor John Bessler, earned $292,306 and paid nearly $63,000 in federal taxes in 2017. They released a dozen years of returns.
Gillibrand earned about $218,000 last year through her Senate salary and a book deal.
In the years before she was married, Harris’ income was mostly derived from public salaries as district attorney and attorney general of California. In her 2004 filing, Harris reported earning nearly $145,000, which increased to $155,000 two years later. She reported wages of $223,000 in 2009, including $13,000 in outside income related to her first book, ""Smart on Crime."" Her adjusted gross income was $263,000 in 2010, though that fell to $158,000 as state attorney general in 2011 and to $130,000 in 2012. Harris and Emhoff paid $410,000 in federal taxes on $1.2 million in 2014. "

“Two weeks later, in October 2003, Mr. Buttigieg vented his dismay in The Harvard Crimson. Contrasting Mr. Edwards’s hollow presentation with Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brazen campaign for governor of California, Mr. Buttigieg wrote that Republicans had cornered the market on political swagger. ‘Across the aisle,’ Mr. Buttigieg lamented, ‘members of a Democratic Party, aghast at the hypocrisy of their counterparts’ personalities, seem themselves reluctant to demonstrate any personality at all.’” NYT … Buttigieg’s Crimson piece

At one point Giuliani chipped a ball that struck Corker in the neck.

Rising Buttigieg formally launches presidential campaign - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Daniel Strauss,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/14/pete-buttigieg-formally-announces-presidential-campaign-1274075,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Surging in early primary polls, Democrat Pete Buttigieg officially kicked off his presidential bid on Sunday, starting a new phase of the campaign as one of the main candidates to watch just three months after he launched an exploratory committee to little fanfare. The South Bend mayor said it was time for the country to plot a new course before a crowd of supporters packed into the Studebaker 84 Building, a recently repurposed former car assembly plant, on a rainy Sunday afternoon in his hometown.
Story Continued Below
“It’s time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different. So that’s why I’m here today, joining you to make a little news. My name is Pete Buttigieg,” he said. “They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana. And I am running for president of the United States.”
Buttigieg, 37, framed his candidacy around his background as someone who was born and served as the mayor of a midsized Midwestern city that went through an economic and technological renaissance. He contrasted that with President Donald Trump’s ""Make America Great Again"" message and his promises to bring back old business to the region.
“I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing that nothing like Studebaker would ever come back — but believing that we would, our city would, if we had the courage to reimagine our future. And now, I can confidently say that South Bend is back. More people are moving into South Bend than we’ve seen in a generation.

“Thousands of new jobs have been added in our area, and billions in investment. There’s a long way for us to go. Life here is far from perfect. But we’ve changed our trajectory and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that’s why I’m here today. To tell a different story than 'Make America Great Again.' Because there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities — the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.”
Buttigieg’s official campaign launch comes amid a surge of news placing the mayor of 102,000-person South Bend in the upper echelons of the Democratic presidential primary. He raised $7 million in 2019's first quarter — fourth most among candidates who have announced their fundraising so far — largely from a swell of small-dollar donors. Buttigieg, who is openly gay, has gained notice for his criticism of Vice President Mike Pence, a former Indiana governor and an opponent of same-sex marriage.
And recent surveys of Democrats in early 2020 states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina show Buttigieg jumping into the pack vying for third place behind the early polling front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Buttigieg, who served as an naval intelligence officer, said his campaign would focus on freedom and national security, arguing that that included climate change, health care and immigration.
“The principles that will guide my campaign are simple enough to fit on a bumper sticker: freedom, security and democracy,” Buttigieg said.
Later in the speech, the South Bend mayor said: “Health care is freedom because you’re not free if you can’t start a small business because leaving your job would mean losing your health care.”
But Buttigieg faces a tough climb to the Democratic presidential nomination: No one has ever jumped from a city hall to the White House, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani won only a single delegate in 2008 despite spending much of the preceding year leading Republican primary polls. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., has also joined Buttigieg in the 2020 Democratic primary, and current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio might jump in as well.
Still, Buttigieg has hoped to leverage his connections to mayors across the country. Openers for his speech included Austin, Texas, Mayor Steve Adler, West Sacramento, Calif., Mayor Christopher Cabaldon, and Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley, all of whom argued that American mayors have a unique connection to voters.
“Politics in cities is the politics of every day life,” Adler said in his speech. “In cities, political issues are not abstract ideas, it is the stuff that hits home.”

How Mayor Pete Started to Look Presidential By ADAM WREN
In a bid to maintain the momentum — and avoid becoming the latest in a line of long-shot presidential candidates who faded after a brief moment of prominence — Buttigieg has moved to expand his campaign team at his South Bend headquarters and in the early primary states, as well as in a small outpost in Chicago, where a handful of staffers are based to take advantage of talent and fundraising potential in the city.
Buttigieg is scheduled to headline a fundraiser in Chicago on April 23. He is also set to travel to Iowa later this week.
Buttigieg noted that his age and his resume — compared with other Democratic presidential candidates who have won statewide races — were unconventional for a president.
“I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor. More than a little bold — at age 37 — to seek the highest office in the land. Up until recently, this was not exactly what I had in mind either, for how to spend my eighth year as mayor and my 38th year in this world. But the moment we live in compels us to act,” Buttigieg said.
“The forces of change in our country today are tectonic. Forces that help to explain what made this current presidency even possible. That’s why, this time, it’s not just about winning an election — it’s about winning an era. Not just about the next four years — it’s about preparing our country for a better life in 2030, in 2040, and in the year 2054, when, God willing, I will come to be the same age as our current president.”
Buttigieg finished his speech saying: ""It’s cold out, but we’ve had it with winter. You and I have the chance to usher in a new American spring.""
His husband, Chasten, then joined the mayor onstage and the two waved to the crowd."
White House messaging falls in line with Trump's sanctuary cities proposal,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/14/trump-immigration-sanctuary-cities-1274072,"President Donald Trump’s proposal to release detained into so-called sanctuary cities, categorically dismissed by the administration days ago, inched closer to reality on Sunday, with White House officials confirming that the controversial plan was back under consideration and urging immediate action in response to a surge of Central American migrants at the southern border.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration was “looking to see if there are options that make” Trump’s proposal legally viable, and described it as “an option on the table” among other immigration enforcement measures.
“Certainly this wouldn’t be our first choice, because ideally we wouldn’t be dealing with the massive influx of illegal immigrants coming across the border,” Sanders told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s “This Week.”
“The president likes the idea, and Democrats have said they want these individuals into their communities,” she said. “So let’s see if it works and everybody gets a win out of it.”
Sanders’ acknowledgment that administration officials are revisiting the proposal follows denials from The White House and Department of Homeland Security to The Washington Post late last week that the idea was still under discussion.
But Trump on Friday contradicted his top aides and agency personnel by revealing that he was “strongly looking at” the plan, which Sanders on Sunday contended would “spread out” the “burden” of across the U.S.
“We don’t want to put all of the burden on one or two border communities, and Democrats have stated time and time again they support open borders, they support sanctuary cities,” Sanders said.
“So let’s spread out some of that burden and let’s put it in some of those other locations, if that’s what they want to see happen and are refusing to actually help fix the problem,” she added.
Sanders’ statement about sharing the “burden” of recalled the March 1964 proposal of Sen. Richard Russell (D-Ga.) to relocate African-Americans so that so much of the population was not concentrated in the Deep South. In arguing against integration in his region of the United States, Russell said: “It is only fair and right that the Negro population be spread more evenly over all sections of the nation.”
The president on Saturday evening dug in on his policy suggestion, writing on Twitter that the U.S. government had the “absolute legal right” to transport apprehended migrants to jurisdictions that limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents. It is not clear that is the case.
“We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!” Trump wrote online.
Administration officials proposed the plan last November and again in February, according to The Post, as a form of political retaliation against the president’s opponents. Democratic bastions including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco were among the targets.
While overall arrests remain below the high levels of the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the number of family members intercepted at the southwest border soared in March, according to preliminary statistics from U.S. Customs and Border Protection — presenting the administration with what officials argue are unique challenges.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that the onus lay with Pelosi’s caucus in the House to legislate a solution to “both a security crisis and a humanitarian crisis” at the U.S.-Mexico border, adding that “we’ve done a great deal of work” in Trump’s executive branch.
“We have an unserious Congress that is not coming to the table,” Conway told host Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“And the Republicans failed to do their job when they were in charge, no doubt. The Democrats now are failing to come together in the House,"" she said.
But Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Sunday that little progress could be made on any immigration compromise with the White House given the number of high-level vacancies at DHS that resulted from the president’s purge of several department officials last week.
“We’re kind of in a rudderless situation,” Thompson said on ABC.
“The individuals tasked with the responsibility of carrying forth the administration’s policy, they’re just not soundly in place for this to occur,” he added.
Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as homeland security secretary last Sunday, following the White House’s unexpected decision to pull its nomination of Ronald Vitiello to become director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Claire Grady, the acting Homeland Security Department deputy secretary, also departed the administration on Tuesday — another casualty of an administration exodus engineered in part by Stephen Miller, the White House adviser who is the president’s top aide on matters of immigration.
It was Miller, too, who was responsible for engendering Trump’s proposal on sanctuary cities, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asserted on Sunday.
“We heard several weeks ago from whistle-blowers that Steve Miller came up with this before we heard about it from any other source,” Nadler told host Jake Tapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“Probably Steve Miller, who seems to be the boss of everybody on immigration, ought to come before Congress and explain some of these policies,” Nadler said."

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has raised $3 million since launching her presidential bid, her campaign said Sunday, a sum that puts the New York Democrat near the bottom of Democrats’ fundraising leaderboard after the first quarter.
But Gillibrand still has a hefty sum in her campaign account — over $10 million, more than a number of her opponents — thanks to a big transfer of leftover funds from her 2018 Senate reelection campaign. Gillibrand’s spokesperson didn’t disclose the number of donors who contributed to her bid, as some other campaigns in the grassroots-obsessed Democratic primary have so far.
In a memo shared with supporters, Gillibrand's campaign argued that her lower haul is due, in part, to backlash from “establishment donors” who are punishing Gillibrand for calling on former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken to resign following several sexual harassment allegations in 2017.
“There’s no question that the first quarter was adversely impacted by certain establishment donors — and many online — who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women,” the memo reads. “Kirsten is committed to fighting for a Democratic Party that values women and does not sacrifice women for political convenience or power.”
Gillibrand, who has struggled to break out of the 2020 field in polling, fell behind all of her Senate colleagues in fundraising despite getting into the race earlier than any of her colleagues save Sen. Elizabeth Warren . Sen. Bernie Sanders led the group with over $18 million by March 31, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris with $12 million, Warren took in over $6 million and Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker both raised about $5 million.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who formally launched his presidential run this weekend, raised more than $7 million over the same period.
Gillibrand has regularly addressed her handling of Franken’s resignation during her campaign, from questions posed at small meet-and-greets in Iowa to her MSNBC town hall last month, when she said, “If there are a few powerful Democratic donors who are angry,” then “that’s on them.”
She has also used it as a hook to draw in other donors online: In one Facebook ad from March, Gillibrand said that “Democratic megadonors are blacklisting” her “because I refused to stay silent” and urged supporters to contribute “to get me to the debates.”
Gillibrand, who has put her gender at the center of her campaign, has cultivated a following amongst other women. Nearly two-thirds of her donors during the first quarter were women, and the majority of the donors had never given to Gillibrand before, according to Gillibrand’s spokesperson.

I'm very familiar with it,” Nadler added. | Andrew Burton/Getty Images Trump has ‘no moral authority’ to talk about 9/11, Nadler says
President Donald Trump has “no moral authority“ to talk about 9/11, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Sunday.
“He stole $150,000 from some small businessperson who could have used it to help rehabilitate himself. And that's why we appropriated it, why I got Congress to appropriate that money,” Nadler said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “To use it for his own small business of 40 Wall Street, he has no moral authority to be talking about 9/11 at all.”
Nadler was referencing how Trump‘s company accepted post-9/11 funding for a building that had not sustained any damage. Trump said the building qualified because his company had suffered economic losses in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. The funding came from the Empire State Development Corp., New York’s economic development agency, and was intended for small businesses.
Trump targeted Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) last week for comments she made about discrimination of Muslim Americans after 9/11. Conservative pundits latched on to one portion of Omar’s comments — in which she referred to the attacks by saying that “somebody did something“ — to argue that Omar was minimizing tremendous human loss. Trump responded by tweeting a graphic video of the Twin Towers collapsing juxtaposed with Omar’s comment, earning criticism from Democrats for targeting a Muslim woman.
Nadler said he didn’t have a problem with Omar’s remarks.
“She characterized it only in passing,” Nadler said. “She was talking about discrimination against Muslim Americans. And she just said that, after that happened, it was used as an excuse for lots of discrimination and for withdrawal of civil liberties.""
“9/11 occurred in my district. I'm very familiar with it,” Nadler added. “I know a lot — I know people, a lot of people, who suffered from it.“

Pelosi’s announcement highlighted what has become an extraordinary situation — the speaker of the House is worried about the safety of one of her own members following a statement by the president of the United States.
An Omar aide said on Sunday that “there has been an increase in threats” against the Minnesota Democrat following Trump’s tweet. Omar’s office reports such threats to the FBI and Capitol Police, the aide said.
A New York man who supports Trump was arrested two weeks ago after threatening to shoot Omar. And last month, a bomb threat was called in to a Los Angeles building where Omar was scheduled to make a speech. That address went ahead as planned.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday that Trump “is wishing no ill will and certainly not violence towards anyone, but the president is absolutely and should be calling out the congresswoman for her not only one time but history of anti-Semitic comments.”
During the last decade, two members of Congress — Democrat Gabrielle Giffords or Arizona and Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana — have been seriously wounded in shootings. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) received death threats from a Venezuelan lawmaker in 2017, and security was stepped up around him.
Omar, a Somali-American and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, has become a center of national controversy over comments that have been condemned as anti-Semitic. The House has twice passed resolutions rejecting anti-Semitism and hate speech more broadly following those episodes.
This latest incident began on March 24, when Omar gave a speech to a Muslim civil rights organization, a week after the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. A white supremacist killed 50 Muslims in a mosque in that mass shooting.
During her speech, Omar said: “For too long we have lived with the danger of being a second-class citizen, and frankly, I’m tired of it. And every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. [The Council on American-Islamic Relations] was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Three weeks later, on April 9, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), a Navy Seal who lost his right eye during an explosion while deployed in Afghanistan, criticized Omar’s comments, a move that set off a firestorm on the right — especially on Fox News — and eventually led to Trump’s intervention.
“First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as ‘some people who did something,’” Crenshaw said in a tweet. “Unbelievable.”
Omar and her defenders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), immediately shot back, saying comments like Crenshaw’s — and, later, the president’s tweet — were endangering the Minnesota Democrat, who has faced a litany of death threats since coming to Congress.
“We are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters on Thursday.
But Crenshaw didn’t back down, issuing another defiant response on Friday, hours after Trump’s controversial tweet prompted further outcry from Democrats.
“When someone calls out a public official for things they said, it is not endangering their life or inciting violence,” Crenshaw tweeted Friday night. “Claiming otherwise is just an attempt to silence your critics.”
Not all Democratic criticism was directed across the aisle, however. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), another high-profile freshman and an ally of Omar and Ocasio-Cortez, directed her complaints at Democratic leadership.
“They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,” Tlaib said Saturday , responding to a tweet about how top Democrats hadn’t done enough to defend Omar.
“However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored. To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.”
Pelosi, who is currently traveling overseas, had largely avoided wading into the latest controversy surrounding Omar until her statement Sunday.
Asked by reporters Friday at Democrats’ annual retreat to weigh in, the speaker deferred, saying she hadn’t been able to talk to Omar yet because the freshman Democrat was “in transit.”
“As is my custom with my colleagues, I call them in before I call them out, so I look forward to hearing from her,” Pelosi said. “I’ll have some comment when I do speak to her.”

"U.S. planes bomb Libya, April 15, 1986",www.politico.com,ANDREW GLASS,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/reagan-bomb-libya-april-15-1986-1272788,"By NANCY COOK
France, Spain and Italy denied the U.S. Air Force overflight rights, forcing that portion of the operation to be flown over Portugal and through the Strait of Gibraltar, adding 1,300 miles each way to the mission and requiring multiple aerial refueling of the planes.
Forewarned by Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his family fled from their residence in the Bab al-Azizia compound moments before the bombs fell. Gaddafi claimed that his adopted infant daughter, Hana, was killed in the attack.
Gaddafi said a reconciliation between Libya and the United States could never occur so long as Reagan remained in the White House. Of the president, he said: “He is mad. He is foolish. He is an Israeli dog.” He also claimed that Reagan had wanted to kill him, citing as evidence that “the attack was concentrated on my house and I was in my house.”
The Libyan dictator said he had “won a spectacular military victory over the United States” and renamed the country as the “Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah.”
After the raid, the Kremlin canceled a planned U.S. visit by Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign affairs minister. At the same time, it signaled that negotiations to hold a summit meeting between Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to seek further nuclear arms control agreements would proceed as planned.
Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general, acting for Libyan citizens who had been killed or wounded in the bombing raid, sued the United States and Britain for damages. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the suit, Saltany v. Reagan , in 1988 as “audacious.”

The Insiders’ Guide To the Mueller Report - POLITICO Magazine,www.politico.com,Darren Samuelsohn,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/15/mueller-report-release-insiders-guide-226655,"The 400-page Mueller report, expected to land this week, is the most anticipated political read since Ken Starr, Monica Lewinsky and the stained blue dress—and potentially even juicier. But how do you wring that juice out of a behemoth of a legal document, full of redactions, at the speed of social media? That’s what the tribes of American politics are gearing up to do this week.
From the moment it drops, the scramble will be on—to defend the president, to plan new lines of attack, or to put this whole big crazy story into the wider context of American history. So much material released all at once raises the question of how to dig in on something so dense, with so much buildup, where the feeding frenzy will be instant among the cable TV chattering classes and Twitter piranhas.
The capital has already evolved one model for processing a big tell-all book: ""the Washington read,” where you scan the index (assuming there is one) to find everything it says about you, your boss and your enemies and then fake like you’ve read the rest. But this time that won’t be enough. The goods might not come easily. They might be buried in an obscure subsection. And there’s way more at stake than in the typical gossipy memoir.
The report by special counsel Robert Mueller could be the biggest oppo dump in history. It could be a fizzle. Although Mueller didn’t find enough evidence to charge President Donald Trump for conspiring with Russia to win the White House, and Attorney General William Barr has concluded that it doesn’t show Trump obstructed justice, the report itself is expected to be rich with details uncovered by the sweeping 22-month investigation.
We already know something about the way the report will look, courtesy of Barr. The attorney general last week told Congress that the document will be color-coded to explain why lawyers for Mueller and DOJ have redacted some of the most sensitive material. But he promised that, for all the gaps, the report won't end up looking totally like Swiss cheese. ""You will get more than the gist,"" Barr told a Senate appropriations subcommittee.
To help navigate this once-in-a-generation moment, POLITICO asked dozens of people who have been tuned in since the 2016 presidential election—Trump officials, Republicans and Democrats, former prosecutors, academics, historians and even the Russians—how they plan to read this two-years-in-the-making document when it shows up in their inbox. Here's what some of them said.
The President’s Defenders
Nobody has more at stake than Trump and his inner circle of family members, aides, loyalists and defenders. They’ve already seen some of their former colleagues face criminal charges and jail time from the Mueller probe. With the report’s arrival, they know that any page could still contain a ticking bomb, one that could open the door to more legal scrutiny or kneecap the president politically as he mounts his reelection campaign. But the document might also have exculpatory material that would help Trump push back with his narrative that the whole probe has been a “witch hunt.”
Above all, Team Trump will need to respond. So inside the president’s world, the attention will be focused on digesting the material, and quickly.
Jay Sekulow, Trump's media-savvy personal lawyer, said he'll have a team of five to six people in place, each assigned a key section to read in parallel. The goal is preparing the quickest possible response to blast out to reporters—as well as to brief him and Rudy Giuliani as they fan out to talk more at length in media interviews. If it were just one analyst reading, he said, “we'd be talking to you the next day""—far too late for crisis management.
Like everyone outside the Barr and Mueller inner circles, Sekulow said he’s still in the dark about how the special counsel report will be structured. He doesn't know if there will be executive summaries, a section featuring conclusions or if it will even come in an easily searchable PDF document. But he said he’s taking comfort in knowing Barr, a Trump appointee, has already read the report and decided nothing in it rose to the level of prosecution. ""At the end of the day, it's like waiting for the jury verdict, except you know what the jury verdict is already,"" he said.
For others in Trumpworld, especially those pulled into the investigation quagmire themselves, the report means other things. Ty Cobb, who served for a year as the lead White House lawyer handling Mueller matters, downplayed his interest in its revelations, saying he was familiar with most of the facts and would mainly be reading to see how the lawyers did their jobs. “The results of their hard work will be of interest to the extent they can be deduced,” he wrote in an email.
Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump associate and early 2016 campaign adviser, wasn’t so blasé about it and said he has a reading strategy in place: He’ll start first with the executive summary—assuming there is one—to see how it matches with Barr’s “CliffsNotes” version of the memo, issued last month. Then he plans to go to the collusion section, since that was the main issue he found himself questioned on, before turning to the portion dealing with obstruction.
Caputo’s version of "" the Washington read ” will be to scan the index for specific top Trump aides he knows and who have been central to the entire investigation, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, longtime Trump associate Roger Stone and former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.
“I'll also read the George Papadopoulos section just to see how much it differs from his book, ‘Deep State Target,’” he said of the Trump campaign adviser who served two weeks in prison last year for lying to the FBI. “And I'll probably poke around looking for traces of myself, but I don't expect to see my name much at all.”
Caputo said he’ll read every word. “I mean, they took the time to read all of my emails and texts, so it's the least I can do,” he said.
The oppo file
For Democratic operatives and Trump’s other political rivals, the Mueller report still hangs in that seductive space between fantasy hit job and grave disappointment. In the first version, it contains long-awaited insights into how and why Russia helped Trump—with or without his collaboration—to beat Hillary Clinton en route to the White House. And it could also offer the details they need to start beating the impeachment drum louder—which means the kinds of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that might not amount to legally prosecutable offenses but would warrant Congress seeking the president’s removal from office.
What are they looking for, specifically? “I am most interested in reading if anyone inside the campaign reported to the FBI or others any contact with Russian officials or individuals who promised to provide dirt,” said Donna Brazile, who took over as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in July 2016 after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned after the public release of her hacked emails.
In terms of tactics, several Democrats said they planned to handle the deluge of information with the quintessential 2019 reading experience: using two or even three screens. Former Obama White House speechwriter David Litt will have Twitter open while he’s making his way through the report, watching in particular for posts from several of the more prominent legal and analytical voices who have narrated the story’s plot twists as it evolved: Ken White ( @popehat ), Mimi Rocah ( @Mimirocah1 ), Renato Mariotti ( @Renato_Mariotti ), Marcy Wheeler ( @emptywheel ), Neal Katyal ( @neal_katyal ) “for the definitive word on special-counsel regs” and Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight “to think through the political implications.” “Basically I'm assembling my own panel, except there's no yelling, thoughtful argument, and zero chance of Kellyanne Conway showing up,” Litt said.
Similarly, Ann Lewis, a former Clinton White House communications director, said she would begin by reading “carefully from the beginning.”
“But, candidly, I recognize that some very smart people will have begun highlighting what they find most important—so I will probably read with the full text on one computer and another open to tweets and summaries,” she added.
One open question for political insiders is how much to rely on news coverage. Don Goldberg, a former Clinton White House communications aide who handled investigations for that scandal-plagued Democratic administration, plans to read the news first: “I think reporters who have been covering this from the start will be far more attuned to what's important and how it relates to other court filings, reporter articles, congressional activities, etc., and also be more sensitive to what's new. That will be my shortcut, and I may read through it in full after I digest POLITICO's coverage.”
On the opposite side is Julian Epstein, a former House Judiciary Committee chief counsel for Democrats during the Clinton impeachment saga, who has found the media coverage so far more of a red herring than a useful guide to what matters. “Given how badly the pundits and chattering class misread the Mueller investigation, despite clear signs that caution was warranted,” he said, “I can’t imagine anyone will be able to meaningfully add to the debate without carefully reading the entire report with all its nuances—cover to cover, starting with Page 1.”
And then there’s Joe Lockhart, the former Clinton White House press secretary whose ideal strategy for the Mueller report rollout turns it into more of a This Town tailgate party. “I plan to take my lawn chair and a cooler of beer and read at the end of Ken Starr’s driveway,” he wrote in an email.
Legal insiders
The Mueller probe has created something of a cottage industry for the former prosecutors, defense attorneys and anyone else who previously worked on a high-profile government investigation. Some have even landed jobs paying five or six figures as cable TV pundits. The professional class isn’t just fascinated by one of the highest-profile inquiries in America in decades, it’s also possibly the most informed audience about how it works, and thus uniquely attuned to what to look for.
Julie Myers Wood worked as a prosecutor on Ken Starr’s investigation of Bill Clinton and has a clear strategy for where to start—one that involves setting aside the summaries in favor of the potentially meatiest chapters. “The obstruction section and Mueller's decision not to decide on obstruction are the areas I'm most interested in reading first,” she wrote in an email. “Knowing the Mueller team, the summaries are likely excellent, but I want to digest the specific facts myself.”
Joyce Vance, a former Obama-era U.S. attorney from the Northern District of Alabama who has become a frequent MSNBC guest discussing the Mueller probe, said she’ll read the report “like any other case file, front to back, with a notepad next to me to make notes about key pieces of evidence, omissions and questions.”
Prosecutors look to see if the evidence is sufficient to establish if there’s been a specific statutory violation that can be proved in court beyond a reasonable doubt, and Vance said she’ll be looking for Mueller’s assessment for why he chose not to file charges against Trump on obstruction. “It seems likely he took that approach because he believed that decision was for Congress,” she said, referring to the prospect that the special counsel intended to hand over his evidence and findings for impeachment proceedings. “I’ll be interested in whether the report confirms that.”
Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who previously worked with Mueller attorney Andrew Weissmann, said he’ll be looking for the executive summaries that Mueller’s prosecutors were reportedly frustrated about not making it into Barr’s initial readout.
The Chicago-based attorney has a couple other pro tips. First, read it on paper. “I will first print it in hard copy, so I can highlight important bits and so I can make comments in the margins; also because I am of an age when serious reading requires that it be on paper,” he said.
And Cotter already has a game plan for how he’ll get through it all. “If it comes out during the day, I will then get an Earl Grey tea and a sleeve of Girl Scout Thin Mints, turn off my phone, ask my assistant to head off any calls and close my door,” he said. “If it comes out after 5:00 p.m., I will get a large Irish whiskey, neat.”
Academics
Mueller’s finished product will have a very different meaning for the experts who study this sort of thing. If media coverage is the first draft of history, they’ll be writing the second draft—but they’re also prepped to offer real-time commentary.
Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University who has written books about everyone from Rosa Parks to Ronald Reagan, said that in his experience the “only way” to process something like Mueller’s report is from beginning to end “quickly, very quickly.”
“Cherry-picking information causes confusion,” he said. Brinkley was one of the National Book Award judges who nominated “The 9/11 Commission Report,” a 585-page government document, for the nonfiction prize in 2004; it was a finalist, but didn’t win. Mueller’s effort, he hopes, will be similarly produced and “written for public understanding, not legal scholars.”
Jennifer Mercieca, a Texas A&M University communications professor writing a book about Trump's 2016 campaign and demagoguery, said she will be reading the Mueller report cover to cover, “looking for juicy bits”—and especially for answers to some lingering questions she has. She’s closely studied the two indictments the special counsel filed in 2018 that named some two dozen Russian officials, companies, hackers and computer programmers as responsible for much of the online mayhem that rattled the last White House race—and is eager to find out why one set of charges made no direct connection to Trump while the other did just that.
“As I read the report, I'll be looking to see if there is more information about that distinction, which I think is really important to understanding what (if anything) happened between the Trump campaign and Russia,” she said.

What Will Really Matter in the Mueller Report By Renato Mariotti

‘Liz Was a Diehard Conservative’ By Alex Thompson
Allan Lichtman, an American University professor who wrote a book making the case for Trump’s impeachment, said he’d be looking to read Mueller’s findings in full to see the context behind the sentence fragments that Barr used in his initial readout to Congress and which the president has used to claim “total EXONERATION.” Lichtman’s goal: to assess whether the attorney general “deliberately covered up damaging information about the president and his associates.”
“Words matter for the historian,” he said. “Even responsible journalists have misleadingly said that the Mueller report clears the president of collusion, when even the fragments cited in the William Barr ‘Summary’ do not use the word collusion but consider only whether the campaign ‘conspired or coordinated with the Russian government.’ ”
The Russians
Unless its intelligence is better than we think, there’s one other party profoundly interested in what the Mueller report reveals. And the message it wants Americans to hear is: Nothing to see here.
Asked how it planned to read the Mueller report, the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., replied through a spokesman with a link to its Facebook page, on which one finds a statement from President Vladimir Putin given during an international conference last week in which he denied collusion between Trump and Russia.
We ""knew a mountain was being made out of a molehill, so to speak,” Putin said, “because we knew how it would end beforehand.”"
MIA from Beto’s campaign: Big policy ideas,www.politico.com,DAVID SIDERS,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/beto-orourkepolicy-proposals-2020-1267666,"2020 elections The big idea? Beto doesn’t have one. One month in, the central thrust of O’Rourke’s presidential campaign appears to be interacting with crowds. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Kamala Harris has her $315 billion proposal to raise teacher pay. Amy Klobuchar has a seven-point infrastructure investment plan. Elizabeth Warren is swimming in white papers on subjects ranging from tech company mergers to taxes and housing.
Beto O’Rourke’s most distinctive policy position? To be determined. There’s no signature issue yet, no single policy proposal sparking his campaign. Convening crowds — and listening to them — is the central thrust of his early presidential bid. And one month into the race, even some of O’Rourke’s supporters are starting to worry about persistent criticism that the charismatic Texan is missing big policy ideas of his own. Story Continued Below
“Many of your critics often believe that you’re not clear or firm on your policy positions,” a caucusgoer told O’Rourke at a town hall-style meeting in Iowa recently. “What should we, as supporters and caucusers, say to rebut these claims?”
It’s not that O’Rourke doesn’t have positions. He does, and in the month since announcing his presidential campaign, he has expressed many of them with specificity. He has robust ideas about immigration, including a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. He has lauded the ""Green New Deal"" and called for a new Voting Rights Act. He was an early champion of legalizing marijuana — and co-wrote a book about it. He wants universal pre-K education, and he has touted a bill by Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) to dramatically expand Medicare coverage while maintaining a role for private health insurance.
Campaigning in South Carolina on Saturday, O’Rourke was endorsed by state Rep. Marvin Pendarvis, who said he was proud to support a politician who is “looking at how we can ensure that all Americans have a quality of life that is necessary in the form of health care and affordable housing and a quality education.”

But none of those positions is unique to O’Rourke. And with his relatively meager legislative record — and a belief that he can transcend ideological lanes within the Democratic Party — O'Rourke appears unclear about where he fits on the policy spectrum.
When a Republican voter told O’Rourke after a recent campaign event that he came off “a little bit more centrist” than she had expected and asked, “Is that true?” O’Rourke replied, “That’s a great question.”
Then O’Rourke, who only weeks earlier had said the nation’s “extraordinary, unprecedented concentration of wealth and power and privilege must be broken apart,” told the woman, “I guess it’s probably for you and voters to decide.”
“All I can do is share the things that I believe in and the way in which I want to campaign,” O’Rourke said. “And then where you want to affix me on the political spectrum is up to you.”
Unlike some of his lower-profile competitors, O’Rourke has not been compelled to release policy papers to draw media attention or donor interest. And the experience of the nation’s last Democratic president, Barack Obama, suggests O’Rourke has ample time to build a policy portfolio. By ALEX THOMPSON
Like O’Rourke, Obama was beset early in the 2008 presidential primary by complaints that he was light on policy. David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Obama, recalled one health care forum with Hillary Clinton in early 2007 in which Obama looked “sorely wanting.”
“I remember him coming back and saying: ‘I did not look like a president up there. She looked like president up there,’” Axelrod said. “There were times when he acknowledged, ‘I’m not where I need to be or want to be.’ But he then pushed himself to dig more deeply, to have more conversations, to develop his thoughts on things where he thought there were gaps. … By the time the campaign hit full swing, he was in a much better place.”
Axelrod said, “There is this tension in a campaign between the desire of the media and the political community to judge everything in the moment and the reality of a campaign, which evolves and gives candidates time to evolve with it. … I think that in a marathon, it is risky to draw too many conclusions at the 2-mile mark.”
Like Obama, a first-term senator when he ran for president, O’Rourke has relatively little Washington experience. But that is not the only obstacle O’Rourke will encounter in his effort to assemble a cohesive policy platform. The former three-term congressman was criticized during his Texas Senate run last year for appearing too progressive. Then it was progressive Democrats’ turn, faulting him in the early stages of the presidential campaign for more moderate elements of his record, including on climate change.
O’Rourke hasacknowledged that he might reconsider some votes he took related to the issue. Asked which ones, O’Rourke told reporters in Iowa recently, “I’ll try to get you a more complete answer in the future because I would need to take a look at those votes. I don’t have them all memorized.
“But I think the point that I was trying to make is that we have very limited time within which to act,” he said. “It’s something that I feel that I’m just really fully appreciating now.”
Following the exchange, Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist in Washington, said, “Beto is going to, at a point, have to put out actual policy proposals and continue to explain how he has evolved on his issues.
“He definitely has real energy behind him,” Feldman said. “But ultimately with that energy comes increased scrutiny and he’s going to have to put forth a policy agenda at some point.” By JAMES ARKIN
O’Rourke has at times appeared confounded by criticism that he is glossing over policy. When an MSNBC correspondent relayed to O’Rourke recently that some students he spoke with found O’Rourke “wishy-washy” on climate change, police violence and other issues, O’Rourke said, “Hmm,” then paused.
“Let me try again,” he said. “On climate: rejoin the Paris climate agreement, Day One. On climate: reinstitute the Clean Power Plan. Make sure that we have higher standards for vehicle emissions for this country. Invest in wind and solar and other renewable energies that are also producing the highest growth and jobs in this country. Free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. Help to convene the world around this problem because even if the United States did everything within its power, China has three to four times the number of coal-fired plants than we do. So we need to exert global leadership, once again return to being the indispensable nation.”
Then, turning to police use of force, O'Rourke called for “tying federal funds to full reporting on use of force and against whom force is used” and “invoking the civil rights laws of the United States to transcend local and state jurisdictions to make sure the full weight and power and accountability of the federal government comes into play to ensure that we protect the lives of those in our lives and in our communities.”
He said, “So those, I hope, are some specific answers on some specific questions.”
At other times, however, O’Rourke has deliberately positioned himself less as a proponent of policy ideas than as a synthesizer of them.
“I’m going to make the rare admission for a politician that I don’t have a good answer to your question,” O’Rourke said at a recent campaign stop when asked what he would do to help in-home child care providers.
Directing an aide to collect the questioner’s telephone number, O’Rourke said, “Let me learn from you and not try to pretend that I have the answer.”
The exchange was reminiscent of O'Rourke's first day as a presidential candidate, when he told a crowd: ""I am all ears right now. There's no sense in campaigning if you already know every single answer, if you're not willing to listen to those whom you wish to serve.""
Earlier this month, O’Rourke’s campaign publicized a pledge by O’Rourke, if elected, to sign an executive order requiring his Cabinet secretaries to hold monthly town hall meetings —effectively codifying his commitment to listen to and learn from his constituents. The proposal was in keeping with O’Rourke’s grueling schedule of campaign appearances across the country, after holding more than 100 town hall meetings in his Texas congressional district while in the House.
O’Rourke’s willingness to volunteer his own gaps in knowledge is rare for a politician and endearing to his supporters. And it has benefited him politically in previous campaigns.
Russell Autry, a pollster who worked for O’Rourke during his time on the City Council in El Paso, Texas, said: “When he started this [presidential] campaign, he was pretty clear what he wanted to do first of all was listen and meet as many people as possible. That was part of his strategy when he first ran for City Council in El Paso and when he first ran for Congress.”
“He wants to have a dialogue, and he wants to engage with real, live citizens, taxpayers, voters and hear what they have to say. And I think he’s good at it,” Autry said. “This is what Beto does. He does his homework and he tries to engage people. And when it comes time for there to be meat on the bones in terms of public policy, I think you’re going to start seeing that.” "
"On Tax Day, Trump tax cuts remain deeply unpopular",www.politico.com,BEN WHITE,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/donald-trump-tax-cuts-unpopular-1273469,"white house On Tax Day, Trump tax cuts remain deeply unpopular The president this week is embarking on a rescue mission to rebrand the 2018 law, partly to firm up his economic credentials ahead of the 2020 election. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump boasted in Michigan last month that he signed into law “massive tax cuts, the biggest in the history of our country.”
As Americans rush Monday to finish with their own tax filings, their judgment on Trump’s beloved tax cut bill is pretty clear: Most really don’t like it. Story Continued Below
Multiple polls show a majority of Americans don’t think they got a tax cut at all — even though independent analyses show they did. And only about a third of the country approves of the legislation itself, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed by Congress at the end of 2017.
So as Trump moves closer to full-time reelection mode later this year, he will have to battle a stark reality: While his personal rating on the economy remains high, his signature legislative achievement is widely viewed as a political dud, one that has drawn special anger in places with high state and local taxes and pricey housing markets where deductions were limited to reduce the overall cost of the tax plan.
White House officials are clearly aware of their vulnerability on the issue and officials are dubbing this Tax Cut Week, sending the president out to tout the impact of the legislation starting in Minnesota on Monday.
The president still enjoys his highest marks on the performance of the economy overall. But the widespread unpopularity of the tax-cut legislation has offered Democrats running for president a giant opportunity to roast the president as showering benefits on corporate America while doing far less for average citizens he promised to help.

“I think the two major developments on tax attitudes are that Republicans have lost the edge they once had as the party best able to handle taxes,” said Karlyn Bowman, who analyzes polling data at the American Enterprise Institute. “And Democrats seem to be making headway by hammering away at the rich not paying enough.”
One reason many Americans don't feel the tax cut: The most dramatic benefit was aimed at slashing the corporate tax rate. And many Democrats want to undo much of that cut.
Just last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of over a dozen Democrats running for president, took direct aim at Trump’s tax cut bill by proposing a plan to add a 7 percent tax on corporate profits reported to investors over $100 million. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to help fund “Medicare for All” by rolling back some of Trump’s tax cuts. Multiple other Democratic candidates have suggested junking some or all of the Trump tax cuts to fund priorities from health and child care to infrastructure and universal savings accounts.
Polling data suggest Democrats have fertile ground to rip into Trump’s tax cuts.
A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that just 17 percent of Americans believe their own taxes will go down as a result of the bill. A CBS News poll found that 40 percent said they saw no change from the tax bill. And more said it drove their taxes up (32 percent) than lowered their tax bill (25 percent.)
The bill itself has been unpopular from the start and remains so.
A Pew Research Center survey conducted last month found that 36 percent of Americans approve of the tax-cut law while 49 percent disapprove. Even the number of Republicans who strongly approve of the law dipped in the latest Pew survey.
White House officials’ response to the unpopularity of the tax cut is basically: Who cares?
They say slashing rates on corporations paved the way for stronger growth in 2018 and higher wages and will continue to do so in 2019, though many economists dispute the assertion that this year will be anywhere near as good as last. And they say Trump’s overall approval rating on the economy — 58 percent according to a recent Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service battleground poll — will overcome general voter antipathy to the tax-cut bill."
Security blanket: The Capitol becomes Fort Cuomo,www.politico.com,billmahoney@politico.com (Bill Mahoney),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/04/15/security-blanket-the-capitol-becomes-fort-cuomo-967422,"The most significant change came after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when several entrances were permanently closed off to the public. | AP Photo Security blanket: The Capitol becomes Fort Cuomo
ALBANY — Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s first official action upon assuming office in 2011 was to ease up on security measures that had earned the Capitol the derisive nickname “Fort Pataki,"" named for the three-term governor who ousted Cuomo's father in 1994. Executive Order No. 1 removed some concrete barriers that had been placed near the building and reopened the hallway near his office to the public.
“To get into this Capitol is like running an obstacle course, and it shouldn’t be,” the governor said in his first inaugural address. “This is the peoples’ meeting place and they should be invited in. And today, my friends, we will reopen the Capitol, literally and figuratively.”
Eight years later, a series of gradual security upgrades means that visitors to the Capitol encounter an obstacle course more daunting than it was in 2011. The screening line at the most commonly used entrance frequently stretches hundreds of people deep and can take over an hour to get through. When visitors finally pass through a checkpoint that increasingly resembles those found at airports, the first thing they often see is a state trooper carrying an assault rifle.
Welcome to Fort Cuomo.
“There’s a feeling that it’s no longer the peoples’ house, and you’re a guest. And that’s to put it kindly,” said John McEneny, who represented an Assembly district that included the Capitol for two decades and quite possibly knows more about the building’s past than anyone. “We’ve lost a very great deal in it.”
Security in the Capitol began to increase well before Cuomo took office, and it might be best to view his temporary interest in rolling it back as an aberration in a decadeslong trend.
The Senate first installed metal detectors near its chamber after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Not long after Gov. George Pataki assumed office in 1995, the hallway near the governor's second-floor office — the one later reopened by Cuomo — was shut down. The heavily armed trooper became a regular presence after terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015.
But the most significant change came after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, when several entrances were permanently closed off to the public. Anybody who did not work in the Capitol or conjoined Legislative Office Building, from schoolchildren on field trips to groups of activists planning to rally inside the building, now had to pass through metal detectors at one of four checkpoints before entering.
Mountains of anecdotal evidence suggest the lines outside these checkpoints have grown longer in recent months. The wait time is always bad in the early March crunch of pre-budget lobby days. But this year, queues stretching 200 people deep were a common sight, and there were occasions where the line was much longer.
“Things have really slowed down,” the Alliance for Quality Education’s Billy Easton, a regular presence in the halls of the Capitol for years, said on a particularly busy day. “It’s good to have security, but we also need to have things as functional as possible, so I feel like the state should make sure that … we’re not jamming up everything, which is definitely happening.”
“We’ve definitely all increased our wait times,” said another lobbyist. “It’s a much more involved process. You have to pick and choose your spots when you come into the building.”
Numerous Capitol regulars attributed the longer lines to changes implemented on the first day of session this year. With little fanfare, guards began requiring visitors to take off their belts before passing through metal detectors, regardless of whether the belts contain metal. While the state police said a requirement that electronic devices like laptops and cell phones be removed from bags and placed in bins was not new this year, numerous regulars said they had not been asked to comply with it before this year.
State police spokesperson William Duffy said the belt policy was implemented because “buckles would often set off the metal detectors.” They were aiming to “eliminate a major cause of multiple passes through … and reduce the wait time for screening.”
But it seems the change has done the opposite, as visitors are left digging through their bags or fumbling with their pants when they get to the front of the line.
“The fact that there are no signs telling people who aren’t often in the Capitol what the expectations are causes a lot of confusion when they get to the security checkpoint itself,” said one lobbyist. “That slows things down a lot.”
“I understand the need to follow the rules, but my belt doesn’t even set off the metal detector but I have to take it off anyways,” Easton said.
The Empire Center’s E.J. McMahon similarly noted he has worn his belt through airport security “about a hundred times without taking it off or tripping anything,” but is still required to take it off while entering the Capitol.
“It’s easy for people who want this, which is mainly people in government, to dismiss this as just carping over an inconvenience for people who don’t want to wait in line,” he said. “But it sends a very important and ultimately demeaning message to the public.”
Duffy said the state troopers do not keep track of how long it takes people to get processed through security. But he said the belt policy has made things better.
“The removal of waist belts has worked as intended — there has been a decrease in the number of second screenings, which had been the main source of delays,” he said. “While we make every attempt to move people through the checkpoints as efficiently as possible, our top priority is to ensure the safety and security of those who work and visit the Capitol.”
McMahon believes that even the presence of metal detectors is an example of “the security state run amok.”
“How come we don’t have the government screening people entering Crossgates Mall?” he said. “Why is every subway stop in New York City unguarded and unscreened? How come I can walk in and out of the park with impunity? Why are you worried about the New York State Capitol in particular? The reason they did it is not because it’s a bigger target; they did it because they could. …""
“There are people out there more than willing to say [removing the detectors would] make it less safe for us. And you know what? Marginally, to a very slight mathematically indiscernible extent, yup. But again, if you’re afraid of walking into a state capitol that doesn’t have metal detectors, why in the world would you ever go near Grand Central Terminal?”
For those who do not want Albany to join the roughly 20 state capitols that don’t have any metal detectors at all, there are still certainly options for reducing lines, even if officials wanted to keep the new rule on belts. State employees and those classified as vendors (including reporters) currently receive ID cards that let them bypass security. Some have suggested privately that the state should consider extending those cards to more people. If the state charged an individual a modest fee, it could conduct background checks at no cost to taxpayers.
“I wonder if there’s a potential for a TSA Precheck-like service to be created,” said one regular visitor. “I think it would speed things up for people who are frequently in the Capitol.”
That would, of course, also speed things up for everybody who comes. The fewer people in line in front of schoolchildren on a field trip, the less time the schoolchildren will have to wait. And it wouldn’t be hard for these background checks to be at least as sweeping as whatever minimal standards are currently used to screen those who currently receive cards: There’s a long list of high-profile officials who have been arrested or convicted on serious and even violent charges over the years, yet have been able to retain their security clearance and avoid the screening to which crime-free members of the public are subjected.
But while that idea has been bandied about occasionally over the years, there has never been any rush to act on it — perhaps due to the likelihood the next day’s tabloids would feature a headline assailing Cuomo for literally selling access to the Capitol to lobbyists.
Another possible solution would be a simple mandate requiring screening areas to be fully staffed on busy days. Even when the Legislature is in session, it’s certainly not uncommon to find several of the scanners at the highly trafficked concourse entrance closed down.
But while activists and other visitors might increasingly grumble about how difficult it is to access their government, no politicians have publicly raised concerns. While the growth of security at the Capitol has coincided with decades during which violent crime has plummeted , it’s also overlapped with an era in which incidents like mass shootings have made Americans increasingly supportive of more intrusive security measures. New York City, home to an ever-increasing share of the state’s political leaders, is home to millions of people who have become accustomed to the impositions of the security state.
Power in the Legislature also has begun to shift toward a younger generation . And while many of these millennials have made reforming the way people interact with their elected officials a key motif of their campaigns, not one has spoken up on the hurdles faced by those wishing to exercise the most fundamental democratic right of petitioning their government.
“I watched it get tightened almost every time I’ve gone in, because I have a comparison,” McEneny said. “I think if you just got here as a new person you were brought up in [a different] age. … It’s society. And there’s a lot of changes like that, and most of that is the price of 9/11.”
“To me, the travesty is that with each year there are fewer people around who remember [the old way of operating] and that we’re normalizing this ridiculous process,” said McMahon.
As such, the dwindling number of Capitol regulars who remember the years before Pataki’s tenure are thus left with little hope the state will ever take even modest steps toward returning to the halcyon days of the past.
“When I was a kid, you could run through the place 24 hours a day,” said McEneny.
“You might be coming down the elevator of the Capitol and the door would open on the second floor,” recounted McMahon. “And Mario Cuomo would get in his with sole bodyguard, Major Burke of the State Police. That was a very common event.""
“Now the needle has swung all the way in the other direction, and the unmistakable message that the Legislature sends to the public is ‘you are not to be trusted.’”"

IMMIGRATION LATEST -- “White House Weighs Broader Immigration Curbs,” by WSJ’s Louise Radnofsky and Rebecca Ballhaus: “President Trump and his top aides are weighing rules designed to clamp down on countries whose nationals overstay short-term visitor visas as part of a broader push for new ways to curb immigration.
“The effort would target nationals of countries with high overstay rates of such visas, which include the African nations of Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to Department of Homeland Security data. The U.S. as part of a new rule would tell the countries’ governments that if rates don’t reverse, then future visas could be shorter or harder to get...
“The White House also is seeking to push through other rules that would tighten student and investor visas, and it is pursuing what some describe as its most ambitious goal on immigration: preventing immigrants from coming or becoming citizens if they are likely to use publicly funded benefits. The overstay proposals, for visas known as B1 or B2s, haven’t been previously reported.” WSJ

Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot’s plan to end aldermanic privilege continues to fuel debate in City Hall.
“There are a lot of unanswered questions about how you define aldermanic prerogative. Will we still get to decide how to spend our menu money?” asked Ald. Nick Sposato (38 th ), referring to the $1.3 million that aldermen receive every year to spend on ward infrastructure. “Will we have a say in which streets to fix? As the alderman, I know what my ward needs. I know which streets are in good shape and which aren’t, and which ones should get priority.”
Lightfoot hasn’t offered details, but her focus so far has been on how aldermanic prerogative pertains to zoning issues. That’s at the heart of the corruption case against Ald. Ed Burke (14th). And it's sparked two major debates in the past year.
In the 41st Ward, an affordable housing project failed when aldermen on the Zoning Committee followed Ald. Anthony Napolitano's lead and voted against it. That was classic aldermanic prerogative, which says an alderman knows best how to handle his or her own ward.
In the 45th Ward, John Arena lost his aldermanic race after supporting a mixed-income development project in Jefferson Park. It's cast a pall on discussions among aldermen.“At some point, you have to make a decision that while you’re weighing opposition or input about an individual project, you also have to weigh it against the overall goals that you promised to deliver,” Arena told POLITICO, referring to the economic-development platform that first got him elected. “If a specific development is key to the broader goals but has opposition, which master do you serve? The one of immediacy? Or the one of broader scope?”
As outgoing Ald. Ameya Pawar explains, “Nimbys can hijack the idea pretty quickly and then it becomes hard to move anything that creates more housing.”
Marisa Novara, vice president of the Metropolitan Planning Council, points to Los Angeles, New York and Seattle, as examples of cities that centralize mundane zoning issues. “Lessening hyperlocal zoning decisions and requiring factual reasons to reject affordable housing are two concrete ways to limit the negatives of aldermanic prerogative.”

Peres heads the center and is founder of Pitango, a venture capital firm with offices in Israel, New York and Silicon Valley. The collaboration is designed to bring together “corporate, academic, civic and government leaders” to promote projects in Chicago and Israel. World Business Chicago will help coordinate.

— Emanuel blows smoke about cigarette use among Chicago teens, by Better Government Association's Kiannah Sepeda-Miller: Mayor Rahm Emanuel's recent claim that Chicago has seen the largest drop in teen smoking nationwide is ""mostly false,"" according to PolitiFact. While federal data on cigarette smoking among high schoolers supports Emanuel's statement that Chicago has seen a 50 percent reduction in that realm over the last eight years, the same dataset shows at least nine other major school districts or counties came out ahead.

A message from Bet on Main Street Coalition: Legislators in Springfield are currently considering singling out small businesses owners who offer video gaming in their establishments for a tax hike. The reality is, video gaming helps support more than 6,000 bars, restaurants, VFWs, and American Legions, allowing them to hire more workers and invest more in their communities. Our community partners, like American Legion Post 1080 in Joliet, have made enough revenue from video gaming to pay off their mortgage and fund much-needed repairs. Already taxed a higher rate than out-of-state corporate casinos and race tracks, video gaming has been paying their fair share for years. In fact, 70 percent of out-of-state owned corporate casinos pay a lower tax rate than video gaming businesses.

How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “I just returned from Israel, where I observed their elections last week with our Kafe Knesset team . While there I had the chance to celebrate a bit early with friends and twin sisters Shirel and Sharona Berger at their new Tel Aviv vegan hotspot called Opa . Back in NYC this week, I’m planning to finally catch Ink before heading to celebrate the Passover holiday with friends in Mexico.”
How did you get your start in journalism? “It’s actually thanks to POLITICO Playbook! I had been working on Jon Huntsman’s 2012 presidential campaign with a focus on outreach in D.C. When the campaign asked if I would help with Jewish outreach, I gained newfound appreciation for just how segmented and siloed the Jewish and broadly speaking pro-Israel community is and how difficult it therefore was to efficiently reach the community at once. I long admired how Playbook was able to bring a hometown feel via a daily curated newsletter to an otherwise vast D.C. political community and decided to launch Jewish Insider’s Daily Kickoff briefing to convene the daily conversation among an otherwise informal Jewish political class. The Daily Kickoff is now coming up on five years and it’s been an epic ride! I’m super appreciative to our amazing team that works hard day in, day out to serve and add value for a highly engaged, top-notch readership each day.” Story Continued Below
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “I just finished Ronen Bergman’s book about the history of Israel’s targeted assassinations titled 'Rise and Kill First.' It’s a fascinating read, especially when you consider how seemingly minor events involving a few individuals can change the world as we know it. Thanks to my pal Mike Granoff, I’m now reading 'Totaled' by Brian Blum about the billion-dollar crash of electric car startup Better Place. Not to compare the two but when reading books like Totaled and John Carreyrou’s ‘Bad Blood’ about large-scale startup failures, I feel that we, as readers, are often able to get a more honest and complete picture than when we read about the wildly successful and more established companies of today.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “If we were having a conversation a few years ago about topics that JI might cover and decided to rank them from least divisive to most divisive, I likely would have listed business then politics and then religion. While covering religion within the Jewish community (not something we do a lot of at JI) certainly has its challenges, I’ve become more impressed lately with religion’s ability to create mutual respect in a way that politics hardly can. Take the United Arab Emirates, which just a few months ago officially recognized its growing Jewish community in Dubai. I had the chance to visit the community earlier this year and was struck by how conversations with leading government officials began with discussions of the commonalities of the Abrahamic faiths as means to establish comfort and respect in a way that talking politics simply would not.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “It has certainly sped up the news cycle in ways that are both challenging and exciting to cover. And almost every major national political story over the last several years has had a strong angle of interest to our readers, so I’m really proud and impressed with how our team at JI has continuously broken news and driven the news cycle time and again.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “I’m the youngest of six siblings and, thank G-d, have 22 nieces and nephews!”"

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print PARIS — Emmanuel Macron's diplomatic adviser, Philippe Etienne, is expected to take over as France's ambassador to the United States as part of a reshuffle of top French diplomatic posts.
The Cabinet has not yet confirmed the nomination, but two French diplomatic officials say the decision has been ""confirmed internally."" The foreign minister's chief of staff, Emmanuel Bonne, is expected to succeed Etienne as Macron's diplomatic adviser, according to a high-level diplomat, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of such nominations.
Macron left it late to pick a successor to the current ambassador to Washington, Gérard Araud, who is retiring at the end of this week. His replacement will manage one of France's key relationships, at a time when Paris has a host of disagreements with the Trump administration — on transatlantic trade, climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and other issues.
Other key French diplomatic positions are also set to change hands by the end of the year. French ambassadors to the United Nations, Beijing and Moscow are either retiring or moving on after completing their rotations. So far none of the potential replacements are women, despite Macron's stated goal of gender parity in senior public posts.
Etienne and the Elysée press office did not respond to a request for comment on whether he is in line for the post. The Cabinet may confirm the nominations this week.
""For a diplomat, discussing his wishes for future posts is as secret as discussing annual bonuses for a trader"" — French diplomat
A former ambassador to Germany and to the EU, Etienne was appointed Macron's diplomatic adviser at the start of his term and has counseled a leader who had little foreign policy experience when he took office two years ago. Etienne's knowledge of EU affairs and his network in Berlin were seen as great assets in Macron's drive to revamp the European Union.
But that drive has enjoyed decidedly mixed results — partly because Germany has not been as receptive as Macron had hoped to some of his ideas. And the diplomatic cell Etienne has led at the Elysée palace has not been universally admired by French diplomats. One described it as ""weaker"" and another as ""less effective"" than previous incarnations. While the cell hasn't seen the same wave of recent departures as other parts of the president's office, a shakeup is expected by the end of the year.

I write here about how President Trump’s signature tax cut law remains remarkably unpopular and could prove to be a drag in 2020. It’s part of this reason Trump is in Minnesota to tout the law on Tax Day today and the White House will remain focused on it for the week.
What’s changed — Via AEI’s Karlyn Bowman: “I think the two major developments on tax attitudes are that Republicans have lost the edge they once had as the party best able to handle taxes … And Democrats seem to be making headway by hammering away at the rich not paying enough.”
Buttigieg gets in — Our Daniel Strauss writes here about South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, already surging in early primary polls, officially joining the presidential field. Mayor Pete, as he likes to be called, faces longs odds of winning the nomination. But his generational appeal for an entirely new politics is clearly resonating.
Here’s what he told me in a recent interview: “So by 2054, when I get to the current age of the current president, the shape of the world then, both environmentally, economically, and beyond, that’s not a theoretical question; it’s a personal one that I have to prepare for just as a human being and I think that gives me a certain sense of urgency around the policy conversation, too.”

FORGET RECESSION — Deutsche Bank’s Torsten Slok: “We have updated our US economic outlook and we do not see a recession for the next three years. Growth will slow from 3% in 2018 to 2% and inflation pressures will abate and the Fed will stay on hold until the end of 2021 and long rates will stay low.”
GOLDMAN: TRUMP THE FAVORITE — Via a new report led by Goldman Sachs analysts Jan Hatzius and Alec Phillips: “An update and expansion of our prior work on the relationship between the economy and presidential election outcomes suggests that President Trump has a narrow advantage going into the upcoming election.
“First-term incumbents have a built-in advantage of 5-6pp in the popular vote, we find, and our economic forecast also gives the President a slim advantage. A somewhat negative net presidential approval rating only partly offsets this.”

TRUMP GOES AFTER THE FED AGAIN — Reuters’ Howard Schneider: “Trump said on Sunday that actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve have nicked U.S. economic growth and stock market gains by perhaps 30 percent, and that it should begin pumping money into the economy as it did during the 2007-2009 recession.

DON’T GET TOO BULLISH — Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg Opinion: “Data released last week provided more support for the notion of short-term stabilization in China, but there isn't yet a convincing longer-term case for higher growth, or for a less uncertain road for a global economy characterized by divergent performance among its systematically most important economies.” Read more.
POWELL NAVIGATES ANGRY PRESIDENT, TURBULENT MARKETS — NYT’s Jim Tankersley and Neil Irwin: “As soon as the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, finished speaking at his December news conference, it was clear, even to him, that he had blown it. Stocks were tumbling. Analysts worried that the Fed was steering the economy into recession. And …Trump was furious.
“Four months later, Mr. Powell and the Fed have mostly repaired the damage, ending a steady march of interest rate increases and signaling that their next policy move may well be a rate cut if the economy continues to soften. Markets have rallied and recession fears have cooled. But one challenge has only worsened for Mr. Powell: Mr. Trump and his escalating anger at the Fed.” Read more .
Speaking of the Fed, what do you need to be on the board? — WSJ’s Greg Ip: “Neither Stephen Moore nor Herman Cain, political allies that President Trump hopes to put on the Federal Reserve Board, has a Ph.D. in economics. For fans and even some foes, that’s a virtue, not a vice. In these populist times, knowing too much economics means you’re out of touch, arrogant, and wrong.

"PROGRESSIVES LINE UP BEHIND OMAR – It’s (almost) Mueller time – NUNES WATCH, CONTINUED — Dems ratchet up demands for taxes, finances",www.politico.com,politico.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/04/15/progressives-line-up-behind-omar-its-almost-mueller-time-nunes-watch-continued-dems-ratchet-up-demands-for-trumps-taxes-finances-424952,"‘SAFEGUARDING’ ILHAN OMAR — Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced over the weekend that the Capitol Police and House sergeant-at-arms were “conducting a security assessment” to ensure Rep. Ilhan Omar’s protection amid intensifying attacks from the right — sparked in part by the president — over her controversial comments about 9/11. A reality check: Pelosi’s announcement highlighted what Bres and Heather called an “extraordinary situation” — the House speaker is concerned for a congresswoman’s safety after an attack from the president of the United States. Pelosi wants Trump to take the video down, and the 2020 Democratic candidates took their own jabs at the president over the weekend.
Story Continued Below
Omar said late Sunday that she’s facing new and increasing death threats after Trump tweeted a video highlighting her remarks, which have come under fire from Republicans for appearing to downplay the terror attacks. The Minnesota Democrat said many of the threats “directly” reference Trump’s video. More from Bres and Heather: https://politi.co/2ZbTYQx
FIRST IN HUDDLE: PROGRESSIVES LINE UP BEHIND OMAR — It’s not just Democratic presidential candidates and congressional leaders who are rushing to Omar’s defense. More than 150 progressive leaders and groups signed a “solidarity” letter on Monday, condemning the “white supremacists and war criminals in the Trump administration” and praising Omar as a “visionary and inspiring leader.” More from your fill-in Huddle host: https://politi.co/2UzeiwC The letter: https://politi.co/2v54kEj
MUELLER TIME — Buckle up, folks. A redacted version of the Mueller report could come as soon as today from the Justice Department, and Washington is preparing for it exactly as Washington does. Team Trump is projecting confidence, with the president’s attorney Jay Sekulow framing it this way: “At the end of the day, it's like waiting for the jury verdict, except you know what the jury verdict is already.”
That’s probably wishful thinking. Barr seemed to indicate to Senate appropriators last week that he would not redact certain damaging information about the president. For example, we know from Barr’s summary that the special counsel uncovered evidence that Trump obstructed justice, but ultimately decided not to weigh in on whether to pursue criminal charges. Did Mueller seek to leave that question to Congress? We may soon find out.
Helluva lede from Darren Samuelsohn: “ The 400-page Mueller report, expected to land this week, is the most anticipated political read since Ken Starr, Monica Lewinsky and the stained blue dress—and potentially even juicier. But how do you wring that juice out of a behemoth of a legal document, full of redactions, at the speed of social media?” https://politi.co/2UklkjU

DEMS TO IRS: COUGH UP THE TAX RETURNS — House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) is giving the IRS until April 23 to hand over the president’s tax returns. That was after the agency missed Neal’s initial April 10 deadline, citing consultations with the Justice Department. Still, Democrats believe they are on sound legal footing. Neal said this weekend that the administration has no basis to “question or second guess the motivations of the committee.”
Democrats don’t expect the administration to comply , but Ways and Means Committee aides cautioned that a subpoena likely wouldn’t come until lawmakers return to Washington the week of April 29. More from Aaron Lorenzo: https://politi.co/2varUzb

Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) is moving forward with the subpoena without holding a full committee vote, citing the imminent two-week congressional recess.
Republicans are crying foul over the subpoena — but Democrats are determined to get their hands on the financial records, which they believe will help corroborate Michael Cohen’s allegations that Trump artificially inflated and deflated his wealth.

A TAX DAY TO FORGET — Lots of you probably got a tax cut this year thanks to the 2017 GOP tax bill. The problem for Republicans?

BURGESS SENDS ALONG A SCOOPLET — President Trump spoke about the ""penny plan"" when he visited with the Senate GOP three weeks ago, which has across-the-board spending cuts of 1 percent for several years in a row that would eventually balance the budget. Like everything Trump, he said he has something bigger: The ""nickel plan,"" which would be cuts of 5 percent, according to attendees.
This, of course, will never happen , but it shows how eager the president is to appear tough on spending as his party tries to negotiate a budget deal that will almost certainly increase spending by virtue of working with the Democratic House.

White House weighs travel restrictions for countries with frequent visa overstays -,www.politico.com,TED HESSON,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/travel-ban-visa-overstay-1356417,"The White House is weighing travel restrictions for nationals of countries with high rates of overstaying visas in the United States, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.
Some of the countries with the highest rates of overstaying temporary visas are in Africa. Chad, Burkina Faso, Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, Somalia, and South Sudan have among the highest overstay rates for short-term tourist and business visas, although they send relatively small numbers of travelers to the U.S. each year. During a meeting in January 2018, President Donald Trump reportedly referred to Haiti and some African nations as “shithole countries“ and questioned why their nationals should be admitted to the U.S.
The prospective action, which was also confirmed by a congressional staffer, comes amid a leadership shakeup among Trump’s top immigration staff. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen left her post last week and three other officials recently resigned or were pushed out. The departures clear the way for the White House to implement a range of new enforcement measures — including the prospective travel clampdown.
News of the prospective travel restrictions was first reported Sunday in the Wall Street Journal.
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told the Journal that reducing overstays remains a priority for the administration. The White House could issue a related presidential proclamation as soon as this week, a Homeland Security Department official told POLITICO.
Trump has focused intensely during his presidency on the flow of migrants at the southwest border, but devoted little attention to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who overstay a visa each year. In 2004, Congress called for the development of a biometric system to track arrivals and departures from the U.S. Successive administrations — including the current one — have failed implement biometric exit tracking, although Customs and Border Protection has conducted several pilots.
A 2006 report by the Pew Research Center estimated that up to 45 percent of the undocumented population entered the country on a valid visa, but did not depart. Roughly 11 million reside in the U.S., according to the organization’s latest analysis.
The Homeland Security Department counted 701,900 overstays of non-immigrant visas in fiscal year 2017, just 1.3 percent of all short-term visitors to the U.S. in that year."
Donald Trump to attend sumo match in Japan -,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/donald-trump-sumo-match-japan-1274818,"This story is being published by POLITICO as part of a content partnership with the South China Morning Post.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend the final day of the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo in late May and may be granted the honor of awarding the Emperor’s Cup to the victorious wrestler.
The White House has requested front-row box seats at the Ryogoku Sumo Stadium on May 26, the final day of the two-week tournament, and the Japan Sumo Association is making preparations for the visit.
Those preparations will include ensuring security for the president and his party while they are in the stadium that is at the heart of Japan’s national sport. Unless modifications are made to the boxes, the U.S. president will sit on the floor in a space about 1.3 meters square and about 5 meters from the raised clay “dohyo” where the wrestlers fight.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is also expected to attend the final day of the tournament, which will take place on the first day of Trump’s three-day visit to Japan.
A number of Hawaiian wrestlers have in the past risen to the highest ranks in this ancient and highly ritualized sport, although there are no Americans presently in the top levels of the sport and in with a chance of lifting the trophy.
Trump and Abe may also be joined at the event by the new emperor and empress of Japan as they traditionally attend one day of each tournament in Tokyo, although the emperor has his own box."
