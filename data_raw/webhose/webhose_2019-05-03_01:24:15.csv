I have a close Jewish friend who I met in the gym after one of his daily workouts. He’s 91.
When Hyman and I bumped into each other just outside the gym back then, we traded courtesies, yapped a bit about the political goings-on of the day and parted with the usual, “You know, we should have coffee sometime.” We did. In fact, we enjoyed our political chit-chats so much that we met for breakfast once a week for the next seven years.
Whenever we get together, breakfast is a side dish – history and politics is the feast. A feast mostly for me because, at his age, Hyman was an eyewitness to much of the history that shaped the modern world. Blessed with the gift of wisdom, he’s a living depository for golden life lessons he refined in the harsh crucible of early 20 th century living. Those lessons glisten as congealed nuggets of wisdom in the course of our conversations.
He’d say things like:
“Better to earn a penny working for yourself than a pound working for others.”
“The truth is rigid but lies … you can twist.”
“When a nation has too many cultures, it ends up with no culture.”
“Wealth doesn’t make you immoral. Poverty doesn’t make you moral.”
When Hyman was born in 1927, Hitler was six years from becoming Germany’s chancellor, he had just published Volume II of “Mein Kampf ,” and he was 11 years from invading Poland. Calvin Coolidge was president. And Israel, 21 years into the future, did not exist. View Cartoon
At breakfast, as Hyman meanders through the nooks and crannies of history, his own family history – steeped in the trials, triumphs and traditions of the Jewish people – never fails to surface. As I listen, I can’t help but think about the similarities between the unique history of black Americans and Jews.
Both groups were forced into slavery in a foreign country. Both suffered inhumane treatment for centuries. And, both relied on an incomparable faith in the God of the Bible to get them to the “Promised Land.” That’s why it was so natural for Martin Luther King, considered a modern-day Moses, to use the Jewish plight as a metaphor for the arduous journey of blacks through America’s wilderness.
“I just want to do God’s will,” King said in his “Mountaintop” speech the night before he was assassinated. “And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.”
But while the group experiences are similar, the group outcomes are vastly different today. Why? A few clues surfaced, for me, during my talks with Hyman – things that Jews did even while they were “poor as church mice,” as Hyman put it.
1. For Jews, building strong families, communities and traditions was never an option.
2. Jews exerted great energy into inculcating a culture of ambition, business ownership and high achievement in their children.
3. Jews doggedly insulated themselves against failure with an iron-clad refusal to live as perpetual victims of history.
I picked up many others, but another old Jewish group habit came to mind as I watched Jesse Jackson , Maxine Waters, Al Sharpton and others embrace Kim Foxx and Jussie Smollett this week.
Hyman said that growing up, his parents admonished him to monitor his public behavior by always asking, “What would the Gentiles say?” The question had nothing to do with bowing to the wishes of non-Jews. It simply told their children that as minorities, their behavior – good or bad – shapes how the world sees their family, and the Jewish people.
Jews tend not to excuse the bad behavior of other Jews just because they’re Jews. Character has no color.
Smollett concocted an illegal hate crime; was indicted on 16 counts by a grand jury; and was effectively exonerated on all counts by a black state’s attorney who was complicit in expunging and sealing his record. This reeked to high heaven.
“ This is consistent with best practices …,” Foxx shrugged. The 2,700-member National District Attorneys Association swiftly begged to differ. Smollett even invoked the honor of his poor mother and the history of his “ancestors” to buttress his innocence, although planet Earth knows he’s lying.
That’s pathological.
“It’s the correct thing that the charges were dropped,” Maxine Waters said in an interview at the NAACP Image Awards where she won the Chairman’s Award. “So, I’m hopeful that he’ll go on with his career and that he will be successful.” Recommended Cortney O'Brien
That’s even worse.
These same “leaders” excuse young blacks who don’t comply with police . They exonerate the OJs of the world. They throw out race cards against subjective “dog whistles” while ignoring the vitriolic Jewish hatred of Louis Farrakhan and Ilhan Omar . They wink at the most degrading aspects of hip hop culture. And, they vote for a party that perpetuates dependency, snuffs out the life of the unborn, and stoops to any low to get and hold on to power.
What should the “Gentiles” say?
What do I say? Most of this is not about advocating for black upward mobility, at all. It’s about a color-blind addiction to power where the faithful walk in rigid allegiance to the catechisms of progressive orthodoxy.
Think about it: Smollett, in a power position, paid two not-so-powerful brothers to create a hoax and, to save himself, is now implying that the brothers really beat him up. They’re black. The man mostly responsible for holding Smollett accountable, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson , has been ignored, humiliated and marginalized. He’s black. So is Clarence Thomas, who they hate. So was Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell, who they ridiculed as plantation “house slaves” because they served a Republican administration. This is not a “black thing.” It’s an ideological thing.
The root problem with many blacks, especially the loud-mouthed leaders and pundits, is that they’ve switched religions. They’ve “backslidden” from King’s Judeo-Christian ethic to embrace the cults of secularism, liberalism, leftism and progressivism – all under the cover of race.
The longer this remains true, the more likely it will be that blacks, as a group, will continue wandering in a political wilderness. But there’s a quicker way to the Promised Land. Just asked the Jews. "

"Looking forward, looking back: an evening with David Natzler",constitution-unit.com,The Constitution Unit,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://constitution-unit.com/2019/04/03/looking-forward-looking-back-an-evening-with-david-natzler/,"Looking forward, looking back: an evening with David Natzler Posted on by The Constitution Unit
On 19 March, the Unit held an event: ‘Challenges for Parliament: Looking Back, Looking Forward’, at which Sir David Natzler – who retired as Clerk of the House of Commons in February – spoke to Professor Meg Russell about his 40-year career in parliament. The discussion was both entertaining and informative; Dave Busfield-Birch summarises the key points.
Early days
Sir David first started working in the House of Commons in 1975, at what he called an ‘exciting time’, just two years after the UK had joined what was then known as the European Communities. His first assignment was as clerk to the European Legislation Committee, which was facing the novel challenge of sifting through the legislation passed by an unelected Council of Ministers sitting in the capital city of another country, and recommending which measures should be debated.
Parliament was unsurprisingly a very different place in the early years of Sir David’s Commons career. Talking of the key differences, he first spoke of how ‘expectations’ had changed significantly since then. For example, there were no limits on how long a Member could speak in those days. Whereas the Speaker (or one of the Deputy Speakers) can now impose relatively short time limits for MPs wishing to speak , that was not the case in 1975. Sir David considered this ‘almost one of the biggest changes’ of the past two or three centuries; that speaking for a long time can no longer be used to ‘destroy business’.
One of the other key differences between then and now is that the House of Commons lacked fiscal independence when he first started working there. It was instead reliant on the government for finance, thereby limiting its ability to take crucial decisions such as whether or not to recruit more staff. The Treasury hence had control of the Commons until the establishment of the House of Commons Commission in 1978, at which point the Commons became fiscally independent.
Select committees
There were, as Sir David noted, select committees before the establishment of the full system of departmental committees in 1979; but they tended to operate more broadly than their modern descendants. The Expenditure Committee, for example, had numerous sub-committees, each responsible for several departments. The Public Accounts Committee, which still exists, also dates from the pre-1979 period.
Following the St John-Stevas reforms , Sir David was assigned to the Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration. Whilst in that role he contributed to the committee’s report on what was known as the ‘sus’ law , which allowed police to stop, search and arrest members of the public simply on the suspicion they might be about to commit a criminal offence. It was a law disproportionately applied to young black men, and in the 1970s, a ‘Scrap Sus’ campaign began lobbying for the law to be abolished.
Within weeks of the sub-committee’s report being published, the government had changed its policy and later introduced what would become the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 . As good as the arguments in the report were, however, Sir David later learned that its influence on the policy change was slightly different than he had realised at the time. In the intervening years, he discovered that the then Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, had wanted to abolish the ‘sus’ law for some time, and rather than changing his mind, the report had given him political cover to make the change (against the wishes of the police) on the basis that parliament was in favour of it.
That example is indicative of the kinds of subtle impact that select committees can have ; as Sir David said, sometimes simply having an inquiry can lead to the government altering its position, by enabling ministers in favour of reform to make the political case for it within government.
As the select committees became more established and influential, membership became more attractive to MPs, and being a junior minister is no longer necessarily seen as a more attractive prospect than serving as chair of a select committee. One factor in this cited by Sir David has been the move to whole-House elections of select committee chairs (in 2010). Previously they were chosen by a committee’s members – who in turn were chosen by the whips, and given a strong steer on who the chair should be. So today’s chairs have a greater sense of representing the Commons, which influences their behaviour.
The expenses scandal
Sir David explained that when the Commons was made subject to freedom of information laws, staff had been preparing on the assumption that it was expenses relating to foreign travel that would upset the public the most. So this was where they focused their efforts when it came to tightening the expenses regime.
Notwithstanding those efforts, the expenses scandal focused largely on other matters and proved devastating for parliament, especially for its reputation and the public’s view of MPs. It forced the resignation of the Speaker for the first time in 300 years. The election of his replacement was conducted by secret ballot – the first time this method had been used – following an open campaign that included hustings (though the secret ballot system itself had been introduced shortly after the election of Speaker Martin, long before his position was at risk). The context of the Speaker election meant that a number of the candidates – including the eventual winner, John Bercow, and Sir George Young – sought election on a reform agenda.
The election of John Bercow then had a ripple effect; he later proposed that the Deputy Speakers should be elected in the same way as the Speaker, as they now are . Chairs of select committees now also earn their position by secret ballot. Sir David suggested that this has led to a change in the atmosphere within the Commons, with the two frontbenches having less control of appointments and backbenchers having more power.
The expenses scandal was, unsurprisingly, a ‘low point’ in Sir David’s career. However, it was also a catalyst for real and welcome reforms of the House’s procedures.
The Wright committee
One of Sir David’s proudest contributions was as drafter of the report of the Wright Committee (the Select Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons 2009–10) , on which he served as clerk, and for which Meg Russell worked as specialist adviser. This also arose as a direct consequence of the expenses scandal.
The committee sat for a relatively short period of time, but its report fundamentally changed the way in which the Commons works. Although Sir David claimed to have been slightly sceptical of having select committee chairs elected by the whole House at the time of the report’s publication, he now thinks it has had a positive impact.
He also spoke warmly of the creation of the Backbench Business Committee , which was included in the reforms as a direct result of research previously conducted by Meg Russell and Akash Paun (formerly of the Unit and now at the Institute for Government) on how other parliaments manage their agendas. The committee has, Sir David believes, been a resounding success. It has proposed debates on matters of great public interest that neither frontbench is keen to discuss, such as the Hillsbrough incident and reform of the support arrangements for people affected by contaminated blood and blood products .
One thing that did not come out of the Wright committee was the creation of a House Business Committee – the committee recommended this, and although the House of Commons voted for the principle it was never put into effect due to resistance from the 2010 coalition government . It remains an ‘oddity’ that unlike most parliaments, the Commons does not have control of its own business, much of which remains by default in the hands of the government. With a majority government, introduction of such a committee would perhaps have changed little. But in the current minority government situation, with the Commons seeking to ‘seize control’ of the agenda, it becomes more obvious what kind of difference it might have made.
Finally, Sir David spoke of how the Wright committee contributed to the creation of the Petitions Committee , which he was ‘thrilled’ had led to a massive input into parliamentary debates from a significant proportion of the public.
The B-word: how has parliament been affected by Brexit
The last topic of conversation was the subject that simply could not be avoided: Brexit. It has, Sir David agreed, led to an interest in the minutiae of parliamentary procedure that is unprecedented.
Sir David warned that the House of Commons having ever greater control means that extra care may need to be taken about the way parliament is perceived by the public. Brexit aside, and in more normal times, there is no strong reason to believe that policy crafted by the Commons would be any better than that crafted by the government.
As Brexit continues to unfold, procedure will, Sir David suggested, need to adapt accordingly. Meanwhile, he pointed out, the House of Commons has been widely seen to have handled Brexit poorly – whether or not that is really the case. This, he suggested, might give the House pause when it considers whether or not it wants greater control and an increased share of the political limelight.

HMRC urges loan scheme users to come forward now - GOV.UK,www.gov.uk,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/hmrc-urges-loan-scheme-users-to-come-forward-now,"Press release HMRC urges loan scheme users to come forward now Users of disguised remuneration schemes need to come to HMRC with information to settle their affairs before 5 April or face the loan charge. Published 3 April 2019 HM Revenue & Customs and HM Treasury
HMRC is encouraging users of disguised remuneration ( DR ) schemes to come forward to settle their tax debt by 5 April.
The majority of users will pay less by settling now than if they wait until the loan charge comes into force. Anybody who wants to settle their taxes should contact HMRC now and send all the information required by 5 April at the latest.
People affected by the loan charge can still benefit from the published settlement terms if they contact HMRC with a genuine intent to settle before 5 April and provide the relevant information, even if settlement cannot be reached until after that date.
By 5 April, scheme users should send through: their name and tax reference numbers (UTR), or National Insurance number the amount of loans received in each tax year whether you want to claim a benefit in kind offset - if so, how much and for which years the name of the employer who provided the loans
Anyone earning less than £50,000 and no longer involved in tax avoidance can spread their payments over 5 years minimum and won’t have to provide detailed supporting information about income and assets. For anyone earning less than £30,000, the spread of these payments can be extended to 7 years minimum.
An HRMC spokesperson said:
HMRC wants to do all that it can to help people get out of avoidance for good. We’re appealing to those who haven’t come forward to settle their disguised remuneration debts to do so now and send us the required information by no later than 5 April. If you’re concerned about your ability to pay, it’s still better to contact us now – we have a range of flexible payment options to consider, and no option will require you to sell your main home to pay off your debt.
People affected by the loan charge don’t need to pay the full amount in one go or by 5 April 2019. HMRC can help anybody who thinks they will have difficulty paying what they owe by spreading payments over a number of years.
There is no maximum time period for payment arrangements. HMRC will not force anyone to sell their main home to pay their disguised remuneration debts.
To support loan charge users, HMRC set up a dedicated helpline, complemented by a team to provide extra support to those who need it. It has redeployed staff to support scheme users and announced simplified payment arrangements.
As part of its continued work in this area, HMRC has announced that it is expanding its Needs Extra Support service to vulnerable customers when it looks into their tax affairs.
DR schemes are contrived arrangements that pay loans through a third party, often an offshore trust, in place of ordinary remuneration with the sole purpose of avoiding Income Tax and National Insurance contributions.
The loans are provided on terms that mean they are unlikely to be repaid, so they are no different to normal income and are, and always have been, taxable. HMRC ’s position on DR schemes has always been clear that DR schemes are designed to avoid tax and simply do not work. Further information Customers can contact HMRC through the dedicated helpline on 03000 534 226, or or speak to their usual HMRC contact. The loan charge, which was first announced in the 2016 Budget, will apply where people have not settled their tax and have DR loans made since 6 April 1999 that remain outstanding at midnight on 5 April 2019. Where people do not settle their tax and have loans outstanding they will have to pay the loan charge. Individuals who have not agreed a settlement or repaid their loans before the loan charge arises should submit an information return to HMRC , setting out their loan balance by 30 September 2019. They should also file their 2018 to 2019 Self Assessment tax return and pay the loan charge by 31 January 2020. Where the scheme user was in an employment-based loan scheme and the employer still exists and is UK-resident, they should tell the employer what the outstanding loan balance is by 15 April 2019. The employer will need to calculate the PAYE liability on that loan charge income, and make payment to HMRC either by 19 April 2019 (by post) or 22 April 2019 (online). The employer will need to report the loan charge amount to HMRC via Real Time Information from 20 April. HMRC has recently warned about new tax avoidance which claim to circumvent the loan charge. These will not work and people should not consider using them. Read Our recent Spotlight is on GOV.UK . "
Home Secretary launches Windrush Compensation Scheme - GOV.UK,www.gov.uk,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-launches-windrush-compensation-scheme,"News story Home Secretary launches Windrush Compensation Scheme The Home Secretary today opened a scheme to compensate members of the Windrush generation who were unable to prove their right to live in the UK. Published 3 April 2019 Home Office , UK Visas and Immigration , and The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP
The Windrush Compensation Scheme , which was designed in consultation with those affected and will have independent oversight, is the latest step in the government’s commitment to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation.
It will provide payments to eligible individuals who did not have the right documentation to prove their status in the UK and suffered adverse effects on their life as a result. These could range from a loss of employment or access to housing, education or NHS healthcare to emotional distress or a deterioration in mental and physical health.
Last April, the Home Secretary established the Windrush Taskforce that has helped over 3,600 people secure British citizenship. An independent lessons learned review, led by Wendy Williams, has also been set up to establish what went wrong and how to prevent it happening again.
Home Secretary, Sajid Javid said:
When I became Home Secretary I vowed to right the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation. We’ve been working tirelessly to fulfil that promise ever since and have helped more than 3,600 people secure the citizenship they were entitled to.
But it’s right that we compensate those who faced extreme difficulties and hardship – and this scheme will go some way in doing that. The Windrush generation have given so much to this country and we will ensure nothing like this ever happens again.
Martin Forde QC commented: I have been involved in advising the Home Office on the design of the Windrush Compensation Scheme, and I believe it is accessible and most importantly, fairly compensates those who have suffered. The scheme has been built on feedback from affected communities, and their personal stories have been crucial in its design.
The scheme is open to anyone from any nationality who has the right to live or work in the UK without any restrictions or is now a British Citizen, and arrived in the UK before 31 December 1988. It is also open to anyone from a Commonwealth country who arrived and settled in the UK before 1973. Certain children and grandchildren of those arriving before 1973 and some close family members may also be eligible to apply.
People who were wrongfully detained or removed from the UK could also be able to make a claim.
The Home Office will also refund fees paid for certain immigration applications that were unsuccessful, and reimburse certain associated legal costs that were incurred.
The scheme was shaped by evidence from affected individuals. The first call for evidence received 650 responses and a formal consultation on the compensation scheme generated responses from almost 1,500 individuals and organisations.
The Home Secretary appointed Martin Forde QC to oversee the design of the compensation scheme, providing independent scrutiny on the operation of the scheme. Share this page"

If $park¥ is the Worst chooses privately to avoid association with others on the basis of his bigotry, his action does not meet the definition of racism I suggested. It is when he participates in an organized system—of exclusion, or the denial of opportunity, wealth, honors, service, etc.—based on combining his bigotry with that of others, or on building social systems (including government) premised on mutual bigotry that he becomes a racist.
When that happens, the libertarian appeal to individual rights and individual initiative as a corrective has already failed. At that point, claims ring hollow that libertarianism, or the free market, or whatever, will solve in the future a problem those means have not solved previously.
It is then time for socially organized protection of those targeted—by means of private social action, or by government force—to take priority. Just societies can not tolerate among them people who, based on bigotry, paradoxically claim an individual right to act collectively and systematically to disadvantage others.
If you think that sounds tyrannical, understand that from the point of of view of those targeted by racism, it is anti-tyrannical. Public policy has no moral reason to prefer your view over your targeted victims' objections."

Dozens of videos show Biden acting very weird. What he is doing in these videos is very inappropriate. The vast, vast majority of people see the behavior for what it is: gross, weird, invasive, presumptuous, entitled, creepy, and wrong. The fact that he doesn't think he did anything wrong makes him an absolute jackass.
I understand he hasn't committed rape or sexual assault. But he has done something else that is very messed up.

The so-called “nuclear option” — or changing Senate rules using only a simple majority — is on track to be triggered a third time in recent years, creating a sense in the Capitol that it’s only a matter of time before the tool is used to lower the 60-vote threshold for passing legislation, reports Burgess. Laying the groundwork: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) first went down the nuclear road when he scrapped the supermajority requirement on certain nominees. Later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell enacted the nuclear option to confirm Supreme Court nominees. Now, the Kentucky Republican is gearing up to use the tool this week to speed up debate time for lower level executive nominees and District Court picks.

Killing the filibuster is something that is gaining steam on the left, with a number of 2020 hopefuls warming up to the idea. But it’s also been championed by President Donald Trump, who is frustrated that he has been unable to get his agenda through the GOP-controlled Senate. “It’ll go down the road,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.).

The New York lawmaker, a young rising star in the party and the fifth-ranking Democrat in leadership, is already considered to be part of the next generation of leaders. But after Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), the fourth-ranking Democrat and a Pelosi ally, decided to run for Senate, Jeffries now has the inside track to replace Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) once she and her top deputies retire. “It does give a clearer path,” said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.). Still, his ascension is far from guaranteed. Jeffries will have to contend with a young and hungry crop of lawmakers who will be eager to climb the leadership ladder.

BORDER BATTLE -- The House may soon vote on a resolution to condemn Trump’s threat to shut down the southern border, report Sarah and Laura Barrón-López. The idea was discussed at a leadership meeting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) office last night, though no timeline has been set. The measure could also include language backing asylum seekers, amid the White House’s threat to cut off support. The goal is to put every single Republican on the record over Trump’s border closure idea, which has created some serious heartburn in the GOP. The dispatch: https://politi.co/2OEXT3w .

TUESDAY’S MOST CLICKED: The Hill’s report on House Dems failing to agree on a budget resolution was the big winner.
WELL THIS DOESN’T LOOK GOOD -- Republican Rep. Mark Walker has been entangled in a federal corruption probe in North Carolina that has led to the indictment of a former Congressman and several others, scooped your Huddle host and Bres. A Walker-controlled political committee received $150,000 from business owner Greg Lindberg at the same time Lindberg asked the lawmaker to pressure North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey to replace his deputy, according to an unsealed indictment. Walker’s joint fundraising committee was created four days before receiving the donation from Lindberg, one of the individuals indicted for bribery. Walker denies any wrongdoing, while his office emphasized that he is not a target of the probe. “He has assisted the DOJ,” said a spokesman. Much more: https://politi.co/2Vf905Z .
TRADE TROUBLES -- One of Trump’s top legislative priorities appears to be in serious jeopardy on Capitol Hill. In an interview with our friends at POLITICO Playbook, Pelosi made clear that the House will not even consider Trump’s rework of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) until after Mexico has passed and implemented its major labor law reforms. She also said the text of the trade pact needs to be changed to ensure it is enforceable, which could further imperil the fate of the agreement. Trump, who has threatened to pull out of NAFTA if Congress doesn’t ratify his revamp, wants to have the deal finished by summer, which seems unrealistic at this point.

CHANGING HIS TUNE -- Trump repeatedly said he has no problem with special counsel Robert Mueller publicly releasing his full report on the Russia probe. But now, the president appears to be reversing course. “In a series of tweets, Trump disparaged congressional Democrats for their efforts to obtain the full report; noted that one of them had opposed the public release of grand jury information from independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s report on Bill Clinton; and tweeted a Fox News clip of lawyer Alan Dershowitz emphasizing that the Justice Department could keep the entire Mueller report confidential,” report Andrew and Kyle. “Democrats — who are gearing up to issue a subpoena for the full report on Wednesday — said Trump’s sudden hostility toward their efforts to obtain the report suggests he’s nervous about what Mueller found.” Much more: https://politi.co/2WHTpMr .

Disaster
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE -- Moderate Republicans are furious that the National Rifle Association has gotten involved in legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, reports the National Journal. The NRA issued a key vote against the bill after Democrats added language restricting gun rights. During a closed-door conference meeting, several GOP members expressed frustration that the NRA is pressuring them over the legislation, which the House will vote on today. Lawmakers in swing districts are now torn between crossing the powerful gun lobby or voting against legislation to combat domestic violence against women, which could hurt the party’s efforts to win back female voters.

I wonder when anyone is going to publish the split. By this I mean how much America export compared to how much it imports. I will bet that Mexico exports way more to America than the other way.
Mexico is allowing these migrants to travel hundreds of miles across it's country before reaching America's southern border. They have ample opportunity to round these migrants up and deport them long before they get close to the border. Instead, they literally allow them free passage through their county. Trump is absolutely right. Mexico is complicit in allowing the invasion by these migrants into America. It will not be until Mexico is affected financially in a big way that they will do their job in stopping these migrants free passage. For instance, Mexico could arrest anyone arrest anyone who aids and assists these migrants. Without assistance, these migrants would take months to cross the country and would likely not even start the journey if the knew the journey will take so long and they would likely never make it without food and water or transport. We all know that NGOs are helping these migrants. Many of these NGOs are American based and should be kicked out of Mexico if they are found to be operating in such a way against the interests of Mexico's biggest trading partner. This lack of inaction by Mexico is going to cost them and it is about time."
