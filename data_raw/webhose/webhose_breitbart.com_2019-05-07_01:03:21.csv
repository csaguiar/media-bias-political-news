For example:
-Enforce E- Verify and start locking up companies knowingly hiring illegals
- Enforce theft of ID and stealing of SS numbers laws which are felonies!! We Americans could go to jail for years. Only a few of these arrests would be necessary to send a message. Just make sure you get hard core bad illegals first or the MSM will scream ""breaking up families"".
-Make it a Fed Rule to stop all Federal aid, stipends, food stamps to illegals
These three along with above would bring immigration to almost a halt.
Finally have DOJ sue to not allow Anchor Babies. This never was the intent of the 14th Amendment/ It was to ensure that slaves would be granted citizenship as some Southern States were passing laws to not consider slaves citizens.
