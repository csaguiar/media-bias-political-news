Daisy Ridley as Rey in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Lucasfilm Ltd. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 5:22 PM GMT / Updated April 12, 2019, 6:24 PM GMT By Daniel Arkin It's finally here, ""Star Wars"" die-hards. The official teaser trailer for the latest entry in the sprawling franchise debuted Friday at a fan convention in Chicago, providing the first glimpse at one of the most anticipated movie releases of the year. The teaser for ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" the third installment in a sequel trilogy that began with 2015's ""The Force Awakens,"" opens with shots of Rey (Daisy Ridley) clutching her lightsaber in an arid desert landscape. It also flashes brief images of other fan favorites, including the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa, Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, Adam Driver as villainous Kylo Ren, John Boyega as Finn, and the lovable droid BB-8. The spot is narrated by Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, who tells his protégé Rey: ""We've passed on all we know. A thousand generations live in you now. But this is your fight."" The teaser closes with the sound of menacing laughter — most likely that of Emperor Palpatine, a central villain in the original trilogy and its prequels. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" does not pick up immediately after the events of the most recent chapter, ""The Last Jedi."" That's according to the new film's director and co-writer, J.J. Abrams, who also helmed ""The Force Awakens."" In a Q&A with late-night host Stephen Colbert at the Chicago event, Abrams said ""The Rise of Skywalker"" revolves around an adventure the main characters go on together. Abrams was joined on the stage by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and select members of the cast. Twitter lit up with reaction to the teaser, and various ""Star Wars""-themed hashtags dominated U.S. search trends. The feeling a Star Wars teaser gives me is unlike any other. Wouldn't trade it for the world. Bring it on #EpisodeIX "
Black hole picture could unlock new era in astronomy,www.nbcnews.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/black-hole-picture-could-unlock-new-era-astronomy-ncna993531,"When the first-ever direct picture of a black hole was unveiled Wednesday, scientists around the world were almost giddy over finally getting a chance to see one of the most mysterious objects in the universe. “A once-in-a-lifetime result,” exulted Shep Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope, the international team of scientists who created the image using a network of radio telescopes linked together to form a single, Earth-size observatory.
“I couldn’t imagine that I’d live to see a telescopic image of a black hole ,” said Jean-Pierre Luminet of the French National Center for Scientific Research, who created the first visualization of a black hole in 1979. Yale astronomer Priya Natarajan was more succinct. “My first reaction on seeing the image was: Wow!”
The remarkable snapshot shows a monster black hole 55 million light-years from Earth in the neighboring galaxy M87. Nicknamed Pōwehi by some members of the team (it's pronounced poe-vay-hee, a word from Hawaiian mythology meaning “embellished dark source of unending creation”), the object is 6.5 billion times as massive as the sun and has a diameter of 24 billion miles. Its mass and powerful gravity cast a shadow against the bright, hot gas swirling around it, creating a distinctive donut shape.
Scientists reveal first image of a black hole: 'We are delighted' April 10, 2019 02:03 The Event Horizon Telescope project is the culmination of a century of speculation about black holes , collapsed masses where gravity is so intense that no matter or even light can escape. Until now, scientists eager to understand these enigmas could study them only by indirect means: testing theories with computer simulations or watching how black holes’ intense gravitation affects matter and space around them . Now the objects are visibly, almost tangibly real.
Even more, the first picture of a black hole heralds a new era in physics. Now that they can observe these bizarre objects directly, experts say we can expect an avalanche of new observations — and new cosmic discoveries.
Einstein keeps acing the tests One of the most striking things about the image of Pōwehi is how closely it resembles black hole simulations created with the help of computer models. Those models are all based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity , making the match an impressive vindication of the famous physicist’s ideas.
“We were surprised by how clear the signature was,” Doeleman told NBC News MACH in an email. “Einstein’s theory of gravity predicts that we should see a ring of light, but to have it come through so clearly rocked us back on our heels.” (A small irony: Einstein himself didn’t believe in black holes , arguing that while his equations indicated that such objects were theoretically possible, they “do not exist in physical reality.”)
Related Science Science First-ever photo of a black hole reveals what had been unseeable The light ring around Pōwehi is distinctly lopsided, another predicted effect. Gas around the black hole is orbiting furiously, and the side that is circling toward Earth appears brighter than the side that is circling away. The pattern indicates that the black hole is rotating clockwise from our perspective, Heino Falcke, a radio astronomer at Radboud University in the Netherlands and a member of the Event Horizon Telescope team, said in an email.
The picture doesn’t reveal what happens at the event horizon, the theoretical “surface” of a black hole. The event horizon is one of the strangest predictions of Einstein’s relativity, the point of no return where time comes to a standstill. So far, the Event Horizon Telescope observations cannot confirm even the existence of an event horizon.
“It looks like an event horizon and it quacks like an event horizon, but you can never exclude something that is almost like an event horizon producing a similar shadow,” Falcke said. “Each competing model has to be tested one by one. The cool thing is — now we can.”
To warped space … and beyond The astonishing power of the Event Horizon Telescope means that a lot of other outstanding questions in astronomy become suddenly answerable, too.
“It gives us, for the first time, a way to test our predictions for how black holes digest matter and launch powerful jets of material that can disrupt entire galaxies,” Doeleman said. Such jets can grow 100,000,000 times as wide as the black hole itself, and nobody knows exactly how they form.
The regions around black holes are also extreme places where gas is heated to millions of degrees and whipped around at nearly the speed of light . They are natural laboratories for testing the outer limits of the laws of physics. “The next step is to sharpen the image further so we can study the dynamics of the black hole — how does it change, how does it affect its surroundings. This will let us go from making still images of black holes to making movies,” Doeleman said.
Pōwehi is just one of billions of supermassive black holes now thought to exist across the universe, in the centers of most large galaxies. Future upgrades to the Event Horizon Telescope will bring more of these objects into view, including Sagittarius A* (pronounced Sagittarius A star), the huge black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy. Falcke and the rest of the team have already made attempts to see Sagittarius A*, but our local black hole flickers rapidly, making it what he termed “an extra challenge.""
The Event Horizon Telescope will be a godsend for many other kinds of astronomical observations beyond black holes.
“The resolving power of the telescope is just astonishing,” Mustafa Amin and Andrea Isella, astronomers at Rice University, said in an email. (Its acuity is equivalent to reading the emails off an iPhone in New York City while lounging in a café in Paris.) They are eager to exploit that power to watch infant planets forming around other stars or to observe delicate structures in distant galaxies.
The possibilities are almost endless. First, though, Falcke and the other black hole sleuths are looking forward to some well-earned sleep. “People were worn out to get this massive amount of work done under this pressure,” he said. “It would be really good to pause for a moment and rethink the way we do things.”

"Retaliating against Democrats, Trump says he's considering sending migrants to sanctuary cities",www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-considered-dumping-migrants-sanctuary-cities-n993701,"President Donald Trump said Friday he is ""giving very strong consideration"" to a plan to bus detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities as a way to retaliate against Democrats. ""We'll bring them to sanctuary city areas and let that particular area take care of it,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""They say we have open arms, they're always saying they have open arms, let's see if they have open arms.""
The president also said he would send more troops to the border and painted the growing number of asylum seekers seeking refuge in the U.S. — many of them families with young children who cannot be imprisoned for a long period of time under current law — as a security problem.
Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 The president said he was weighing the idea because Democrats had blocked his efforts to change the country's ""very dangerous immigration laws.""
The president's statement came after a former Department of Homeland Security official said the plan, first reported by The Washington Post on Thursday night, was ultimately scrapped when it was determined to be ""so illegal."" A White House official who confirmed the broad outlines of the proposal Friday morning pushed back on the idea that it was meant as retaliation toward political rivals, however, calling that ""absolutely ridiculous.""
The official insisted the White House had never pressured Immigration and Customs Enforcement to put the plan in motion, but simply floated it to officials at the agency.
Trump: I'm considering releasing migrants in 'sanctuary cities only' April 12, 2019 07:06 DHS on Thursday night told NBC News the proposal had been ""a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.""
The White House official confirmed the idea came up twice — initially as a query to ICE about the possibility, and later to inquire why it wouldn't be legally doable. Matthew Albence, who starts Friday as acting head of ICE, was involved in the assessment of the plan and the ultimate conclusion that it would not be feasible.
The Post Quote: d DHS officials as saying the administration sought to release detainees in the San Francisco-based district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and in other strongly Democratic districts. It said the White House told ICE that the plan was partly meant to conserve jail space but also partly to ""send a message to Democrats.""
A source familiar with the plan told NBC News it was designed to ""somehow hurt Pelosi.""
Pelosi responded Friday, ""It is just another notion that is unworthy of the presidency of the United States and disrespectful, the challenges we face as a country, as a people to address who we are — a nation of immigrants.""
Following Trump's tweet that his administration was once more weighing the idea, White House principal deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement that Democrats ""should be working with the Administration to find the best ways to transport those illegal aliens that are already set for release, into communities in their states and districts.”
Another source, the former DHS official, told NBC News of the Trump administration's original thinking: ""Why release (migrants) into Yuma or Phoenix when you can release them in San Francisco where they want them?""
White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller at a Republican dinner in Columbus, Ohio, in August. Leah Millis / Reuters file The Post reported that two DHS whistleblowers independently reported the busing plan to Congress and that several DHS officials confirmed their accounts. Two DHS officials said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who is widely reported to have assumed control of U.S. border policy, discussed the proposal with ICE, according to The Post.
Related Politics Politics At the center of Trump's Homeland chaos, Stephen Miller is the lone survivor ""Sanctuary cities"" is a term used to describe jurisdictions that limit or ban cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Trump has accused Democrats of trying to "" turn America into one giant sanctuary city for violent criminals and MS-13 and other gang killers.""

John McCain, on Friday slammed the idea of a wall to curtail human trafficking at the southern border, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited as a problem in an attempt to build support for his long-promised barrier. ""The people that are coming over the border, for the most part, are not trafficked individuals,"" McCain told NBC News' Cynthia McFadden in an interview. ""It's people within our own walls, in our own borders, so a wall is not going to fix this, but education will and awareness will and strengthening our laws will."" She added, ""The misnomer in this is that somehow this occurs outside the country, that somehow its another country — not us, ever us. Well, it is very much us.

She currently serves on the Arizona governor's council on human trafficking and has worked with officials in her home state to raise awareness and fix laws around the issue. She also heads the human trafficking initiative at the McCain Institute and was in New York City to participate in the 10th annual Women in the World program at Lincoln Center. This past February, at an event on human trafficking , Trump claimed that human traffickers were ""going through a border where there's nobody for miles and miles, and there’s no wall to protect,"" adding that ""they come into our country and they sell people."" The president also repeated the claim in State of the Union address this year. In her NBC News interview on Friday, McCain also lamented the lack of civility in Washington and said that her husband, who died last August, would have wanted lawmakers to debate one another on the issues but work together on a bipartisan basis. ""I am quite certain he knows what's going on,"" she said. ""I know he'd be so upset over this because of the tenor, the lack of inaction on many members' parts, specifically on members of Congress. He would've been right in the mix saying we're going to work together, please let’s not fight. That's who he was."" She added: ""Oh, he loved a good fight. Heck, yeah.

Prenuptial agreements: What is a prenup and should I get one?,www.nbcnews.com,Nicole Spector,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/prenuptial-agreements-what-prenup-should-i-get-one-ncna993616,"When two people get married , they’re not just uniting their bodies, hearts and souls; they’re also joining their financial assets . It’s a terribly unromantic fact — and probably the last thing anyone wants to talk about at length when they first get engaged. Questions like “Should we get a prenuptial agreement?” can be downright buzzkills.
But if you’re planning to get engaged or already are, this is an important topic to unpack together .
We’ve set out to answer a number of questions you might have about prenups by consulting divorce lawyers and financial experts, along with a relationship therapist.
What is a prenup, exactly? “It is a legal agreement entered into between two people before they are married that that can cover a wide variety of issues centered on property rights and assets,” says Ike Z. Devji, of-counsel asset protection attorney in Phoenix, Arizona. “In addition to the traditional role that most people think of (dictating the division and distribution of a variety of physical assets and setting terms for any required spousal maintenance at divorce), pre-nups can also cover death, incapacity, estate planning, student debt , spousal support and a variety of other legal issues including the division and attribution of income earned during marriage.”
What is the purpose of a prenuptial agreement? There are many, but “one of the main reasons to sign a prenup is to deviate from what the law would provide in the event of a divorce,” says Elysa Greenblatt , a divorce lawyer in NYC. “People often want to protect their assets from distribution and a prenup is the obvious answer. There are other reasons that might not come to mind as quickly [such as] if one party has a child from a prior marriage — it can be important to have a prenup so that the parent can support that child with marital income. Another reason has to do with the fact that divorce laws vary state by state. If you live somewhere that has laws of equitable distribution but you may move to a community property state, it is important to protect your assets and set how they will be distributed.”
Russell D. Knight , a divorce lawyer in Florida, says that often people want a prenup so they can keep what they brought into the marriage, which the law typically already protects — it’s when financial assets get commingled that things get complicated, and that, as Knight points out, “happens easier than you think.”
“ Buying a house together with just one person's money is commingling. Starting a business together using one person's capital is commingling. Moving money around more than a few times can even qualify as commingling,” says Knight. “The longer you've been married, the more you are likely to commingle your assets [and have] non-marital assets turn into marital and, thus, divisible assets.”
Aren’t prenups just for rich people? Nope.
“Typically, you think of a prenuptial agreement as being for those individuals with substantial means to protect,” says Marcia Mavrides , a divorce attorney in Massachusetts. “This isn’t always the case anymore, and in fact, many millennial clients hire Mavrides Law (my firm) to assist them with a prenup to protect them from their future spouse's student debt and visa versa. Even though these individuals may have significant earning potential, they realize that they should each be responsible for their own student loans. The best part is that these couples have discussed their financial situations in great detail before hiring attorneys to draft a prenup, so there are no unpleasant surprises.”
How much does a prenup cost? There’s no fixed cost here, as it depends on both geography and how much negotiating takes place.
Kelly Frawley and Emily Pollock , both matrimonial and family lawyers in Manhattan, say a prenup in their pricey area ranges between $7,500 and $20,000 per party.
Vicki L. Shemin , a family law attorney and mediator in the Boston area, estimates that a prenup “would cost at least $2500 — but could cost tens of thousands of dollars.”
If you’re in a situation where your betrothed has the bulk of the assets (that would be protected under the prenup), then they should cover the costs of your counsel, which Frawley notes is common practice.
To get a better idea, you should absolutely meet with a lawyer for a consultation.
“A consult can be no fee, or it can be priced at an hourly rate,” says Frawley.
What You Need to Know About Renting Vs. Buying a House Oct. 30, 2017 02:27 How long does a prenup take? Again, it depends. Typically, the more assets you or your partner bring to the table (and the more ardent your lawyers), the longer this will take.
“Ideally, you should start the prenup conversation with your spouse shortly after getting engaged,” says Mavrides. “You and your fiancé should each find an attorney and begin the drafting process at least six months prior to your wedding.”
You may even start exploring prenups before you get engaged.
“I had a case this year where we did a prenup before they got engaged,” says Pollock. “The earner had a strong feeling about conditions under which he was willing to be married. He had to be sure [his prospective fiancee] agreed what marriage looked like before he was willing to do it.”
The couple did end up getting engaged.
Do both parties need a lawyer for a prenuptial agreement? While you might be able to find a lawyer who will draft up a prenup for both of you, this is highly inadvisable. So, to be safe, the answer is yes.
“One of the hallmarks as to whether a prenup is ‘fair and reasonable’ at the time of execution is whether a party had an attorney at the time the document was being negotiated,” says Shemin. “Personally, if I am the mediator, or even if I just represent one party, I insist that the other party have counsel. This is the general practice. Parties can work with one mediator, or, one lawyer to do the drafting — but each party should/must (if not legally, then advisedly) have his/her own counsel. Since prenups are governed by state law, although this may vary state-to-state, it is generally considered the advisable and preferred practice.”
Related Good Cents Good Cents Financial infidelity: Why we lie about money and how to solve the problem Can prenups be thrown out? As legal contracts, one would think that prenups would be set in stone, but in exceptional cases, they can be broken in divorce.
“Prenups are not ironclad and can be overturned on a number of circumstances,” says Megan Gorman , managing partner at Chequers Financial Management. “If one party had a significant windfall, it would be prudent to speak with the attorneys who handled the prenup to understand your rights. There might need to be changes made to the prenup. Keep in mind things evolve and that the best course of action is to always be open with your spouse on finances.”
Can I get a prenup online? Technically yes, but you’re likely wasting your time and money.
“Obtaining a prenup online is not advisable,” says Gorman. “There are complex legal issues at play. You need to understand your rights. An online approach is risky and will likely have holes in the event of a divorce.”
A ‘postnup’ is also an option If entering into a prenup is not something you can afford in terms of time or money before your wedding, you can absolutely arrange a postnuptial agreement after you’re married.
“The cost is the same and the process is the same [as a prenup],” says Pollock. “Commonly with a postnup though there’s a specific purpose, or a live event that triggers re-examination, such as the purchase of real estate, where you want to specify how that would be distributed — or someone is thinking about leaving the workforce and wants to negotiate how assets should be distributed.”

This is perhaps another article in itself, but Dr. Fran Walfish , a relationship therapist in Beverly Hills, shares three quick tips on navigating this potentially touchy conversation:
1. Admit that this is a tough but necessary talk “Tell your beloved intended that this is a hard conversation to have and that you want to make it as productive as possible. All of us struggle to hear difficult things. When you share and expose your vulnerability the other person feels safe to do the same with you.”
2. Discuss in a peaceful environment “Be sure you are in a quiet place with no distractions so you can focus on the other person.”
3. Listen patiently and mindfully “Be ready to accept anything the other person says. You don't have to agree but listen openly without becoming defensive. If you are shy and don't know what to say, offer compassionate reflection of what you hear the other person saying. This allows the other to feel heard, validated and accepted.”

Chinese woman arrested at Mar-a-Lago indicted on two counts,www.nbcnews.com,Tom Winter,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/chinese-woman-arrested-mar-lago-indicted-two-counts-n993976,"Yujing Zhang, the Chinese citizen arrested at Mar-a-Lago in March while President Donald Trump was at his nearby golf club, was indicted Friday. The short, two-page indictment gave no new information about how Zhang allegedly got into Trump's resort in Florida two weeks ago. She was charged with two counts — unlawful entry of restricted buildings and grounds and false statements to law enforcement.
The FBI began investigating Zhang as a possible spy after her arrest. Federal authorities told a judge on Monday that she lied repeatedly to Secret Service agents while carrying computer malware unlike anything a government analyst had ever seen. When they searched her hotel room, they found she had more than $8,000 in cash, along with an electronic device that detects hidden cameras.
When Zhang entered the club in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 30, she was stopped by Secret Service agents at a security checkpoint, according to court documents. She showed two Chinese passports with her name and photograph to the agents, who then took her to Mar-a-Lago security to see if she was a member of the club.
Mar-a-Lago allowed Zhang to enter, according to the documents, because part of her name matched that of a member of the club. Zhang gave a nondefinitive answer when asked if that member was her father, according to the court documents, and was admitted by the club ""due to a potential language barrier issue."" She was taken by shuttle to a second checkpoint.
Yujing Zhang, charged with bluffing her way into President Donald Trump's Florida resort, is seated upon arrival with U.S. Marshals, awaiting for the start of her hearing at the U.S. federal court in this courtroom sketch, in West Palm Beach, Florida on April 8, 2019. Daniel Pontet / Reuters Zhang had said she intended to go swimming at the club, and at the second checkpoint, when she appeared unsure of where to go, according to the arrest affidavit, she told a club receptionist she was at Mar-a-Lago for a United Nations Chinese American Association event later that evening — a nonexistent event. The receptionist alerted a Secret Service agent, who detained Zhang for questioning.
In the arrest affidavit, the agent said Zhang spoke very good English and during questioning ""became verbally aggressive with agents.""
She was found carrying four cellphones, a laptop, a hard drive and a thumb drive, but no swimsuit. After a preliminary forensic investigation, the thumb drive was found to contain ""malicious malware,"" according to the affidavit.
Zhang's arrest has raised questions about Mar-a-Lago's security during the president's visits. There's no evidence Zhang ever approached the president, who was at his nearby golf course when she arrived.

Niall Carson / Press Association via AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 4:07 PM GMT By David Ingram Governments on at least four continents are stepping up their calls to regulate Facebook, YouTube and other social media companies after years of frustration with how technology companies have managed violent content on their services. With a wave of new and proposed laws in recent weeks, the governments — not including the United States — are making a sweeping challenge to the freewheeling speech rules of the internet that have opened up politics to new voices but also allowed violent extremist groups to flourish. Australia this month threatened prison time for technology workers in a law it passed to fight violent imagery online. The British government has proposed a new internet regulator that could fine senior managers if they don’t meet a “duty of care” to users, while Europe has moved forward with proposals for stricter regulation of both terrorist content and copyrighted material . Singapore is considering a law that would penalize technology companies that publish falsehoods, and internet freedom activists in Thailand say a new internet security law there amounts to “cybermartial law.” Canada this month added itself to the list of exasperated countries asserting control, warning of possible financial penalties or other regulatory options if social media firms do not do more. In the U.S., social media companies have been under a near-constant barrage of criticism, including from local and national politicians. This week, representatives for technology companies were called to testify before two congressional hearings with antithetical concerns: one on the rise of white nationalism , and another on the dangers of censorship . And while some politicians have suggested a variety of ways to regulate technology companies, none has offered laws that would force such companies to more aggressively moderate their platform. Such laws would conceivably run afoul of U.S. free speech guarantees, which go further to bar censorship than elsewhere in the world . While growing public scrutiny of social media companies and a history of light-touch regulation have provided the backdrop for the foreign governments' proposals, free-speech advocates expressed concern that the pendulum could swing dramatically toward heavy-handed censorship. “Governments have been really jealous in a way of company control of online speech, and they’re pushing back,” David Kaye, the United Nations’ special rapporteur for free expression, told NBC News in a phone interview. The challenge technology firms face to enforce even their own rules was on display last month when a gunman used Facebook to livestream his attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which he killed 50 people. Facebook and YouTube said they blocked millions of copies of the graphic video, but couldn’t always keep up with people trying to spread it. That followed earlier complaints from elected officials and regulators about the spread of terrorism content and the use of social media by anonymous users to meddle in elections. Changing, fast and slow The companies and their trade associations are pushing back in each country with an array of arguments, saying they want to work with the authorities and noting the thousands of people they’re hiring to moderate content. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in a phone interview that the social network knows it has to do more to earn back people’s trust after two years of scandals about privacy, violent material and its role in politics. “What you’ve seen in the last kind of year and a half is we’re running the company very differently,” Sandberg said. “I used to spend more than half my time, the majority of my time, on the growth and the business, and now I spend the majority of my time on protection and security.” Responding last month to the Christchurch shooting, Sandberg said in a blog post that Facebook was exploring restrictions on who could broadcast live on the service. April 9, 2019 05:43 But it’s not clear the companies are changing fast enough for many politicians. “The era of social media firms regulating themselves is over. It’s time to do things differently. It’s time to keep our children safe,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a video message posted Monday, the day her government published its regulatory proposal. The argument goes to the heart of social media’s hugely profitable business model: showing ads alongside content posted at will by mostly nonprofessional users, generally without the companies paying for the content or being liable for it. Kaye said the proposed laws come as social media companies have shown some success in better regulating their platforms with technology and the willingness to spend money on human moderators. Facebook employs 30,000 people in its safety division. “The companies have never been better at taking down content,” he said. But how these systems work is still mostly a secret to the public. Some civil society groups, which for years have been allies of the technology companies in opposing strict regulation, say they also have been frustrated by the companies’ failure to be transparent about their systems. “Technologically, they’re not able to explain to regulators what algorithms they use, and so of course the regulators are going to be frustrated,” said Lucie Krahulcova, a Melbourne-based policy analyst for Access Now, which promotes free expression online. Truth and consequences The idea of using criminal law, not just civil liability, to clamp down on online content is particularly unusual in democratic countries such as Australia. Under the law passed this month by Australia’s parliament, technology companies must “expeditiously” take down “abhorrent violent material” or face enormous fines, and employees face prison terms of up to three years. The law passed in the span of a couple days with little public debate. Krahulcova said the result was a slapdash measure with vague definitions — but possibly a political winner ahead of Australian elections next month. “The general public doesn’t have that much empathy for the tech companies, but there’s not also not as much awareness of free speech or the right to data protection,” she said. Faced with criminal penalties, companies will err on the side of removing content, said Eileen Donahoe, executive director of Stanford University’s Global Digital Policy Incubator. “There will be so much over-censorship out of fear of having criminal consequences,” she said. Advocates for free expression said they fear that authoritarian governments will copy laws like Australia’s, using the example of democratic countries as cover for violations of human rights. “People who are critical of the government are arrested and tried for spreading their political beliefs under the same laws meant to stem the spread of false information on social media,” said Sanja Kelly, director for internet freedom at Freedom House, a nonprofit that advocates for civil liberties worldwide. Hate speech removals on YouTube 'complex,' says Google rep at hearing April 9, 2019 03:42 Singapore’s law has also caused alarm among free speech advocates who worry that it could be used to expand the government’s ability to target opposing politicians and journalists . Freedom House warned in a report last year that “digital authoritarianism” was on the rise , citing Chinese censorship, privacy failures by firms such as Facebook, and moves by various countries to restrict speech online under the guise of fighting false news stories. One way technology companies could sidestep regulations may be to shift their emphasis from public posts toward private, encrypted messages — hidden from government view and from the companies themselves. Last month, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company was planning such a move , though he did not say it was to avoid government oversight and the network’s news feeds aren’t going away soon. In a report last month, researchers at New York University recommended various steps the companies could take, such as removing any content that is provably false — something that Facebook does now only in cases of imminent harm or voting misinformation. “The social media platforms spent a long time minimizing and downplaying problems in 2015, 2016, into 2017, and only recently began to acknowledge that the problems existed,” Paul Barrett, the report’s author, said. “Even today, they’re taking relatively small steps, rather than the sort of dramatic, demonstrative, policy changes that might have caused governments to hold off,” he said.

Kimberly Foxx called for the independent probe after she was raked over the coals for suddenly dropping all charges against the ""Empire"" actor just a week after he was indicted on 16 felony counts of filing a false police report. Dueling protesters clash over Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office's decision to drop all charges against Jussie Smollett in Chicago on April 1, 2019. Paul Beaty / AP file “A former prosecutor, Inspector General (Patrick) Blanchard has been conducting independent inquiries for Cook County for over a decade,” Foxx said in a statement. “Ensuring that I and my office have the community’s trust and confidence is paramount to me, which is why I invited an independent review of this matter. I welcome this investigation and pledge my full cooperation and the cooperation of my office as IG Blanchard conducts his review.” The Cook County Inspector General's office is a watchdog for Cook County government looking to ""detect, deter and prevent corruption, fraud, waste, mismanagement, unlawful political discrimination and misconduct,"" according to the OIIG website . Smollett alleged he was the victim of a hate crime, telling police on Jan. 29 that he had been beaten up by two masked men in the swanky Streeterville neighborhood while he was out getting food. The actor, who is gay and black, claimed his attackers hurled racist and homophobic slurs before punching him, putting a noose around his neck, and dousing him with what he said was bleach. Jussie Smollett leaves following his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago. Nuccio DiNuzzo / Getty Images file But soon police began to suspect that Smollett had made up the story. Foxx recused herself from the racially charged case in February, before Smollett was charged, and handed it over to her deputy. At the time, a representative from her office said the recusal ""was made to address potential questions of impartiality based upon familiarity with potential witnesses in the case."" But suspicions were raised that Smollett might get a sweetheart deal after The Chicago Sun-Times reported that Tina Tchen, a Chicago lawyer and former chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, had put Foxx in touch with members of Smollett's family days after he told police about the alleged attack. Foxx found herself on the defensive after the charges against Smollett were dropped. The decision was ripped as a ""whitewash"" by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the local police union, the Fraternal Order of Police, asked the Department of Justice to investigate Foxx’s role in the decision to not prosecute Smollett. Foxx's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton insisted that the Smollett case was treated no differently from the more than 5,700 other “cases for alternative prosecution” that the office has handled in the past two years. Later, Foxx herself said she played no role in the decision to drop all the charges and insisted he did not get special treatment from her office. “Mr. Smollett was afforded the same opportunity that anyone in Cook County who had a nonviolent offense and the required background check would get,” Foxx told NBC Chicago. “I was not part of the charging decision.” Corky Siemaszko "

SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 6:10 PM GMT By Martha C. White Wells Fargo’s better-than-expected earnings contributed to stock gains for the financial sector, but this good news could be short-lived, as analysts look at what lies ahead for the beleaguered bank. Wells Fargo beat analysts’ expectations when it reported second-quarter earnings on Friday of $1.20 per share, above the consensus forecast of $1.09 per share. It recorded $21.6 billion in revenue versus $21 billion expected. But its stock fell even as the broader market rallied on the strength of record earnings from JPMorgan Chase and the announcement of a new video streaming service from Disney . “Numerically, for the quarter, earnings were okay but management dropped guidance, in particular, for net interest income for the full year,” said Morningstar analyst Eric Compton. “There’s still just a lot of negatives overhanging that."" “Fundamentals remain challenged with loan and deposit balances declining,” David Long, managing director of equity research at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a research note. Long also noted lower net income on interest, and noninterest income that came in lower than expected. It struggled with lending, as well. “Loan growth was pressured by declines in all categories except [commercial real estate], while deposit balances were lower for both interest- and noninterest-bearing balances,” Long said. While the banking sector overall faces the risk of slowing global economic growth and deteriorating credit quality, Wells Fargo also faces self-inflicted problems, with a tarnished reputation and regulatory disciplinary actions stemming from a huge fake-account scandal. Just two weeks earlier, the bank caught the market by surprise by announcing CEO Tim Sloan, a three-decade veteran at the company who became chief executive in 2016 following the departure of John Stumpf, will leave by the end of June. “It isn’t good to see a bank without an official leader,” Compton said. “It’s not the best situation, for sure.” Stumpf had been at the helm when the bank was conducting activities that would eventually cost it billions in fines and penalties, from opening up accounts without customers’ knowledge and then charging them fees, to requiring customers to pay for unnecessary services and overcharging them on others. Earlier in March, Sloan had come under fire from Washington and Wall Street alike for his testimony to Congress, during which he faced bipartisan ire from Representatives on the House Committee on Financial Services who questioned whether or not the bank had really changed its ways. Following the announcement of his departure, vocal bank critic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., weighed in, tweeting , “Tim Sloan should have been fired a long time ago. He enabled Wells Fargo's massive fake accounts scam, got rich off it, & then helped cover it up.” What Sloan’s sudden replacement by general counsel and interim CEO Allen Parker ultimately means for Wells Fargo is less than clear. “At this stage, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on what this change means, given that the range of potential successors is wide,” Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden wrote in a note to clients. “I think what happened at Wells is the culture and the systems had been so ingrained with all these different mechanisms for basically overcharging their customers and not doing right by them,” said banking analyst Bert Ely. “It’s not an overnight job to change the culture and eliminate these processes.” Doing so will be a big job, one which has ramifications for choosing Sloan’s successor, Ely said. “There’s no question the next CEO has to come from outside,” he said. “The challenge is, who’s that going to be?” Martha C.

READ MORE The Meghan Markle effect is in full swing — or should we say full term.
Since the Duchess of Sussex — who has officially given birth to a baby boy — announced her pregnancy last fall , fashionistas have been watching her every public move, keen on observing what she wears and how she wears it.
Markle's streamlined and classic wardrobe may be pricey, but it isn't difficult to imitate. Tim P. Whitby / Getty Images file Such scrutiny isn’t new for Markle, whose style has grown to be iconic since stepping foot into the royal limelight. Anyone with a taste for fashion (myself included) has long been taking note of her consistently chic outfits — from her trove of sharply cut, form-fitting dresses and wide-collar twill coats, to her collection of power blazers and no-nonsense shoes (including versatile flats).
Markle’s looks are on our radar in part because, as Vanessa Valiente, a personal stylist and creator of V-Style , a fashion and travel blog points out, “she’s giving royal style some edge,” but also because they’re not that difficult to imitate.
“There is a strength and versatility to her look [that] is actually very easy to copy on a budget ,” says Valiente.
If you got it, flaunt it (baby bump included) Taking this a step further, when you consider that historically maternity wardrobes haven’t exactly screamed glamour, it’s exciting to see a celebrity of such regal stature show off her baby bump in show-stealing looks.
“I think she's reinforcing the idea that you don't have to ‘check out’ of style when you're pregnant,” says Jennifer Mackey-Mary, owner and stylist at Everyday Style . “In fact, pregnancy can be an opportunity to try something new and be a little bolder. These aren't clothes you're going to have forever, and embracing the bump can let you try styles you might be self-conscious to try otherwise. Pregnancy celebrates the female form, and Markle's style choices are putting her bump front and center — there's no hiding going on there. It's something every pregnant woman can be inspired by.”
Such inspiration is evident when you consider just how much people are searching for Markle’s maternity looks online.
Fadel Senna / AFP - Getty Images Searches in Markle maternity looks are soaring According to SEMrush , a trends data provider, the number of search queries around Meghan Markle's maternity style increased by 554 percent since October 2018, detecting a strong correlation between searches for Meghan Markle maternity style and her ASOS maternity dress , which surged in search by 68.6 percent since she was first seen wearing it.
Love the Sales has been cataloging Meghan Markle's maternity wear (amassing 75 outfits so far) and notes that searches for brands she wore soared on their site as well. For instance, Karen Gee (who designed the white sheath dress Markle donned in October ) saw a search performance boost of 5,800 percent. Outland Denim, which makes sustainable jeans that Markle has worn out and about, saw a search spike by 3,900 percent since Markle started wearing them.
Markle’s maternity wardrobe wasn’t cheap — but yours can be So, here’s the catch: while Markle does sport the occasional fast fashion dress that won’t break the bank, the Duchess of Sussex’s wardrobe is overall, really expensive. Like, you could buy a house with this money.
“We’ve [estimated] that Meghan's maternity wardrobe has cost over half a million dollars,” says Liam Solomon, marketing manager at Love The Sales. “A lot of this price comes from the fact that many of these pieces were specifically designed for her by [high end brands, including a bespoke Oscar de la Renta dress that cost over $13k.”
Hannah Mckay / Reuters file Keep it simple — most of these maternity looks aren’t flashy These hefty price tags seem to contradict the idea that any woman can copy Markle, but keep in mind that save for the fancy galas, most of Markle’s outfits aren’t that dramatic, meaning they’re easy to mimic on a budget.
“Her look is [mainly] a series of clean lines, structured outerwear and neutral colors with the occasional bold dress or edgy detail,” says Valiente. “She does a ton of monochromatic looks and is [basically] living in black jeans. You can easily find those.”
Valiente recommends shopping on Hatch (Markle has sported at least one maternity dress from this brand) when the site has a sale.
“ A Pea In The Pod [also has sales], and you can also buy second hand styles on B to B Maternity,” says Vaiente. “Top if off with a structured coat or open blazer, which does not have to be maternity by the way, and you are good to go.”
Mackey-Mary adds that Markle has a penchant for “strong, architectural silhouettes.”
“She lets the clothes (and the impeccable fit) speak for themselves. She doesn't hide behind lots of ruffles or volume, or overly girly prints. Bodycon dresses like this are an easy way to copy Markle's style,” says Mackey-Mary, pointing to a bodycon maternity tank dress on Old Navy for $30 .
Check out Meghan Markle-centric blogs and Pinterest “There are several blogs that actually capture what Meghan wears on a daily basis and will give you links to products that are similar to what she wore,” says Mattie Givens , a lifestyle blogger who is currently pregnant. “I personally find it helpful to use the image search feature in Pinterest to search for lots of options that look similar to what she wore in the photo I am searching. You can find a lot of great designer dupes that way.”
Pinterest also has a burgeoning realm for “ Meghan Markle Knockoff Outfits .”
Also check out WhatMeganWore.net, Meghan’sFashion.com, and Good Housekeeping’s growing photo gallery , which gives links to inspired looks at a much lower price.
Fast fashion sites sold out of Meghan’s dresses — but there are others to choose from Solomon points out that the majority of consumer interest in Markle’s wardrobe when shopping on Love the Sales centers upon her more affordable choices. The problem is, those H&M, ASOS, and J. Crew pieces sell out fast, primarily because they’re not expensive.
If the exact Markle dress you’re seeking from one of these retailers isn’t available anymore, don’t end your search; chances are you can find something similar from the same retailer.
Take the H&M cream knit number Markle wore this past winter that was shockingly, reduced to only $17 (down from $35). That dress is mostly out of stock, but there are other dresses on H&M that have a similar vibe, like this ribbed jersey dress for $25. It’s a darker color, yes, but bear in mind that based on Love the Sales analysis, Markle’s predominant color choices are navy blue and black.
Accessorize, accessorize... If accessorized properly, a form-fitting sheath that goes just past your knee can help you achieve a very Markle look for a very unremarkable price.
“Even if you're not walking around in sky high stilettos, the details matter. A chic handbag or tote ( this is a great budget friendly swap for Markle's pricier tote ) and pointy-toe flats make every outfit look more expensive,” says Mackey-Mary.
Facundo Arrizabalaga / Reuters file Attending a fancy work dinner? Give ‘Rent the Runway’ a spin ASOS has a great collection of “occasion” maternity clothes (and an up to 50 percent off sale happening now ), but if you’re looking for something super high end, you should consider trying out Rent The Runway , a subscription service that lets you rent women’s dresses, apparel and accessories.
“I have had great experience with Rent The Runway and wear a lot of chic maternity pieces that I wouldn't feel comfortable paying for since I will probably never wear them again,” says Givens. “Getting to wear higher end maternity clothes and knowing that I didn't have to pay top dollar for them or worry about storing them for years is awesome.”
“Our maternity section launched in fall 2017 and has been extremely successful,” Sarah Tam, chief merchant officer at Rent The Runway tells NBC News Better. “We now have over 3,000 styles that will accommodate and flatter a woman throughout her pregnancy.”
Rent The Runway sports over 500 designer brands, including some Markle favorites like Stella McCartney and Oscar de la Renta.
The site has seen a spike in interest in its maternity selection, thanks in part to Markle’s fashion.
“Meghan Markle is making people want to be more polished, and dress up more while pregnant,” says Tam. “The [typical pregnant] Rent the Runway subscriber loves showing off her bump, and loves layering a coat over a colored sheath dress — something we see Meghan pulling off effortlessly.”
Don’t forget the bra A good bra can go a long a way in making a Markle-inspired number work its magic.
“Well fitting maternity bras can help your trendy maternity outfit, like Meghan's cute form fitting dresses, look their best,” says Kimmay Caldwell, an undergarment educator at Hurray Kimmay who frequently works with pregnant women. “I never suggest skimping on support, but I do suggest spending less on maternity bras because your body is constantly changing, and you'll need to check in on your size often. If you had to choose just a few to get you through, the key is to look for a wire-free stretchy cup bra that can fluctuate with you — with an adjustable band and straps. For smaller or more moderate sizes, the Miel Nana bra is great, or the Warner's Easy Does It Bra . For fuller sizes, I highly suggest a wire-free bra like this one from Elila that runs from C to K cup, or this one from Parfait for D to G cups (UK sizing), which also has a J-hook in the back to make it a racerback.”

The 30-year-old suspect murdered his wife, 29, and two daughters, ages 7 and 5, at their Phoenix home, Sgt. Tommy Thompson of the city's police force said at a news conference Friday. Police later in a statement said that Austin Smith had been booked in jail on four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault. Smith's wife, Dasia Patterson, 29, and their daughters Mayan Smith, 7, and Nasha Smith, 5, were found dead at the family’s home, police said. Smith chose not to kill his 3-year-old daughter, who was found by police hiding under a bed and was not injured, Thompson said. Smith allegedly returned home from a bar Thursday night and confronted his wife over his belief she was cheating on him. She denied the allegations before Smith shot her and killed the children, police said in a probable cause statement. This undated booking photo from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office shows Austin Smith. Maricopa County Sheriff's Office via AP Police said that Patterson and Nasha were found dead from gunshot wounds, and Mayan was found dead from what is believed to be blunt force trauma. Police said that after killing members of his family, Smith drove to an apartment complex in Phoenix where he fatally shot a 46-year-old man after confronting him over a belief that someone had been having an affair with his wife. The suspect told officers during an interview ""that the reason he shot these individuals is because in God's eyes, it was all right for him to deal with someone in this manner who had been involved in an extramarital affair,"" Thompson said. Police said Ron Freeman, 46, was killed at the apartment. Freeman told Smith he was crazy and Smith shot him multiple times with a handgun, then reloaded and shot him while he was on the ground, the probable cause statement says. Smith then allegedly went back to the car and got a .223-caliber rifle and saw other people helping the man he had shot, and he then shot at them with the rifle, according to the document. Two other people, a man and a woman who have not been identified, were also shot at the apartment where Freeman was killed. The woman, who is related to Freeman, was hospitalized in critical condition. Police were alerted to the murders around 8:15 p.m. Thursday when they received a call about a shooting at the apartment complex. When officers arrived, they saw a car they believed was being driven by the shooter leaving the scene. The car was stopped, and Smith was taken into custody. One of the injured victims told police they were worried about the suspect's family and asked officers to perform a welfare check, and it was at the family's home that officers found the bodies of the suspect's wife and their two daughters, and the 3-year-old who was alive, police said. Thompson said it is tough emotionally for investigators when young children are the victims. ""Anytime we deal with small children, or children for that matter, it's an added burden,"" Thompson said. A judge Friday set a cash-only bond of $2 million for Smith. Minyvonne Burke Minyvonne Burke is a breaking news reporter for NBC News. Phil Helsel "

Rivera, who describes herself as a conservative and religious homemaker, grew up believing ""mafú"" — a word for pot — was a dangerous drug and stayed away from it. That changed after Rivera found relief from the chronic pain and fatigue caused by fibromyalgia by using capsules containing cannabidiol, or CBD, an active component of marijuana that does not cause a high.
Lirio Rivera. Courtesy of Lirio Rivera Since the legalization of medical marijuana two years ago in Puerto Rico, the storied plant is quietly transforming the financial landscape here, and Rivera is one of thousands of islanders either using, growing or selling medical marijuana.
Millions of dollars in investments are financing marijuana farms and dispensaries that sell everything from pot-laced ylang-ylang scented massage oils to tropical-flavored edibles, as well as the capsules used by people like Rivera. This has taken place despite operational, banking and regulatory challenges.
“If people knew the healing power of cannabis, everyone would be growing it in their patios,” she said.
The industry In 2015, a year before leaving office, then-Gov. Alejandro Padilla legalized medical marijuana by executive order after a series of public debates. Two years later, the legislature voted it into law and Gov. Ricardo Rosselló signed the legal framework for its use.
According to the island's medicinal marijuana page, around 72,000 patients have signed up for the program run by the Department of Health. The office's goal is to register 100,000 new patients by the end of the year.
“It’s a new industry with a lot of exciting opportunities,” said Puerto Rico’s pot commissioner, Antonio Quilichini, executive director of the Puerto Rico Cannabis Program and Regulation Board.
According to the government, companies, doctors, patients and workers who have paid fees for cards, permits and licenses to consume, sell, cultivate, transport, prescribe and manufacture have added $11.5 million to the island's cash-strapped economy, which is still recovering from Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 and a crushing $72 billion public debt.
The government has issued 77 dispensary licenses and 40 have opened across the island.
The government and industry proponents project that the cannabis program could generate $100 million in new tax revenue by 2020 and create 20,000 jobs.
As the industry has ramped up in the last two years, some have pointed out that the projections depend on enrolling a lot more patients so that the island can generate revenues from the sales taxes and the increasing number of growers and sellers have a solid consumer base.
Medical marijuana proponents say that growth is happening.
“We are seeing more and more patients register; we went from 20 patients a week to 1,500,” Quilichini said. He said online registration through a new digital platform has facilitated the process. “Patients are excited and are welcoming alternative ways of healing.”
Growing and selling Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Draco Rosa , who co-wrote the Ricky Martin hit, ""Livin' La Vida Loca,"" is a passionate user of medicinal marijuana. He's one of the many investors and celebrities putting money and resources into the industry.
“This thing works. It’s the real deal,"" said Rosa, who has survived cancer twice, in 2011 and 2013. He credits medical cannabis with greatly helping him during his treatments. “You can’t run from the haunting of cancer, but you can at least live more at ease so that your body can heal.""
Draco Rosa. Courtesy of Steven Lyon His experience inspired him to create his own medicinal marijuana line with the highest possible concentration of CBD. To do so, he teamed up with NextGen Pharma, the island’s first and largest medicinal marijuana company.
“I approached the cannabis lines in the way I produce music — with a lot of love and attention to quality and detail,” Rosa explained.
In December, Rosa released his first product called Monte Sagrado (Sacred Mountain), also the name of his new album , and it is aimed at cancer patients and people suffering from chronic pain. In February, the married father of two released a second medicinal line, Mad Love, for patients suffering from anxiety and stress; products include edibles and oils.
“The chocolates son super ricos (delicious), it’s all dulce amor (sweet love),"" he said.
Other celebrities, including musician Julian Marley, sell CBD products in Puerto Rico.
NextGen Pharma, which has the largest cannabis operation in Puerto Rico, has invested $6 million in building new headquarters, increasing their staff and expanding manufacturing.
“People are looking for alternatives to chemicals that have secondary side effects,"" Carmen Serrano, CEO of NextGen Pharma, told NBC News.
The same group of investors founded Bwell, a line of dispensaries. To date they've opened four establishments in tourist-heavy areas like Old San Juan, Condado and Ocean Park as well as in Guaynabo and are scheduled to open six more by the end of the year.
Puerto Rico is able to honor tourists' medical cards from any U.S. state where medical cannabis is legal, Serrano said, which puts the island in a good position to sell.
Working through challenges Medical marijuana is still classified as an illegal substance, so financial institutions shy away from offering services to the nascent industry.
Banking is the biggest challenge, according to Julian Londoño, vice president of the Puerto Rico Medical Cannabis Association and a managing partner at NextGen Pharma.
Tu Coop, the one local credit union providing financial services to the medical marijuana industry, had to cancel accounts in January after Banco Cooperativo, a larger bank handling the credit union's transactions, no longer accepted their checks.
But the problem was solved after Tu Coop took Banco Cooperativo to court and a judge ordered the larger bank to reinstate the credit union's accounts.
Still, Londoño said one of the toughest hurdles facing the industry is that medical marijuana is essentially a cash business, which he described as cost prohibitive and labor intensive.
Employees on the production line at NextGen Pharma. Xarcia Garcia / NextGen Pharma ""Imagine having to count, recount, bag and transport a $40,000 monthly tax bill in cash?"" he said.
Lawmakers in the House are expected to vote on the SAFE Banking Act, which would allow legal cannabis businesses to use federal banking institutions and alleviate the tensions between federal and local governments trying to regulate legal marijuana.
Apart from banking issues, informing the public and law enforcement about medicinal marijuana is a constant challenge.
“There is still a lot of education that has to happen at the ground level with police officers,” Serrano said.
Quilichini, the island's pot minister, agrees. “We are constantly in discussion with law enforcement and district attorneys. There is still a lot of confusion with what is legal, what is not,” he said.
Some patients like Rivera say that while they have greatly benefited from medicinal marijuana, they have to keep an eye on costs.
""A vile of 20 capsules costs anywhere from $60 to $80, and insurance does not cover it,"" she said. ""Sometimes to make it last for a month, I skip a day or two.”
Medicinal cards cost $25 each, but with doctor visits to get a prescription, the average cost can climb to $80 to $100. Dispensaries sell everything from $10 edible cakes to $80 viles of capsules.
Optimistic about the future Despite the issues, proponents tout the growing number of patients, growers and dispensaries and the enthusiasm around the industry.
“Puerto Rico has the talent, expertise, climate and infrastructure to make this industry work,” said Jason Ortiz, vice president of the Minority Cannabis Business Association, based in Connecticut. The group aims to ensure more minorities are part of the growing cannabis industry.
For her part, Rivera is still shy about telling some of her friends she uses medical marijuana. She's afraid there's still a stigma attached.
That doesn't stop her from being a fan.
“But to be honest, I still can’t believe that marijuana is what has finally helped me live a more normal life,” she said.

Police in Bloomington, Minnesota, got reports at 10:17 a.m. that a child had fallen from a third-floor balcony at the mall and landed on the first floor. The child is still alive and receiving care. Witnesses told officers ""that the suspect, that had either pushed or possibly thrown the child, took off running immediately after the incident,"" Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said. Potts said that a witness attempted to stop the suspect from fleeing, and officers then ""quickly"" found the suspect in the mall and took him into custody. Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda. Bloomington Police Department The suspect, Emmanuel Deshawn Aranda, 24, who is from metro area, faces a charge of attempted homicide, police said in a statement. Police said that he did not have a relationship with the child or the child's family. Officers are still investigating the scene, and are working with mall employees to find video footage of the incident. His reason for throwing the child from the third floor is still unclear, but Potts said they are still trying to figure out why this happened. ""We believe this an isolated incident and there is no threat to the public,” police said, adding that the investigation by Bloomington Police, the Hennepin County sheriff's crime lab, and Metro Transit Police is continuing.

Court records show Aranda was arrested twice before at the Mall of America, the Associated Press reported. He was arrested on July 4, 2015, after police said he matched the description of a man throwing things off the upper level of the mall, and police said he refused to give his name and resisted arrest. He also was accused of walking into a mall store and sweeping his hand across a display table, breaking glasses. In October 2015, Aranda was accused of throwing glasses in Twin Cities Grill in the mall, and the complaint says that he approached a woman who was waiting for the restaurant to open and asked her to buy him something, and that when she refused Aranda allegedly threw a glass of water in her face and a glass of tea that struck her leg. Aranda was under a trespass notice at the time banning him from the mall until July 4, 2016, the AP reported.

Nicky Woolf: Julian Assange is a difficult man to defend. But free press advocates really ought to try.,www.nbcnews.com,Nicky Woolf,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/julian-assange-difficult-man-defend-free-press-advocates-really-ought-ncna993831,"Hot Take Nicky Woolf Julian Assange is a difficult man to defend. But free press advocates really ought to try. The Wikileaks founder did deserve to be arrested and should face justice, just not by the United States or in the Chelsea Manning case. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on May 19, 2017. Neil Hall / Reuters file Get the Think newsletter. April 12, 2019, 4:22 PM GMT By Nicky Woolf, editor, New Statesman America Julian Assange was dragged out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on Thursday, which had served as his unofficial prison since he fled there in 2012 upon requesting asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was being investigated over allegations of sexual assault. Dragged out by officers of London’s Metropolitan Police on charges that he failed to appear in court, he looked for all the world like Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin in ""Iron Man 3"": Dishevelled, bearded, diminished. “We must resist!” he shouted. Assange is, in the popular imagination, both villain and victim. Though the official investigation that would've forced his extradition to Sweden in 2012 was over the allegations of sexual assault, he has maintained that they were a pretext for what he thought would be his eventual extradition to the United States. He expected to face charges that he helped whistleblower Chelsea Manning steal Iraq war secrets from the U.S. military — including the shocking video (that Wikileaks titled “collateral murder” on its release) showing an Apache helicopter pilot gunning down civilians. He wasn't totally wrong: American authorities on Monday unsealed a 2018 indictment and requested his extradition on a charge of conspiring with Manning to help her break into the Pentagon’s computer network. Tulsi Gabbard calls Assange's arrest a blow to transparency and free press April 11, 2019 05:31 He had been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years, in a small room with ( until, reportedly, last autumn ) his cat, and continued to run Wikileaks — the influential (in its early years) and then controversial to the point of absurdity (in later years) publication-dump for leaked government and business documents. During the 2016 presidential election, now most infamously, Wikileaks published the hacked DNC emails; Assange denied that the emails were leaked by the Russian government, though the U.S. Department of Justice later charged 12 members of the Russian military with having done so. Ecuadorian authorities explained that they had evicted Assange because of his “repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols,” a bloodless phrase which alludes to what sounds like pretty disgusting behavior by the Australian-born Wikileaks chief. Later, less diplomatically, the Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno called Assange a “spoiled brat”. The Ecuadorian ambassador to the U.K. complained in 2014 that Assange’s habit of riding a skateboard indoors which “damaged floors, walls, and doors” and that he behaved aggressively towards the staff. Complaints about his hygiene compounded. More disturbingly, according to Ecuador's Interior Minister said after ending his asylum, he even smeared his own feces over the embassy walls. Supporters of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange demonstrate in front of the presidential palace in Quito, Ecuador, in 2018. Daniel Tapia / Reuters “This sets a dangerous precedent for all journalist and media organizations in Europe and around the world,” Assange’s lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, said after his removal and arrest. “This precedent means that any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States.” Assange, however, is an unpleasant character, which makes it difficult for many to defend. His role in the 2016 election as an — unwitting or witting — partner of Russia in its attempts to manipulate the results was malignant. And that his asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy was an attempt to avoid answering official questions about his alleged sexual assaults (he has publicly denied the allegations), he is, at best, a complex figurehead for any movement in favor of transparency from leaders and freedom of speech. But as unlikely and distasteful a figurehead for transparency, he nonetheless has become one. And simply because Assange is an unpleasant person — let’s not mince words — doesn’t mean that we should accept that the U.S. government is seeking to imprison a publisher on charges that he said something that might have encouraged someone to think about hacking, because they don’t like what he published. (American authorities are charging him with an offense centered around conspiracy to commit computer intrusion — i.e., hacking — rather than under the Espionage Act.) What the Justice Department is alleging is that Assange broke the law by encouraging Manning to look for more material to send him, and saying that he could help her to crack a password. The problem is, if convicted on that charge, it could set a wide-ranging precedent for any journalist who deals with sources who bring leaked information — and that could have a chilling effect on American investigative reporting. It is an awkward position to argue that someone should face trial in one place, but not another. And yet, justice would be served if Assange were to face his accusers in court in Sweden, where he was accused of several counts of sexual assault by two women. The investigation could technically be re-opened until 2020, though the initial investigatory term expired in 2015 and prosecutors said in 2017, short of Assange returning to Sweden, they saw no way to re-open the investigation at that time. Justice would not, however, be served by his facing trial in the U.S. on hacking charges founded on the premise that public service reporting adds up to a crime. That would be a travesty, with far-ranging effects on all investigative reporting in and about the U.S. As Edward Snowden, the whistleblower who leaked a trove of National Security Agency documents that revealed the American government’s secret bulk data collection program, tweeted on Thursday: “Assange’s critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom.” Nicky Woolf Nicky Woolf is the editor of New Statesman America , a new sister publication to the U.K.'s ""New Statesman"" magazine.

Ilhan Omar's 9/11 comments spark more false outrage — and expose anti-Muslim bias,www.nbcnews.com,Qasim Rashid,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/ilhan-omar-s-9-11-comments-spark-more-false-outrage-ncna993886,"On April 12, 1997 I received a call from my brother, Private First Class Tayyib M. Rashid, a newly minted U.S. Marine. He had called to tell us he had just graduated from boot camp. Ours is an immigrant family, and his service was a source of pride and validation for all of us. We were Americans in a new sense now. This year I filed to run for Virginia Senate — an extension of the American dream my immigrant family and I have cherished. But the fact is that Muslims have been in the United States before the states were created — let alone united. Historians believe that 15 to 30 percent of Africans enslaved and trafficked here were Muslim. Yet, some 400 years later we're still considered outsiders.
Conservative outrage over Rep. Ilhan Omar’s recent comments at a civil rights banquet hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) exemplify this exclusion. Speaking about the need for strong civil rights protections, especially for Muslim Americans, Omar said : “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Congresswoman Omar targetted by conservative media April 12, 2019 04:27 The political right went immediately into attack mode. Brian Kilmeade, co-anchor of “Fox and Friends,” wondered if she was even an American first ? Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, described her remarks as “ Unbelievable .” The NY Post featured a front page with Omar’s picture depicted below a photo of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Now even President Donald Trump has joined in, tweeting a video that cuts between her Quote: and images of the Twin Towers. At a time when Omar has suffered bomb threats and assassination plots , such hyperbole on the part of the media and elected officials only adds fuel to the bonfire.
WE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 The allegation is that Omar trivialized 9/11 by describing it as “some people did something.” I’m reminded of Cardinal Richelieu’s Quote: : “If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.” Omar isn’t even being afforded six words.
SIGN UP FOR THE THINK WEEKLY NEWSLETTER HERE
For those who care about accuracy, Omar’s full 20 minutes of remarks present the correct and clear picture of her opinion on terrorism. The “some people did something” Quote: refers not to the 9/11 terrorists or Saudi Arabia — whom she has repeatedly condemned — but to unjust elements within the U.S. government who have denied Muslim Americans the equality that every citizen deserves.
Indeed, while some in the GOP are trying to use this moment to score cheap political points, Omar has been working hard to advance the 9/11 Victim’s Compensation Fund — a fund her GOP critics refuse to co-sponsor . Omar has been adamant that we must provide healthcare to our American heroes.
Perhaps the most frustrating thing about this latest spasm of faux outrage is the way it obscures Omar’s actual point. Americans who are Muslim — or who are perceived to be Muslim — are constantly engaged in a battle to maintain their constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties. This is a history we refuse to reconcile with, but until we do, our nation will struggle to ensure justice for all.
Too many have already forgotten the NYPD’s six years of warrantless spying on American citizens who are Muslim — all without a single “terror” lead , no less. What about the $445 million in annual tax dollars spent on the ongoing and unconstitutional indefinite detention of alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay — all held without being charged? What about the CIA torturing Muslim people in the most horrific manners — an unconstitutional practice tragically supported by a majority of Americans and defended by Republican and Democratic administrations alike?
Americans who are Muslim — or who are perceived to be Muslim — are constantly engaged in a battle to maintain their constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.
While President Donald Trump has spent an immense amount of time working on his “Muslim ban,” he has almost completely ignored the problem of domestic terrorism — a fact that is confusing given that every single terror incident on U.S. soil in 2018 was carried out by a right-wing terrorist or white supremacist ? In fact, as the New York Times reported late last year : “U.S. law enforcement failed to see he threat of white nationalism. Now they don’t know how to stop it.” The facts demonstrate that terrorism stemming from white supremacy, not Islam, is the greatest terror threat to America.
Social media companies have been attempting to ban Daesh (ISIS) terrorists — yet have been slower to stop white supremacist terrorists — claiming free speech, despite the demonstrable connection to rising terrorism. This month another white son of a sheriff’s deputy burned down three historically Black churches — citing his hatred of Christianity as a reason — the White House remained silent. Instead, the president continues to slam Omar for calling Stephen Miller a white nationalist, something that many others have said previously without presidential rebuke, from Rep. Mark Pocan last summer to Miller’s own uncle and childhood rabbi .
 Thousand Oaks shooter joins list of white men rampaging in Pittsburgh and Tallahassee. So where were they radicalized? It is exactly this double standard that Omar referred to when speaking of the civil rights injustices imposed on American Muslims in a post-9/11 America. Instead, Omar — a woman who came here as a refugee to escape war and terrorism — is being accused of ignoring the things that destroyed her childhood. On Stephen Colbert this week, Omar again proudly affirmed her identity as an American.
And Omar is not the only Muslim to suffer from this double standard. I recall getting another call from my brother, now a U.S. Marine sergeant, not long after 9/11. In the days after the attacks, he told me, he had been singled out and interrogated at the airport and asked if he had ties to terrorism. He was a U.S. Marine, in his military fatigues, traveling with his unit — but even that wasn’t enough to ensure others of his American loyalties. As I run for Virginia office, I’m already seeing critics question my own identity — despite my sworn oath as a human rights lawyer to uphold the US Constitution, and despite mine and my family’s years of service to our country. But that’s okay, because we will continue to serve all Americans, regardless of political party — that’s how we define patriotism.
Likewise, Rep. Ilhan Omar’s patriotism is not the problem. Those who seek to undermine the Constitution’s promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are the ones we should be questioning.

"Gay in rural America: Up to 5 percent of rural residents are LGBTQ, report finds",www.nbcnews.com,Avichai Scher,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/gay-rural-america-5-percent-rural-residents-are-lgbtq-report-n993936,"Millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people live in rural areas of the United States — largely by choice, according to a report released earlier this month by the LGBTQ think tank Movement Advancement Project. MAP’s report estimates between 2.9 million and 3.8 million lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people live in rural America, comprising approximately 3 to 5 percent of the estimated 62 million people who live in rural areas.
“We so often overlook that LGBT people live in rural communities,” Logan Casey, a MAP policy researcher and one of the report’s lead authors, said. “But being LGBT doesn’t mean you want to go live in a coastal city.”
Related NBC OUT Trump's controversial transgender military policy goes into effect The report notes that LGBTQ people are drawn to rural areas for many of the same reasons as their heterosexual counterparts — proximity to family, a tight-knit community and a connection to the land. However, the report also found rural LGBTQ communities are uniquely affected by the “structural challenges and other aspects of rural life,” which it notes could “amplify the impacts of both rejection and acceptance.”
‘VULNERABLE TO DISCRIMINATION’ The report found the social and political landscape of rural areas makes LGBTQ people “more vulnerable to discrimination.”
“Public opinion in rural areas is generally less supportive of LGBT people and policies, and rural states are significantly less likely to have vital nondiscrimination laws and more likely to have harmful, discriminatory laws,” the report states.
Simple, everyday actions can also be fraught, especially for transgender people. According to the report, 34 percent of trans people report discrimination on public transportation and 18 percent report harassment at a gym or health club. These numbers apply to rural and urban residents, but Casey’s research indicates that lack of alternative options and the importance of public spaces in small, tight-knit communities can make harassment harder to bear in rural areas.
Related NBC OUT Arizona moves to repeal law banning promotion of 'homosexual life-style' in school The report also notes the geographic distance and isolation of rural areas can present challenges for LGBTQ people.
“If someone experiences discrimination at a doctor’s office, school or job, it’s less likely there’s another option close by,” Casey explained.
The report also found those in rural areas have less access to LGBTQ-specific resources. Fifty-seven percent of LGBTQ adults in urban areas have access to an LGBTQ health center, while only 11 percent of those in rural areas do. And when it comes to senior services, almost half of LGBTQ adults have access to LGBTQ senior services, compared to just 10 percent of their rural counterparts.
There was also an urban-rural divide when it comes to the school climate for LGBTQ youth. Almost 60 percent of LGBTQ youth in urban areas reported having a gay-straight alliance club in their school, compared to just 36 percent of LGBTQ youth in rural areas.
Courtesy Movement Advancement Project In addition, traditional challenges of rural life today, such as the opioid epidemic and unemployment, can be harder on LGBTQ people because they can be legally turned away from services or fired for their identity in most states. Thirty states, most of them “majority rural,” don’t explicitly protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and public services.
The smaller populations of rural areas can also complicate matters for LGBTQ people, because they are more likely to stand out. This can make them more vulnerable to discrimination but also keep problems they face under the radar.
For instance, LGBTQ youth homelessness in rural and urban areas is roughly equal, though LGBTQ people still face much higher homelessness rates than their straight counterparts. However, the report cautions that rates could be higher for rural LGBTQ youth, who often sleep in cars or outside, rather than their urban peers who sleep in shelters where their presence is recorded in data.
One of the biggest challenges the report identifies is health care. Fifty six percent of gay, lesbian and bisexual people across the country reported at least one instance of discrimination or patient profiling in a health care setting. According to statistics cited in the report, more than 40 percent of nonmetropolitan LGBTQ people said if they were turned away by their local hospital, it would be “very difficult” or “not possible” for them to find an alternative, compared to 18 percent of the general LGBTQ population, according to a statistic cited in the report.
Trans people often struggle to find health care providers knowledgeable about gender-affirming care and are more likely to have such care denied by their insurance provider. Trans people of color often face the added burden of providers with a lack of cultural competency for their community.
Related NBC OUT Buttigieg goes from cordial to critical of Pence on campaign Trans people are also 15 percent more likely to have transition-related surgery denied by their insurance if they live in a rural area.
For many trans people, especially of color, the burdens of rural life force them to move away from home.
Malaysia Walker, 40, a black trans woman, began her transition in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. For eight years, she struggled with doctors who she said would only prescribe the lowest dose of hormones, didn’t test her hormone levels and shuffled her around to different doctors.
“There was not a provider that specializes in working with the trans community,” Walker said. “Getting access to hormones was horrible.”
Walker also said she was denied a promotion at her retail job because she is trans and that she often felt unsafe. But she didn’t decide to leave until a year ago, when her insurance denied a gender-confirmation procedure.
She moved to New Orleans and now works as a retention specialist at a clinic that offers care to transgender people. The move created a “new life” for her, and she’s generally happy living in New Orleans. But she does miss the food, family and familiarity of home.
""The crawfish in New Orleans isn't like Jackson,"" Walker said. ""Thirty-nine years of building a life in Jackson. I miss the comfort of home.""
‘SETTLING INTO RURAL LIFE’ While challenges for LGBTQ people can be “amplified” in rural areas, the report also found bright spots for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people living in nonmetropolitan communities.
Same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals are raising children in rural areas at higher rates than urban areas. Rural residents support a variety of LGBTQ rights at high numbers, especially among women and youth, even if lower than urban residents. Sixty two percent of rural residents support nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people; among rural residents 18-29, it’s 75 percent, and among women, it’s 67 percent. In urban areas, 72 percent of residents support such protections.
Michael Patterson, left, and his husband, Bryan Timm. Courtesy of Michael Patterson and Bryan Timm Some LGBTQ people feel safer in rural areas than urban areas. Michael Patterson, 35, grew up on a dairy farm in Pennsylvania. He moved to Philadelphia when he was 18 in part to be closer to gay life. Yet he moved back in 2013, to a small town outside Erie to start his own business.
He said that while he felt safe in Philly’s “gayborhood,” he was often verbally harassed in other areas of the city and knew of violent attacks on gay men.
He was nervous to move back to rural Pennsylvania, fearing social isolation and repression. But he was pleasantly surprised.
“I thought I was moving back to die alone,” he said with a slight chuckle. “But I wound up meeting my husband here and settling into rural life.”
His husband, Bryan Timm, 39, grew up in the area but never left for a big city.
“I don’t feel like I have to go anywhere, this is my home,” Timm said. “Times are changing here. The guys who bullied me as a kid for being gay, they’re my friends now. I’m not shy to hold hands with Michael in public.”
While social conditions in the area are changing, there are still legal and policy hurdles. Pennsylvania is the only Northeastern state that doesn’t have protections for LGBTQ people against discrimination.
While the MAP report makes several recommendations for improving support systems for LGBTQ people as well as policy and social changes, it appears focused on one in particular: passage of the federal Equality Act. The measure would make it illegal nationwide to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill was recently reintroduced in Congress.
“LGBT people in rural areas are disproportionately harmed by the lack of protections and the presence of discriminatory laws,” the report states. “The current policy landscape demonstrates the clear and urgent need for federal and state nondiscrimination protections for LGBT people.”

SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 7:26 PM GMT By Doha Madani A 36-year-old Harvard alumnus pleaded guilty Friday to taking college entrance exams for the children of wealthy parents as part of an alleged $25 million college admissions scam that has led to dozens of criminal charges. Mark Riddell pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit money laundering. He appeared in federal court in Boston and did not make any statements before his hearing. He could face up to 41 months in prison but prosecutors have said they will likely recommend 33 months instead, according to NBC Boston . A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 18 , according to the U.S Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts. Riddell apologized last month for his role in the sweeping federal investigation that was dubbed Operation Varsity Blues by investigators. ""I want to communicate to everyone that I am profoundly sorry for the damage I have done and grief I have caused those as a result of my needless actions,"" the resident of Palmetto, Florida, said in a statement released by his attorney in March. Riddell, a 2004 Harvard graduate and a four-year tennis letter winner, took SAT and ACT exams for students between 2012 and this past February, according to a criminal complaint. He was paid $10,000 per test, prosecutors said. It is unclear exactly how many tests Riddell took, but prosecutors are seeking to recover almost $450,000 in forfeiture from him. A 10-month-long FBI investigation resulted in charges filed against 50 people — including the scam's mastermind, his accomplices and the parents. Among the 33 parents who were charged were actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman. Related Cheat Sheet: Everything you want to know about the college admissions scheme Huffman is among 14 defendants in the scandal who is expected to plead guilty in the case, according to the Department of Justice. The former ""Desperate Housewives"" star admitted to paying $15,000 to get her older daughter extra time for her SAT test and to have a proctor administer the test and correct the answers. A plea hearing for Huffman is scheduled for May 21 in Boston. Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are among 16 parents facing a new indictment for their alleged involvement in the scandal, the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said Tuesday. The couple were previously charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud for allegedly paying bribes totaling $500,000 to help their two daughters get into the University of Southern California. The new indictment adds a charge of money laundering against the couple and 14 other defendants accused in the scheme. Loughlin, best known for her role as Aunt Becky on ""Full House,"" appeared in federal court last month and was released on a $1 million bond .

Trump admin files emergency request to stay order blocking return of asylum seekers to Mexico,www.nbcnews.com,Daniella Silva,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-admin-files-emergency-request-stay-order-blocking-return-asylum-n993991,"A federal appeals court in California took action Friday that would temporarily allow the Trump administration to return asylum seekers to Mexico. The decision is in response to the Trump administration's emergency motion filing from Thursday asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in San Francisco to stop a nationwide injunction that would bar the government from continuing its policy of forcing migrants to wait in Mexico as their asylum cases play out.
The court asked that opposition to the emergency motion be filed by Tuesday, 9 a.m. local time.
The government's motion said the injunction issued Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg rested on ""serious errors of law"" and blocked an initiative ""designed to address the dramatically escalating burdens of unauthorized migration.""
Trump confirms plan was proposed to bus migrants to 'sanctuary cities' April 13, 2019 05:10 The administration had asked for an administrative stay that would take place immediately and remain in place while the court considers the issue of a longer stay while the appeals process plays out in a possibly months-long process.
The American Civil Liberties Union had asked the court earlier Friday to deny the emergency request that would keep in place the administration's policy of returning asylum-seekers to Mexico while they wait for court dates.
In response to the judge's decision Friday evening, Judy Rabinovitz, who argued the case for the ACLU, said, ""this is just an interim step while the court considers the government's stay request.""
""We're very disappointed in the 9th Circuit's decision and we hope that the stay will be short-lived,"" Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Friday night. The group is part of the lawsuit seeking to stop the policy.
""The plaintiffs and others like them are very vulnerable to harm in Mexico and should be able to pursue their asylum claims in the United States,"" she added.
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision.
The organizations seeking to stop the policy of returning migrants to Mexico said in a brief earlier Friday that the government's request should be denied and that there was not ""sufficient urgency"" to warrant an administrative stay.
""The government should not be allowed to manufacture the need for an emergency administrative stay by failing to timely file a stay request,"" the brief said.
Asylum-seeker made to wait in Mexico gets his day in U.S. court March 20, 2019 01:04 In issuing a preliminary injunction temporarily stopping the policy , Seeborg had ordered that it go into effect Friday to give the administration time to appeal.
“It was a huge victory for us and it’s a huge defeat for the Trump administration at least in terms of a signal that you are not above the law,” Rabinovitz said of Seeborg’s ruling.
Seeborg also ruled that all 11 migrants named in the lawsuit must be allowed to enter the U.S. within two days of the order taking effect.
While the order was not set to officially go into effect until Friday, an official with Mexico’s immigration agency told NBC News the government had not been returning newly arrived migrants to Mexico since the judge issued his decision on Monday.
Related News News Asylum-seekers forced to wait in Tijuana fear for their lives Since the policy was implemented in late January, 1,323 Central American migrants have been returned to Mexico, according to a statement from Mexico’s National Institute of Migration. Of those, 308 were families including 428 children under 18, according to the statement.
A Department of Justice official told NBC News that since Seeborg's order all migrants affected by the policy who have had court dates in the U.S. have been told they will not be returned to Mexico following those hearings. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Critics of the policy say forcing migrants to wait in Mexico puts their lives in danger and violates their legal right to seek asylum in the U.S.
Trump administration attorneys have said the policy was meant to deter “baseless” asylum claims that were “overtaxing” the U.S. immigration system.
Families seeking asylum had previously been allowed to stay in the U.S., either in detention or released into the country, while awaiting their court hearings.
Rabinovitz said that the ACLU would also be working to get relief for migrants affected by the policy whose court dates in the U.S. may not be for months.
""Clearly they should benefit even though the preliminary injunction doesn't order the government to bring them back. They can't be subjected to this policy anymore so there's no way they can be required to stay in Mexico,"" she said.

— John Delaney (@JohnDelaney) March 24, 2019 A demonstrably athletic Democratic nominee would provide a contrast to Trump, who has made comments suggesting he does not believe in the benefits of exercise and will be 74 by the time Inauguration Day in 2021 rolls around.
Delaney, 55, said that he manages to get some form of exercise four or five days a week, about 40 minutes a pop, and that he can deadlift about 225 pounds. On the road, the former Maryland congressman tries to select hotels based on which one has a gym. O'Rourke, 46, in particular has embraced the idea of combining campaigning and working out — inviting reporters, TV cameras and potential voters to join him for a St. Patrick's Day 5K in Iowa last month.
While campaigning against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018, O'Rourke hosted an 8-mile biking town hall in Dallas, fielding questions as he pedaled, his communications director, Chris Evans, said.
""He held dozens of early morning running town halls across Texas where voters could jog with him for three or four miles, ask questions while they ran and share what was on their minds,"" Evans said.
Thanks to all (casi 700!!) who came out to our first biking town hall of the campaign — beautiful day in Dallas, exciting to be with you all and looking forward to doing it again soon! pic.twitter.com/gowibmWHGG
— Beto O'Rourke (@BetoORourke) July 8, 2018 Recently, a video of Warren, 69, sprinting to a train in New York City's Penn Station went viral as the camera man, by the time he caught up with Warren and her team, was out of breath. Her exercise routine includes walking an average of six miles per day, she told NBC News.
""It's a little harder on the campaign trail, but I keep track and try my best,"" she said.
She's often joined by her husband, Bruce Mann, and their golden retriever.
""We let Bailey off his leash and just talk,"" she said. ""When I'm on my own, I listen to audio books.""
Candidates who don't regularly broadcast their workouts on social media say staying fit is still a priority. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., regularly attends spin class, according to her campaign. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., often works out at the Senate gym and at home, a campaign spokesperson told NBC News. Booker, a former college football player, is vegan and often posts about health-related subjects.
Joe Biden , who has not announced his candidacy but finds himself at the top of early polling, is no slouch for a 76-year-old man, according to his younger brother Frank Biden. In a January interview with Sirius XM's Michael Smerconish, Frank said the former vice president ""benches 185 for repetition.""
""The image of him on the bench with gritted teeth and powering through that last rep is a very accurate one,"" Frank Biden said. His brother ""will be the most dynamic 70-something-year-old you've ever met in your entire life,"" should he run, he said.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was chopping his own wood as recently as the last presidential cycle, his wife, Jane, told People magazine in January 2016 . Sanders, 77, currently leads the pack in fundraising . His campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump gets his exercise on the golf course, though he opts to use a cart rather than walk the greens.
""I get exercise. I mean I walk, I this, I that,"" Trump told Reuters last year. ""I run over to a building next door. I get more exercise than people think.""
As The Washington Post reported in 2016, Trump gave up most athletic pursuits after college because he ""believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted.""
Delaney said the president's past comments on exercise is ""really strange,"" adding, ""We all know that regular exercise does improve the quality of peoples' lives.""
""If you exercise, it implies a certain amount of self-discipline, and I think that's always important,"" Delaney said. ""I think voters obviously want to know about you as a person, so I guess it says a little bit about who you are as a person.""

SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 9:01 PM GMT / Updated April 13, 2019, 12:28 PM GMT By Ben Collins Katie Bouman, a researcher who helped create the first image of a black hole, quickly gained internet fame Thursday for her role in the project after a photo of her went viral. But internet trolls soon followed, questioning Bouman’s work and floating false claims that she did not have much of a role in the project. Colleagues rallied to her defense, but the situation highlighted the vitriol that women continue to face on the internet, and the continued vulnerability of major internet platforms to trolling campaigns. Bouman , a postdoctoral fellow who will soon be an assistant professor at the California Institute of Technology, noted in a Facebook post Wednesday that “no one algorithm or person made this image” and published a photo of the many people she worked alongside. The photo of the black hole was the end result of the work of hundreds of researchers and eight telescopes. Bouman’s public recognition — much of it applauding an example of a woman at the forefront of a major scientific effort — drew attention from misogynist communities on the internet. Some users congregated on Reddit and created videos questioning Bouman’s contribution that were then uploaded to Instagram and YouTube. By Friday, falsehoods claiming it was not Bouman but a male colleague who deserved credit for the black hole image overtook legitimate coverage in search results on YouTube and Instagram. On YouTube, the first video result for users who search for “Katie Bouman” returns a video titled “Woman Does 6% of the Work but Gets 100% of the Credit: Black Hole Photo.” The video is riddled with inaccuracies, and largely draws from a falsehood created on Reddit and pushed heavily by a “men’s rights” community. Hours later, a similar search showed that the video was no longer appearing at the top of YouTube's results. YouTube algorithm vs. Katie Bouman pic.twitter.com/3TABQ2vitN — Max Woolf (@minimaxir) April 12, 2019 The video claims Andrew Chael, a “straight white male” did most of the work, based on the number of publicly available lines of code for the project on the website Github. Chael, an astrophysicist and graduate student at Harvard University who worked with Bouman, responded on Twitter saying the conspiracy theory is “awful and sexist,” and added that he’s gay. The theory claims that Chael wrote 850,000 lines of code, which he says is also wrong, adding there are 68,000 lines of code total in the current software. A YouTube spokesperson told NBC News that the company is working to change its system to value authoritative content. “We've taken a number of steps to address this including surfacing more authoritative content across our site for people searching for news-related topics, beginning to reduce recommendations of borderline content and showing information panels with more sources where they can fact check information for themselves,” the spokesperson said in an email. “We’ve seen meaningful progress as a result and are committed to making more improvements going forward.” (1/7) So apparently some (I hope very few) people online are using the fact that I am the primary developer of the eht-imaging software library ( https://t.co/n7djw1r9hY ) to launch awful and sexist attacks on my colleague and friend Katie Bouman. Stop. — Andrew Chael (@thisgreyspirit) April 12, 2019 Becca Lewis, a research affiliate at nonprofit research institute Data & Society who studies extremism on YouTube, said this was another example of YouTube’s algorithm “rewarding engagement and time spent on the site to maximize advertising revenue” instead of facts. “Time and again, we see that this leads YouTube to recommend sensationalist content that is often conspiratorial or bigoted,” Lewis said. “In turn, content creators are incentivized to create this kind of content, and a culture has emerged on the platform that is deeply reactionary.” Instagram had also been co-opted by the anti-Bouman campaign. An account impersonating Bouman, with the username “katieboumanoffficial,” was the first result for users looking up “Katie Bouman” in Instagram’s search box. The account, which impersonated an Instagram model until November, began impersonating Bouman late Thursday night, posting several headshots and screenshots of YouTube videos featuring Bouman. Descriptions on the images of the account, however, spread false claims about Bouman. One description changes Chael’s name to “Andrew Chad,” a reference to “Chads,” internet misogynist terminology for men who are attractive to women. “He is Andrew Chad. He wrote 850,000 of the 900,000 lines of code that were written in the historic black-hole image algorithm!” the description reads. Instagram did not respond to a request for comment. Ben Collins"

David Harbour in a scene from ""Hellboy."" Mark Rogers / Lionsgate via AP Get the Think newsletter. April 12, 2019, 9:06 PM GMT By Sam Thielman, editor, Tow Center for Digital Journalism Before the dawn of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, there were a lot of bad superhero movies, but very few totally unimaginative ones. The first two Hellboy films, directed by Guillermo del Toro, were stylish, but they relied on Del Toro’s established visual panache, not any ability to approximate the experience of reading the comics. Many directors, enamored of comics, have tried different approaches, usually without success: Zack Snyder and Rob Rodriguez restructured ""Watchmen"" and ""Sin City"" slightly, but they storyboarded nearly every shot from the comics themselves. Warren Beatty shot ""Dick Tracy"" like a film noir and loaded up a dozen career-peak dramatic actors with embarrassing prosthetics; Ang Lee split the screen into actual panels for ""Hulk""; Tim Burton staged literal circus acts during both of his ""Batman"" films. Kinka Usher’s ""Mystery Men"" jettisoned almost everything about Bob Burden’s comics (with Burden’s blessing; he co-wrote the script) and just lets the cast of career comedians riff on the silly material. Beginning in 2008, the MCU changed all that: The film series mimics the complicated, no-beginnings-and-no-endings interwoven structure of Marvel Comics so that all the movies (which come out three times a year) are sequels to each other. The thing that makes the Marvel franchise work so well is that each sub-series — the Captain America flicks, the Thor movies, and so on — has its own tone, and is also a gloss on a particular film genre. Some are punchier and more fun than others, but few are actually bad. Related 'Shazam!' is a superhero movie trying to reclaim the genre's exuberant potential But they are also so incredibly lucrative that, like the Harry Potter films and the subsequent young adult fiction adaptation glut before them, every studio’s ambition now is to produce a film series, rather than a movie, and thus every studio produces franchise-start hopefuls trying to compete — mining comics, pulp novels or old sci-fi movies. ""Wonder Woman,"" ""Deadpool,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" Disney’s own ever-growing Star Wars Universe and ""The Lone Ranger"" are all doing a kind of Marvelly thing, and even the bad ones are titanic moneymakers. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"" the second film in the most recent Ninja Turtles series (which is due to be rebooted a third time) made $245 million globally — slightly more than the GDP of the Marshall Islands last year. ""Hellboy,"" which was released on Friday, clearly wants some of that money. It has all the earmarks of a franchise kickoff, down to the multiple endings during the credits teasing future directions for the characters’ adventures. The problem is that ""Hellboy"" is not even really a movie; it’s a launchpad for five different movies that will never get made, because no one wants to watch a launchpad for five different movies when they've paid to watch this movie. But before you can understand why this movie doesn't work, it's important to understand why Mike Mignola’s Hellboy comics series is so damned good. It pays homage to trashy pulp heroes like Doc Savage and The Shadow, but it’s also beautifully drawn and studded with ironic, oblique intrusions by obscure saints and a panoply of multiethnic fairy stories, all of it tracing a tragic character arc that creeps up on the reader over hundreds of pages. Daniel Dae Kim, David Harbour and Sasha Lane in a scene from ""Hellboy."" Mark Rogers / Lionsgate via AP Mignola’s gorgeous art is justly praised so often by fans and critics that his prowess as a plotter gets ignored — but the narrative momentum of the Hellboy comic series is as purely satisfying as anything in serial fiction. It culminates in a fast-paced trilogy of stories that remain the least-widely read of Mignola’s Hellboy stories. In the trilogy, which was adapted for the movie, Mignola (and fellow artist Duncan Fegredo) tugged on all the loose threads of all the prior comics at once, and a frantic, action-packed finale unexpectedly sent Hellboy to Hell. The trilogy is virtuosic and well worth reading, but it would be impossible to understand if it were to be, say, divorced from the larger narrative, robbed of its tragic ending, filled with Easter eggs for people who’d read the comics and adapted into an expensive film … which is what happens in the film that opens today. The new, inexcusable Hellboy movie, was directed — if that’s the word I want — by Neil Marshall, whose terrific horror flick ""The Descent"" suggested that he might be up to the job of making a fun and scary Hellboy movie. He has not. The new film is paced like an episode of ""Game of Thrones"" (which Marshall also directs on occasion) set on fast-forward, with so many plots and subplots that the majority of the dialogue is just excruciatingly boring exposition to set up the action sequences, which are numerous but individually far too short, because the movie has to cram in more exposition to set up the next one. Some of the action is okay: There’s a really gory fight with three disgusting giants that I loved, and a bit near the end where we get to see a few gorgeous building-sized monsters for what, annoyingly, can’t be more than a minute between them. The bit with evil Russian witch the Baba Yaga is revolting and great. Milla Jovovich in a scene from ""Hellboy."" Mark Rogers / Lionsgate via AP No individual part of the movie is objectionable (except the actors playing Hellboy’s two sidekicks, Sasha Lane and Daniel Dae Kim, both Americans doing eye-watering English accents); there’s just not enough of any of it to work. However, David Harbour is even better than Ron Perlman (who starred in the last two Hellboy movies) as the title character, and Milla Jovovich’s career-long streak of being the most watchable part of a genuinely terrible movie continues uninterrupted. It may want to be a TV series — and perhaps it would be a pleasantly weird one one — but Marshall pulls off only one actually complete sequence in a movie with a dozen plots, and that's a flashback adapting part of Mignola’s funny short story ""The Corpse."" What’s most irritating to someone who wants to see the movie because of the comics is that the filmmakers chose the most complicated and fast-paced Hellboy story to adapt; it exceeds 500 pages in print. It’s a story that can only exist at all because Mignola had spent 14 years carefully laying its groundwork with a graceful, subtle, literate storytelling that he had already spent half a career perfecting. The movie version looks graceless and kludgy because it hasn’t put in the hours, but it wants moviegoers to put in their money. Sam Thielman "
'Star Wars: Episode IX' teaser trailer breakdown: 'The Rise of Skywalker' mixes CGI and nostalgia,www.nbcnews.com,Ani Bundel,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/star-wars-episode-ix-teaser-trailer-breakdown-rise-skywalker-mixes-ncna994066,"2019 is looking to be a big year for movie events , with Disney leading the way. “Avengers: Endgame” is mere weeks from premiering, having broken pre-sale records along the way. Also on deck is “Aladdin,” and new “The Lion King,” “Frozen 2,” and what is possibly the most anticipated franchise follow-up in the history of modern cinema, “Star Wars Episode IX.” The trailer for “Episode IX” was revealed today, clueing fans in to the title — “The Rise of Skywalker” — as well as key plot points like the return of the series’ original villain, Emperor Palpatine . All told, Disney has executed a triumph of marketing panache that blends sentimentality and modern CGI action movie tropes with a billion-dollar franchise. The new trailer, much like the ones before it, is a heavy nostalgia play that also works hard to give fans moments they don’t expect.
The new trailer, much like the ones before it, is a heavy nostalgia play that also works hard to give fans moments they don’t expect. “Episode IX,” as the number implies, is the third movie in the third trilogy, the last chapter of a multi-generational tale. Though they were made slightly out of order — with the middle trilogy done first, the prequel trilogy at the turn of the millennium, and now the final trilogy in the 2010s — the fact that these movies all take place in the same universe, with a through line that connects three generations of characters, is a testament to George Lucas' original vision.
But nostalgia isn’t enough; these new ""Star Wars"" films also have to feel of this sociopolitical moment, instead of the 1970s or the 1990s. The trailer achieves this delicate balance by bringing back the old, with Billy Dee Williams reprising his role of smuggler-with-a-heart-of-gold Lando Calrissian, and Ian McDiarmid returning as the evil Emperor Palpatine , the original villain from the first two trilogies. An epic battle between good and evil beckons.
The most significant new element is symbolized by the opening scene featuring Rey, the hero of the new generation . Rey takes on a ship heading directly for her with a slow-motion leap for the ages. It’s a scene that was simply not possible to do in the 1970s, had anyone even considered it. The message is clear: Fans may think they’ve seen it all, but this old dog still has new (CGI) tricks up its sleeve.
The trailer and title reveal were the pinnacle of the Star Wars Celebration , a single franchise convention running five full days in Chicago. Started back in 1999 in conjunction with the prequel revival, the event has run every few years, sometimes as a way to keep up fan enthusiasm during non-movie years. Run by Lucasfilm in conjunction with ReedPOP since 2010 (the latter is responsible for major conventions such as New York Comic Con), the celebration was already established when Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion back in 2012. Much like other quirky fan-driven segments of the franchise, like “ May the Fourth ,” the new overlords wisely left the celebration in place.
Related Opinion Happy Star Wars Day, a fake holiday Disney turned into a marketing blitz fans actually love Indeed, marketing has been key to the success of Disney’s “Star Wars” revival. The once-powerful franchise was moribund when Disney came along, while the rival “Star Trek” franchise was making big bucks and “The Avengers” was racking up opening weekend records . Meanwhile on TV, “Game of Thrones” was dominating critics best-of lists.
It’s hard to imagine now, but when Disney announced it was not only buying Lucasfilm but putting Episode VII into production, there were a lot of doubts . It wasn’t until 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” brought in $2 billion, making back literally half of Disney’s investment, that the full power of the franchise was unleashed.
And a lot of that had to do with a marketing campaign that started with the 2015 Star Wars Celebration. Held in Anaheim, the “Episode VII” panel featured the debut of BB-8, the reunion of original trilogy cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, and the introduction of the new faces that would carry the franchise forward. It also premiered one of the most magnificently cut trailers of the decade . The combination of the franchise’s iconic ships crashed in the desert combined with the symbolism of the beloved original stars passing the torch down to a new generation was intense.
The new trailer continues this tradition. While Rey’s feat of derring do will likely be the most talked about moment, the trailer’s crashed Death Star is arguably just as important. Bad guys have been building these symbols of destruction forever in “Star Wars,” almost to the point of comedy. And yet it is comforting to be reminded that though evil rises, it also falls again. The trailer may have brought back the ultimate bad guy from the original trilogy, but chances are he won’t survive the film.
If today is any indication, the “Star Wars” franchise continues to delight and surprise fans, who walked out of the celebration panel looking sated. The balance between the new generation of heroes and nostalgia had been struck once again — and Disney is marketing the film perfectly. As the Skywalker rises, so will the excitement for this film. May the force be with them, always.

'Special': Groundbreaking new Netflix series stars gay man with cerebral palsy,www.nbcnews.com,Alexander Kacala,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/special-groundbreaking-new-netflix-series-stars-gay-man-cerebral-palsy-n994001,"Netflix’s new series “Special” is an unconventional comedy about a gay man with cerebral palsy. The show, which debuts Friday, has eight 20-minute episodes and is based on actor Ryan O'Connell’s memoir: “I’m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves.” O’Connell stars in the series and serves as its executive producer, alongside “The Big Bang Theory” star Jim Parsons.
In a recent interview with NBC News, O’Connell said it was “a shock” for him that the series “actually made it to the finish line.”
“It feels very surreal, because I didn't think that any of this could be possible,” he said. “I’ve been working in Hollywood for six years now, and I know that even the best ideas, even the best shows, with the best talent attached, the odds of one actually getting shot and made and released is very medium rare.""
“Special” is based on O’Connell’s experience living with cerebral palsy, a motor disability that affects one's ability to move and maintain balance and posture, and his real-life decision to falsely claim his limp as the result of a car accident.
“I felt like I had achieved this amazing life hack, and for a few years, I felt like it just gave me the confidence to go after the things I want,” O’Connell said of the false claim. “It did give me an extra boost, but that faded after a couple years, because it was just creating a lot of emotional problems for me 'cause I was lying about who I was — to myself and to other people. I was trying to cut out this big part of myself, but that doesn't work, it never works.”
Special, is a distinctive and uplifting new series about a gay man, Ryan with mild cerebral palsy who decides to rewrite his identity and finally go after the life he wants. Netflix O’Connell, who said he realized he is gay when he was 12, stayed closeted until his late 20s. “I didn't love that for me,” he said. “I wasn't thrilled and over the moon, because I felt like being gay and disabled basically set a death sentence to my love life.”
“I assumed that all gay men would be disgusted by my disability, and I think that the vast majority of them truly didn't care, and I was making it into something that it wasn't,” he added. “That's not to say that I wasn't valid in my feelings of being scared or being judged ... but I also think that I was really scared and I was projecting a lot of s--t on people.”
However, O’Connell acknowledged, many people with disabilities “face a lot of discrimination and ostracization” and their fears of being judged and not accepted are “completely founded in reality.”
Related NBC OUT Gay in rural America: Up to 5 percent of rural residents are LGBTQ, report finds He said he hopes “Special” changes the conversation surrounding those with disabilities and provides much-needed visibility for the estimated 61 million Americans who identify as having a disability .
“The fact that we have so little content to account for that population of people, just from a business point of view, it feels like it’s bad business,” he said. “You have a totally untapped demo that is starving for stories like theirs, and we’re gonna ignore it? That doesn’t make sense.”
He said he hopes “Special” can help normalize the experience of those with disabilities. “For so long, we've been ignored,” he lamented. “I really hope that stops.”

"At forum on NYC's high school admissions, frustration rules - NBCNews.com",www.nbcnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/forum-nyc-s-high-school-admissions-frustration-rules-n993966,"New York City’s mayor and schools chancellor faced harsh criticism at a community forum in Queens on Thursday night as speaker after speaker pilloried their plan to eliminate an admissions exam for the city’s specialized high schools. “Not only is the rollout racist, but the whole concept is racist,” said David Lee, an alumnus of Brooklyn Technical High School, one of eight highly selective schools where the sole criterion for admission is passing a competitive test.
Lee’s remarks, and others like them, drew applause from a packed room on the second floor of Queens Borough Hall.
The forum was the first in a series of community meetings on diversity in specialized high school admissions. It was held by state senators, including John Liu, a Democrat from Queens who chairs the Senate’s New York City education committee.
“This is necessary because last year the city proposed a plan without including many parts of the city,” Liu said at the beginning of the meeting. “In particular, the Asian community was completely excluded, not inadvertently, but intentionally and deliberately.”
Sen. John Liu, D-Queens, talks to Senate members on opening day of the 2019 legislative session in the Senate Chamber at the Capitol on Jan. 9, 2019, in Albany, New York. Hans Pennink / AP file How and whether to diversify the city’s highly selective public schools — where three in five students are Asian — is a question that has touched off fierce debate across the city.
Anger has become particularly intense in the Asian American community, whose members rallied outside Queens Borough Hall before the forum as police officers looked on.
In June, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza announced a plan to phase out the required exam for specialized high schools and replace it with a model that admits top students from each of the city’s middle schools.
The city says the move will help boost diversity at specialized high schools, where blacks and Latinos account for just 10 percent of students, even as they make up nearly 70 percent of the city’s overall student population. Asian Americans are about 14 percent of the city’s students .
Because the Specialized High School Admissions Test is written into state law, ending it requires legislative approval. Bills have been introduced in both the state Assembly and Senate .
Related News Plan to diversify New York's top high schools divides Asian-American groups Some attendees expressed support for the mayor’s plan.
“It's very offensive to hear all the racial coding that African Americans are not good enough, if more of us are accepted into the specialized schools that it’s going to bring down the standards,” said Mary Alice Miller, who had tested into a specialized school.
But many said they disagreed with de Blasio’s call to end the test.
Horace Davis, a Brooklyn Tech graduate and president of the Caribbean American Society of New York, told attendees that blacks and Hispanics accounted for many of the students at his school during the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s.
He said the fact that the admissions process remains the same suggests the test is not to blame for the lack of diversity.
He was one of several critics who accused New York City’s school system of failing black and Hispanic students long before they get to high school. The city, they said, should create more gifted and talented programs in boroughs with underserved communities and establish more specialized high schools.
“Underrepresentation of blacks and Hispanics at specialized high schools is a symptom of a much larger problem,” said Davis, who noted that his child now attends his alma mater.
Re-Examined: Growing Tutoring Market Highlights Possible Gaps in Public Education Aug. 23, 2016 07:00 City Department of Education spokesperson Doug Cohen said in an email before the forum that “a single test doesn’t capture the full talent of students.”
“Our proposal will expand opportunity for the highest-performing students in middle schools across the City and make our specialized high schools academically stronger,” he said.
A study from the New York City Independent Budget Office , released in February, found that if the system proposed by de Blasio were fully in place, blacks would make up around 19 percent of all specialized high school offers and Latinos 27 percent.
Compared to actual enrollment numbers for the 2017-18 year, that’s about a fivefold increase for blacks and more than a fourfold increase for Latinos.
Related News Advocates allege NYC school plan discriminates against Asian Americans Asians would still account for the largest share of offers, though their numbers would be cut in half, from 61 to 31 percent.
For fall 2019 admissions, around 11 percent of offers went to blacks and Latinos combined, while 51 percent went to Asians and 29 percent to whites, city Department of Education data show. A total of 27,521 students sat for the exam.
For many Asian American parents, having their children earn a spot in a New York City specialized high school is crucial to ensuring their academic future.
“Taking away the test will marginalize opportunities for thousands of students, mostly low-income and mostly immigrant,” Lee said. “At this particular time, it also will marginalize mostly Asian students.”
The Test The Calandra-Hecht Act of 1971 , a New York state law, established the three-hour exam as the sole method by which students were admitted to what were then only three specialized schools: Stuyvesant High School, the Bronx High School of Science, and Brooklyn Tech.
A fourth, Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, does not use the exam, instead basing admissions on a competitive audition and academic records.
The city Department of Education has since added five more schools to the list requiring the test.
Over the last few decades, schools like Stuyvesant, Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech have seen their Asian American enrollment soar, as more and more people of Asian descent, among them first-generation immigrants, move to the city.
Asians account for 74 percent of students at Stuyvesant , 66 percent at Bronx Science and 61 percent at Brooklyn Tech , according to school data.
By contrast, blacks and Latinos combined make up just 4 percent of students at Stuyvesant, 9 percent at Bronx Science and 13 percent at Brooklyn Tech.
The percentage of white students was 19 percent at Stuyvesant and 23 percent at Brooklyn Tech and Bronx Science, figures showed.
Split on the issue Asian Americans in favor of keeping the specialized high school test view de Blasio’s proposal as an attack on fairness and merit-based admissions.
But others, among them Asian Americans , argue that using a single exam to decide who gets in prevents specialized schools from recruiting multiple levels of talent among people of color, particularly blacks and Latinos.
A Quinnipiac poll released in early April showed that 57 percent of New York City voters say other factors should be considered in deciding who is admitted to specialized high schools.
Asian voters appeared split on the issue. Forty-eight percent said other factors should be considered, while 46 percent said the single exam should be kept.
While not everyone Thursday night agreed on how best to change the specialized high school admissions process — if at all — they seemed to agree that there is no magic bullet.
Harry Lopez, a 1999 graduate of Brooklyn Tech, told NBC News before the forum began that parents play a vital role.
“They pushed me,” said Lopez, whose parents are immigrants. “Some people could say it’s abusive, but it wasn’t. They were just like, no, you have to work hard to get to where you want.”
Related News NYC selective high school admissions uproar a symptom of a much bigger problem Dayana Alexandre, the daughter of immigrants from Haiti and another 1999 graduate of Brooklyn Tech, agreed with Lopez.
Both said there needs to be more investment in early education. They also were against scrapping the exam.
“I believe the test levels the playing field and there’s no way of manipulating who gets in,” Alexandre said. “But they also have to prepare the underrepresented community so that they can have the opportunity to pass the test.”
The city Department of Education does have programs that offer some disadvantaged and underrepresented public and charter school kids preparation for the specialized high school exam.
But some wonder why so much test prep is even necessary if all public schools were truly preparing students to meet the demands of the specialized high school exam in the first place.
The Plan As part of his overhaul , de Blasio is also expanding the Discovery Program, which offers specialized high school spots to students who miss the exam cut-off score within a certain range and who attend a summer program. The program, also enshrined in state law, is designed to increase enrollment of low-income students.
The mayor’s expansion, which will amount to 20 percent of seats at each elite school, began with admissions for September. The city also adjusted program eligibility to target students in high-poverty schools.
With these changes, the mayor’s office estimated that offers to black and Latino students would increase from 9 percent to roughly 16 percent.
Data released by the city Department of Education this week show a slight uptick in offers to black and Latino students through both the test and Discovery invitations. Those groups combined made up 14 percent of offers this year, compared to 12 percent in 2018.
For the Discovery Program alone, 922 students received invitations this year, compared to 778 in 2018, though some ultimately will not qualify.
Related news Behind the 'model minority' myth: Why the 'studious Asian' stereotype hurts The share of Asians extended Discovery offers jumped from 43 percent in 2018 to 54 percent this year, while for whites it decreased from 26 percent in 2018 to 15 percent. Blacks edged up from 10 percent to 12 percent, and Latinos from 12 percent to 18 percent, figures show.
The city Department of Education expects to fill around 500 Discovery seats, based on the final pool of eligible students and historic enrollment.
“We’re using every tool at our disposal to increase diversity at the specialized high schools, but despite the incremental progress we’re making through the Discovery program, the status quo remains the same,” Carranza said in a statement. “We need to eliminate the test now.”
In December , a group of Asian American education advocates sued the city in Manhattan federal court, alleging that changes to the Discovery Program prevent Asian American students from vying for those seats.
It was unclear how gains made by Asians in the Discovery Program might affect that case, which is still pending.
Liu, the state senator, said another community forum is planned for Brooklyn in May. In a phone interview Friday, Liu called the Queens one productive.
But, he added, “I would have liked to hear more voices in favor of changing the process, just so that we can have a more well-rounded forum.”
Regardless of the track ultimately taken to address specialized high school admissions, many attendees Thursday night said ramming changes through too quickly was not the answer.
“It’s going to take a generation,” Lopez said.

Carlos Osorio / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 12, 2019, 10:10 PM GMT By Associated Press WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — An attorney for Patriots owner Robert Kraft said Friday that the public release of video evidence in the prostitution solicitation case against him would invade his privacy and jeopardize his right to a fair trial. William Burck told a Palm Beach County judge that there is “no need” to release the video. He spoke during a hearing held in part to determine whether media outlets could offer arguments in the case. “It’s basically pornography,” said Kraft’s lawyer William Burck at a hearing in Palm Beach County Court, according to CNBC. “There’s no need to see the video unless you actually have a prurient interest in seeing the video,” Burck said. “There’s no need for that [video] to be released” for the public to understand what Kraft allegedly did.” “It is alleged to be sexual conduct,” he said. Jupiter police obtained a search warrant to secretly record at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. Police say those cameras captured Kraft twice paying to have sex with spa employees in January. Kraft was charged with two counts of solicitation as part of a multicounty investigation that also resulted in about 300 male customers being charged, 10 massage parlors being closed and their owners charged with felony prostitution. Investigators initially said they were targeting human traffickers. But Assistant State Attorney Greg Kridos told the judge Friday that there was no evidence of human trafficking at the Jupiter spa. Burck said the previously highly publicized allegations of human trafficking by both police and State Attorney Dave Aronberg had amounted to ""politicking"" and that they added to potential harm to Kraft's privacy in releasing video evidence. Attorneys for media outlets say redacted versions of the video evidence should be released on public interest grounds, and Judge Leonard Hanser said Friday that he would grant their motion to intervene in the case. NBC News is among the media outlets seeking release of the video evidence. Hanser gave parties a deadline of Tuesday to submit additional documents. Kraft's attorneys say the videos are an illegal invasion of privacy and are not necessary to be released publicly because the affidavits describe the acts that took place. They are seeking a motion to suppress the videos, arguing they also would mar chances for a fair trial. NBC News contributed. "

The two doctors were featured in a piece on Kenya CitizenTV last year where they discussed potential safety concerns that came with their work in the area. Correa said at the time he had positive experiences working in other countries where the conditions were harsh, such as Venezuela. Hernandez expressed some anxiety about attacks in the area. “My reaction was bad because when I checked on the internet of Mandera county, the internet said Mandera county is a dangerous county for people,” Hernandez said in the video. At least 100 Cuban doctors have been brought to Kenya in an exchange program that saw about 50 Kenyans travel to Cuba for specialized training last year. Dr. Herera Correa Ohito said the extremist group has not claimed responsibility for the kidnappings, though authorities believe the terror organization had a hand in the kidnapping. Al-Shabab was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2008 by the U.S. State Department. The department called al-Shabab a brutal and violent extremist group. ""Al-Shabab has used intimidation and violence to undermine the Somali government and threatened civil society activists working to bring about peace through political dialogue and reconciliation,"" the department said in a March 2008 release. The organization was behind the attack on an upscale hotel and office complex in Nairobi in January that killed 14 people. In November an Italian volunteer, Silvia Romano, was kidnapped in southern Kenya’s coastal region by gunmen linked to al-Shabab. She has not been found. Today we have been reminded, again, of the evil machinations of international criminal networks. Two Cuban doctors were abducted in Mandera, while on their way to work and a security officer fatally injured. — Amb. Monica Juma (@Diplomacy_Kenya) April 12, 2019 Kidnapping for ransom was a frequent al-Shabab activity before 2011. That’s when Kenya sent troops into Somalia to fight the extremists who had kidnapped four Europeans that year. Kenya said the abductions threatened tourism, a key pillar of the economy. Kenyan troops are now part of the multinational African Union force bolstering Somalia’s weak government against al-Shabab. The extremist group has vowed retribution on Kenya for its troop presence in Somalia. Monica Juma, the cabinet secretary for foreign affairs in Kenya, tweeted about the ""evil machinations of international criminal networks"" on Friday. ""Security agencies are engaged in the search and rescue mission to ensure safe return. We (the Ministry of Foreign Affairs @ForeignOfficeKE) are also in contact with the Government of Cuba,"" Juma said. Doha Madani Doha Madani is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.

The Corvette — America's longest-running sports car — to get a radical change,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/corvette-america-s-longest-running-sports-car-get-radical-change-n994091,"The world of supercars is dominated by makes from across the pond — Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren. The Chevrolet Corvette has always been a more-bang-for-the-buck challenger with an Achilles heel that prevents world domination: its front-mounted engine is in the wrong place. With her announcement last night that the next-generation Corvette is to be revealed July 18, General Motors CEO Mary Barra all but confirmed America's longest-running sports car is about to get a long-awaited upgrade - mid-engine placement that will put it in the same league as those European rockets.
(Some fans of the Ford Mustang, first sold in 1964, say it's the longest-running U.S. sports car because Corvette, first available to buyers in 1953, skipped the 1983 model year to facilitate development of a new generation. Calling the Mustang, a four-seat coupe, a sports car, is debatable , however).
Barra, speaking Thursday at a New York event to honor families of first responders killed in 9/11, did not outright say the engine would be placed behind the driver, but she appeared with a camouflaged eighth-generation Corvette that has the short nose and long rear of a typical mid-engine vehicle.
Here’s the 411 on the Next Generation #Corvette . There's only one way to keep up with it: https://t.co/d5nlLQjYgU pic.twitter.com/Jf5l0ixiof
— Chevrolet (@chevrolet) April 11, 2019 ""Were not confirming or commenting on the engine even though it’s highly speculated,"" said Chevrolet spokeswoman Kelly Cusinato.
Mid-engine placement, considered ideal for racing because it results in better handling, is a foregone conclusion among Corvette aficionados, many of whom are giddy that, instead of being a front-engine drag racer, the next Corvette is likely to be more of a global track star.
""I think having a mid-engine will welcome new Corvette enthusiasts to the family,"" said Katie Ellison, editor of America’s Sports Car Magazine and marketing and communications manager at the Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where the Corvette is built.
She noted that it was long the dream of the late godfather of Corvette, Zora-Arkus Duntov, to put the motor in the middle. On Saturday corvetteblogger.com noted that the camouflaged Corvette revealed by CEO Barra includes an image of Duntov.
Some auto reviewers believe the highest-performance version of today's Corvette has more horsepower (755) than its front-engine layout can handle. What's more, bringing the European layout to the vehicle will make it appeal to younger buyers at a time when the Corvette's stereotypical customer spends most of his time in a recliner.
""We're already seeing the age trending downward,"" Ellison said.
One question among Corvette fans is whether GM can maintain it as a performance bargain. Prices today start at $55,000 and reach into the low $100,000s compared to roughly $200,000 and up for the European competition. Mid-engine development is likely to add thousands to the sticker.
""It’s the most affordable sports car out there,"" Ellison said. ""I'm sure it will be a little more expensive, but Chevrolet doesn't want to lose its core customers.""

"AOC defends Omar after Trump 9/11 video, calls on more Dems to speak out",www.nbcnews.com,Doha Madani,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/aoc-defends-omar-after-trump-9-11-video-calls-more-n994131,"President Donald Trump tweeted a video featuring images of 9/11 in a political attack on Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. — prompting some Democrats to rebuke the president's post. The video that Trump posted on Friday spliced a statement Omar made about the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks with footage of the Twin Towers in New York collapsing. It is captioned ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET.""
Omar's reference to the terrorist attacks came in a speech last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Los Angeles. During the event, Omar spoke about how Muslim Americans' were mistreated and their constitutional rights and freedoms were infringed on after the 9/11 attacks.
Within her remarks, Omar made a statement that her critics said glossed over that act of terror. Democrats contend, however, that the president's video could incite violence.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” she said in the speech last month.
CAIR was in fact founded in 1994, though its level of advocacy grew after 9/11.
It was the congresswoman's wording that ""some people did something"" — repeated in the video tweeted by Trump — however, that Omar's critics have seized upon.
WE WILL NEVER FORGET! pic.twitter.com/VxrGFRFeJM
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 12, 2019 Trump's video post on Friday echoed criticism of Omar on the front page of the New York Post on Thursday , which splashed the words ""Here's Your Something"" over an image of the World Trade Center towers ablaze.
In the days since, Omar's comments have gone viral, and it has drawn statements — and ""no comment"" — from party leaders as well as presidential contenders.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., appeared to try to find middle ground between the president and Omar's statement, though she did not mention the Minnesota congresswoman by name. Instead Pelosi said in a tweet that ""The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence.""
""The President shouldn't use the painful images of 9/11 or a political attack,"" she said, adding in a subsequent tweet that ""It is wrong for the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe.""

Omar, who has said that she has been subjected to numerous death threats, appeared to respond to the president's video in a series of tweets on Saturday afternoon. She noted a number of Trump administration policies that threaten ""the ideas of justice, of liberty, of the pursuit of happiness"" that the ""country was founded on,"" including the White House's child separation policy, transgender military ban and the Muslim ban.
""I did not run for Congress to be silent. I did not run for Congress to sit on the sidelines. I ran because I believed it was time to restore moral clarity and courage to Congress. To fight and to defend our democracy,"" she tweeted .
""No one person — no matter how corrupt, inept, or vicious — can threaten my unwavering love for America,"" she added in another tweet . ""I stand undeterred to continue fighting for equal opportunity in our pursuit of happiness for all Americans.""
Many members of party leadership declined to comment about the situation itself or speak to Omar's remarks. Those vying for the White House, however, seemed more inclined to voice their support for Omar after freshman congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted their criticism of Trump's post and called on Democrats to speak out.
Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who are both candidates for president, each came out in support of Omar fairly quickly.
""Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we,"" Sanders said on Twitter. ""The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.""
The President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman—and an entire group of Americans based on their religion. It's disgusting. It's shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.
— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 13, 2019 Warren went further and said in a Friday tweet that any elected official who refuses to condemn the video ""shares responsibility for it.""
""The President is inciting violence against a sitting congresswoman — and an entire group of Americans based on their religion,"" Warren said. ""It's disgusting. It's shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.""
Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a front runner in the wide field of Democratic presidential contenders, described the president's tweet to a town hall in South Carolina on Saturday morning. Many of those in attendance were unaware of the situation and gasped in response.
""This is an incitement of violence against Congresswoman Omar — against our fellow Americans who happened to be Muslim,"" O'Rourke said, who emphasized the prevalence of hate crimes in recent years and that the president's comments have consequences.
Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat with an increasingly growing platform, called the video an ""outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress"" that other members should speak out against.
AOC slams New York Post cover attacking Rep. Ilhan Omar April 11, 2019 01:00 She also Quote: d a poem by a German pastor, ""First They Came, "" which speaks to the failure of many people to resist the Nazis' persecution of Jews and other groups that ultimately led to the Holocaust.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who has been outspoken in her support of Omar, a fellow Muslim congresswoman, called the Post cover a ""pure racist act"" in an interview with MSNBC Thursday.
After Trump's posting the video Friday, Tlaib tweeted , ""enough is enough.""
""No more silence, with NY Post and now Trump taking Ilhan’s words out of context to incite violence toward her, it’s time for more Dems to speak up,"" Tlaib wrote. ""Clearly the GOP is fine with this shameful stunt, but we cannot stand by.""
On Saturday, GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted a Quote: by Donald Trump, Jr., who in a Friday opinion piece for Breitbart characterized Omar's words as ""disgraceful and untrue rhetoric.""
""@DonaldJTrumpJr is right about what Ilhan Omar said,"" she tweeted. ""When 3,000 Americans are murdered by radical Islamic terrorists, it’s not 'some people did something,' it’s an act of war.""
Anti-Muslim hate crimes are approximately five times higher than they were before 2001, according to the FBI. The United States government also passed controversial surveillance laws like the Patriot Act in the wake of the attacks, which was often used as the basis to spy on Muslim Americans and mosques in the United States.

Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 13, 2019, 12:54 AM GMT By Associated Press LOS ANGELES — A 15-year-old boy who was in the middle of a murder trial in his mother's stabbing death when he escaped from a Southern California jail was captured Friday night, authorities said. Ike Souzer escaped the Orange County Juvenile Hall, somehow got onto a roof and then jumped a perimeter fence just after midnight Friday, said Steve Sentman, chief probation officer for the county. Jail staff spotted Souzer on the roof, then turned on a facility-wide alarm and called the sheriff's office, he said. Sheriff's Capt. Mike Peters said deputies were ""very quick"" to respond but Souzer was able to elude capture. Ike Souzer Orange County Sheriff's Dept Late Friday the Orange County Sheriff's Department tweeted that the teen ""is back in custody."" The sheriff's office released surveillance footage showing Souzer tending to an apparent wound on his leg shortly after escaping and then walking seemingly casually away from the facility. The 6-foot, 200-pound teen was wearing red pants and a white shirt. Sentman said it's the first escape from the 434-bed facility in at least two decades and that an investigation is underway into how it happened. Souzer has been in custody since he was 13, when he was arrested on suspicion of fatally stabbing his mother, Barbra Scheuer-Souzer, 43. His escape came in the middle of Souzer's trial on a murder charge in juvenile court, said Kimberly Edds, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office. Souzer's public defender, David Hammond, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. A Gofundme page for Scheuer-Souzer says she was so good at helping her son with autism that she went back to school to help others with the condition and was about to graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Through her unconditional love and commitment, she helped her son go from non-verbal to verbal status,"" according to the page. ""Her whole goal was to help her son and the autistic community by giving back and serving the needs of others."" Scheuer-Souzer had three other grown children and three grandchildren.

Even so, Benjamin Netanyahu’s victory in the Israeli elections earlier this week served as a reminder that rules underpinning the international consensus are being rewritten before our eyes. Netanyahu is embarking on a record fifth term as prime minister. Most of the lawmakers in the coalition government he will head have opposed the removal of Jewish settlements on land that Palestinians envision for a future state.
Related World news World news One Israeli's journey from ultra-Orthodox settler to peace activist This appears to doom a two-state solution — which has been accepted in diplomatic circles since the mid-1990s as the only game in town in terms of peace and justice for Palestinians and Israelis.
A few days before the elections, Netanyahu declared that he would annex settlements in the West Bank — territory Israel captured during the Six-Day War of 1967 with its Arab neighbors. Many countries consider these communities to be illegal under the Geneva Conventions, which bans settling on territory occupied in war.
This is not a huge surprise: Netanyahu conditionally accepted the concept of creating of a Palestinian state in 2009, but six years later he vowed that a state would not happen under his watch.
Among Palestinians, support has also been ebbing amid frustration with failed negotiations.
But Netanyahu's vow to annex settlements is a big deal.
Netanyahu headed for historic fifth term after Gantz concedes April 10, 2019 01:00 “Although it may just be campaign sloganeering, we all need to be clear that Israeli sovereignty over all the Israeli settlements would make it impossible to create a Palestinian state,” wrote Hady Amr, a former deputy head for the Middle East at the U.S. Agency for International Development and an expert with the Brookings Institution think tank.
“The difficulty of separation — and the likelihood of annexation — is growing stronger by day,” Amr added.
In a statement Friday, a group of key U.S. lawmakers — Reps. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., Ted Deutch, D-Fla., and Brad Schneider, D-Ill., — said they were "" greatly concerned by the possibility of Israel taking unilateral steps to annex the West Bank .""
Such an Israeli move would likely spell the end to a troubled process that started with the Oslo Accord of Sept. 13, 1993 . The interim agreement was meant to lay the groundwork for peace by establishing a separate Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with a capital in eastern Jerusalem.
Related World news World news Amid Trump's Mideast push, an abandoned building reminds Palestinians of past failures But with negotiations at a standstill and after years of bloodshed, both sides are bitter and mistrustful — and settlements have been one of the most heated issues in efforts to restart peace talks that have been halted since 2014.
Jewish settlers in the West Bank have grown from just more than 100,000 in the 1990s to more than 400,000 now. Jews in the 60 percent controlled by Israel are governed by civilian law.
A Palestinian protester moves a burning tire during clashes with Israeli troops near the Jewish settlement of Beit El in the West Bank on March 27. Mohamad Torokman / Reuters Palestinians in these areas are subject to checkpoints, restrictions of movement, and an almost complete ban on construction and development, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that opposes the occupation.
The group says that ""for the past 50 years, Palestinian West Bank residents have been living under rigid military rule that primarily serves the interests of the state of Israel and Israeli settlers.""
The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, is increasingly seen as corrupt and heavy-handed with the population under its watch.
Dire conditions in the Gaza Strip complicate matters further. The strip is ruled by Hamas, a militant group that has fought in a series of conflicts with Israel since Jewish settlements there were dismantled in 2005, and the blockaded population inches closer to total humanitarian collapse every day.
Violence — particularly the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, that broke out in 2000 — alienated many of the Palestinians' allies in Israel and undermined talks, as well.
In a series of tweets Thursday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., underlined the fears of many allies of Israel and longtime supporters of a two-state solution.
“It’s not sustainable for Israel to militarily occupy the West Bank,” she wrote. “Nor is it just to continue denying Palestinians their inherent right of self-determination. I urge Israeli leaders to take no action — particularly annexing the West Bank — that would kill a two-state solution.”
Now that Prime Minister Netanyahu will likely form the next government, I urge his coalition to exercise restraint and reject campaign promises to annex any portion of the West Bank – doing so would be a serious blow to lasting peace.
— Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) April 11, 2019 “The only way for Israel to retain its Jewish and democratic character is to support the creation of an independent Palestine by its side,” she wrote.
Tweets like these don't get posted in a vacuum. Recent statements by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also raised the prospect that Trump is planning to formally change longstanding U.S. policy on the subject.
Under questioning by Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on Tuesday, Pompeo repeatedly declined to answer whether the\a two-state solution was still U.S. policy.
“We are in the process of laying down our vision of how to resolve a problem,” Pompeo said in apparent reference to Trump’s as-yet-to-be-unveiled “deal of the century” aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The plan spearheaded by Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner is expected to be announced after Netanyahu forms a new government.
Related World news World news As Israel moves right, young American Jews target Birthright tours in protest While pledging that the administration is intent on ""making life better"" for people in Gaza and the West Bank, Pompeo would not say whether the White House supported “full and equal political and legal rights” for Palestinians under a one-state solution.
“Ultimately, the Israelis and the Palestinians will decide on how to resolve this,” he said.
The White House has already made a series of decisions that have endeared him to Netanyahu, including the decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem , and the recognition of Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967 .
After this week's election, longtime Palestinian politician and leader Hanan Ashrawi said Trump had ""emboldened"" Netanyahu's ""extremist and militaristic agenda.""
""This cynical alliance against Palestinian rights and the standing of the rules-based international order remains unchallenged by the rest of the international community, thereby reinforcing the rightist and populist agendas,"" she said.

Head of Sudan's military council steps down a day after coup,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/head-sudan-s-military-council-steps-down-day-after-coup-n994136,"KHARTOUM — The new head of Sudan's military council said on Saturday a civilian government would be formed after consultations with the opposition and the transition period would last for a maximum of two years, as protesters kept up pressure for rapid change. In his first televised address, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Abdelrahman said he was also cancelling a night curfew ordered by his predecessor and ordered the release of all prisoners jailed under emergency laws ordered by ousted President Omar al-Bashir .
Bashir was overthrown on Thursday after weeks of mass protests brought on by rising food costs, high unemployment and increasing repression during his three decades in power.
Protest organisers had earlier on Saturday urged people to keep marching to demand a civilian government after the defense minister and the intelligence chief stepped down.
Defense Minister Awad Ibn Auf stepped down as head of the transitional military council late on Friday after only a day in the post.
Celebrations erupted on the streets of Khartoum overnight after Ibn Auf's resignation. Thousands of protesters waved flags and illuminated mobile phones in the darkness and drivers hooted car horns. People chanted: ""The second has fallen!"" a reference to Ibn Auf and Bashir, witnesses said.
""Islamists have now lost control and they are in shock. Their ability to project influence in an organized way inside the state appears weak,"" said Sudanese analyst Khalid al-Tijani.
""The reason for the changes in Sudan is the pressure from protesters and pressures within the army, and the fear among military commanders of a split in the armed forces.""
Related News Sudan's president ousted by military after months of protests The new head of the military council, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan Abdelrahman, is a commander believed to be more ready to talk to demonstrators.
Burhan was the third most senior general in the Sudanese armed forces and is little known in public life. As head of Sudan’s ground forces he oversaw Sudanese troops fighting in the Saudi-led Yemen war and has close ties to senior Gulf military officials.
The military council said earlier it expected a pre-election transition to last two years at most or less if chaos could be avoided. The head of the military council's political committee, Omar Zain al-Abideen, said the council would hold a dialogue with political groups.
The announcement appeared aimed at reassuring demonstrators who had pressed for months for Bashir's departure and resumed protests against army rule after his ouster on Thursday, calling for quicker and more substantial change.
Bashir, 75, himself seized power in a 1989 military coup. He had faced 16 weeks of demonstrations sparked by rising food costs, high unemployment and increasing repression during his three decades of autocratic rule.
The protests escalated last Saturday when thousands of demonstrators, apparently bolstered by change in Algeria following similar protests, marched toward the Defence Ministry in central Khartoum to deliver a memorandum demanding the military side with them.
At least 16 people were killed and 20 injured by stray bullets at protests and sit-ins on Thursday and Friday, a police spokesman said. Government buildings and private property were also attacked, spokesman Hashem Ali added.
He asked citizens to help ensure safety and public order.
Protest organizers have vowed not to end their street action until a civilian transitional council is formed, saying rule by military commanders who for years were al-Bashir loyalists is just an extension of his regime.
Related News Sudan's Omar al-Bashir Flies Home and Evades Arrest: Official Ibn Auf was Bashir's vice president and defense minister and is among a handful of Sudanese commanders whom Washington imposed sanctions on over their alleged role during atrocities committed in the Darfur conflict that began in 2003 .
The council said on Friday it would not extradite Bashir, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague , over accusations of genocide in Darfur during the insurgency that led to the death of an estimated 300,000 people. He denies the allegations.
World powers, including the United States and Britain, said they supported a peaceful and democratic transition sooner than two years. China said it would continue to seek cooperation with Sudan regardless of the political situation.

Hypersonic air travel just took a step closer to reality,www.nbcnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/hypersonic-air-travel-just-took-step-closer-reality-ncna993366,"Sixteen years after the Concorde supersonic airliner took its last flight, a handful of companies are working to create a new generation of airliners capable of flying faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1, or about 770 miles per hour). Firms like Boom and Aerion promise to be flying passengers at 1,000 miles per hour or more by the mid-2020s. But some companies are working toward passenger planes that will leave these supersonic jets in the dust. These so-called hypersonic aircraft would be capable of flying at or above Mach 5, or about 3,800 miles per hour. At Mach 5, a trip from New York City to London would take just two hours instead of the typical seven or eight.
An English company claims to have taken a big step toward a hypersonic future . Reaction Engines, based in Oxfordshire, announced Monday that it had successfully tested an engine cooling system that could support aircraft flying at Mach 3.3. If subsequent tests go well, the “pre-cooler” system could help aircraft reach Mach 5 or higher — and possibly power a spaceplane.
The system addresses one of the biggest challenges in the development of hypersonic airplanes : controlling the buildup of extreme heat within engines.
The Sabre engine was created to curb the extreme heat buildup in hypersonic plane engines. Reaction Engines At Mach 5, air temperatures inside an engine can reach 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s enough to melt metal, and it interferes with the combustion that generates the propulsive power. The pre-cooler lowers temperatures by passing super-hot air over thousands of tiny coolant-filled tubes.
Related Innovation Innovation These planes could jet you around the world at hypersonic speed In the first round of tests, conducted in March at a facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port in Adams County, researchers used a fighter jet engine to blast the experimental device with air heated to 788 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s just about the temperature that an engine would experience while traveling at Mach 3.3, or 2,532 miles per hour. The device cooled the airstream to a manageable temperature in less than 1/20th of a second, according to the company.
The successful test was “a hugely significant milestone,” Reaction Engines CEO Mark Thomas said in a statement.
Other experts expressed enthusiasm, too.
“It’s very exciting,” Jeffrey Hoffman, an aerospace engineering professor at MIT, said of the successful test. But, he added, “they’re basically trying something that’s very new, pushing materials to extreme limits, and there’s a lot of unknowns in there.”
In future testing, the pre-cooler will be challenged with temperatures even higher than the 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit typical of flight at Mach 5, the threshold for hypersonic flight. And Reaction Engines said craft powered by its cool-as-a-cucumber engine could someday reach speeds of Mach 25, or 16,537 miles per hour, in space. Just not anytime soon, Hoffman warns.
“There’s a long way to go before we’re flying hypersonic vehicles from the surface of the Earth up into orbit,” he said. “We just have to wait and see.”

'Frustration grows' as Congress delays Puerto Rico disaster relief discussions to May,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/frustration-grows-congress-delays-puerto-rico-disaster-relief-discussions-may-n994116,"Puerto Rico will have to wait until May for Congress to resume discussions over disaster relief funding, deepening a growing uncertainty over hurricane recovery efforts. “These funds are very critical for our plans to achieve full recovery and achieve certain goals associated with housing infrastructure and economic development programs ,” Manuel Laboy Rivera, Puerto Rico’s secretary of economic development, told NBC News. “After this devastation that happened in 2017 [Hurricanes Maria and Irma], Puerto Rico should be in the right path for long term recovery and the funds associated with that, as any other U.S. jurisdiction, should be addressed with a greater sense of urgency.”
Lawmakers failed to pass legislation to provide disaster relief funds to areas affected by hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters before leaving for a two-week recess.
“Congress should have already passed a desperately-needed disaster aid package instead of delaying action,” said Erica González, director of the advocacy group Power 4 Puerto Rico, in a statement. “Nutritional assistance and resiliency support are a matter of life and death for so many Puerto Ricans on the island.”
Trump lies about aid to Puerto Rico April 3, 2019 06:56 Marion Mollegen McFadden, senior vice president for public policy and a senior adviser for resilience at Enterprise Community Partners, explained that communities tend to face deep recovery challenges if they don’t know when relief funds will start to flow. It especially hinders processes to develop efficient recovery plans.
“Right now, nobody knows when the money is going to come, or if they will be able to use it,” McFadden told NBC. “As weeks turn into months… frustration grows. Homes that have been damaged and not repaired become more deteriorated.”
The latest funding delay comes as the island continues to be at the center of a showdown between Congress and the White House over how much money Puerto Rico should receive for recovery.
Various disaster aid bills and amendments failed to pass the Senate this month as President Donald Trump repeatedly doubled down on his opposition to granting Puerto Rico further federal recovery funds, a move that deepened divides between Republicans and Democrats.
Senate Republicans wanted to provide enough money to finance a $600 million food assistance program in Puerto Rico and $5 million for a study on the impact of emergency aid after the hurricane, while also making sure that southern hurricane-hit states such as Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, as well as Midwestern states such as Iowa and Nebraska suffering from floods had access to more aid.
While Senate Democrats agreed on adding aid to other states, they countered that Puerto Rico was not getting enough money to address its needs.
Democrats wanted to also provide funds for additional projects on the island such as FEMA reimbursements to local government entities who spent money doing emergency-related work; as well as $25 million to restore the Caño Martín Peña, a body of water that stretches alongside the San Juan Bay area and is surrounded by low-income communities that were hit hard by Maria.
“What do we say to them [Republicans and Trump]? You’re not getting a nickel for anywhere else until Puerto Rico is fully funded … Next time I see you, I hope I can say that we got the aid for the rest of America but that we also got the same amount for 3 million American citizens who live in the island of Puerto Rico,” said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., during a gala event Thursday night.
Related News Puerto Rico struggles to get disaster aid amid Congress, Trump showdown According to Elizabeth Kellar, director of public policy and deputy executive director at the International City/County Management Association, the best role government can have during a recovery period is “as a convener, [bringing] together groups across sectors” — including private entities, philanthropy and others — to strategize on efforts.
“It’s going to take a very long time to recover and people are going to get impatient… that’s why leaders need to step up and clearly address progress in a realistic, holistic way,” Kellar told NBC.
Before leaving for a two-week recess, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., introduced a $17.2 billion emergency supplemental bill to support Puerto Rico and the floods in the Midwest. Lawmakers will most likely vote on the legislation after congressional sessions resume on April 29.

"An ALS patient's dilemma: End his own life, or die slowly of the disease?",www.nbcnews.com,Jon Schuppe,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/als-patient-s-dilemma-end-his-own-life-or-die-n993421,"U.S. news An ALS patient's dilemma: End his own life, or die slowly of the disease? “You need not suffer this way,” the dying man told a friend who also had ALS. “You have a choice.” As ALS slowly robbed him of breath, George Gallegos wrestled with ending his own life. Benjamin Rasmussen / for NBC News Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 13, 2019, 9:44 AM GMT By Jon Schuppe and Melanie Bencosme PARKER, Colo. — In early February, as Lou Gehrig’s disease left him fighting to breathe, George Gallegos had a decision to make: Was he ready to die? Gallegos, 68, a retired psychologist, sat in an electric wheelchair in his brightly lit home southeast of Denver. His illness, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, had left him unable to speak more than a couple of words without pausing to inhale, his chest heaving and neck cords bulging with each gulp. His hands were curled into claws. His voice had weakened to a near whisper. ""My condition has turned more serious,” he said one Monday afternoon. He was still reeling from a respiratory attack that forced him to spend much of the weekend drawing oxygen from a ventilator. “When I get to this place, I get scared. I get to feeling like I'm losing every day, and ALS is winning.” Gallegos had two choices. He could allow the disease to take its course. Or he could pursue another option, newly legal, that would allow him to pick the time and place of his death. Taking control of death: How an ALS patient battled with choosing his last day April 12, 2019 15:16 Under a law Colorado passed in 2016, he had obtained a prescription for a cocktail of drugs that would put him to sleep, drop him into a coma, and, within an hour, stop his heart and breathing. He’d navigated a thicket of bureaucratic requirements to get approved. He’d prepared his family, arranged his funeral, and written detailed directions for the handling of his accounts. The next steps were to call the pharmacy, have someone mix the drugs in a cup, and drink. Members of the right-to-die movement have fought to make “death with dignity” possible for terminally ill Americans. Thousands have ended their lives since 1997, when it was first made legal in Oregon. On Friday, New Jersey became the eighth state to legalize medical aid in dying, and others are considering it. Advocates say the option gives patients more control over their fate, and relieves some of their anxiety over death. Opponents say giving people the ability to end their own lives is immoral, undercuts doctors and risks abuse. In the middle are people like Gallegos. He embraced the option but spent his final weeks agonizing over it. Roughly a third of people who get prescriptions for end-of-life medications do not take them, according to states that track their use. As more states offer the option to terminally ill patients, thousands of Americans each year, along with their loved ones, are confronting this harrowing dilemma. Gallegos did not want to suffer unnecessarily, but he wasn’t sure where to draw the line. Was it when he could no longer breathe, or eat, on his own? Or when he felt he’d become too much of a burden to his family? The drugs offered an escape, but he worried that ending his life was cowardly and unnatural. Family members, friends, doctors and counselors told Gallegos he would know when the time was right, but he wasn’t so sure. “Day to day, I just fight with the symptoms and hope I can still make the decision as to when my last day will be,” Gallegos said in one of many conversations with NBC News as he moved toward death. “I know I’m close,” he said. ‘There’s no way I’m going to die’ The disease came with dates. The neurologist who diagnosed Gallegos with ALS in November 2015 cited research on average survival rates: Most patients lived from two-and-a-half to five years. “Within that window is likely to be the time you have remaining,” the doctor told him. George Gallegos with his dog Yaleb in 2009. Sandra Martinez The news — following symptoms that began with difficulty writing certain numbers — felt like an ambush. Gallegos, an avid waterskier and fly fisherman, considered himself “relatively bulletproof” as he entered his late 60s. Now he was promised an early, agonizing death from a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, leaving them unable to communicate with the body’s muscles, which then waste away. Those afflicted gradually lose the ability to speak, swallow, control their bladder and bowels, and breathe. It seemed impossible that could happen to him. “There’s no way I’m going to die,” he remembered thinking. “I’m feeling OK. I can’t write so well. Yes, I have a limp. But I’m OK. I’m healthy. They’re telling me something that’s not going to happen to me.” George Gallegos visits Yellowstone National Park in 2015. Courtesy of Sandra Martinez When his denial subsided, he saw that he could use his remaining time to say goodbye to the people he loved, leave things in proper order for Karen Miller, his partner of two decades, and live the rest of his days in as dignified a way as possible. At a basic level, that meant being able to maintain connections with family without becoming completely dependent on others and to die at home. He joined an ALS support group. He retired from the nursing facility where he was known by the elderly residents as Dr. George. Many of them contributed to a GoFundMe campaign that sent Gallegos to the 2016 Super Bowl in San Francisco, which his beloved Denver Broncos won. Gallegos also watched with interest a campaign to make medical aid in dying legal in Colorado. In November 2016, he and Miller joined 65 percent of Colorado voters who approved a law based on Oregon’s that legalized the option. By then, Gallegos was getting around in an electric wheelchair. “Why wouldn’t you allow a person who is sure to die the opportunity to die with dignity, taking medications and perhaps avoid all the long worse kind of suffering that the condition brings to them?” Gallegos recalled thinking during the campaign. But he didn’t pursue it himself. “I was thinking: ‘That’s way far away. I’m not close to that yet. I can do it whenever,’” Gallegos said in a November 2018 interview. “Which was technically true. But I was closer than I would know.” ‘There are times when we'll just cry together’ ALS’s assault on Gallegos’ central nervous system continued. He relied more on voice-to-text software for emails and text messages. His lung capacity diminished, requiring more time on a ventilator. It grew harder to swallow and cough. His speech slurred more often. Cleaning himself and going to the bathroom became arduous. He rarely left his house. With each new complication, Gallegos added to an array of medications that helped him get through each day. He took pills for pain, swelling, chronic itchiness, bladder spasms, constipation, infections, lung congestion, sleeplessness, heartburn and high blood pressure. He kept track of them in a pill box and washed them down with water sucked from a cup fitted with a wide straw. He depended on others for routine tasks. Nurses stopped by daily. He hired an Army veteran who lived nearby to help when Miller, a secretary at a nearby middle school, was at work. Medicare and long-term care insurance covered much of the cost, but still the out-of-pocket bills mounted. That included $5,000 for the wheelchair, more than $20,000 for a used wheelchair-accessible van and more than $20,000 to make their bathroom accessible. George Gallegos and his wife, Karen Miller, in their home. Benjamin Rasmussen / for NBC News The veteran Gallegos hired, Kristine Kettlewell, fed him breakfast and lunch, helped him brush his teeth, ran errands, assisted him with paperwork. On good days, they went out for lunch or to shop. When Miller returned home, she fed him dinner and got him ready for bed. She often woke in the middle of the night to get him a drink of water or adjust his blanket. He soon began sleeping in his wheelchair. They’d been together since 1997 without getting married; each had children or stepchildren from prior marriages. With ALS closing in, they decided to make it official. In April 2018, they were wed in their living room by a chaplain from Gallegos’ palliative-care program, with only their dog, a bichon frise named Yaleb, beside them. At the same time, Gallegos began preparing Miller for life without him. He wrote out instructions on whom to call, what accounts to change, what bills to pay. The disease tested their relationship: Miller, with little time to relax, sometimes lost patience with Gallegos, and he hated feeling like a burden. But it also brought them closer. He learned to savor certain moments ─ a deep conversation, a blue sky, a tasty meal ─ that reminded him how wonderful it was to be alive and to love. He told Miller he was sad that their time together was nearly over. “There are times when we'll just cry together,” Miller, 58, said. ‘You have a choice’ The worsening symptoms forced Gallegos to think more seriously about medical aid in dying. He watched members of his ALS support group endure excruciating deaths from a disease that typically ends with respiratory failure but can also cause pneumonia, malnutrition and blockages in the arteries of the lungs. He recalled one friend “writhing and contorting, scratching, clawing, gnawing, hurting others around him, trying to escape the jaws of death.” The man refused to consider ending his own life. “You need not suffer this way,” Gallegos told him. “You have a choice.” Gallegos decided that he, too, should have a choice. Colorado’s law, which went into effect in December 2016, includes a rigorous process to make sure the drugs are administered voluntarily to people already facing imminent death. The law also frees patients of the legal implications of suicide: It requires that the death certificate list the underlying illness, so that there is no impact on life-insurance policies. Following the law’s requirements, Gallegos saw two doctors who documented that he was in sound mental health, had six months to live and wasn’t being forced to seek the drugs. The process stretched through the summer of 2018. After getting approved, Gallegos received the prescription for a combination of drugs known as DDMP last September. If he decided he wanted the drugs, all he had to do was call a pharmacy, pay $450 and have them delivered. Miller ─ who’d agreed to go along with whatever he decided ─ could then prepare the drugs and bring him the solution, but the law said he had to sip and swallow it himself. Having the option to legally end his own life felt like an important accomplishment ─ another step in preparing for his final days. But he still did not know if he’d go through with it. He sought advice from people he trusted, and he also looked for signs. At one point he jokingly tied his fate to the Broncos’ mediocre season: If they kept losing, he’d do it. If they went on a winning streak, he’d hold off. “I am still in a search,” Gallegos said in an interview at his home in November. ‘I can’t see how that presents me with dignity’ No signs arrived. Through fall and winter, as the breathing and coughing attacks grew more frequent, Gallegos remained unable to decide whether, or when, to take the drugs. He’d always been slightly built, and the loss of muscle made him look spectral in loose-fitting sweatpants and a fleece jacket. His speech diminished, but his intellect was as sharp as ever. “I'm wondering how much longer I will choose to live, in recognition of the quality-of-life issue that seems to erode, evaporate, daily,” he said in early December. “It's really a hard thing.” His spent longer stretches on the ventilator, which delivered oxygen through a mask that covered his face. His bedtime routine with Miller, which included lifting him from the toilet, tested them both. He wondered how long he could expect her to be his caregiver. They managed a relaxing Christmas Day, watching old movies by themselves. But by New Year’s Eve, George was asking Miller to pound him on the back to break up his chest congestion. Afraid of choking, he didn’t eat anything much thicker than yogurt. “I’m useless,” he said. Advocates say medical aid in dying ─ known as MAID ─ gives patients more power and dignity. But he couldn’t see it. ALS would always be more powerful. And was it really more dignified to end his own life? He didn’t see it that way. “I really feel like I'm running away from a big bad option that's coming to kill me,” he said in mid-January. ‘The finish line of my life’ The next month, Gallegos decided to check himself into a nursing facility for five days. The goal was to have the staff help him “retrain” his bowels so he could go to the bathroom during the day, giving Miller a break. “I feel discouraged because I know this is another indicator of things getting progressively worse for me,” he said. He paused every couple of words, eyes widening and eyebrows rising as he inhaled. “I’m moving towards the finish line of my life.” Before he left, Miller asked him: “George, are you ready to get the meds?” “I think I’m ready,” he told her. “I think I need to do it soon before I lose the strength.” He decided to get the prescription filled when he returned. Gallegos' ALS symptoms began with weakness in his hands. Benjamin Rasmussen / for NBC News At the nursing facility, Gallegos didn’t get the around-the-clock care he was used to. He suffered another respiratory attack, and was unable to complete the bowel regimen. He returned home after four days, on Feb. 22, looking pale and frightened. Miller had trouble understanding him. He asked to be put immediately on his ventilator, and remained on it for most of that day and the next, watching TV and eating a bit. On Feb. 24, a Sunday, nurses arrived to give him a shower. When he emerged, his head was slumped to his chest. Miller rushed to Gallegos and searched for a pulse, but she couldn’t find one. She and the nurses put him on his ventilator, then dressed him and put him in bed as they waited for a hospice nurse to arrive. The nurse confirmed that Gallegos was dead. Miller kissed him. “Thank you for all these wonderful years,” she said. A ‘dignified’ way to die? He didn’t die scared. Miller consoled herself with that thought. Whether he died with dignity was another question. “I don’t think he would have thought that was a dignified way to die,” Miller said the day after Gallegos’ March 3 funeral. In the living room was a bouquet of Broncos-orange roses that had surrounded Gallegos’ urn at the service. “We had to dress him in bed. Put on his clothing. I think he probably would have prefered to use MAID, but it didn’t end up that way.” Gallegos had meticulously planned for all aspects of his death, but wrestled with the option that medical aid in dying offered. He chased an answer until the end. “I don’t know how people do such a thing,” Gallegos said three weeks before his death. “But that’s what I think I’m supposed to be able to do: decide when is my last day. Will it be a weekend? Will it be a weekday? Will it be on a Monday? I have no idea. But I’m supposed to know.” Jon Schuppe Jon Schuppe writes about crime, justice and related matters for NBC News.

But for some churchgoers and black residents in St. Landry Parish and across south central Louisiana, the fear remains that it could happen again. And there's a good reason. Historic racial violence and bloodshed in Opelousas, where two of the churches are, and visible Ku Klux Klan activity in the surrounding area about 20 years ago remain painful reminders of intolerance and bigotry that some worry still lurks on the fringes. ""We are grateful that law enforcement worked very rapidly,"" said John Milton, the religious affairs chairman of the NAACP chapter in Lafayette, about 20 miles from the churches. ""But we believe that it's much more deeper than this case. Because of the past history of black church burnings, the bottom line is we know there is a substantial connection between race and this event, and this is not an isolated incident."" Louisiana church fires: Black metal music may have influenced suspect April 12, 2019 01:40 Federal investigators stressed at a news conference Thursday that they had not yet determined a motive for the burnings or whether the attacks constitute a hate crime. Holden Matthews, 21, was charged with three counts of arson for allegedly setting fire to the three churches in St. Landry Parish over 10 days beginning March 26. Officials said that Matthews, who is white and the son of a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy, appeared to be a fan of black metal music, a subgenre of heavy metal that has been associated with white nationalist ideology and church burnings in Norway. An affidavit filed in the case said authorities linked Matthews to the fires with the help of surveillance video, cellphone tower data and the purchase of a gas can and other materials from a Walmart. ""When people feel threatened, they will lash out and strike first,"" Milton said. St. Landry Parish, brimming with Creole culture and a population of more than 83,000, is about 56 percent white and 42 percent black, census data shows . Rick A. Swanson, a professor and civil rights researcher at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said a pattern of violence against black people and black churches in the area has roots dating to Reconstruction after the Civil War. Most notably, in 1868, black families in St. Landry were harassed and killed by vigilante white men upset over the newfound voting influence of freed African Americans. Some estimates at the time put the number killed at 200, although that figure has been disputed, according to reports on what is referred to as the Opelousas massacre , which set the stage for lynchings and other racial strife throughout the state. ""There's a very intense history that can't be ignored,"" Swanson said.

Gerald Herbert / AP As the cornerstone for black communities across the South, churches were threatened, burned and bombed during the civil rights movement. Louisiana was not immune from the wave of church burnings in the 1990s that led President Bill Clinton to form a National Church Arson Task Force to investigate the causes. Five churches that were damaged or destroyed were in Louisiana, where David Duke, a prominent white supremacist, had won a state House race a few years earlier. In the Lafayette area in the mid-'90s, a local public-access cable TV channel allowed a Klan leader to host his own show, ""The Klan in Akadiana"" — a play on the state's Acadiana region celebrated as the heart of Cajun country. News reports in 1996 described the show, which attracted ""a few thousand die-hard cable subscribers,"" as ""an hour of hooded robes, Confederate flags and burning crosses."" The local NAACP, however, challenged how the show's host, an imperial wizard of the Knights of the White Kamellia, allowed several guests to wear masks — violating a 1924 state statute that said mask-wearing was prohibited in public, except for events such as Halloween and Mardi Gras. Related 'Blackness isn't safe, anywhere': How the church burnings in Louisiana send a dangerous message After attracting national attention, the show was off the air the following year. Locally, Swanson said, there hasn't been a blatant peddling of white supremacist ideology in recent memory, although hate groups have been on the rise nationally over the past four years. There are plans Saturday for local NAACP members and faith leaders to come together in Opelousas to talk about restoring their sense of community, Milton said. With this Palm Sunday marking the beginning of Holy Week, worshippers at the three affected churches — St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, both in Opelousas — have found other places to hold services. Celina Richard, who belongs to the Greater Union Baptist Church, said she doesn't necessarily need to know whether hate motivated someone to target her church — where she was baptized at 16, had married at 21 and buried her parents last year. But the destruction of her church, which has about 100 members, has shattered her feeling of security. Congregants must rebuild the burnt ruins now considered a crime scene.

"If Daenerys Targaryen can teach Jon Snow not to fear dragons, you can learn not to fear snakes",www.nbcnews.com,Catherine Bartlett,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/if-daenerys-targaryen-can-teach-jon-snow-not-fear-dragons-ncna993626,"The long-awaited final season of ""Game of Thrones"" is just days away and fan theories are flying. Is Cersei actually pregnant? Is Littlefinger alive? Can we officially 'ship Brienne and Tormund? But there’s one plot point that clearly cannot be debated: Daenerys is going to love her dragons. The massive, fire-breathing flying reptiles are petrifying to her adversaries but fierce protectors of her, the mother who raised them from eggs. Named after her late husband and brothers, the dragons are Dany’s family — and her guarantee of a powerful future.
In Season 7, Jon Snow and Dany had a reptile rendezvous and finally met Drogon and Rhaegal (her third, Viserion, is currently a Zombdragon ). Dany proclaimed “They’re not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, no matter how terrifying they are to everyone else — they’re my children.”
Related Pop Culture Pop Culture Five minutes with Ned Stark: His 'Game of Thrones' predictions and whether he'll return That’s a sentiment to which every entomologist, herpetologist and icky-animal lover can relate: ""-ologists"" the world over empathize with Dany’s love of the unlovable. Once you understand a creature, its behaviors and unique contributions to our shared world, it makes no difference if that animal is small, soft and cuddly, or if it sports scales and a split tongue. They are just as appreciated and and here’s the thing: You can learn to love them, too.
But, while people who study bugs and reptiles naturally enjoy sharing their passion with audiences, those animals and the people who love them are disproportionately met with fear, disgust and downright rudeness.
The science behind our phobias of creepy-crawlies doesn’t seem set in stone; it’s still being debated whether fear of these animals is learned or innate . However, it is clear that, in part, children learn from their parents and mimic their behaviors. When a parent acts scared, the child will be, too.

As an Education Specialist for the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, I’ve had the privilege of guiding hundreds of children through meeting a snake up close for the first time. Some are cautious, while some are excited.
There was one young girl, for instance, whose body language initially displayed nervousness: Her shoulders were scrunched up, arms bent at the elbow, as she slowly reached forward — not unlike Jon Snow nervously extending his hand toward Drogon. But she touched it and, when I asked what it felt like, she said, “Like an ear of corn."" Her explanation was spot-on in a way I’d never been able to verbalize in my decade of teaching: An ear of corn, smooth, pebbled and room temperature.
 'Game of Thrones' trailer breakdown: What HBO does — and does not — want us to know about season eight Her description was perfect, but what was most memorable to me was her smile. Her hesitancy changed at first touch to surprise and grins. She unfurled like a flower blooming as her fear wore off and her curiosity grew. Another girl whispered in my ear “I love snakes.” It touched me, but I couldn’t help but wonder why that was a secret?
Our fear, which is broadly undeserved, is a problem for snakes (as well as other reptiles who can also inspire fear and loathing).
Snakes are necessary predators in an ecosystem: Not only are they effective forms of rodent control, they also eat eggs, frogs, lizards, insects, other snakes , rabbits, tadpoles, birds and even crustaceans. A healthy ecosystem has snakes keeping those animal populations in check.
Furthermore, snakes can become snacks for other animals, providing necessary nutrients for opportunistic hunters. Roadrunners, raptors, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, raccoons, badgers and even vultures (if they see them already dead) enjoy snake snacks.
And snakes are impressive seed dispersers : Rodents who have eaten seeds fall prey to snakes and the seeds, undisturbed by the gastrointestinal tract of a carnivore, can pass through unharmed and deposited. The seeds are then also ensconced in little fertilizer packets, which helps the plants germinate far from their original location.
(Plus, snakes are beyond gorgeous .)
Daenerys and a dragon in Season 5, Episode 10 of ""Game of Thrones."" HBO What snakes aren’t are sneaky predators trying to hunt down humans; they’re actually shy, reclusive loners looking for a little empathy. Many a gardener and hiker has been in the vicinity of a snake that never even advertised its presence. Snakes are actually wary of all large mammals and prefer to stay in camouflaged coils. It isn’t until a snake is approached by a scary creature — like a hawk or a human with a shovel — that they will defend themselves. If your life was threatened, wouldn't you fight back?
Humans, though, are dangerous threats to snakes: Even one inadvertent step on a snake's back can break ribs and destroy vital organs, which is why they don’t invite attention.
Remember that a reptile fear is potentially learned and, even if animals that shed their skin make your skin crawl, try not to pass on the phobia.

Trump's early weekend message on Twitter came after Kim said he would consider another summit, but set the year's end as a deadline for Washington to offer mutually acceptable terms for an agreement, the country's state-run media said. Kim made the comments during a speech Friday at a session of the North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament, which made a slew of personnel changes that bolstered his diplomatic lineup amid stalemated negotiations with the United States. According to the Korean Central News Agency, he blamed the collapse of his summit with Trump in February on what he described as unilateral demands by the U.S. , which he said raised questions over whether Washington has genuine willingness to improve relations. But Kim said his personal relationship with the American president remains good and that they could exchange letters at ""any time.""

""We of course place importance on resolving problems through dialogue and negotiations. But U.S.-style dialogue of unilaterally pushing its demands doesn't fit us, and we have no interest in it,"" Kim said during the speech. The United States has said the summit in Vietnam broke down because of the North's excessive demands for sanctions relief in return for limited disarmament measures. In their first summit last June in Singapore, Trump and Kim issued a vague statement calling for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when and how it would occur. Kim repeated earlier claims that North Korea's crippled economy would persevere through heavy international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons program and that he wouldn't ""obsess over summitry with the United States out of thirst for sanctions relief."" Related Trump tweet on North Korea sanctions sparks hours of confusion Kim said the United States has been refusing to withdraw what the North perceives as ""hostile policies"" while sticking to ""mistaken judgment that we would succumb to maximum pressure."" ""If the United States approaches us with the right manner and offers to hold a third North Korea-U.S. leaders' summit on the condition of finding solutions we could mutually accept, then we do have a willingness to give it one more try,"" he added. ""We will wait with patience until the end of the year for the United States to come up with a courageous decision. But it will clearly be difficult for a good opportunity like last time to come up."" The lack of substantial disarmament commitments from the North and the deepening impasse in nuclear negotiations have fueled doubts on whether Kim would ever voluntarily relinquish an arsenal he may see as his strongest guarantee of survival. Some experts say it's becoming clear the North intends to turn the talks with the United States into a bilateral arms reduction negotiation between two nuclear states, rather than a unilateral process of surrendering its arsenal.

"The 2020 Democrats' campaign logos, in graphic detail",www.nbcnews.com,Ludwig Hurtado,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/2020-democrats-campaign-logos-graphic-detail-n990486,"The 2020 Democrats' campaign logos, in graphic detail Sans serif font is in. Red, white and blue are out. George Wylesol / for NBC News Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 13, 2019, 8:31 AM GMT By Ludwig Hurtado For a diverse and growing field of 2020 Democratic contenders looking for a winning branding strategy, a lot is riding on the humble campaign logo. Whether through color, typeface, slogan or symbol, “Democratic candidates post-2016 are seeing advantages in differentiating themselves from the pack,” said Susan Merriam, a co-founder of the Center for American Politics and Design , a research group focused on the use of graphic design in politics. “Consumers and voters have seen a lot of the same and want something different,"" Merriam said. ""If the Democratic 2020 presidential primary is any example, the more competition there is, the more likely candidates will try and differentiate themselves through design and stand out from one another.” Merriam and graphic designer Michael Bierut, a partner at Pentagram design firm and the creator of Hillary Clinton’s ‘H’ logo in 2016 , shared their insights about the 2020 candidates' campaign logos with NBC News. Effective political branding, Bierut says, is a delicate balance that involves the candidate's personality as well as the design. ""The candidate is more important than logo, and what will happen if it works properly is that people will associate their feelings about the candidate and project it onto the logo,"" he said. What's in a name? Democrats of both sexes and Republican women were more successful last year when they emphasized their first names, Merriam said. In 2020, several presidential candidates are also going the first-name route. Given the potential number of septuagenarians in the race, they might be trying to seem young and relatable, the graphic designers said. “Everyone wants their candidate to feel accessible and approachable,"" Bierut said. Cory Booker 2020 New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker Merriam: ""As red, white, and blue are the typical choices, I don't think Booker was trying to communicate anything in particular by not using other colors. He was probably just trying to look patriotic, like a typical political logo. I think using the first-name emphasis is a more casual, friendly choice rather than 'Booker,' and the color blocks are a cool contemporary look."" Julian Castro 2020 Former Housing Secretary Julián Castro Merriam: ""Between the choice of the brighter blue and breaking the box, the designer clearly chose to put emphasis on the accent of the 'á.' Castro has been the only Latinx candidate to announce their run for president for 2020 thus far, and it makes sense to emphasize a quality connected to his personal narrative and which differentiates him from the field. A small nod to the Spanish language does that in a nice and subtle way."" Bernie Sanders 2020 Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders Merriam: ""I think it’s a case of it’s not broke don’t fix it. Bernie’s logo received positive responses in 2016, and clearly his campaign was fairly successful, so it makes sense he used it for his race for Senate in 2018 and now for 2020."" “The slab serif and first-name emphasis give a homegrown vibe very consistent with Sanders’ populist messaging.” Amy Klobuchar 2020 Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar Bierut: ""Amy’s got the only serif typeface that is anything like delicate. That must be some deliberate choice. Interestingly enough, going against her early reports of being a tough boss, who is a yeller , you see this kinder, gentler, first-name basis, in a nice pretty serif typeface."" Merriam: “Serifs tend to be considered more traditional — in particular, high-contrast serifs [in which the strokes vary from thick to thin]. This typeface is reminiscent of calligraphy and has ornamental traits rooted in typefaces of the Victorian era [and] Gilded Age. Between the font choice, the color being purply blue, and the extended color scheme we’ve seen her campaign use, it seems reasonable to assume the designer was making choices for a more centrist, nonpartisan aesthetic, whether intentionally or subconsciously."" Related Pete Buttigieg 2020 South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (pronounced Boot-a-judge) Beirut: ""People are deliberately deciding to either go with their first name, in some cases because I think they’re trying to be friendly and accessible, in other cases because they’ve got some sort of issue with their last name, which I think Mayor Pete definitely battles with."" Red, white and blue — and green and yellow too Kamala Harris 2020 California Sen. Kamala Harris Harris' logo uses red and yellow, inspired in part by the campaign buttons of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to seek a major party's presidential nomination, a Harris campaign aide told NBC News. Harris, whose father is Jamaican and mother was Indian, became the second African American woman to be elected to the Senate. She announced her presidential bid on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, nearly 47 years after Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Harris said she chose her slogan because “Kamala Harris, for the people” was how the former prosecutor and attorney general of California would introduce herself in court. Merriam: “In the 2018 election, women and people of color used colors other than red, white and blue more often than white men,” including former Georgia state House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams in her gubernatorial campaign. Interesting Tidbit: Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman ever to run for president, launched her campaign 47 years ago. #KamalaHarris chose yellow and red for her campaign logo in a nod to Chisholm's bid for president with its red and yellow campaign buttons. pic.twitter.com/gf53gIl7DE — Trevor Joseph Newton (@TrevJoseph) January 21, 2019 Beirut: ""She’s the one who seems to have maybe picked up on the lesson of ‘Make America Great Again,’ although I think that’s definitely candidate-centric as opposed to the broader one that Trump’s been using all along."" Beto For America 2020 Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke Merriam: ""The black with white lettering clearly is high contrast and bold and made Beto stand out from typical senatorial candidates, away from the red and blue. The font he chose, 'Abolition,' comes from historical typography from whisky bottles, which gives it a craft brewery vibe. Abolition is also seemingly used in Netflix’s logo, so maybe Beto is trying to give off some Netflix and chill vibes."" Elizabeth Warren 2020 Massachussets Sen. Elizabeth Warren Merriam: ""The campaign has named the mint 'liberty green,' which seems relevant if they are referencing the color of the Statue of Liberty, a strong woman and symbolizing liberty. The designer opted for a purply blue, and the 'liberty green' is a departure from the typical Democratic primary blue. The last-name emphasis and all-caps choice is somewhat authoritative."" Kirsten Gillibrand 2020 New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Merriam: ""Sen. Gillibrand has made a clear choice to define herself as the candidate for women, visually by using a bold saturated pink and black contrast. This aligns with her messaging as a candidate that will stand for women — be the first person to call out a senator for sexual harassment, benefit women in the military, and share her personal narrative of being a mom with two teenage sons. In her new logo, 'Gillibrand' fights visually with the larger text size and bolder color of '2020.' The choice of a sans serif typeface is fairly typical and doesn't tell a voter much about the candidate; however, the relationship of the trimmed 'R,' A,' and 'N' is nice, but very subtle."" Marianne Williamson 2020 Marianne Williamson Merriam: ""Williamson’s font for 'Marianne' is fairly nondescript, so the ballet-pink '2020' stands out with the blocky cut-out-like typeface. The role of pink and purple with the first-name emphasis is clearly intended to brand herself as a clear woman candidate."" John Hickenlooper 2020 Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper Bierut: ""The one I think was the most fun to work on is John Hickenlooper’s, just because he’s got that hopelessly long name. It’s not just long, but it sounds long and crazy. A nice, long four-syllable — Jesus, that’s a 12-letter name — is nothing you’d choose for your brand. ""And then he’s got these stripes above it that I think are meant to represent the Rocky Mountains. It looks like somebody said, 'Governor, we’ve got to figure out a way around this, so how about we just use your name as the plains above which the majestic Rockies will rise?' And he took that advice. ""You get a little circle with a finite number of pixels wide [on social media], and fitting a 12-letter word in that is not an easy task. I’d much rather be Amy Klobuchar."" Tulsi Gabbard 2020 Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard Merriam: ""While I am sure the designers intended for the logo to reference a Hawaii sunrise, it definitely looks like a sunset. The colors are similar to the movie poster 'Red Dawn,' as someone has pointed out on Twitter."" Beirut: ""Tulsi’s thing is really weird looking, but it looks like there’s an idea behind it."" Jay Inslee 2020 Washington Gov. Jay Inslee Merriam: ""The designer of this logo seems to be referencing environmentalism with the gradient Earth-ish orb behind his last name. However, there are definitely some type crimes occurring, and it just looks really dated. I am not sure whether they intended for this to come across as retro — it just seems badly designed to me. In contrast, Harris’ logo is a great example of something that intentionally has a retro feel. My fellow co-founder said Inslee’s logo looked like an enterprise software or cybersecurity company from the days of the [Texas Instruments] TI-83 calculator. Frankly, if I was on the campaign I would consider crowdsourcing a new logo because it also must be really difficult to work with, designing around, printing, etc."" A traditional look The logo designs for lesser-known, male candidates ""tend to be rooted in more traditional political logos, using red, white, and blue and stars or stripes,"" Merriam said. Andrew Yang 2020 Andrew Yang Merriam: ""The idea of the italicized logo or slant indicates moving forward, speed … youth maybe? That part is not bad. The red and blue fits the logos of past presidential candidates. However, the stripes in the “Y” awkwardly interact with the 'a,' and the relationship of the title case to 2020 is also not great."" John Delaney 2020 Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney Merriam: ""Like the [former Arkansas Gov. Mike] Huckabee 2016 presidential campaign logo, it is a failed knockoff of the fields in the 'O' of the Obama presidential campaign logos. Is it a reference to the campaign trail? Driving America forward? The highways across America? Infrastructure? It’s vague, to say the least. What it looks like to me is the designer did not just want to use the logotype and wanted to add a little something to bring in the red and lighter blue. They did not do so successfully, in my opinion. This seems more of the level of design we see for a candidate running for the House of Representatives rather than the presidency."" Mike Gravel 2020 Former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel Merriam: ""Mike Gravel’s logo uses a poppy red and navy color scheme with a typeface that appears to be custom and inconsistent. The typeface is not quite a serif or sans serif and has individual characters with rounded corners and some with hard corners. The icon of star and stripes is too small in the 'a.' When the logo is small the icon is minuscule."" Tim Ryan 2020 Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan Merriam: ""Rep. Tim Ryan’s logo uses a sans serif font, red- and blue-blocked color, with tight letter spacing. It is remarkably similar to Cory Booker’s with the color blocking but uses a typeface with less personality than Booker’s."" Eric Swalwell 2020 California Rep. Eric Swalwell Merriam: ""Rep. Eric Swalwell uses a condensed sans serif, classic colors, and stripes reminiscent of the American flag. This logo, while an improvement from his congressional logo, doesn’t tell you too much about the candidate — a missed opportunity."" Wayne Messam 2020 Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam Merriam: ""Mayor Wayne Messam's logo features bold typography, first-name emphasis, classic red and blue colors, and the tagline 'for America' — not dissimilar from Amy Klobuchar's logo or popular TV show 'The West Wing's' 'Bartlet for America.'"" Meanwhile, on the Republican side ... Donald Trump and Mike Pence 2020 President Donald Trump Merriam: ""The stars and '45' that interrupt the rectangle outline feel like an afterthought to bring in a touch of Americana. As prior to 2016 the 'Trump' brand was well known, it's unsurprising that then-candidate Trump chose to build on that brand with emphasis on the last name, with a heavy font drawing lots of focus and attention (not unlike the candidate himself).""

Doing your taxes? Use these tips to get organized,www.nbcnews.com,Vivian Manning-Schaffel,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/doing-your-taxes-use-these-tips-get-organized-ncna993051,"It is said Benjamin Franklin once wrote nothing was certain but death and taxes — and it seems he was right. As we stare down yet another April 15 , many procrastinators (guilty!) find themselves scrambling at the last minute to organize their materials before sitting in front of an accountant , or filing themselves. Plus, with a new tax law in effect , you might be in a position to rethink your deductions, which can change the game in how you prepare. Though the near doubling of the standard deduction means more people will likely opt for the standard deduction, many will still have to go through the trouble of itemizing to see which option offers the greater benefit, says Andrea Coombes , a tax specialist, investing and retirement writer who contributes to NerdWallet .
The exercise of compiling all of your yearly expenses can be overwhelming, and the urge to stick your head in the sand come tax time can be strong and real. But Coombes says an attitude adjustment — and a little organization — can help make the process easier. “One way to think about doing your taxes is as an annual check-up on your finances . You have to delve into your financial situation from a year ago, and that can really help you plan for the future,” says Coombes.
What happened to my refund? 2018 taxes explained March 15, 2019 03:45 Is there anything can we still do this year to prevent having to cram for tax prep and make the whole process a little easier to tackle? Here are six things to consider:
1. Target deductions in advance If you’re considering itemizing your deductions, Coombes advises taking a close look at a blank 1040 and a blank schedule A to determine which expenses are eligible for deduction. “Line entries for several categories of deductions might jog your memory about what your deductible expenses are for the year,” she says.
One way to think about doing your taxes is as an annual check-up on your finances.
Andrea Coombes, tax specialist
2. Adopt a storage system that works for you April Walker, lead manager for tax practice and ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), says the paperwork storage/organization part of tax prep is a highly personal decision — you have to land on a system that works best for you. For some (like Coombes), this entails storing your receipts in a drawer or in a filing cabinet, in one easily accessible location, until you’re ready to tackle them.
Disorganization can be costly come tax time. “You might not be able to find that receipt for your childcare payment, and then you decide not to declare the benefit and you lose out on a valuable tax break,” Coombes says.
To this end, budgeting apps, like Quicken and Mint , have features that allow you to track or capture expenses electronically and on the fly and have tools that flag tax deductible expenses.
However you prepare, just be sure to do your math before submitting your paperwork: If you use a CPA to prepare your taxes, Walker warns they might charge more for having to deal with your receipts.
Related A BETTER Way A BETTER Way What if I can't afford to pay my taxes? 3. Budget your time Allot enough time to review credit card statements, PayPal and debit card statements to see if there are deductible expenses you might have forgotten about. And, if you drive for work, be sure to track your miles, says Coombes.
4. Ask your accountant about more than taxes To most people, meeting with your CPA is all about praying for a refund — or at least the tax you owe is minimal. But, Walker says, keeping the conversation focused on taxes is an overlooked opportunity to address your overall financial well-being. “A CPA is able to give ideas for the rest of your life,” she says. “You’re also going to want to talk about other things, like retirement , or saving for college , or cash flow and budgeting . To make the most of your appointment (and your CPA’s expertise), prepare a list of questions to ask your CPA about ways to improve your financial wellbeing before your appointment.
5. Revisit your withholding Once you’re done with your taxes, Coombes says it’s important to reconsider your withholding tax status and make any adjustments you deem necessary. “Only 16 percent of people changed their withholding as a result of the big new tax law. This can lead to surprises at tax time. My advice is to shoot for a small refund. If you’re getting a big refund, that’s money you could’ve had in your paycheck all year long that could’ve gone into your 401K or to pay down debt ,” says Coombes.

Designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard as terror group could jeopardize U.S. troops,www.nbcnews.com,F. Brinley Bruton,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/designating-iran-s-revolutionary-guard-terror-group-could-jeopardize-u-n992356,"The White House was looking to shake things up when it designated Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization . It worked.
“American terrorists killed in bombing,” read a headline in Iran’s official Fars news agency, referring to an attack in Afghanistan that killed three U.S. servicemen . That came just a day afterthe Trump administration's announcement and represented a marked change in terminology by Tehran.
Iranian lawmakers dressed in military uniforms also chanted ""Death to America"" during an open session of Parliament on Tuesday. And according to the country’s Mehr news agency, Parliament passed an emergency bill requesting that countries that arrest U.S troops should hand them over to Iran to face trial as terrorists.
President Hassan Rouhani declared that the force's popularity would only surge in the wake of the designation, saying its members would be more ""in the hearts of the Iranian nation"" than at any other time in history.
U.S. ups pressure on Iran by targeting top security service April 8, 2019 03:18 The White House’s decision to put the powerful military unit with deep economic resources that answers only to the country's supreme leader in the same category as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group came a year after the Trump administration said it was withdrawing from the landmark Iran nuclear agreement .
Richard Nephew, a former director for Iran at the National Security Council who served as a member of the team who negotiated the 2015 deal, said President Donald Trump's decision to designate the Guard as terrorists would most likely make American operations in the region “much more complicated.”
“If you have terrorists nearby ... what do you do with them?” he wrote in an email. “In the U.S. system, we have authorities that authorize military operations against them. The Iranians know that. Are they going to wait to be hit? Or will they hit first?”
This is not a hypothetical scenario: For almost two decades Iran has expanded its influence in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. In the process, it has had to operate close to American forces — often as adversaries, but sometimes not.
Tehran hails military drill in Persian Gulf featuring Iranian-made drones March 14, 2019 00:51 And the designation raises legal issues, Nephew said.
“What do we do if we capture IRGC officers somehow in Syria or Iraq? Do we turn them loose to the Iranians? They're terrorists!” he wrote. “And, what do the Iranians do if they capture U.S. ‘terrorists’ in the Persian Gulf as they did in January 2016 ?”
NBC News reached out to the Pentagon for comment.
Trump called the designation an “unprecedented step” that “recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances, and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft.”
Those who opposed the Obama-era nuclear pact — both in Washington and the capitals of U.S. allies in the Middle East — allege it gave Iran cover to pursue its ballistic weapons program and deepen its influence in the region. Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have warned for years of Iran’s growing power, and were bitterly disappointed when Obama negotiated it.
On the eve of pivotal elections in Israel , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday personally thanked Trump for the designation, as did Saudi Arabia.
Israel ramps up defenses amid increasing tension with Iran March 24, 2019 02:00 But this week's announcement makes it less likely that Iran will accede to American demands and stop its pernicious activity in the region, according to Ilan Goldenberg, Middle East security director at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington.
“The bottom line is the agreement was working, it was containing Iran’s nuclear program and we had total international support and unity around this issue,” he said.
With the nuclear deal axed, that mechanism for the U.S. to address Iran’s behavior is no longer available.
“We’ve shattered all trust,” Goldenberg said. “You could have had a negotiation on ballistic missiles. You could have had a negotiation on regional behavior. You could have had negotiations on future additional nuclear agreements.”
Sanctions against the Guard could also complicate any attempt by a future president to try to return the United States to the Iran deal, both advocates and critics of the move said.
“This is part of a strategy by Iran hawks to layer on sanctions to make it more difficult for Democrats,"" a Republican congressional aide told NBC News when the designation was announced.
Several Democratic presidential candidates have said they favored having the United States re-enter the agreement, and the Democratic National Committee has said it supports a return to the deal.

House Democrats give IRS until April 23 to hand over Trump's tax returns,www.nbcnews.com,Kalhan Rosenblatt,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/house-democrats-give-irs-until-april-23-hand-over-trump-n994161,"House Democrats have given the Internal Revenue Service a new deadline to hand over President Donald Trump's tax returns days after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department would miss the original deadline of April 10. In a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig sent Saturday by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., Democrats gave a second and final deadline of April 23 for six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. The lawmakers could go to court to seek the returns if the IRS does not turn them over.
""To date, the IRS has failed to provide the requested return and return information despite an unambiguous legal obligation to do so ... Please know that, if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request,"" Neal wrote in the letter.
The letter also states that there is ""no valid basis to question the legitimacy of the Committee’s legislative purpose,"" citing Supreme Court instructions that Congress' power to investigate is ""broad.""
""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took issue with Neal's characterization of the dispute.
""These are complicated legal issues and I think it is more important to the American taxpayers that we get this right than we hit an arbitrary deadline,"" Mnuchin told reporters, according to the Associated Press. ""I would just emphasize this is a decision that has enormous precedence in terms of potentially weaponizing the IRS.""
Mnuchin said that Treasury Department lawyers have been working ""diligently"" to research the issues involved and have been in contact with Justice Department attorneys. He said he thought Neal was just picking arbitrary deadline and refused to speculate how the administration would proceed if the issue goes to court.

Cummings, D-Md., notified his committee on Friday that he would be subpoenaing Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, for the president's financial statements. The subpoena is another avenue Democrats are pursuing to obtain Trump's financial information.
In the memo, Cummings said he intended to issue the subpoena, which request documents between 2011 and 2018, on Monday.
The Ways and Means Committee first sent a formal request to the Treasury Department for Trump's tax returns on April 3, giving the department a deadline of April 10 to produce the documents.
“I today submitted to IRS Commissioner Rettig my request for six years of the president’s personal tax returns as well as the returns for some of his business entities. We have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal, and oversight rights,” Neal said in a statement.
But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed back on the request, saying his department would be unable to meet the deadline.
In a letter to Neal, Mnuchin said the Treasury was continuing to review Democrats' request in light of ""serious issues"" about whether the request is proper.
""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power,"" Mnuchin wrote, saying he was consulting with the Justice Department about the legality and constitutionality of Neal's request.
Related Politics Mnuchin says Treasury won't meet Democrats' deadline for Trump's taxes Mnuchin said that ""for the same reasons,"" he intended to supervise the department's review personally.
Trump's tax returns have been a contentious subject since he was a candidate for president. He has claimed that he cannot release his returns because he is under audit by the IRS.
However, in congressional testimony in February, Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen said he'd seen no proof that any audit was under way . And tax experts have said that even if he is under audit, there's nothing to stop Trump from releasing his returns .

Cal Newport: Addicted to your phone? How a 30-day digital detox can help break the screen time cycle,www.nbcnews.com,Cal Newport,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/addicted-your-phone-how-30-day-digital-detox-can-help-ncna994171,"For many, 2018 was a year of mounting frustrations with personal technology. Negative stories piled up about the varying abuses and misdirection of social media services — privacy violations , censorship, knee-jerk outrage — while at the same time, Apple rolled out its Screen Time feature , revealing to millions of iPhone users the unflattering reality of how many hours they actually spend each week staring at a little glowing rectangle. Given these trends, it makes sense to make 2019 the year we reform our digital lives. The question, however, is how to succeed with this goal. My suggestion for decluttering your digital existence is to learn from the decluttering experts. As Marie Kondo teaches , the solution to an over-stuffed house is not to resolve to be cleaner or to buy smarter organizers. You must instead start from scratch: Clean out the entire closest and then add back in only things that “spark joy.”
To simply resolve to look at your screen less or implement hacks such as turning off notifications isn’t enough.
My research indicates that a broadly similar approach is what works best for your digital clutter as well. To simply resolve to look at your screen less or implement hacks such as turning off notifications — the digital equivalent of trying to be cleaner or buying smarter organizers — isn’t enough. The technological and cultural forces pulling your attention back to your screen are too powerful for small tweaks to aggregate into large lifestyle changes. What does seem to work is to clean out your metaphorical closet: Step away from all the optional apps and services that you’ve haphazardly downloaded in recent years, and then add back only the tools that are really important to living a meaningful life.
The more detailed process I propose is called the digital declutter. It asks that you begin by taking a 30-day break from optional digital technologies in your personal life. These include any apps, services, or web sites that aren’t necessary for your work or play a vital role in your daily routine. For most people, these optional technologies include social media, online news and entertainment sites, games and streaming videos.
It's time to delete all of your social media apps Feb. 26, 2019 03:03 For technologies that play both a vital and a distracting role, specify rules to separate the former role from the latter. For example, if your job requires you to occasionally post on your company’s social media account, this shouldn’t be an excuse for unrestricted social media browsing on your phone. Instead, put aside some set times on your calendar to complete your professional social media work from your office computer, and then otherwise avoid these services during the declutter period.
There are two motivations for taking a 30-day break. The first is to detox from the compulsive urge to tap a screen at the slightest hint of boredom. It’s difficult to think clearly about your digital life while you still feel an addictive pull to its algorithmically optimized charms.
The alluring noise emanating from our screens provides an easy distraction from the bigger questions about what really matters.
The second purpose to this long duration, however, is arguably more important: to get back in touch with what you actually value. The alluring noise emanating from our screens provides an easy distraction from the bigger questions about what really matters; what we want to do with limited time here on earth. This month-long reprieve provides the space needed to revisit these questions, and through both self-reflection and experimentation, form some tentative answers.
At the end of the digital declutter, you must resist the urge to simply return to the same digital life you fled a month earlier. Like a Kondo aficionado carefully deciding what shoes to put back in the closet, only add back digital tools that significantly support one of these values you recently identified during your self reflection. And when you do add back such a tool, don’t allow its use to be unrestricted — instead place some careful rules about how and when you use it to maximize the deep benefits it provides while minimizing its costs.
""Digital Minimalism,"" by Cal Newport Penguin Random House If Facebook groups are key for keeping up with a community group that’s really important to you, for example, don’t allow this reality to justify mindless Facebook browsing during every moment of boredom. You might instead remove the Facebook app from your phone and enforce a simple schedule in which you log on to the site on your desktop computer on Sunday nights to review the latest announcements from the group. Similarly, I’ve heard from multiple declutter veterans who tamed a Netflix binge-watching addiction with a simple rule: They never stream shows alone. This trick maintains the relationship-building value of movie night, while avoiding using reruns of “The Office” as a mindless escape from issues that would benefit from direct confrontation.
A little over a year ago, I asked my readers if anyone would be willing to attempt this digital declutter and then send me some thoughts about the experience. I thought a couple dozen brave souls might take on the challenge. In the end, over 1,600 signed up. In addition to emphasizing the hunger so many now feel toward rethinking their relationships with their screens, I learned an important lesson from their experiences: Marie Kondo is on to something. If you want to rediscover joy in your cluttered digital life, half measures are unlikely to work. Gather the courage to start from scratch. Clear out all the junk that has haphazardly piled up on your devices, get back in touch with what you actually want to do with your time, and then put these tools to work making your life more joyful instead of allowing them nudge you into a joyless, distracted, screen-addled existence.

Does marijuana cause lung cancer? Doctors call for more research,www.nbcnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/does-marijuana-cause-lung-cancer-doctors-call-more-research-n993941,"Early in his career operating on lung cancer patients, Dr. Raja Flores knew most were cigarette smokers. But through the years, Flores, a thoracic surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, noticed a startling pattern: Some of his patients had never smoked a tobacco cigarette. They smoked a different drug: marijuana . And they had developed a much more aggressive form of lung cancer. Initially, Flores didn’t consider there could be a connection between marijuana and lung cancer. The research linking pot smoking with cancer was scant and largely inconclusive. But as the numbers grew, Flores wondered if he was seeing some kind of grim new trend.
“I said to myself, ‘wait a minute, here’s another person in his 40s who never touched a cigarette and the cancer is all over the place,” Flores told NBC News. “It’s so bad I can’t even operate.’”
Flores first raised his concerns about harms from smoking marijuana in SurvivorNet , an online community for cancer patients and experts. He acknowledges there isn’t scientific proof that smoking cannabis causes lung cancer. But he worries that the combination of widespread legalization and marketing of marijuana’s potential health benefits are contributing to the belief that cannabis is an entirely benign drug. In fact, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults published last summer found that nearly a third thought that smoking or vaping weed could protect a person’s health.
Many Americans held a similar view of tobacco before evidence accumulated showing that cigarette smoking could cause lung cancer, said pulmonologist Dr. Panagis Galiatsatos, a critical care instructor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and director of the tobacco treatment clinic at Johns Hopkins Medicine.
Until the number of cigarette-related lung cancer cases accumulated to a level that no one could ignore, there were even respected scientists who dismissed warnings about the potential dangers associated with smoking tobacco, Galiatsatos said.
Does marijuana use cause lung cancer? Most research says no, but that doesn’t mean that smoking joints long-term comes without consequences.
A 2016 review monitoring health concerns related to marijuana use found strong evidence for an association between daily or near-daily marijuana use and chronic bronchitis, an inflammation of the airways of the lung that causes cough, wheezing and shortness of breath.
“There are respiratory effects to using smoked marijuana for long periods of time,” said Dr. Russell Bowler, director of the COPD clinic at National Jewish Health in Denver. He's a member of the the Retail Marijuana Public Health Advisory Committee for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, which commissioned the study.
Related Health Even a little marijuana may change teen brain, study finds Daily or near-daily marijuana use may be associated with bullous lung disease, a condition where air pockets are formed within the lung disrupting its function, and pneumothorax, a condition that commonly leads to collapsed lungs in young people, Bowler's research found.
Bowler said there needs to be more research into smoking marijuana and the development of lung cancer.
“There’s very little published [data] on secondhand exposure and insufficient data to make conclusions about its health effects,” Bowler told NBC News.
One reason for the lack of data: Studies on marijuana cannot be performed in the U.S. because, on the federal level, the drug remains in the same class as heroin and LSD, a Schedule I drug. That means marijuana is designated as having “a high potential for abuse” and “no currently accepted medical use.”
However, public health advocates of U.S. cannabis research believe marijuana laws should have no bearing on a scientist’s ability to study the drug’s consequences on a population.
Don't smoke anything Researchers comparing the smoke of cannabis and tobacco say they may be similar in how they damage the lungs.
“The smoke of marijuana contains many of the same volatile chemicals found in tobacco smoke that are injurious to lung tissue,” pulmonologist Dr. Donald Tashkin, emeritus professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, told NBC News.
“As a pulmonologist, I advise all my patients not to smoke anything,” Tashkin said.
On the surface, pot smokers would seem to be at a lower risk than cigarette smokers because they light up fewer times a day. But researchers have found that far more carcinogens, like tar, end up in the lungs when a joint is smoked than a cigarette.
This occurs because marijuana is smoked differently than a normal cigarette. Traditional vaping or joint smoking usually involves inhaling the marijuana smoke deeply into the lungs and holding it in, which gives the toxins more contact with the lungs. Also, many marijuana users smoke a joint all the way to the end.
Tar, the sticky stuff left after burning, is concentrated at the end of a joint and contains high levels of harmful substances that can injure lung cells.
Some research has shown that smoking one joint is comparable to smoking anywhere from four to 20 cigarettes. These findings are one reason why Tashkin expected to find a link between smoking pot and developing lung cancer.
“Regular smoking of marijuana by itself causes visible and microscopic injury to the large airways that is consistently associated with an increased likelihood of symptoms of chronic bronchitis that subside after cessation of use,” Tashkin wrote in a 2013 study on the effects of habitual marijuana use on the lungs.
Related Health How to stop teen vaping? Make e-cigarettes harder to get He also found that pre-cancerous alterations developed in the lungs, but it often did not lead to cancer.
“In human studies of long-term marijuana users, we found widespread pre-cancerous changes on the lungs,” Tashkin said. “That doesn’t mean that if you have these changes you will develop lung cancer. But if it’s there you are at an increased risk of doing so.”
Tashkin, who has co-authored numerous studies on the impact of marijuana on the lungs over the past 30 years, has even re-analyzed his own data. He only found an increased risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers in a small number of patients. The number was so small that Tashkin didn’t believe it could be used as firm evidence to support the conclusion that pot could cause cancer.
Marijuana more potent than ever In the U.S. marijuana is legal by a doctor’s order in 33 states and recreationally in 11 states plus the District of Columbia .
Marijuana, unlike tobacco, does not have any controls on its strength or quality so people don’t use the same amount in one dose. Also, those who use medical marijuana for non-specific conditions such as pain treatment , may vary in the amount of drug they need to provide relief. These factors make it hard for researchers to set standards to measure the drug’s effects.
More potent forms of marijuana, sometimes called skunk marijuana, may be one reason people don't develop lung cancer, despite ingesting the same cancer-causing agents as combustible cigarettes, Browler explains.
“Now in Colorado people get a product that routinely has 30 percent THC. That means people are smoking a more potent product and may be smoking fewer times per day to receive the same effect,” said Browler. “Some cigarette smokers smoke 1-3 packs a day, that’s up to 60 cigarettes. You wouldn’t be alive if you were smoking 60 joints a day at 30 times the amount of THC.”
Related Health Edible marijuana worries doctors after man suffers heart attack Smoking may still be the most popular form of using marijuana, but using edibles has grown in popularity and that doesn’t affect the lungs, he added.
One thing experts agree on is that more research is needed.
In the early 50s, some prominent scientists, questioned the idea that smoking could cause lung cancer, but it wasn’t until there were more than 30 million cigarette smokers in the U.S. that the danger to the lungs started to become clear, Galiatsatos said. [An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed this statement to Flores.]
“If we turn our back on this now, we may have a big disaster later on,” Flores said.

The test makes the immense Stratolaunch the largest airplane in the world to fly, with a wingspan measuring 385 feet — wider than a football field is long. With two fuselages and six Boeing 747 engines. Stratolaunch is built to launch rockets from the air.
Stratolaunch is an “air launch” system, meaning that the aircraft will carry rockets up to about 35,000 feet and then drop the rocket. One of the advantages of such a system, touted by Stratolaunch as well as Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit , is that flying in and out of a traditional runway gives greater flexibility and, eventually, will allow for quick turnaround between launches.
Stratolaunch, a giant six-engine aircraft with the world's longest wingspan , makes its historic first flight from the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California on April 13, 2019. Matt Hartman / AP The company has had various partnerships, as well as internal plans, for the rockets that Stratolaunch will carry. SpaceX was one of the company’s earliest partners but Stratolaunch later switched to a contract with Northrop Grumman -owned Orbital ATK to fly the Pegeasus XL rocket. Stratolaunch’s plan to develop its own fleet of rockets was scrapped in January.
Related Science World's biggest plane, Stratolaunch, marks another key milestone Stratolaunch Systems is owned by Vulcan, which manages the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The billionaire entrepreneur founded Stratolaunch in 2011, in partnership with specialty aircraft builder Scaled Composites. Allen died in October , following complications of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Allen’s passing is cited as one of the main reasons for the shift in Stratolaunch’s plans at the beginning of this year. When the company announced in January that it was ending development of its own rocket engines and vehicles, Stratolaunch reportedly laid off more than 50 of its 80 employees.

"Booker kicks off campaign in hometown of Newark, promises to stay above the fray",www.nbcnews.com,Leigh Ann Caldwell,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/booker-kicks-campaign-hometown-newark-promises-stay-above-fray-n994191,"NEWARK, N.J. — Sen. Cory Booker returned to his hometown of Newark Saturday for what he billed as the official launch of his presidential campaign, which he previously announced via video on Feb. 1. Though it's comparatively early in the race, Booker has met with mediocre polling and fundraising numbers while facing a crowded Democratic field.
The former two-term mayor of Newark, where he began his political career in the city council, kicked off a two-week national tour centered around ""Justice for All."" Booker said that his commitment to low-income Americans is evident because he chooses to live near downtown Newark, home to many who fit that description.
His speech Saturday focused on Democratic ideals of health care for all, LGBTQ rights, economic equality and a pathway to citizenship for immigrants. But he also challenged the president's divisive rhetoric, vowing to stay above it.
Sen. Cory Booker kicks off presidential campaign April 13, 2019 02:03 ""The president wants a race to the gutter and to fight us in the gutter. But to win, we have to fight from higher ground in order to bring this country to higher ground,"" Booker said to a crowd numbering 4,100 people according to the Booker campaign, which cited an assessment by the chief of security.
But Booker, who is a moderate candidate compared to some of the Democratic primary challengers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, also challenged the progressive left, dismissing purity tests.
""Because the people on my block, the people gathered here and folks all across the country can't wait. They can't afford a politics of division that sacrifices progress for purity,"" Booker said. ""They can't afford to allow this election to become just an exercise in political posturing or a box checking competition that is completely divorced from the realities of so many people who are struggling and hurting.""
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker salutes the crowd during a hometown kickoff for his national presidential campaign tour at Military Park in downtown Newark on April 13, 2019. Andres Kudacki / AP ""And I know and you know that we don't have the privilege to wait for what fits into someone else's narrow view of what it means to be a progressive,"" Booker said.
Meanwhile, Booker left a lot of room for interpretation on an issue that is expected to be a defining one in 2020: health care. He said he supports an incremental approach to Medicare for All, mentioned the words ""public option"" and embraced the Affordable Care Act — positions that are all-encompassing.
The senator was introduced by his mother, Carolyn Booker. Popular Newark mayor Ras Baraka and fellow New Jersey Sen. Bob Melendez also made introductory speeches. Booker's next stop is Iowa.

Sara Bushland still missing from Wisconsin after stepping off school bus 23 years ago - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/cold-case-spotlight/sara-bushland-still-missing-wisconsin-after-stepping-school-bus-23-n993896,"Apr 12 2019, 12:43 pm ET Sara Bushland still missing from Wisconsin after stepping off school bus 23 years ago by Julia Curley Comment Print
Sara Bushland was a social butterfly, according to her sister Lesley Small. “She could fit into any group,” Lesley told Dateline. “She could bounce around from one clique to another and she always fit right in.”
Just 18 months apart in age, sisters Sara and Lesley were also close friends as they grew up in Colorado with their father. They got into trouble together, too, according to Lesley; in December of 1994, Sara got caught shoplifting. Rather than face her father’s disappointment, 13-year-old Sara fled to their mother Marie Lambert’s house in Spooner, Wisconsin, Lesley said. Sara Bushland
Sara moved into the house with her mother, her stepfather Jim and his sons, Dean and David. According to Lesley, things didn’t get any easier for her younger sister. Lesley said the Lambert home wasn’t always happy, but Sara did develop a group of friends and started dating Travis Lane, a local man who was five years older than she was. Through the ups and downs, Lesley said she and Sara always stayed in touch.
“She always took care of everybody and didn’t bring much attention to herself,” Lesley told Dateline. “She was very good at hiding her feelings.” advertisement
But on April 3, 1996, Sara’s life changed course.
The day began like any other Wednesday for the high school sophomore. According to sister Lesley, early that morning, one of Sara’s stepbrothers gave her a ride to a friend’s house in Spooner. Sara and her friend then walked to Spooner High School in time for the morning bell.
Around noon, Sara’s boyfriend Travis picked her up from school and the pair spent Sara’s lunch break together. Sara then returned to school and at the end of the day, she boarded her bus and headed home.
Around 4:00 p.m., four students saw Sara get off the bus at her usual stop. According to Washburn County Sheriff Dennis Stuart, witnesses said Sara then started walking up her family’s long driveway.
According to law enforcement and Sara’s family, she never made it to the house. Somewhere along the gravel driveway, Sara disappeared.
According to phone records, at 4:37 p.m. that spring day, Sara’s stepbrother David called his father to tell him that Sara hadn’t come home from school. Both Sara’s mother and stepfather were out of town that day and hadn’t been planning on coming home until the following day. But when Sara’s mother Marie learned that Sara hadn’t returned from school, she hopped in her car and headed to Spooner.
After a night of phone calls to Sara’s friends and a visit to her boyfriend Travis’s apartment nearby, Marie reported her daughter missing on April 4. But in the days and weeks that followed Sara’s disappearance, Marie’s initial urgency waned.
“My mom would basically tell me that I didn’t need to worry,” Lesley, who was 17 at the time, told Dateline. “This wasn’t a big event. And I’ve since been told that she was reported without a sense of urgency. I don’t understand it. No matter how your child disappeared, it should always be urgent. But at 17 years old, I just listened.” advertisement
Lesley also told Dateline that despite her mother reporting Sara missing, investigators initially did not search for the teenager. The Washburn County Sheriff’s Department treated Sara’s disappearance as a runaway case. According to Sheriff Stuart, law enforcement conducted the first of several searches at the Lambert property in July of 1999 – more than three years after Sara disappeared. He said investigators also combed through a trash dump on the property in 1999 and dragged nearby Spring Lake in August of 2000. They found nothing of significance.
Sheriff Stuart, who assumed his position in early 2019, told Dateline he can’t explain why investigators lagged in their search for Sara. The original investigators have since retired, he added.
In May of 2013, a group of more than 70 officials, made up of Washburn County officers and Wisconsin’s Division of Criminal Investigation , searched the Lambert property once more. Again, they found nothing.
Sara’s stepfather Jim died in June of 2017. Just one week later, investigators executed a search warrant on the Lambert’s property for a fourth time. Again, nothing of significance was found.
“The case has changed hands so many times. And each new detective assumes that the last group took care of it and looked into all the evidence,” Sara’s sister Lesley told Dateline. “It’s awful. At 17 years old, I believed law enforcement was doing everything it was supposed to be doing. It affects me every single day.”
Sheriff Stuart says investigators won’t give up on the fight to find Sara.
“The Sara Bushland case is still an ongoing investigation. We constantly get leads and we are doing follow-up with it. The case has never been closed,” Sheriff Stuart told Dateline. He would not describe the nature of the leads his office has received.
Lesley’s only aim is to bring her sister home. “I will never give up hope that she’s still out there; there’s no evidence to say otherwise. I wouldn’t look poorly on her had she left,” Lesley said. “I won’t give up. I’ll continue to help find answers for Sara.”
Sara Bushland would be 38 years old today. At the time of her disappearance, Sara was 5’0” and weighed 104 lbs., with blonde hair and a mole above her upper lip. If you have any information on Sara’s case, please contact the Washburn County Sheriff's Office 715-468-4700. Julia Curley"

Jackson, announced Saturday that it will begin accepting transgender men as students in fall 2020. College officials said in a statement that the new policy, approved by trustees, would not include ""individuals who identify as women regardless of the sex assigned to them at birth."" Students who transition to female during their time at the Atlanta school will not be eligible to graduate but can appeal to Morehouse's president, officials said. ""I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today’s environment is important,” Morehouse College President David Thomas told the Associated Press. ""For 152 years, the world has, in some way, seen Morehouse as the West Point of black male development."" Morehouse is the sole historically black college to admit only men. Neighboring Spelman College, which educates African American women, adopted a similar admissions policy in 2017, leading to its first transgender woman graduate last year. The Morehouse policy was developed over 15 months. ""In a rapidly changing world that includes a better understanding of gender identity, we’re proud to expand our admissions policy to consider trans men who want to be part of an institution that has produced some of the greatest leaders in social justice, politics, business, and the arts for more than 150 years,” Terrance Dixon, the school's enrollment vice president, said in the statement.

Weintraub said. April 13, 2019 01:27 Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 14, 2019, 12:16 AM GMT By Phil Helsel A Pennsylvania officer who shot and wounded an inmate because he apparently thought he was using his Taser instead of his gun will not be criminally charged, the prosecutor said. Bucks County District Attorney Matthew D. Weintraub said in a letter to New Hope Police Chief Michael Cummings that the March 3 shooting ""was neither justified, nor criminal, but was excused,"" according to a statement released Friday. Weintraub said the officer had an “honest but mistaken” belief he was deploying his Taser when he shot the man. The officer shot Brian Riling, who had been arrested on intimidation, assault and other charges, in a holding cell in the borough of New Hope. Riling survived but spent several days in critical condition, the district attorney said. Riling had entered the holding cell and removed his belt as instructed, and what appeared to be a bag of drugs fell to the ground, Weintraub said in the statement. Riling stepped on the bag, there was a struggle, and the officer who shot him entered the cell to help the officer wrestling with him. The officer who shot Riling yelled, ""Taser!"" before firing what was a firearm, the district attorney's office said. Video released by the DA's office shows the officer appear to shoot Riling, who shouts and falls to the floor as the two officers step back. In the video, Riling appears to say, ""Was that a gun?” and ""What are doing? You shot me with a gun? What the f--- are you doing?"" He also talks about his kids and says he doesn't want to die. Weintraub said the officer who shot Riling wore his Taser on his right side, in front of his firearm, which is a violation of department policy that says officers should carry their Tasers on their non-dominant-hand side. ""This violation of policy, however, does not constitute a violation of law,"" he said. The use of a gun by a police officer “must be an officer’s last resort ... and was not justified in this case,” the statement from Weintraub’s office said. But ""because the officer believed he was deploying his Taser and not wielding his service firearm, he did not possess the criminal mental state required to be guilty of a crime under state law."" An email from NBC News to the office of an attorney listed in court documents as representing Riling was not immediately returned on Saturday afternoon. The Bucks County Courier Times newspaper quoted the attorney, Richard Fink, saying earlier this week that although Riling had been released from the hospital, he was still experiencing medical problems related to the shooting. The officer was placed on administrative leave and retired from the police department on April 10, the district attorney's office said. The police department did not respond to a request for comment. New Hope Borough is a community of around 2,500 in Bucks County, around 30 miles northeast of downtown Philadelphia. Phil Helsel"

Large bird attacks and kills its fallen owner in Florida,www.nbcnews.com,,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/large-bird-attacks-kills-its-fallen-owner-florida-n994236,"Large bird attacks and kills its fallen owner in Florida NBC News 1 day ago Associated Press © Wilson Ring An endangered cassowary roams in the Daintree National Forest, Australia on June 30, 2015. ALACHUA, Fla. (AP) — A large, flightless bird native to Australia and New Guinea attacked and killed its owner when the man fell on his property in Florida, authorities said Saturday.
The Alachua County Fire Rescue Department told the Gainesville Sun that a cassowary killed the man Friday on the property near Gainesville, likely using its long claws. The victim, whose name was not released, was apparently breeding the birds, state wildlife officials said.
""It looks like it was accidental. My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,"" Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor told the newspaper.
Cassowaries are similar to emus and stand up to 6 feet tall and weigh up to 130 pounds, with black body feathers and bright blue heads and necks.
The San Diego Zoo's website calls cassowaries the world's most dangerous bird with a four-inch, dagger-like claw on each foot.
""The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick. Powerful legs help the cassowary run up to 31 miles per hour (50 kph) through the dense forest underbrush,"" the website says.
Cassowaries are not raised for food in the U.S., but are sought after by collectors of exotic birds.
To obtain the mandatory permit, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requires cassowary owners to have ""substantial experience"" and meet specific cage requirements, spokeswoman Karen Parker told the newspaper.
Wildlife officials did not answer phone calls late Saturday from The Associated Press and it could not be learned what happened to the bird.
