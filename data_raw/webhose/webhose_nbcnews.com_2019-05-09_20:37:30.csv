By Phil Helsel A suspect is in custody in connection with fires at three historically black churches in Louisiana, a federal prosecutor confirmed Wednesday night. The suspect’s name was not released. U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana David C. Joseph said in a statement that: “A suspect has been identified in connection with the three church burnings in Opelousas, Louisiana, and is in state custody.” The federal prosecutor did not name the churches in the brief statement, but three historically African American churches have burned in St. Landry Parish, where Opelousas is located, since late March. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office, ATF, and FBI are working with state and local law enforcement and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the victims and those St. Landry Parish residents affected by these despicable acts,” Joseph said. The prosecutor’s statement does not indicate a suspected motive. ABC station KATC of Lafayette first reported that a suspect was in custody, citing law enforcement sources. There have been no injuries in the blazes, which were reported at the St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26; the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2; and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 4, officials have said. Port Barre, where St. Mary Baptist Church was, is around 11 miles east of Opelousas. The churches were empty at the time of the fires, officials said, and each suffered considerable damage, forcing worshippers to hold Sunday services at other locations. A fourth fire last weekend at a church with a predominantly white congregation in another parish 200 miles away doesn’t appear to be connected, authorities have said. A news conference is expected in St. Landry Parish on Thursday morning, in which Gov. John Bel Edwards, the state fire marshal, and other federal and state law enforcement officials are expected to attend, and provide an update “on the fires that burned three historically African-American churches in St. Landry Parish over the span of 10 days,” Edwards’ office said in a statement. About 200 people, including from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, had been examining the latest cases in Louisiana to help determine whether the fires were intentionally set and may have been motivated by racism or extremism. After the third fire, State Fire Marshal Butch Browning told reporters that investigators had identified “suspicious elements” in each case and “believe that crimes have occurred.” The president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Derrick Johnson, said in a statement earlier this week that “the spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country.” Phil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.

A search team discovered two sets of footprints in Cucamonga Canyon, south of Mount Baldy, and followed them in the San Gabriel Mountains northeast of Los Angeles, the San Bernadino County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.
A helicopter team searching over the area then spotted two people who the crew believed could be missing hikers Gabrielle Wallace, 31, of Rancho Cucamonga, and Eric Desplinter, 33, of Chino Hills. Their identities were later confirmed.
The pair went missing Saturday while hiking in the snowy mountains. They vanished as they made their way toward the 8,860-foot Cucamonga Peak near Mount Baldy.
Eric Desplinter and Gabrielle Wallace vanished on Saturday. San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department / AP Desplinter was described as an experienced hiker, and the two were said to be carrying proper equipment for the icy conditions.
The San Bernadino Sheriff’s Department noted that search teams covered more than 30 square miles looking for the pair and that agencies from across the region aided in the search.
""Volunteers are a real blessing to our agencies, providing thousands of hours giving back to make our communities better and stronger,"" Sheriff John McMahon said in a statement. ""This is a perfect example of their commitment.""

Job-related falls should be easy to prevent. But workers keep dying anyway.,www.nbcnews.com,"Eli Wolfe, Fair Warning",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/job-related-falls-should-be-easy-prevent-workers-keep-dying-n993216,"U.S. news Job-related falls should be easy to prevent. But workers keep dying anyway. Nearly 900 workers fell to their death in 2017 — the most since the U.S. started tracking such accidents nearly three decades ago. Deaths from falls accounted for more than 17 percent of all job-related fatalities in 2017. Charles Evans Jr. / Fair Warning Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 8:29 AM GMT By Eli Wolfe, Fair Warning This story was produced by FairWarning , a nonprofit news organization based in Southern California that focuses on public health, consumer and environmental issues. Last August, Higinio Romero was working on the roof of a condo in South Florida when he slipped and fell two stories, landing on rocks below. Emergency workers found him unconscious and bleeding from his ears. Romero — a father of two children, 4 months old and 10 years old — died about an hour later. According to a sheriff’s report, he had unclipped his safety harness shortly before the fall. Federal safety rules aim to prevent workers from falling to their deaths, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) routinely investigates and penalizes negligent employers. OSHA recently cited Romero’s employer, the Tarheel Corporation, for three serious violations of fall-protection rules and sought $32,000 in penalties. An attorney for Tarheel said the company is contesting the OSHA violations. Yet the problem has been getting worse. The most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that 887 workers died in falls in 2017 — the most since the agency started tracking job-related fatalities nearly three decades ago. Those deaths from falls accounted for more than 17 percent of all job-related fatalities that year, also a record. In construction, the rate was even higher — almost 40 percent . Preventing workers from falling off roofs, scaffolds, ladders and other elevated surfaces should be simple. Public information about fall hazards is widely available, and so is equipment and training. Safety regulations are effective when followed. Yet the deaths continue to mount. Last Saturday, a stagehand at a concert venue in California died after falling off a roof. Days before, a construction worker plunged 180 feet to his death in Kansas City, Missouri. In mid-March, a New Jersey worker was killed in a fall at a construction site. “It’s the No. 1 killer,” said Scott Earnest, deputy director of construction safety and health at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a federal research agency focused on worker health and safety. Experts say the construction boom following the recession is a possible factor behind the rising death toll because a worker shortage in the industry has attracted more inexperienced workers to the labor force. NIOSH and OSHA have tried to attack this problem through an aggressive public awareness campaign. Since 2012, the federal agencies and a network of industry trade groups have encouraged companies to participate in job site “ stand-down ” events, where employees can receive fall-safety training beyond what is already required by law. In 2018, nearly 1 million workers received this training. But safety experts are still concerned that life-saving information isn’t reaching smaller companies, especially in construction. From 2011 to 2015, less than one-third of construction workers were employed by firms with 10 or fewer employees. But this group accounted for over 60 percent of fall deaths in construction, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training, a nonprofit labor organization that participates in the fall-prevention campaign. Equally troubling, the number of fatalities in residential construction, where many small companies operate, has been increasing over the last few years: From 2011 to 2015, fatal falls more than doubled in residential construction, according to the construction research center. “Contractors with very few employees don’t have sophisticated safety and health programs,” said Chris Cain, the center’s executive director. OSHA standards for fall protection vary by industry. In construction, employees must use safety equipment if they’re working 6 feet or more above either the ground or a lower floor. One option is a lifeline that tethers the worker to the structure. In most cases of injuries and deaths, such safety measures were not in use. Researchers say that Latino workers are more likely than white workers to die in falls. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2017 falls caused nearly 26 percent of job-related deaths of Latinos, compared to about 16 percent of white fatalities. Among foreign-born Latinos, falls were responsible for nearly one in three workplace deaths. The leading cause of workplace deaths is transportation incidents. “Hispanic workers perform some of the most dangerous jobs in the industry,” said Luz Marin, an assistant professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania who specializes in work safety. Fear of immigration authorities, as well as the language barrier, can compound the risk, making some workers less likely to report dangerous conditions. “Most of the time, they don’t know how to navigate through OSHA … or how to file a complaint,” Marin said. Fall-related violations that could endanger workers are so common that the average person can likely spot one by just walking around their neighborhood, said Peter Dooley, a health and safety project consultant for the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health based in Arizona. “You can see construction workers on roofs who are one step away from being paraplegic,” Dooley said. Four of OSHA’s 10 most frequently cited violations address issues related to fall hazards, but the enforcement corps of 2,100 inspectors for OSHA and its state counterparts is minuscule compared to the 8 million job sites they are responsible for. And even when the agency finds violations, it often struggles to hold employers accountable or correct their behavior, worker safety advocates say. In July 2016, OSHA cited Rich Tiller, owner of a Nebraska construction firm, for a “willful” violation involving fall hazards at one of his job sites. Willful violations are the most egregious kind. In a press release, the agency said Tiller had a “callous attitude” toward worker safety, and already owed over $250,000 in unpaid penalties for a string of prior violations. “OSHA is holding Rich Tiller accountable for his repeated pattern of willfully exposing workers to fall hazards on job sites,” OSHA’s Omaha area director, Jeff Funke, said in the release, announcing an additional $70,000 fine. Yet in 2017, OSHA officials cited Tiller again for fall hazards and other violations. The 2016 case dragged on for another two-and-a-half years. When it finally closed in February, Tiller ended up paying just $4,000 of the $70,000 penalty. The agency also downgraded the “willful” violation to “serious.” A Labor Department spokesman said he couldn’t comment on why Tiller’s violation was reduced because OSHA settlement conferences are confidential. It is typical for OSHA to reduce a fine after an employer agrees to invest in safety improvements. Tiller did not respond to a request for comment. The way some employers escape with a slap on the wrist is disheartening to people like Mary Vivenzi, whose partner, Kevin Noah, 42, was killed in 2002 in a 50-foot fall while working on a retrofit project on the Golden Gate Bridge . A subsequent investigation revealed that Noah had been working on a dangerously narrow platform without scaffolding. Cal/OSHA, the federal agency’s state counterpart, recommended penalties for several serious violations. But the case was thrown out on appeal on a technicality : The citation issued by Cal/OSHA misstated the legal name of the employer, Shimmick Construction Co. Inc./Obayashi Corp. As a result, the company walked away without paying a cent . “What incentive is there for them to them to change if they’re getting away with everything?” she said. Shimmick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For workers who survive falls with serious injuries, recovery can be long and painful, and some don't make it. In 1999, Kevin Keane was working on the roof of a warehouse northwest of Los Angeles when he lost his balance and fell through an open skylight, crashing onto a pallet of video cassettes 40 feet below. He was injured but survived. Days later, his brother, Nolan, 18, fell through an unprotected skylight on the same roof and was killed. Kevin Keane, left, and his brother Nolan. Courtesy of Liz Lambrecht As Kevin recovered, he became addicted to prescription painkillers, then heroin, according to his mother, Liz Lambrecht. He died of an overdose in 2008. “For all practical purposes, Kevin died when Nolan died,” Lambrecht said. After Nolan died, the brothers’ employer, Single Ply Systems, a commercial roofing contractor, paid over $83,000 in penalties to Cal/OSHA. The company also paid several thousand dollars for Nolan’s funeral, according to Lambrecht. But she said the company could have saved the expense by putting a fraction of that money into safety. Single Ply did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “An $8 piece of plywood would have solved the whole problem,” Lambrecht said. “It just boggles my mind.” Eli Wolfe can be reached at eli.wolfe@fairwarning.org Eli Wolfe, Fair Warning "

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrested by police in London,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested-police-london-n991236,"LONDON — The Justice Department revealed Thursday that it has charged Julian Assange with computer hacking hours after the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks was arrested in London following a U.S. request to extradite him. Assange, the publisher of state secrets that embarrassed governments around the world, was wanted in Britain for skipping bail in 2012, when he was under investigation in Sweden on charges of sexual assault and rape. He spent almost seven years living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to the U.S.
Assange is charged with one count of ""conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer,"" according to the indictment released Thursday by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.
Prosecutors say the password was being sought by Chelsea Manning, a former Army intelligence officer who provided Assange with a trove of secret government documents that WikiLeaks published in 2010 — ""one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States,"" according to the indictment.
Assange, 47, has said that the United States is trying to infringe on his journalistic freedoms. The indictment accused him of going beyond the role of a traditional journalist when he helped Manning crack the password that gave her access to hundreds of thousands of classified files.
WATCH: Bearded Julian Assange is arrested and removed from Ecuadorian Embassy April 11, 2019 00:58 Appearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday afternoon, Assange pleaded not guilty but was convicted of failing to surrender to police on June 29, 2012. He will be sentenced in Crown Court, where more serious crimes are heard.
Assange faces extradition hearings on May 2 and June 12.
Addressing the media outside the court after the hearing, Assange's London-based attorney, Jennifer Robinson, said his arrest ""sets a dangerous precedent for all media organizations and journalists.""
""Since 2010 we’ve warned that Julian Assange would face extradition to the U.S. for his publishing activities with WikiLeaks,"" Robinson said. ""Unfortunately today we’ve been proven right.""
She added that she had just spoken to Assange, whose message to the world was: ""I told you so.""
Julian Assange arrives at a court in London on Thursday. Jack Taylor / Getty Images In an interview with NBC News, Robinson said she was concerned about her client's health, adding that ""he was in the middle of treatment for [a] root canal when he was arrested.""
A source directly familiar with the situation told NBC News that the U.S. is making plans to seek Assange's extradition.
Footage shot by the Ruptly news video agency showed a bedraggled and bearded Assange being hauled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy by seven men. As he was bundled into a waiting police van, Assange shouted: ""You must resist. You can resist. ... The U.K. must resist.""
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno said in a video message that Assange had his diplomatic asylum withdrawn due to ""repeatedly violating international conventions.""

— Lenín Moreno (@Lenin) April 11, 2019 Moreno added that he asked the U.K. not to extradite Assange ""to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty."" In a subsequent statement, Ecuador's foreign minister said that the U.K. had given its assurance that it would comply with the request.
Alan Duncan, a British government minister, welcomed Assange's eviction and said it was the result of ""extensive dialogue"" between the U.K. and Ecuador.
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's foreign ministry, criticized Assange's arrest. ""The hand of 'democracy' squeezes the throat of freedom,"" she said in a Facebook post.
WikiLeaks said in a tweet that Assange's political asylum had been ""illegally terminated in violation of international law.""

Julian Assange did not ""walk out of the embassy"". The Ecuadorian ambassador invited British police into the embassy and he was immediately arrested.
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 11, 2019 The group has repeatedly claimed that the DOJ is building a criminal case centered on the leaking of Democratic emails hacked by the Russians in the 2016 election.
President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, told a congressional hearing in February that former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone was in contact with Assange before WikiLeaks released leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee.
Assange has always maintained that the source of the leaks was not Russia, contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies.
The White House referred questions about the Assange indictment to the DOJ. In an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump appeared to downplay his knowledge of Assange's organization, saying: ""I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing.""
Trump hasn’t always been circumspect when it comes to Assange and WikiLeaks. Less than a month before the 2016 election, he showered praise on the organization.
“I love WikiLeaks,” he said on Oct. 10.
Assange, who founded WikiLeaks in 2006, made international news in 2010 with the publication of the leaked information provided by Manning.
These included a video of a U.S. military helicopter fatally shooting people in Iraq, and thousands of classified military logs revealing sensitive information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thought to be the biggest leaks in U.S. military history.
Clinton on Assange: 'He has to answer for what he has done' April 12, 2019 02:36 Manning last month refused to testify before a federal grand jury looking into the release of documents to WikiLeaks.
In November 2010, the Swedish government issued an international arrest warrant for Assange in connection with allegations of sexual assault and rape from two women. Assange, who has denied the allegations, surrendered to British police the following month and was released on bail. He then fled, breaking the terms of his bond agreement.
Sweden dropped its investigation into Assange in 2017 . But Sweden's chief prosecutor, Ingrid Isgren, said Thursday that the investigation into Assange could be reopened if he returned to the country before the statute of limitation expires in August 2020.
Elisabeth Massi Fritz, lawyer for one of Assange's accusers, said on Thursday that she would ""do everything we possibly can"" to get police to reopen the investigation ""so that Assange can be extradited to Sweden and prosecuted for rape."" The prosecutor's office said it had received a request from the original plaintiff to re-open the rape case.

In 2016, the Ecuadorian government cut off his access to the internet in the embassy after WikiLeaks published a trove of emails from Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The government said it was trying to make sure he couldn't interfere in the affairs of other countries.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 9:31 AM GMT By Associated Press CAIRO — Tens of thousands of Sudanese were making their way to the center of the country's capital on Thursday, cheering and clapping in celebration as two senior officials said the military had forced longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir to step down after 30 years in power. The circumstances of al-Bashir's apparent ouster and his current whereabouts remained unclear, however. The armed forces were to deliver an ""important statement"" and asked the nation to wait for it, state TV reported earlier. The two officials, in high positions in the government and the military, told The Associated Press the army forced al-Bashir to step down and was now in talks about forming a transitional government. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. NBC News could not immediately independently verify the report. The swirling reports of a coup following nearly four months of street protests against al-Bashir's rule raised expectations it was a sign the autocrat was relinquishing power or was being removed by the military. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir. Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah / Reuters file Pan-Arab TV networks said top ruling party officials were being arrested. They aired footage of masses they said were heading toward the presidential palace in Khartoum, waving the national flag, chanting, and clapping. Al-Bashir, who is a pariah in many countries, is also wanted by the international war crimes tribunal for atrocities in Darfur . Eyewitnesses in Khartoum said the military had deployed at key sites in the city to secure several installations since the morning hours. Armored vehicles and tanks are parked in the streets and near bridges over the Nile River, they said, as well as in the vicinity of the military headquarters, where thousands were anxiously awaiting the army statement. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals. Organizers of the protests urged crowds to converge and join an ongoing sit-in underway in Khartoum since the weekend. They issued a statement vowing to remain in the streets until the ""regime steps down completely and power is handed to a civilian transitional government."" Thousands of protesters, including women carrying their children, were making their way toward the military headquarters, many ululating and flashing ""V'' for victory. There were also unconfirmed reports that the airport in the Sudanese capital had been closed. Seeing reports that Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, has left office.

State TV ceased regular broadcasts, with only the brief announcement saying that there will be an ""important statement from the armed forces after a while, wait for it."" The development followed deadly clashes between Sudanese security forces and protesters holding a large anti-government sit-in outside the military's headquarters in Khartoum, which also include a presidential residence. There were several attempts to break up the sit-in, leaving 22 dead since Saturday. On Tuesday, Sudanese security forces tried again to disperse the sit-in, which began over the weekend, killing at least 14 people, activists behind the demonstration said. The government said 11 died. The fatalities so far have included five soldiers who protest organizers said were defending the sit-in. Protesters sit on a torn billboard during a rally demanding Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir step down on Wednesday. Reuters The months of protests have plunged Sudan into its worst crisis in years. The demonstrations initially erupted last December with rallies against a spiraling economy, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to embattled al-Bashir's rule. Security forces have responded to the protest movement with a fierce crackdown, killing dozens. Al-Bashir banned unauthorized public gatherings and granted sweeping powers to the police since imposing a state of emergency last month. Security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, live ammunition and batons against demonstrators The protests gained momentum last week after Algeria's President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years, resigned in response to weeks of similar protests . On Saturday, marches in Khartoum marked the 34th anniversary of the overthrow of former President al-Nimeiri in a bloodless coup. It was one of the largest turnouts in the current wave of unrest. The military removed Nimeiri after a popular uprising in 1985. It quickly handed over power to an elected government. The dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until al-Bashir — a career army officer — allied with Islamist hard-liners and toppled it in a coup in 1989. Associated Press"
DNC launches hyper-local 2020 effort to shadow Trump on the trail,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/dnc-launches-hyper-local-2020-effort-shadow-trump-trail-n993196,"WASHINGTON — Voters in hundreds of small and medium-sized towns across America are about to be targeted with digital ads, press conferences and billboards featuring neighbors and friends who say they’ve been “betrayed” by . The effort is the main feature of the Democratic National Committee’s “war room” that launches on Thursday and is focused on defeating Trump in 2020, according to officials who briefed NBC News.
Responding to criticism that Democrats were too focused on Trump’s temperament and personal attributes during Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, the party’s main organizing arm says it’s making a major expansion of its opposition research team that will be “hyper-focused” on the impact of Trump’s policies on local communities.
A team of several dozen staffers have compiled an archive of thousands of documents obtained through local news and Freedom of Information Act requests that will be used to spotlight promises Trump made during visits to specific communities — and to “put a human face” on what’s happened since then.
Those include promises made to welders and pipefitters in Virginia Beach and Newtown, Pennsylvania, construction workers around Tampa, Florida and seniors struggling with high drug prices in Reno, Nevada. The DNC did not provide estimates on how much money they planned to spend on an effort that is planned to continue through the 2020 election.
While Democratic presidential candidates compete for the nomination, the DNC will bypass traditional primary states like Iowa to get a head start in targeting voters in battleground states Clinton lost, including Florida, Arizona, Michigan and Georgia.
“Wherever the president goes, we’re going to hold him accountable on a local level for the ramifications of his policies,” said Saul Shorr, a Democratic media consultant advising the DNC. “People have absorbed the fact that he isn’t truthful. The real question here is ‘have they benefited or not?’” said Shorr. Whether it’s health care, taxes or infrastructure, “we think the answer is no.”
Trump ran his 2016 campaign, in part, on a pledge to prioritize “forgotten"" Americans, especially in rural communities across the Midwest and South. ""The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer,” Trump said in his inauguration address.
That campaign agenda included a tax cut primarily benefiting the middle class, bigger paychecks for working-class Americans, health care for all that would be better and cheaper than Obamacare and a manufacturing job renaissance.
But the president has recently said he won’t have a health care plan until after the next election . While manufacturing employment has been experiencing a strong run since Obama was president, a majority of Americans said that they expect their taxes to stay the same or increase this year in a recent NBC News/WSJ poll . And while wages have been modestly rising since 2014, those for average workers, especially without college degrees, have been stagnant for decades.
""The rich are getting richer, corporate profits are soaring, but the rest of us are still just running in place,"" said Adrienne Watson, director of the ""war room"" effort. ""Trump has made the system more rigged than ever."" Watson will run the effort for the DNC, along with research director Nick Bauer. Daniel Wessel will be the lead spokesman.
The Democrats’ database includes every single Trump rally in 2016, material that will be used to create digital and television ads of promises he made to local communities from Lansing, Michigan to Tallahassee, Florida.
That will be spliced with county and municipal statistics on indicators like wage levels and the number of local residents with pre-existing conditions who would be hurt by Trump’s budget cuts. For instance, if Trump visits Lordstown, Ohio, the DNC will highlight the administration’s efforts to cut $1.75 million to fund a transition center there to help laid off General Motors employees.
“Democrats are clearly too busy pushing their phony Russia collusion hoax to notice the large number of promises made and promises kept by President Trump,” said RNC spokesperson Michael Joyce in response to the charges of broken promises.
Joyce pointed to the confirmation of two Supreme Court Justices, many other federal judges, the 2017 tax cut, deregulations and a “booming” economy as evidence that “just scratches the surface of accomplishments made by President Trump and his Administration over the past two years.”
As its model, the DNC is using a 4-minute video it cut last year featuring Trump pledging his “allegiance” to workers and companies like Harley Davidson that includes local Kansas City coverage of company executives using their 2017 Trump tax cut to repurchase stock shares while shuttering a plant that cost hundreds of local jobs.
The DNC’s local focus is an acknowledgement from the party that, even as national leaders in Washington continue to conduct investigations around Russian interference in 2016 and Trump highlight’s national economic statistics, for many Americans the biggest worry is their local economy.
It also reflects concerns that, in 2016, the party didn’t focus enough on Trump’s business record, a major selling point for swing voters in small towns across America who thought he would use his business acumen to benefit them.
That history includes lawsuits from stiffed contractors and others that, Democrats say, is being repeated in the form of promises he’s broken to American voters. The DNC now has a database of 7,000 lawsuits involving Trump or his Trump Organization, including contractors like a Philadelphia cabinet maker who said the real estate tycoon’s refusal to pay him sent him into bankruptcy, or Trump’s failure to pay state or local taxes.
The Monday after Trump’s election in 2016, the DNC began taking the same approach with federal agencies, making numerous Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain internal records about Trump and his policies, for instance correspondence between the Department of Labor, local business owners and government officials about the impact of Trump's policies.
Those records will be dropped into ads and press conferences featuring local residents and amplified by local news stations and papers.
The campaign is focused on all demographic groups, not just swing voters who supported Trump. For instance, when Trump visits Charlotte, North Carolina to stump for reelection, the Democrats plan to drop content featuring him, during an October, 2016 rally promising a “New Deal” for African American communities and expanding access to capital through “micro loans” for those communities.
During another October rally in Columbus, Trump said he would champion a student loan program that would cap repayment for at 12.5 percent of a borrower’s income. “They just go ahead and they get on with their lives because it’s very, very hard for young people,” he said.
Trump has not proposed either of these things as president.

India votes in 1st phase of election seen as a test for Modi,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/india-votes-1st-phase-election-seen-test-modi-n993291,"NEW DELHI — Polls opened Thursday in the first phase of India's general elections, seen as a referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party. A festive spirit prevailed as men and women in colorful clothes made their way to heavily guarded voting stations in large numbers.
In the world's largest democratic exercise, voters in 18 Indian states and two Union Territories are casting ballots on Thursday, the first day of a seven-phase election staggered over six weeks in the country of 1.3 billion people.
Modi supporters say the tea seller's son from Gujarat state has improved the nation's standing. But critics say his party's Hindu nationalism has aggravated religious tensions in India.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses a campaign rally in Junagadh, India, on Wednesday. Amit Dave / Reuters Thursday's voting is important for the BJP as it had won only 32 of 91 seats in the previous 2014 elections. It is seeking to improve its tally this time.
Modi came to power in 2014 and the party invoked its Hindu nationalist roots before the elections, with Modi at the forefront against the threat of Pakistan, India's Muslim-majority archrival. Hindus comprise about 80 percent of India's 1.3 billion people.
Even though India continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, the Modi-led government's performance on the economy has come under criticism.
The first item in the opposition Congress party's election manifesto describes a plan for creating jobs. It also promises an income subsidy program for the poorest families and for farmers.
Some 900 million people are eligible to cast ballots at around a million polling stations across India. They will decide 543 seats in India's lower house of Parliament. Voting concludes on May 19 and counting is scheduled for May 23."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 10:50 AM UTC By Ben Kesslen and Associated Press A 90-year-old pilot’s death in a small plane crash in 2017 was likely caused by his decision to allow his large dog to fly in the passenger’s seat, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined in a report released Monday. Jerry Naylor, a former commercial pilot who was flying the single-engine airplane, crashed into a cornfield, 50 yards away from the runway at Monticello Regional Airport in Iowa. While the late pilot’s son said his father routinely flew with his 70-pound dog, NTSB officials report that Naylor's loss of control of the plane was caused by the “dog's likely contact with the flight controls during landing.” Officials say Naylor died from “multiple blunt-force injuries sustained during the accident.” The NTSB found no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures in the small plane, which led them to zero in on the dog as the cause of the crash. The dog, whose name and breed were not identified by the NTSB, survived. A witness at Monticello Airport saw the dog running out of the cornfield after the crash. “First responders were able to catch the dog, who was treated for minor injuries by a local veterinarian,” the NTSB said.

Obama's former White House counsel expects to be indicted in extension of Mueller's probe,www.nbcnews.com,Allan Smith,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/obama-s-former-white-house-counsel-expects-be-indicted-extension-n993311,"Former White House counsel Greg Craig was indicted by a grand jury Thursday for allegedly making false statements to the Justice Department about work performed for Ukraine in 2012. Craig, 74, who was charged with concealing material information from the Foreign Agents Registration Act Unit, or FARA Unit, and making false statements, failed to disclose work he performed for Ukraine because he believed it would prevent him from assuming future roles within the federal government, according to the indictment, which stemmed from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.
Craig, who served as former President Barack Obama's White House counsel, refused to accept a plea deal.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Wednesday that people familiar with the situation said Craig was likely to be charged with making false statements to the Justice Department.
Craig and his law firm were hired in early 2012 to lead an independent inquiry into whether former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko received a fair trial after she was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2011 for abuse of office, federal prosecutors say.
He was also signed on to consult about Tymoshenko's second trial. Craig's firm, Skadden Arps, at which he was partner, received more than $4 million for the report and consultation.
The effort, NBC News has previously reported, was spearheaded in part by Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman. Manafort was working with the government of former Ukrainian President Victor Yanukovych to produce a report that Ukrainian legal experts have called a politically motivated ""whitewashing"" of the facts.
The investigation into Craig grew out of Mueller's probe of lobbying efforts undertaken at Manafort's direction and at the behest of the pro-Russian, pro-Putin government of Yanukovych.
Manafort pleaded guilty to failing to register as an agent of Ukraine during this time period when he amassed millions of dollars in work lobbying on behalf of the country's government.
Emails showed that Craig was resistant to registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act and asked the co-author of his inquiry whether the project would require him to.
In a May 2012 email, Craig debated whether to hire a public relations firm after being told that Tymoshenko's attorneys might speak publicly about his firm's inquiry, according to the indictment.
""I have been clear that we cannot run close to the FARA line and if we were seen as hiring and directing [PR Firm] we would be doing much more than just lawyering,"" Craig wrote.
Craig allegedly made false statements about the report in 2013 in response to the FARA Unit's inquiries and again in 2017 after being interviewed by Mueller.
He allegedly stated in a formal written response to the FARA Unit that his firm did not inform, consult or act under the instruction of Ukraine.
According the indictment, he failed to inform the FARA Unit that he generated the written inquiry report, that his firm advised the hiring of a public relations firm, was informed about the firm's strategy and met with a lobbyist whom he informed of the firm's strategy.
Craig also allegedly failed to disclose that he met with reporters in coordination with representatives to the Ukraine.
Because of the allegedly misleading information provided by Craig, the FARA Unit determined that he and his firm did not have to register as a foreign agent, according to the indictment.
In a statement he posted to YouTube on Thursday, Craig said that his comments to reporters were actually intended to ""prevent mischaracterization of our report by Ukraine and its public relations firm"" and that ""I was always honest about the reason for my contacts with the media.""
""I never discussed the findings of our report with any U.S. officials and certainly did not lobby any U.S. officials on behalf of Ukraine,"" Craig said. ""I did not help Ukraine promote its spin when it released our report.""
Craig's attorneys, William Taylor and William Murphy, released a statement Thursday calling the indictment ""unfair and misleading.""
""It ignores uncontroverted evidence to the contrary,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration. That is what this trial will be all about.""
Craig was interviewed multiple times by Mueller's team. In addition to working for Obama, Craig served as a senior legal adviser to former President Bill Clinton.
He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

Assange shouts 'you must resist!' as he’s bundled into a police van The fugitive founder of WikiLeaks and publisher of state secrets that embarrassed governments across the world was dragged out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London after spending seven years there.
London's Metropolitan Police said the Ecuadorian government had withdrawn asylum for Assange, adding that officers had been ""invited"" in by the ambassador.
Assange was wanted by British police for skipping bail in August 2012, while he was under investigation for sexual assault and rape in Sweden.
The Australian national has maintained that if forced to surrender to authorities he would eventually be extradited to the U.S. to face charges.

European leaders gave British Prime Minister Theresa May until Oct. 31 to persuade Parliament to approve the country's divorce deal with the bloc.

Warren targets big business with $1 trillion 'profits' tax,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/warren-targets-big-business-1-trillion-profits-tax-n993146,"WASHINGTON — Companies with profits over $100 million would face new corporate taxes under a proposal released Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The 2020 presidential hopeful said her ""real corporate profits tax"" is aimed at companies that report large annual gains but pay little in taxes thanks to a variety of tax credits and deductions that are available to lower their overall bill.
An analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank, that was released on Thursday found that the number of publicly held corporations that pay no federal taxes more than doubled last year to 60, thanks in part to the $1.9 trillion tax cut President Donald Trump signed into law.
""Everybody profits from being part of this country and everybody ought to make a contribution,"" Warren said Thursday in an MSNBC interview. ""Little sized businesses do it, medium sized businesses do it, families do it, we want the big corporations to do it, too.""
Sen. Warren on new corporate tax plan: Markets without rules are theft April 11, 2019 14:57 The senator pointed to Amazon as an example. The company paid no federal taxes on $11.2 billion in income last year, according to ITEP.
Under Warren's plan, companies would have to pay a 7 percent tax on profits over $100 million that would stack on top of their other federal taxes. In Amazon's case, Warren estimated her tax would have raised its total bill to $698 million.
The company defended its tax practices on Thursday in response.
“Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits remain modest given retail is a highly competitive, low-margin business and our continued heavy investment.""
Warren responded on Twitter that she did not dispute Amazon met its obligations under existing law. ""That's the problem,"" she said.
An accompanying analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who also consulted on Warren's plan for a wealth tax on the ultra-rich, estimated that 1,200 publicly traded companies would be affected and pay an additional $1 trillion in taxes over 10 years. They added that this was a ""lower bound"" estimate, since they expected the plan to raise more from some large private companies as well.
Warren argued her approach was better than raising the corporate tax rate — which was cut to 21 percent from 35 percent under Trump — because it would prevent companies from using various breaks to reduce or zero out the new tax.
""It's a small new tax — but because our richest, biggest corporations are so skilled at minimizing their taxes under our current system, that small new tax will generate big new revenue,"" she wrote in a Medium post.

Trump's protectors shield him from Democrats' oversight plans,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/trump-s-protectors-shield-him-democrats-oversight-plans-n993341,"WASHINGTON — As Democrats are quickly finding out, gaining control of the House of the Representatives didn’t mean the Trump administration was going to roll over on their requests for Trump’s taxes and info on the Mueller probe. After all, the president still controls the executive branch, and he has his protectors inside the administration’s top departments.
So on Wednesday, you had Treasury Secretary Mnuchin tell the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee that he wouldn’t be able to meet the deadline to turn over the president’s tax returns.
(The law clearly states that the committee has the power to request tax returns to be reviewed in a closed executive session.)
Attorney General Barr under fire after 'spying' remark April 11, 2019 01:36 Also yesterday, Attorney General William Barr – who earlier summarized the Mueller report in a mere four pages – embraced the GOP talking points on the Russia probe, as NBC’s Ken Dilanian writes
“I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur. The question was whether it was adequately predicated,” Barr told the Senate Appropriations Committee.
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal. It's a big deal,” he added.
Note: Using the word “spying” to refer to opening a counterintelligence investigation based on a foreign tip that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton , or having surveillance on Carter Page (after he left the Trump campaign) is highly loaded for the nation’s top law enforcement official.
Bottom line: Democrats have their work cut out for them when it comes to oversight.
And they’re going to have to decide which fights are worth pursuing and which ones might take them down rabbit holes from which they’ll never emerge.
Oh, and one other thing: Former Obama aides are asking why THEY got accused of politicizing the IRS, and Trump/Mnuchin aren’t….
Assange arrested, U.S. to seek extradition Early this morning, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested in London .
And NBC’s Dilanian reports that the United States is making plans to seek his extradition – in connection with sealed federal charges in the Eastern District of Virginia, according to a source directly familiar with the situation.
The nature of these charges isn’t clear.
But here’s a reminder of the role WikiLeaks played in the 2016 election:
The DNC emails it published – right before the Dem convention – lead to the ouster of party’s chairwoman. They created Hillary-vs.-Bernie unrest inside the convention hall. The John Podesta emails it published fueled negative storylines for the Clinton campaign in the last month of the race. And Trump mentioned the word “WikiLeaks” some 140 times in that last month. 2020 Vision: Warren raised $6 million Elizabeth Warren’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it raked in $6 million for the first fundraising quarter .

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., finds herself embroiled in another controversy after a comment she made about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Muslim civil rights. Speaking last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Los Angeles chapter, Omar mistakenly said the organization was founded in response to the terrorist attacks, adding ""because they recognized that some people did something"" — a phrasing that some in conservative media have interpreted as a too-flippant reference to the attack. ""CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said. April 11, 2019 01:19 It is unclear what Omar meant by the wording of her comment. A spokeswoman for Omar said the congresswoman had misspoken about CAIR's founding. It was established in 1994, but expanded its civil rights advocacy after the Sept. 11 attacks. T he front page of The New York Post on Thursday denounced Omar, splashing the words ""Here's Your Something"" over an image of the World Trade Center towers ablaze after the planes hit. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., came to Omar's defense, tweeting Thursday that the newspaper ""knows exactly what it's doing - taking quotes out of context and evoking painful imagery to spread hate and endangering the life of Rep.

""They do this all the time to us. Especially women of color. They take our words out of context because they’re afraid … because we speak truth to power,"" she said. Tlaib said Omar — who became last fall the first Somali American, first Muslim refugee and first hijab-wearing Muslim woman elected to Congress — ""has always condemned"" terrorism because ""she has seen what terrorists can do,"" pointing to the fact that Omar came to the U.S. as a child refugee fleeing violence in Somalia. April 11, 2019 09:09 Omar and Tlaib are the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Fellow freshman Rep.

Michael Avenatti faces 36-count indictment in California,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/michael-avenatti-faces-36-count-indictment-california-n993391,"Michael Avenatti, former attorney for Stormy Daniels, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in California on 36 counts, including embezzling from a paraplegic, court documents released Thursday show. Avenatti, 48, faces charges of wire fraud, failure to collect and withhold payroll taxes, attempting to obstruct the IRS, failing to file tax returns, aggravated identity fraud, bank fraud and false testimony under oath during bankruptcy.
The lawyer was arrested March 25 on some of the counts, but the 61-page indictment filed by a federal grand jury late Wednesday ""significantly broadens the scope of the case,"" according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.
The criminal charges in the indictment ""are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in other sets — typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti’s financial house of cards from collapsing,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna.
Avenatti wouldn't comment beyond statements he made on Twitter .
""I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me,"" he wrote Thursday.
The charge involving the paraplegic man says Avenatti drained a $4 million settlement paid out to the client by Los Angeles County, using ""portions of the settlement to finance his coffee business or pay personal expenses,"" the U.S. attorney's office statement said.
""Avenatti concealed the receipt of the settlement from Client 1 and instead gave him periodic “advances” of no more than $1,900 and paid the rent for his assisted living facility,"" the statement said.
Avenatti lied by telling that client as he was trying to buy a house that his settlement money was not available, causing him to fail to meet escrow, according to the indictment. Avenatti is also accused of failing to fulfill a promise to respond to that client's Social Security Administration inquiry, leading to a loss of benefits.
Josh Robbins, the attorney representing that alleged victim, Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, said in a statement that Johnson is the ""victim of an appalling fraud.""
""Mr. Avenatti stole millions of dollars that were meant to compensate Mr. Johnson for a devastating injury, spent it on his own lavish lifestyle, then lied about it to Mr. Johnson for years to cover his tracks,"" Robbins said. “His actions have left Mr. Johnson destitute.""
Avenatti also allegedly embezzled millions of dollars from four other clients, using the money to fund the purchase of a jet, his coffee business, ""his auto racing enterprise"" and his own legal and personal expenses.
He used some clients' money to pay previous clients he had swindled and ""pay some of his law firm’s bankruptcy creditors, including the IRS,"" according to the U.S. attorney's office.
""As an attorney, holding your client's money to trust is one of the highest duties. It is lawyer 101. You do not steal your client's money. And that is one of your highest duties and every lawyer knows it,"" Hanna said.
Avenatti tweeted a client's testimonial calling him ""an exceptional, honest and ethical attorney.""
""Any claim that any monies due clients were mishandled is bogus nonsense. ... I look forward to proving my innocence,"" Avenatti wrote in the tweet.
Any claim that any monies due clients were mishandled is bogus nonsense. By way of example only (there are MANY more like this), here is a document Mr. Johnson signed less than a month ago attesting to my ethics and how his case was handled. I look forward to proving my innocence pic.twitter.com/tWL1aIuPy0
— Michael Avenatti (@MichaelAvenatti) April 11, 2019 Nineteen tax-related charges against Avenatti include accusations he has not filed personal income tax returns since 2010, and didn't file some tax returns for his two law firms. He is also accused of failing to pay more than $3 million in payroll taxes while he was the owner Global Baristas US LLC, which operated Tully’s Coffee.
""Avenatti allegedly attempted to obstruct the IRS’s efforts to collect the taxes"" by lying and directing funds from credit card transactions at Tully's coffee shops to a new bank account, the U.S. attorney's office said.
Two bank fraud charges against Avenatti allege he secured bank loans by submitting tax returns that had never been filed with the IRS and by claiming that the Eagan Avenatti law firm had $508,200 in its operating account when it had only a little more than $43,000.
Avenatti is also charged with four counts of bankruptcy fraud for allegedly failing to report all of Eagan Avenatti’s accounts receivable, under penalty of perjury, and falsely testifying under oath during a bankruptcy hearing by denying the firm had received more than $1.3 million in fees when it had.
The IRS has been investigating Avenatti for more than two and a half years, Hanna said.
If Avenatti is convicted of all 36 counts, he could face a potential 335 years in federal prison, according to the U.S. attorney's office. He is currently free on $300,000 bond, and is scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana on April 29.
A $5 million jet co-owned by Avenatti was seized Wednesday as part of the ongoing investigation, officials said.
The new charges follow Avenatti's arrest in New York last month for allegedly trying to shake down Nike for up to $25 million and on two counts of wire and bank fraud from Southern California, where his firm is based. Avenatti has said he expects to be cleared.
Attorney Michael Avenatti leaves the federal court house in Manhattan on March 25, 2019. Johannes Eisele / AFP - Getty Images The attorney is best known for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Donald Trump.
The charges are the latest major blow to a career that took off last year when Avenatti represented Daniels in her lawsuit to break a confidentiality agreement with Trump to stay mum about an affair they allegedly had.
Avenatti became one of Trump's leading adversaries, attacking him on cable news programs and Twitter. At one point, Avenatti even considered challenging Trump in 2020.
But in California, his business practices had come under scrutiny from the IRS and a former law partner who was owed $14 million by Avenatti and the Eagan Avenatti firm."

SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 1:13 PM GMT By Associated Press COLUMBUS, Ohio — No topic seemed off limits, including tales of back alleys and coat hangers, as abortion-rights supporters in Ohio fought perhaps the last battle over a twice-vetoed heartbeat abortion ban, which Gov. Mike DeWine has said he will sign. After nearly 10 years of fighting, Democrats let loose during the run-up to final House and Senate approval Wednesday with lessons from slavery, predictions of economic harm, references to the book of Genesis, and testimonials about their own rapes. Faith groups brandished banners and made pleas for religious tolerance. An advocate for reproductive rights threatened Republicans with the loss of young voters' support in 2020. Opponents vowed to sue. Ohio Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan wipes away tears during a hearing to propose amendments to the ""Heartbeat Bill"" which was later voted to pass to the House floor at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus on April 9, 2019. Brooke LaValley / Columbus Dispatch via AP Ohio's closely divided politics have slowed the progress of the so-called heartbeat bill as it has caught momentum elsewhere, forcing years of debate in the state where the movement originated. Five other states have now passed similar bans , two of which have been blocked by the courts. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who took office in January, has said he will sign the bill, after former GOP Gov. John Kasich vetoed it twice. State Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan, a Democrat from a storied Youngstown political family, shed tears during the debate, exasperated at a bill she said would harm Ohio and its future. ""I'm concerned that we will have companies that will choose not to locate here due to our oppressive laws. I'm concerned that doctors will leave the state of Ohio,"" she said. ""I'm concerned that our kids are going to leave, that we're going to lose a large amount of young people who don't want to live in an oppressive atmosphere."" Related Author of Ohio's strict abortion bill believes Supreme Court will welcome it 'with open arms' Opponents' protests did nothing to budge a largely closed-mouthed GOP majority on the committee. They appeared confident that prohibiting pregnancy termination once a fetal heartbeat is detected is the best thing for the unborn, for women and for the state. Republicans dominated an 11-7 party-line vote that sent the bill to the full House, where it's scheduled for a vote Wednesday. State Rep. Candice Keller, a Middletown Republican, called the legislation ""the most compassionate bill we've ever passed."" Keller rejected suggestions that everyone knows someone who has had, or will need, an abortion; that women will continue to have abortions, only unsafely; even that reproductive rights are about women rather than the men who impregnate them and the male doctors who abort those pregnancies. ""If we are really about empowering the women of Ohio and empowering the women of this country, we will begin to tell the truth about the abortion industry and the enormous amount of profit that is made on the backs of women,"" she said. During floor debate Wednesday, two female representatives who said they had been raped, slammed the bill for not making exceptions for rape and incest. Another female lawmaker said her great-grandmother bled to death in a bath tub trying self-administer an abortion. House Health Committee Chairman Derek Merrin criticized those who say abortion drives down health care costs. His conscience, he said, tells him abortion is wrong. ""My heart, Mr. Speaker, tells me it's wrong. My understanding of the law and of the constitution tells me it's wrong. And in the spirit of fairness, equality, and justice, I know it's wrong,"" Merrin said. Related Texas abortion bill proposes death penalty for women, physicians Prohibiting abortions at the first detectable heartbeat means prohibiting virtually all abortions, said Dr. Michael Cackovic, a specialist in maternal fetal medicine at Ohio State University Medical Center. He said current standard practice, which involves transvaginal ultrasound, can reliably detect a heartbeat five to six weeks into pregnancy. ""Essentially, that's three to four weeks after conception, or one to two weeks after a missed period,"" he said. Cackovic said the heartbeat prohibition would require women who want an abortion to determine they're pregnant using an over-the-counter pregnancy test and to race to have the procedure between four and five weeks into pregnancy. ""You're going to be doing more procedures and subjecting women to more procedures and medications to get abortions, because they're rushing between that four and five weeks to get it accomplished,"" he said. About a third of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, he said, so the law also would force many women who don't want to be pregnant to get abortions needlessly, when they might naturally have miscarried. State Rep. Beth Liston, a Dublin Democrat and a pediatrician, said proponents' hopes of challenging the viability standard upheld in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision aren't grounded in science. She said she favors the idea from Genesis that breath begins life. ""Simply put, you need lungs and a brain to live, and there's no technology in the world that will change that,"" she said. The House's 56-39 vote sent the bill to the Ohio Senate, which agreed to House changes 18-13 before sending the bill to DeWine, a Republican who took office in January. The earliest bans on heartbeat abortion, in Iowa and North Carolina, have been blocked by the courts. Three more states — Mississippi, Kentucky and Georgia — have more recently passed bills amid growing national momentum. The Georgia bill has not yet been signed by the governor."
The legal battle between Democrats and AG Barr over the Mueller report has begun - NBCNews.com,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/legal-battle-between-democrats-ag-barr-over-mueller-report-has-ncna993251,"Speaking about his efforts to obtain the full, un-redacted version of the Mueller report and all of the supporting documents and evidence, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said : “If we don’t get everything, we will issue the subpoena and go to court.” Nadler’s comments came on the same day that Attorney General William Barr appeared before the House Appropriations Committee on April 9 and announced that he would release a redacted version of the Mueller report “within a week.” Barr then appeared before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee meeting , where he told lawmakers: ""I'm landing the plane right now and I've been willing to discuss my letters and the process going forward, and the report is going to be out next week and I'm not going to go into the details until the plane is on the ground.""
Whenever the plane does land, it’s likely Barr’s redactions will do little to satisfy Democrats.
When the plane does land, it’s likely Barr’s redactions will do little to satisfy Democrats. Any hope that the attorney general would be impartial was erased when he released a four-page document that President Donald Trump has since used as a vehicle to falsely claim a “total exoneration” of all wrongdoing. Even more disturbing was Barr’s refusal to clearly answer questions about potential White House involvement in the crafting of that document.
No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2019 Indeed, Barr even refused to push back on the president’s accusation that the special counsel’s investigation was nothing but a “witch hunt.” Asked by senators whether he agreed with this characterization, Barr remarked that it ""really depends on where you're sitting."" It was answer sure to make his boss in the Oval Office happy, if not Congress.
Bizarrely, Barr is now claiming that the four-page letter he released was “not a summary” of the Mueller report. Never mind the fact that in his own words, Barr literally wrote , “I believe that it is in the public interest to describe the report and to summarize the principal conclusions reached by the Special Counsel and the results of his investigation.”
AG Barr on the Mueller Report: 'I'm landing the plane right now' April 10, 2019 08:35 Once again, a member of the Trump administration is lying. It is painfully clear that the attorney general cannot and should not be the arbiter of what Congress, and ultimately the American people, can see when it comes to the Mueller report. Someone who is not comfortable, at the very least, of respecting the efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is clearly far too partisan to be trusted with such an important moment in U.S. history.
Barr’s reticence is not super surprising given the White House’s statements. In recent days, Trump has telegraphed that he does not want the full report to be released publicly. On Monday, Trump tweeted: “The Democrats will never be satisfied, not matter what they get, how much they get, or how many pages they get. It will never end, but that’s the way life goes!”
The Democrats will never be satisfied, no matter what they get, how much they get, or how many pages they get. It will never end, but that’s the way life goes!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 8, 2019 Mind you, this is the same guy who spent years promoting a conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Putting that blatant hypocrisy aside, Trump isn’t wrong. Democrats will not be satisfied with “pages” because there is no reason why they, or the American people, should have to settle for anything less than the full and complete report. Not some sanitized version manufactured by a presidential public defender.
Imagine what House Republicans would be doing if as attorney general, Eric Holder, had tried to do the same thing to protect Obama. Actually, we don’t have to imagine, we already know.
In 2011, Republican Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-CA , subpoenaed the Justice Department for documents related to an operation known as “Fast and Furious.” At Holder’s urging, Obama invoked executive privilege to shield the release of those documents to the committee. Republicans responded by holding Holder in contempt of Congress.
Imagine what House Republicans would be doing if as attorney general, Eric Holder, had tried to do the same thing to protect Obama.
Speaking at the contempt proceedings, committee member Jim Jordan — the same Jim Jordan who is now the lead-Republican on the panel — asked , “How can you ignore the facts when you don’t get the facts?” After successfully voting to hold the attorney general in contempt, House Republicans filed a lawsuit in federal court to challenge the use of executive privilege, arguing, ""the Attorney General's conception of the reach of 'Executive privilege,' were it to be accepted, would cripple congressional oversight of Executive branch agencies, to the very great detriment of the Nation and our constitutional structure.""
Judge Amy Berman Jackson, the same judge who presided over Paul Manafort and Roger Stone’s recent legal proceedings, agreed with Congressional Republicans and ordered the Justice Department to produce the documents and records they had subpoenaed.
Related Opinion Mueller report's release to AG Barr is the end of the beginning for Trump, not the beginning of the end When you re-examine the rhetoric and substance that oversight Republicans used to successfully challenge the president’s use of privilege in 2012, it feels eerily if accidentally prescient.
And if past truly is prologue, the next sequence of events will mirror what we saw earlier this decade. Barr will release his redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress. Chairman Nadler will follow-through with his promise to subpoena the un-redacted version of the report with supporting documents and evidence. The attorney general will refuse to cooperate with the subpoena. Congressional Democrats will hold Barr in contempt of Congress and file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the Trump administration’s use of executive privilege. If the court rules the same way that Judge Jackson did, the White House could appeal the ruling and bring matter to the feet of the United States Supreme Court.
All the while, the American people will be left wondering what is in the full report that has Donald Trump so scared that he would be willing to engage in such a long and public battle for something that the majority of Americans believe they have a right to review.

What is a CT scan? What the test detects and how it works,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-ct-scan-what-test-detects-how-it-works-n988601,"If your doctor orders a CT scan, here is what you need to know: What is a CT scan? A computed tomography scan — also called a CT or CAT scan — is an imaging test that lets doctors see inside a person’s body. As a patient lies still on a table, special X-ray equipment takes pictures from different angles to create cross-sections of the body. The “slices” can be looked at individually or together to create 3-D views of tissues and organs, according to the National Cancer Institute . The test is painless and usually done on an outpatient basis.
In some cases, a contrast dye is injected into the patient’s vein or a patient is asked to drink it to help parts of the body show up more clearly on the image. The test lasts anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the size of the area being scanned.
What can CT scans detect? They can detect the following conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health :
broken bones cancers blood clots signs of heart disease internal bleeding Can you detect cancer with a CT scan? Yes. The scan can help doctors find cancer and show a tumor’s shape, size, location and the blood vessels that feed it, according to the American Cancer Society .
Doctors can compare CT scans done over time to see how a tumor is changing in response to treatment.
How harmful is a CT scan? The radiation exposure from a CT scan is higher than that from standard X-ray procedures, but the increase in cancer risk from one scan is small, the National Cancer Institute noted.
The main worry is how the exposure adds up over time. Some experts believe CT scans are not necessary in many cases and needlessly expose patients to radiation. Multiple CT scans in kids have been linked to later cancer risk .
What is difference between a CT scan and an MRI? Both are painless imaging tests, but a CT scan uses X-rays, while MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses a large magnet and radio waves to look inside the body, so there’s no exposure to radiation.
An MRI is particularly good at showing soft tissues of the body, including the brain, spinal cord, muscles, ligaments and tendons."
How to watch Israel's Beresheet spacecraft attempt moon landing,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/how-watch-israel-s-beresheet-spacecraft-attempt-moon-landing-ncna993436,"An Israeli spacecraft attempting to make history by becoming the first privately funded craft to land on the moon suffered an engine malfunction during its descent and crashed onto the lunar surface. The Beresheet spacecraft was to have touched down on the moon between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. ET. But officials with SpaceIL, the Israeli nonprofit organization behind the mission, reported that they lost contact with the four-legged spacecraft as it neared the surface of the moon.
""We didn't make it,"" SpaceIL chairman Morris Kahn said during a livestream of the landing attempt. ""The achievement to getting to where we got is really tremendous.""

If successful, Israel would have become the fourth nation — after the United States, Russia and China — to land a spacecraft on the moon.
Beresheet — the name means “genesis” in Hebrew — performed a final pre-landing maneuver Wednesday, firing its engines for 32 seconds to bring it within 10 miles of the lunar surface.
During the landing attempt, the four-legged craft, about the size of a washing machine, beamed back a ""selfie"" from an altitude of about 14 miles above the lunar surface. Against a backdrop of the moon's pockmarked surface, the photo showed one of the space probe's legs and a view of a plaque emblazoned with Israel's flag and the words ""Small country, big dreams.""

The Beresheet lander was designed to snap photos of its surroundings on the moon and use its onboard magnetometer to measure the magnetism of lunar rocks.
Beresheet launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Feb. 21 and slipped into lunar orbit April 4 .
The Beresheet mission was originally developed as part of the Google Lunar X Prize competition, which challenged privately funded teams to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon, drive it at least 500 meters and send photos and videos back to Earth.
The contest ended last year with no one winning the $20 million grand prize . But on Thursday, Peter Diamandis, the founder and executive chairman of the Culver City, California-based X Prize Foundation, which sponsored the competition, said the organization will award $1 million to SpaceIL to continue its work.

Pence: Buttigieg is attacking my faith to stand out in 2020 crowd - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/pence-buttigieg-attacking-my-faith-stand-out-2020-crowd-n993376,"Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday that Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and upstart presidential hopeful, had criticized his positions on gay marriage and LGBTQ equality to stand out among a crowded Democratic primary field. “Well, look, I worked very closely with Mayor Pete when I was governor of the state of Indiana,"" Pence said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” ""We had a great working relationship, and he said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally, and he knows better, he knows me.”
“I get it, you know, it's like, you have 19 people running for president on that side, and part of it is sliding off to the left,“ he added. “They're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they can be. I get that.”
2020 Vision: Mayor Pete takes aim at VP Pence at LGBTQ forum April 8, 2019 01:27 Mayor Pete calls out hypocrisy, denouncing Pence's stance on homosexuality April 8, 2019 09:14 Pence was asked in the CNBC interview about the landmark Supreme Court decision in 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide and whether he had “accepted it’s law.”
The vice president replied that he “fully implemented that decision in the law” as governor, “but … I have my Christian values.”
“My family and I have a view of marriage that's informed by our faith, and we stand by that,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean that we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view. One of the great things about this country is our freedom of religion and the freedom of conscience, and we'll continue to cherish our values, cherish our views.”
Pence has opposed gay rights policies such as legalizing same-sex marriage, and in 2015, as Indiana governor, he signed the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which critics have said gives businesses the right to refuse service to gay people.
As governor, Pence praised Buttigieg after he came out publicly in 2015. But Buttigeig, who is in a same-sex marriage, has criticized the vice president in recent weeks as attention on his long-shot presidential bid has escalated.
In a speech before an audience of LGBTQ rights supporters on Sunday, Buttigieg said, “If being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade.”
“And that’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator,” Buttigieg said.
He added that his marriage to his husband “has made me a better man, and yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God.”
Buttigieg reprised his critique on Monday.
“Just because you are LGBTQ doesn't mean it's OK to discriminate against you,” he told reporters in Las Vegas. “I think most people get that, I think most Christians get that, and it's time for us to move on toward a more inclusive and more humane vision of faith than what this vice president represents.""

Australian rugby star Israel Folau faces sack over homophobic social post,www.nbcnews.com,Reuters,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/rugby-australia-set-sack-star-player-over-homophobic-social-post-n993371,"Rugby Australia said on Thursday it would terminate the contract of Israel Folau, the country's best-known and best-paid player, if he cannot offer a good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to ""hell"" if they did not ""repent"". The 30-year-old fullback, a fundamentalist Christian, posted similar comments last year but escaped sanction and signed a new deal with RA through 2022 in February.
That multi-million dollar contract looks certain to be torn up unless Folau can convince RA and the New South Wales Waratahs that there are ""compelling mitigating factors"" for sharing the post.
A statement from RA Chief Executive Raelene Castle and her Waratahs equivalent Andrew Hore said they had made repeated attempts to contact Folau since he posted the comments on Wednesday.
Related NBC OUT Arizona moves to repeal law banning promotion of 'homosexual life-style' in school ""Whilst Israel is entitled to his religious beliefs, the way in which he has expressed these beliefs is inconsistent with the values of the sport,"" the statement added.
""Israel has failed to understand that the expectation of him as a Rugby Australia and NSW Waratahs employee is that he cannot share material on social media that condemns, vilifies or discriminates against people on the basis of their sexuality.
""As a code we have made it clear to Israel formally and repeatedly that any social media posts or commentary that is in any way disrespectful to people because of their sexuality will result in disciplinary action.
""In the absence of compelling mitigating factors, it is our intention to terminate his contract.""
The unprecedented move will throw into disarray Australia coach Michael Cheika's plans for the Rugby World Cup in Japan later this year.
Folau has been all but ever-present in the Wallabies number 15 shirt since switching to rugby union from Australian Rules in 2013 and scoring two tries on his test debut against the British and Irish Lions.
He has scored 35 more tries in 72 tests since and helped Australia to the final of the 2015 World Cup in England, where they were beaten by New Zealand.
An elusive and dangerous runner, Folau helped the Waratahs to the Super Rugby title in 2014 and only last weekend became the highest career try-scorer in the competition when he crossed for his 60th five-pointer.
Folau has had previous lucrative offers to play in Europe and Japan but his stated desire to remain in Australia makes his most likely destination a move back to rugby league, a code in which he represented Australia at the start of his career.
'A REAL STAB IN THE HEART' Raised as a Mormon, Folau moved to a pentecostal church in 2011 and has made no secret of his religious beliefs since.
He was a critic of the proposal to make same-sex marriage legal in Australia before it was passed in 2017 and last year took to Instagram with his first post about gay people being destined for hell.
Castle said then that RA ""accepted"" his position that he had just been expressing his beliefs and had not intended to ""upset people intentionally or bring hurt to the game"".
Wednesday's post, which took the form of a meme based on verses from the bible, said gay people and others he perceived to be ""living in sin,"" including ""drunks"", ""idolaters"" and ""atheists"", would be condemned to hell.
Related NBC OUT Help us nominate our 2019 NBC Out #Pride50 honorees The post drew widespread condemnation from around the world with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern among those criticizing Folau for the way he was using ""his platform.""
Japan rugby captain Michael Leitch posted a video in Instagram in which he said Folau's comments were ""wrong on so many levels"" and could be ""a real stab in the heart"" for people struggling with their mental health.
The RA and Waratahs statement on Thursday said they wanted rugby to be a sport that unites and welcomes people regardless of their ""race, gender, religion or sexuality.""
""No language that isolates, divides or insults people based on any of those factors can be tolerated,"" it said.
Pride in Sport, which works to make Australian sport inclusive for LGBTQ people, later welcomed the decisive action taken by Castle and Hore.
""This unprecedented course of action sends a strong message of what will and will not be tolerated in rugby – and they've made it clear that homophobia and transphobia has no place in the sport,"" said Andrew Purchas, founder of the Sydney Convicts, Australia's first and most successful gay rugby club.

Navy to allow off-duty trans sailors to dress in accordance with gender identity,www.nbcnews.com,Nico Lang,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/navy-allow-duty-trans-sailors-dress-accordance-gender-identity-n993406,"The Navy will allow transgender sailors to dress in accordance with their gender identity while off duty. The dress code clarification comes as the military prepares to roll out a controversial new policy on Friday restricting the service of openly transgender people. The Navy will permit all transgender service members to “live socially” as “their preferred gender” when they are not in uniform, a U.S. Navy spokesperson confirmed to NBC News. The dress code guidance was sent in an administrative message to troops earlier this week.
""There is no policy that prohibits the ability of a Service Member to express themselves off-duty in their preferred gender,"" the message states. ""Appropriate civilian attire, as outlined in the uniform regulations, will not be determined based on gender.""
Related NBC OUT 'Nothing short of a ban': Transgender troops, advocates react to new military policy The new trans military policy set to be unveiled Friday — which was ignited by a series of surprise tweets sent by President Donald Trump in July 2017 — allows currently serving transgender troops and service members who have already received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to continue to serve in their preferred gender. But after April 12, when the policy goes into effect, no one with gender dysphoria who is taking hormones or has transitioned will be allowed to enlist.
Further, any currently serving troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria after April 12 will have to serve in their sex as assigned at birth and will be barred from taking hormones or getting gender-affirming surgery.
Those guidelines, which the Defense Department insists do not constitute a ban, were announced after the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia allowed the Trump administration to enforce the policy while it is being challenged in court. LGBTQ advocacy organizations, including the National Center for Lesbian Rights and GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD), have filed lawsuits to overturn the “trans military ban,” calling it “discriminatory.”
As those cases make their way through the court system, LGBTQ groups working on behalf of transgender members of the military credited the Navy for taking a “step forward” to affirm the lived identities of trans sailors.
Bree Fram, communications director at the LGBTQ military advocacy group SPART*A , said the organization is “thrilled.”
“The Navy is taking care of its transgender service members by giving them the option to dress and express themselves as they choose,” Fram told NBC News.
Melody Stachour, a trans woman who serves as a chief petty officer in the Navy Reserve, said the newly announced guidelines are “an attempt to support trans service members to the maximum extent possible, even while they are constrained by the overall policy that they are governed by.”
“This is not just good for the sailors, but also for the Navy,” she said, “as it allows them to retain sailors who are doing an excellent job … while acknowledging that they are still required to follow the orders given by their seniors.”
Others expressed reservation about the Navy guidelines on gender expression, saying it could put transgender people at risk of being discharged from the military.
Related NBC OUT Arizona moves to repeal law banning promotion of 'homosexual life-style' in school Although the Department of Defense has maintained the restrictions on trans troops are not a “ban,” a report released by the Palm Center, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, claims the new regulations make it almost impossible for transgender people to serve. According to the report, both “gender dysphoria” and a “medically advised need for any treatment for gender dysphoria” constitute a “basis for separation from military service.”
Aaron Belkin, the Palm Center’s director, claims trans individuals could be reported and sent to a mental health counselor for a “gender dysphoria” diagnosis if they’re seen dressed according to their gender identity off base.
“Once the information gets out that someone is trans, then the service member has no more control over it,” he tells NBC News.
Belkin compares it to life under “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Enacted in 1994, the Clinton-era policy allowed gay, lesbian and bisexual people to enlist in the military as long as they didn’t disclose their sexual orientation. However, closeted troops faced being outed by fellow service members, former partners and even family members.
“In practice, the permission to live a private life was complete B.S.” Belkin added. “It existed on paper, and it's the same mechanism here.”
Andy Blevins, who was discharged under “don’t ask, don’t tell,” said the predicament that faces transgender people serving in the Navy or other branches of the military is actually “worse” than “don’t ask, don’t tell” — which was lifted in 2011.
“We entered the service knowing we had to hide a crucial aspect of our identity,” said Blevins, who now serves as the executive director of OutServe-SLDN, an LGBTQ military advocacy group. “These service members were told nearly three years ago: ‘We see you, we hear you, we’re going to support you, we affirm your identity. Be true to yourself, because that’s what’s needed.’ And then the rug was pulled out from underneath them.”
While Blevins is “grateful” to the Navy for making a gesture to support trans troops, he said the “lack of clarity” surrounding its dress code policies is the issue. As of now, no one knows if it could be used to target transgender service members down the line.
Related NBC OUT Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, Pences trade barbs The guidelines issued earlier this week by the military branch advised all members of the military to “continue to treat each other with dignity and respect,” saying there would be “zero tolerance for harassment, hazing or bullying of any service member in any form.”
As the restrictions on trans service go into effect, National Center for Lesbian Rights Legal Director Shannon Minter says these unanswered questions only “underscore the serious harms” of singling out members of an already vulnerable population.
“Gender is a fundamental aspect of a person’s identity,” Minter explained. “It cannot be turned on and off like a switch, and the very notion of requiring a non-transgender person to do so would be immediately recognized as cruel and unworkable. It is equally cruel and unworkable for transgender people.”
According to the Palm Center and OutServe-SLDN, no other branches of the military have announced similar policies regarding the attire of off-duty trans troops.

Puerto Rico's power authority nears $9 billion debt restructuring deal,www.nbcnews.com,Reuters,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/puerto-rico-s-power-authority-nears-9-billion-debt-restructuring-n993446,"An agreement in principle between a bond insurer and the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), disclosed in a late Tuesday court filing, moves a deal to restructure about $9 billion of the bankrupt utility’s debt closer to the finish line. Assured Guaranty Corp is in the “final stages” of documenting and executing an agreement with PREPA and a group of bondholders, who reached a deal with the utility in July covering more than $3 billion of debt, according to a motion filed in U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico.
The so-called definitive restructuring support agreement (RSA) would cover about half of PREPA’s outstanding bonds.
“If finalized, the definitive RSA will provide PREPA and its creditors with a path toward restructuring billions of dollars in legacy debt and would facilitate PREPA’s transformation process and development of a plan of adjustment,” the filing stated.
A PREPA deal has lagged court-approved settlements with the bankrupt U.S. commonwealth’s Government Development Bank and Sales Tax Financing Corporation (COFINA) creditors. The island has been in federal court since May 2017 in an attempt to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
The latest motion in PREPA’s bankruptcy asks for a two-week extension in the schedule for litigation filed in October by Assured and two other bond insurers seeking a court-appointed receiver for PREPA. Assured contemplates withdrawing from the receiver lawsuit, which is currently set for a May 15 court hearing, if a settlement is approved, the filing said.

Holden Matthews faces charges of three counts of simple arson on religious buildings. If convicted he could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison per charge, State Fire Marshal Butch Browning said at a news conference. Authorities said they are working to determine if racial bias was a motivation in the alleged crimes, and if the suspect was influenced by a subgenre of music linked to white nationalist ideology. Matthew's father, Roy Matthews, is a St. Landry Parish sheriff's deputy, and was unaware of his son's alleged involvement and was not personally part of the investigation, Sheriff Bobby Guidroz told reporters. All three churches that were burned were in St. Landry Parish, north of Lafayette. ""That's tough,"" Guidroz said after Roy Matthews learned of his son's alleged connection. ""That tells you, and it should tell the country, no matter who you are, there are consequences."" Holden Matthews, who was taken into custody late Wednesday without incident, has a possible connection with ""black metal"" music and ""its associated history with church burnings in other parts of the world,"" the fire marshal said.

Officials said that Matthews didn't have a criminal history, but they had arrested him in an effort to avert ""what could have been other crimes."" An investigator said in an affidavit filed in the case that a charred gas can was found near the origin of one of the fires and that the same type of gas can, as well as automotive shop towels and a lighter, were purchased at a Walmart late on March 25 less than three hours before the first church fire was reported. Matthews was driving a pickup truck, and surveillance video from one of the fires showed a truck of that type, according to the affidavit. In addition, cellphone tower data revealed GPS coordinates put a device with a cellphone number known to belong to Matthews in the surrounding area of all three fires, the affidavit said. An attorney whom a court clerk said was listed as representing Matthews did not immediately return a phone message Thursday. FBI agents said that the agency still needed to ""gather all the facts"" to determine if the blazes were a ""bias-related event.""

The churches were empty at the time of the fires, officials said, and each suffered considerable damage, forcing worshippers to hold Sunday services at other locations. (A fourth fire last weekend at a church with a predominantly white congregation in another parish 200 miles away doesn't appear to be connected, authorities said Thursday.) St. Landry Parish, with a population of more than 83,000, is about 56 percent white and 42 percent black, census data shows . Guidroz said police in the parish worked with pastors at other black churches to step up safety patrols. The fires have been unnerving for churchgoers in the region because they conjure up images of attacks on black churches in the South during the civil rights movement, and more recently, during the 1990s.

""Just to be clear, not all black metal has to do with far-right politics, and a lot of people outwardly reject (black metal musician Varg Vikernes) for his far-right politics,"" Hankes said. Vikernes, who had been a member of the Norwegian band Mayhem, was convicted in the 1990s of manslaughter in the stabbing death of a fellow bandmate and for arson attacks on three churches in Norway, The Associated Press reported. He was later paroled and living in France, where officials in 2013 dropped terror charges against him but still wanted to take him to court for alleged anti-Semitic and xenophobic messages. The SPLC said Matthews appeared to comment on Facebook about a 2018 movie, ""Lords of Chaos,"" based on Vikernes and his band. The movie drew debate about its accuracy. In the post, Matthews said he enjoyed the film. Hankes said there was nothing associated with Matthews' account that immediately suggested he had any greater connection with Vikernes. Dana Nichols, the special agent in charge with the ATF's New Orleans division, said Thursday that there is ""zero tolerance"" for these attacks, particularly on houses of worship.

SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 3:35 PM GMT / Updated April 12, 2019, 12:04 PM GMT By Associated Press Retired Pope Benedict XVI has published an analysis on the Catholic Church's clergy sex abuse scandal, blaming it on the sexual revolution of the 1960s and church laws that protected priests. The essay immediately raised eyebrows, seeming to interfere with or even contradict Pope Francis' own efforts to confront one of the most critical issues facing the church. One church historian called Benedict's essay ""catastrophically irresponsible,"" because it conflicted with Francis' own efforts to lead the church out of the sex abuse crisis. Benedict in 2013 had said he planned to retire to a lifetime of penance and prayer and would leave Francis to guide the church. Pope Francis' new Vatican law on reporting sex abuse allegations March 29, 2019 01:01 U.S. church analysts said the essay, published in the German monthly Klerusblatt, was both flawed in content and problematic on universal church level, exacerbating existing divisions in the church that have emerged between supporters of Francis and Catholics nostalgic for Benedict's doctrine-minded papacy. In his introduction, Benedict said both the Vatican secretary of state and Francis had given him permission to publish it. The Vatican press office confirmed it was written by Benedict. In the essay, Benedict traced the start of the clergy abuse crisis to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, citing the appearance of sex in films in his native Bavaria. He also blamed the crisis on failures of moral theology in that era, as well as church laws that gave undue protection to accused priests. Benedict wrote that during the 1980s and 1990s, ""the right to a defense (for priests) was so broad as to make a conviction nearly impossible."" As Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict reformed those laws in 2001 to make it easier to remove priests who abused children. Benedict took a hard line against clerical sex abuse as the Vatican's conservative doctrine chief, and later as pope, defrocking hundreds of priests accused of raping and molesting children. ""Why did pedophilia reach such proportions? Ultimately, the reason is the absence of God,"" he wrote. Francis has blamed the scandal on a clerical culture in the church that raises priests above the laity. Villanova University theologian Massimo Faggioli said the essay was thin in its analysis by effectively attributing the scandal to the sexual revolution. He said it omitted key cases, such as the Legion of Christ founder's pedophilia, which began well before then. ""If a pope emeritus decides to stay silent, it's one thing and can be defended. But speaking and telling a tiny part and a very personal version of the story, it's hard to defend,"" he said on twitter. ""Everything we know in the global history of the Catholic abuse crisis makes Benedict XVI's take published yesterday very thin or worse: a caricature of what happened during in the Catholic Church during the post-Vatican II period - with all its ingenuities and some tragic mistakes,"" he tweeted. Church historian Christopher Bellitto questioned if Benedict, who turns 92 next week, was being manipulated by others. He said the essay undermined Francis' own efforts to steer the church out of the crisis. Bellitto said the essay omitted the critical conclusions that arose from the pope's February sex abuse summit in Rome, including that ""abusers were priests along the ideological spectrum, that the abuse predated the 1960s, that it is a global and not simply Western problem, that homosexuality is not the issue in pedophilia."" ""It is catastrophically irresponsible, because it creates a counter-narrative to how Francis is trying to move ahead based on the 2019 summit,"" he said. ""The essay essentially ignores what we learned there."" David Gibson at Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture agreed with that assessment. ""For a retired pope to try to undo the critical work of a sitting pope and on such a crucial issue seems ... bad,"" he said. "
Air National Guard members' pensions delayed for months due to backlog,www.nbcnews.com,Phil McCausland,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/air-national-guard-members-pensions-delayed-months-due-backlog-n993221,"Several retired members of the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve say they have struggled to receive their pensions, a problem that military officials attribute to a beleaguered workforce and technology that one former general called ""shamefully outdated."" Some retirees say they have waited months to receive the financial support and health benefits owed to them after 20 years of service. NBC News spoke with half a dozen former Air National Guard and Reserve members who in the last two years have waited weeks or months past the date of when they expected to receive their pension. Some eventually received their money but had to endure months of no income while waiting.
In interviews, the retired service members say they are forced to endlessly navigate automated phone systems for hours and receive generic email responses when they request specific details about the state of their pensions.
“I worked so hard. I showed up. I did the best job I could for my patients in Air Force hospitals, and this was a benefit that I never thought I would have to beg and plead and fight to get,” said retired Lt. Col. Jackie Brich, who received her benefits and back pay more than six months after they were due.
Pilots with the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 128th Air Refueling Wing in Milwaukee pilot a KC-135 Stratotanker transporting airmen from Truax Field, Wisconsin, to Ramstein Air Base, Germany, Aug. 29, 2018. Airman 1st Class Cameron Lewis / U.S. Air National Guard Current and former military officials describe a system that is susceptible to a pileup of requests because of technology issues and overworked employees.
Retired Brig. Gen. Jeff Cashman, who served as the director of the National Guard Manpower, Personnel and Services until 2017, told NBC News that the technology element remains a major hurdle, calling it a “handicap” and “shamefully outdated.”
The service is regularly forced to turn to manpower surges, with the latest happening in February, Cashman explained, to “treat the worst of the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause.”
“The Air Force is so crippled by bad pay and personnel IT systems that we have abandoned excellence and resigned ourselves to aspirational goals of ‘only 1 or 2 months late,’” Cashman said.
The Air Reserve Personnel Center, which manages the records of Air National Guard and Reserve service members and handles retirement requests, said in a news release last week that it allocated additional manpower in February “to reduce the inventory of retirement applications for Guard and Reserve members turning 60 years of age.”
Maj. Joseph Simms, a spokesman for the personnel center, told NBC News that the agency had to bring in 12 additional technicians to work on a backlog of 2,200 applications that stretched from August 2018 to February. More than half of the 33 technicians worked six 10-hour days each week of February to catch up.
Related News Veterans haven't received GI Bill benefits for months due to ongoing IT issues at VA The reason for the backlog, Simms said, is a mix of problems that included a sudden loss of its trained workforce and the agency's need to maintain a call center until August — which it supported since at least 2015.
But Christine Lynn, the center’s deputy director of personnel and total force services, added that the personnel center faces ongoing issues with its Military Personnel Data System, which the Air Force uses to manage its personnel records and to maintain data from a member’s career.
Sometimes technicians simply can’t log in, an issue that can last for days but which the center has little control over because it is a system managed by a separate entity.
“It happens fairly consistently, sadly,” Lynn said.
But she said that after a self-audit in October prompted by the delays, the personnel center has worked to streamline the process by reallocating its workflow and pursue elements of automation, which are currently in their testing phase.
“We feel confident that we are going to be able to provide better service to our customers now,” she said, though noting that they would still face the delays because of the data system.
Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who announced last week that he was running for president, said that his staff had briefed him on the issue and that he hoped to ensure that the Air Force Personnel Center receives a modernized system so that retirement orders can be sent out on time. He said he hopes to push the issue forward in the House Appropriations Committee, on which he serves.

You plan for it and you make sure retirees are getting their payment on time. You hire and fill positions accordingly to make sure that goal is being met.""
Paul Blanzy is one veteran who is still waiting. He served two tours in Afghanistan before he retired from the Air National Guard in 2013 after 30 years in the military. Because of his tours overseas, he is eligible for retirement early — which should have been more than six months ago.
“It’s very frustrating for me that I can’t do anything to help myself or help these other airmen,” Blanzy said. “And it’s really frustrating that our senior leadership aren’t doing their jobs.”
While Blanzy still hasn't received his pension, he said he is now starting to help a friend from his time in the service navigate his own retirement application. The friend’s 60th birthday, when benefits should be disbursed, is in July.
“I’m going to try and walk him through that system, so he gets started well ahead of time,” Blanzy said. “I just hope they’ll do a better job for him.”

SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 3:05 PM GMT By Minyvonne Burke An Alabama college gymnast who broke both her legs during a competition over the weekend lashed out at people sharing and tagging her in videos of her fall. ""I am asking you to please stop,"" Auburn University senior Samantha Cerio posted on Twitter Wednesday. ""Going through the pain and seeing my knees bent unnaturally in real life was horrible enough, but to continue to see it from videos/pictures because some people feel entitled to repost it is not okay."" Cerio was trying to execute a handspring double front at Friday's NCAA Regional Semifinal competition in Louisiana when she landed at an awkward angle on the mat causing her to fall backwards on the ground. She was taken off the floor in a stretcher. Her coach Jeff Graba said the college gymnast dislocated both knees and tore multiple ligaments in her legs. She underwent a two-and-a-half hour surgery earlier this week and is recovering in the hospital. ""I have family, friends, and teammates who do not need to see me getting injured over and over again,"" Cerio said on Twitter. ""My pain is not your entertainment."" Graba told NBC's ""Today"" show that doctors expect Cerio to fully recover and the gymnast plans on walking down the aisle in two months at her wedding. ""She's a trouper. She's one of the strongest people I've ever met, I knew that beforehand and she's just confirmed it,"" he said. ""She'll get through this. Days after her devastating injury, Cerio posted on Instagram that she was leaving the sport. Graba said that she was always planning to move on and did not do it because of her injury. ""After 18 years I am hanging up my grips and leaving the chalk behind,"" Cerio wrote Sunday. ""I couldn’t be prouder of the person that gymnastics has made me to become. It’s taught me hard work, humility, integrity, and dedication, just to name a few. It’s given me challenges and roadblocks that I would have never imagined that has tested who I am as a person."" Cerio, who is studying aerospace engineering, graduates in May and has a job lined up with Boeing where she plans to work on rockets as a structural design analysis engineer. Minyvonne Burke "
'How about paying your taxes?': Walmart responds to Amazon's challenge over pay,www.nbcnews.com,"Lauren Thomas, CNBC",04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/how-about-paying-your-taxes-walmart-responds-amazon-s-challenge-n993461,"Amazon and Walmart are in war over worker pay — and now corporate taxes. After Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos on Thursday issued a challenge to other retailers, not naming which ones specifically, to match Amazon’s pay and benefits, Walmart snapped right back.
“Today I challenge our top retail competitors (you know who you are!) to match our employee benefits and our $15 minimum wage. Do it! Better yet, go to $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us. It’s a kind of competition that will benefit everyone,” Bezos wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.
Hey retail competitors out there (you know who you are 😉) how about paying your taxes? https://t.co/Rmh3VZOHsG @JeffBezos
— Dan Bartlett (@danbartlett6) April 11, 2019 “Hey retail competitors out there (you know who you are) how about paying your taxes?” tweeted Walmart’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Dan Bartlett on Thursday morning, sharing an article about Amazon paying $0 in federal taxes on more than $11 billion in profits last year.
A representative from Amazon wasn’t immediately able to comment on Bartlett’s tweet.
Walmart’s minimum wage of $11 an hour, set in January 2018, is still below Amazon’s, which was hiked to $15 in November. But Walmart has said its average worker earns $17.55 an hour with wages and benefits.
As for Bartlett’s argument: Amazon's low tax bill mainly stemmed from the Republican tax cuts of 2017, carryforward losses from years when the company was not profitable, tax credits for massive investments in R&D, and stock-based employee compensation."

In an address on state television, Defence Minister Awad Mohamed Ahmed Ibn Auf said Bashir, 75, was under arrest in a ""safe place"" and a military council was now running the country.

Sudanese sources told Reuters that Bashir was at the presidential residence under ""heavy guard"". A son of Sadiq al-Mahdi, the head of the country's main opposition Umma Party, told al-Hadath TV that Bashir was being held with ""a number of leaders of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood group"".
Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague and is facing an arrest warrant over allegations of genocide in Sudan’s Darfur region during an insurgency that began in 2003 and led to death of an estimated 300,000 people.

Adawi is said to be favored by regional neighbors at odds with Bashir over his Islamist leanings.
Thousands of people flocked to an anti-government protest outside the defense ministry on Thursday, while huge crowds took to the streets in central Khartoum, dancing and shouting anti-Bashir slogans. Protesters chanted: ""It has fallen, we won.""

Pelosi: Trump is 'very different...not only unique...what would be the word'?,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/pelosi-trump-very-different-not-only-unique-what-would-be-n993401,"WASHINGTON — One day last week, amid spiraling fallout over special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dialed up the president and requested a meeting. She talked to about working together on an infrastructure package.
It was the first phone call between the two since the testy days of the government shutdown earlier this year, and it seemed productive. They are planning to meet, she told The Associated Press in a Wednesday interview.
""It's so very self-evident that the president is very different from every other person that anybody ever served with,"" Pelosi said in the AP interview Wednesday.
""He is not only unique, he's ... what would be the word?"" she said, trailing off. ""To be president of the United States is to have a very special personality. But there are shared values about commitment to our Constitution, to the vision of our founders to the Constitution of the United States. I don't see those features yet in this president.""
So goes the relationship between Washington's two power centers — one in the White House, where Trump is slapping almost hourly at the investigations into his administration and running headlong into a climactic moment of his presidency, the other on Capitol Hill, where Pelosi is deliberately steering her gavel toward her party's goals.
Pelosi: Trump is on 'viscous campaign' to take away health care April 2, 2019 01:30 As the two cross the 100-day mark of the era of divided government, theirs is a relationship like almost none other in Washington.
Even as Trump derides Democrats as ""unhinged"" and claims they are a party taken over by ""socialists,"" he pulls his punches with Pelosi. And while Pelosi criticizes Trump as ""unfit"" for office — and hasn't fully closed the door on impeachment — she wants to work with him on shared priorities.
She says 80 percent of their conversations, including the talk last Thursday, are about infrastructure. They're trying, she said, to find areas of ""common ground.""
Launching an infrastructure investment program is the kind of big bipartisan undertaking that seems all but impossible in times like these.
The Trump administration's ""infrastructure week"" became a punchline around Washington when it fizzled amid the White House's often shifting priorities. Trump promised on election night a $1 trillion investment in new roads and other projects but has never come close to achieving it. Democrats scoff at the $200 billion requests he's made in his budget proposals as meager. Pelosi called it a ""nonstarter.""
But infrastructure — like the effort on lowering prescription drug costs — is the kind of initiative that could benefit both of them as they head toward the 2020 campaign season. They could change the subject from the ongoing investigations that pose risks for both parties, and they could show voters they can deliver with building projects that improve communities and create jobs even at a time of divided government, with Democrats controlling the House and Republicans controlling the Senate.
""We want dirt to fly,"" Pelosi said.
After her talks with Trump, Pelosi thinks the president may be willing to do more than he's put on the table. Trump's latest budget proposed $200 billion in federal dollars that could be leveraged with private capital to cover the difference.
""I don't think the president is wedded to that proposal,"" she said. ""It's too small.""
Most of their phone call last week revolved around infrastructure, and she said the intention is to ""get a dollar figure"" as a starting point for the discussions.
Asked about infrastructure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also left open the possibility of a fresh bipartisan effort.
""We've all been talking about infrastructure, including the president, for a couple of years now,"" McConnell told Fox News on Wednesday. ""We need some straight talk from both sides on how we're going to pay for it.""
The day after Trump and Pelosi spoke, Trump went to California to visit the southern border, where he is trying to build a long-promised border wall with Mexico after Democrats thwarted his demand for more wall funds during the shutdown.
That afternoon, House Democrats filed a lawsuit challenging Trump's national emergency declaration, which he invoked to circumvent Congress and to use military construction money to pay for the border wall.

Lawmakers call for immediate extradition of Assange,www.nbcnews.com,Rebecca Shabad,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-call-immediate-extradition-assange-n993466,"WASHINGTON — Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle applauded the arrest Thursday in London of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and called for his immediate extradition to the United States. The lawmakers said that Assange, who was charged by the Justice Department with computer hacking, had acted as an agent of the Russian government and had harmed U.S. national security.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrested in London April 11, 2019 01:57 “He has time after time compromised the national security of allies by publicly releasing classified government documents and confidential materials related to our 2016 presidential election,” said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., in a statement. ""Today this dark chapter hopefully begins to near its end.""
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that whatever Assange’s intentions were when he started WikiLeaks, ""what he’s really become is a direct participant in Russian efforts to undermine the West and a dedicated accomplice in efforts to undermine American security.”
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, told reporters that Assange has effectively been “an agent of the Russian intelligence agencies.” So did Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C. “Under the guise of transparency, Julian Assange and Wikileaks have effectively acted as an arm of the Russian intelligence services for years,"" he said in a statement. ""Mr. Assange engaged in a conspiracy to steal classified information, putting millions of lives at risk all over the world. Hopefully, he will now face justice.""
It was revealed Thursday that Assange was charged with one count of “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer ,” after he was arrested on behalf of a U.S. extradition request. As the head of WikiLeaks, Assange published secret American documents in 2010 that embarrassed the U.S. and other countries. Assange will face extradition hearings on May 2 and June 12. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison.
He had been living as a fugitive for nearly seven years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to the U.S. He was also wanted in Britain for skipping bail in 2012, when he was under investigation in Sweden on charges of sexual assault and rape.
Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., tweeted Thursday that Assange’s arrest was “good news” and that Assange has “long been a wicked tool of Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence services.” Sasse added that Assange should serve the rest of his life in prison.
Speaking to reporters at the Capitol, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said that Assange has “done a lot of harm” to the U.S. and “he should pay for that.”
Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., called on Twitter for “immediate extradition of Assange to the U.S., while Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., noted that the U.S. will likely “have to fight with other countries to get him extradited.”
Asked whether President Donald Trump should have praised Assange when he was running for president in 2016, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday, “That’s up to the president.”
“I have repeatedly condemned the guy,” Graham said of Assange. “He's never been a hero. He released classified information and put our troops in danger, equally important to those who came to our aid, I think, in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said in an interview on MSNBC that there could potentially be more charges against Assange in relation to WikiLeaks' role in the 2016 election and the release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
“That's partly based on what I know from my role on the Intelligence Committee,” Himes said. “My guess is that he understands that he has broken the law, and we may not have heard the last of the charges that could be leveled in this indictment that was unsealed today.”

Navy to drop charges against former USS Fitzgerald officers in deadly destroyer collision,www.nbcnews.com,Elisha Fieldstadt,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/navy-drop-charges-against-former-uss-fitzgerald-officers-deadly-destroyer-n993346,"Charges are expected to be dropped against two former USS Fitzgerald officers accused of negligence in the 2017 destroyer collision that killed seven sailors, a U.S. Navy statement said Wednesday. Former USS Fitzgerald commanding officer Cmdr. Bryce Benson and former crew member Lt. Natalie Combs will receive letters of censure, but charges against them will be withdrawn and dismissed, the Navy statement said. Letters of censure acknowledge acts of wrongdoing but have no legal ramifications.
""This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers,"" the Navy's statement said. ""Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received non-judicial punishment,""
The USS Fitzgerald collided with a Philippine-flagged merchant ship on June 17, 2017, in Japanese waters about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, where the United States has a naval base. The bodies of the seven U.S. sailors were found in flooded berthing compartments of the destroyer the next day.
In 2018, Benson pleaded not guilty to two counts of dereliction of duty through neglect and improper hazarding a vessel through negligence, according to court documents.
The documents said Benson ""negligently failed to ensure the safe navigation of the said vessel, as it was his duty to do so as commanding officer."" Benson also faced a charge of negligent homicide, but it was dropped last year.
Combs was charged with negligent dereliction of duty resulting in death and negligent hazarding of a vessel in the collision.
Charging documents said Combs ""should have known of her duties"" and ""was derelict in the performance of those duties.""
Wednesday's statement from the Navy said the ""comprehensive program to improve Navy readiness and training, to do everything possible to ensure that accidents like this will not recur, remains on track.""
""The Navy continues to strive to achieve and maintain a climate of operational excellence,"" the statement said.

In addition to Wonder, singers Marsha Ambrosius, Anthony Hamilton and Jhené Aiko performed at the memorial service, which included a video presentation, tributes by his children and family, including his longtime girlfriend Lauren London, and scripture readings. Other celebrities that took part in the service included media mogul Karen Civil and radio host Big Boy. Rapper YG and producer DJ Mustard were listed as pallbearers, along with Hussle’s brother Samiel Asghedom. Ambrosius became emotional before singing Mariah Carey's ""Fly Like A Bird."" Hamilton gave a touching rendition of his song, ""Do You Feel Me,"" and Aiko performed her song, ""Eternal Sunshine."" Wonder also performed ""Rocket Love"" from his 1980 album “Hotter Than July."" Civil read the heartfelt message that Obama wrote honoring Hussle. ""I’d never met Nipsey Hussle, but I’d heard some of his music through my daughters, and after his passing, I had the chance to learn more about his transformation and his community work,"" Obama said in the letter. Lauren London's son, Kameron Carter, told the crowd about a dream he had days after Hussle died where the rapper told him that heaven was like ""paradise."" Hussle's daughter, Emani Asghedom, became visibly emotional on stage and did not want to talk. Several of Hussle's family members got up to talk, including the rapper's brother, Samiel. ""I want everybody to know Nip put his heart and soul on Crenshaw and Slauson,"" he said. ""Bro stayed and he died on Crenshaw and Slauson."" Nipsey Hussle's brother eulogizes him April 11, 2019 01:12 He added: ""Everything he said in the music was who he was. I hope that he knows that we're all proud of him."" London read a text message she sent to the rapper in January thanking him for making her into ""more of a woman."" ""You're still the coolest guy in the world to me,"" the message read. ""I love you so much. Unconditionally. My truth is this. I'm never going to give up on you. My loyalty and devotion is to you."" The actress, who shares son Kross Asghedom with the rapper, said she has ""never felt this pain before."" “My pain is for my 2-year-old that probably won’t remember how much his dad loved him,"" London said. She also included Los Angeles residents in her tribute, telling the crowd: ""We lost an incredible soul. We lost someone incredibly rare."" "
NASA twins study shows how spaceflight affects astronauts' bodies,www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/nasa-twins-study-shows-how-spaceflight-affects-astronauts-bodies-ncna993536,"WASHINGTON — From his eyes to his immune system, astronaut Scott Kelly’s body sometimes reacted strangely to nearly a year in orbit, at least compared to his Earth-bound identical twin — but newly published research shows nothing that would cancel even longer space treks, like to Mars. The good news: Kelly largely bounced back after returning home, say scientists who released final results from NASA’s “twins study,” a never-before opportunity to track the biological consequences of spaceflight in genetic doubles.
It marks “the dawn of human genomics in space,” said Dr. Andrew Feinberg of Johns Hopkins University. He led one of 10 teams of researchers that scrutinized the twins’ health down to the molecular level before, during and after Kelly’s 340-day stay at the International Space Station.
More importantly, the study “represents more than one small step for mankind” by pointing out potential risks of longer-duration spaceflight that need study in more astronauts, said Markus Lobrich of Germany’s Darmstadt University and Penny Jeggo of the University of Sussex, who weren’t involved in the work.
The findings were published in Friday’s edition of the journal Science, on some notable space anniversaries — when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space in 1961, and the first launch of the space shuttle in 1981.
KEY FINDINGS NASA already knew some of the toll of space travel, such as bone loss that requires exercise to counter. This time, NASA-funded scientists looked for a gamut of physiologic and genomic changes that Scott Kelly experienced in space, comparing them to his DNA double on the ground, former astronaut Mark Kelly. Some results had been reported in February.
Related Space Space 'Space genes' — how an astronaut is now different from his twin brother Possibly the weirdest finding had to do with something called telomeres, the protective ends of chromosomes. Those tips gradually shorten as we get older, and are thought to be linked to age-related diseases including some cancers.
But in space, Scott Kelly’s telomeres got longer. “We were surprised,” said Colorado State University telomere expert Susan Bailey. She can’t explain it although it doesn’t mean Kelly got younger. Back on Earth, his telomeres mostly returned to preflight average although he did have more short telomeres than before.
Next, Kelly’s DNA wasn’t mutated in space but the activity of many of his genes — how they switch on and off — did change, especially in the last half of the voyage, which ended in March 2016.
Immune system genes especially were affected, putting it “almost on high alert as a way to try and understand this new environment,” said study co-author Christopher Mason, a Weill Cornell Medicine geneticist in New York.
Again, most gene expression returned to normal back home, but some of the immune-related genes were hyperactive six months later.
Other findings:
—Some changes in the structure of Kelly’s eye and thickening of his retina suggested that, like about 40% of astronauts, he experienced symptoms of “spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome.” It may be caused by fluids shifting in the absence of gravity.
—He experienced some chromosomal instability that might reflect radiation exposure in space.
—A flu shot given in space worked as well as one on Earth.
—Kelly aced cognitive tests in space but slowed down after his return, maybe as more things competed for his attention.
ULTRA LONG-DISTANCE TESTING Researchers needed months’ worth of blood, urine and fecal samples, along with cognitive and physical tests and ultrasound scans. That meant getting creative: Some blood samples required analysis so rapidly that Kelly would time collection so the blood could travel on Russian Soyuz capsules carrying other astronauts back to Earth.
That wouldn’t be an option on a three-year trip to Mars. One of the study’s technological advances: Portable DNA-sequencing equipment that will let astronauts run some of their own genomic analyses on future missions, said Weill Cornell’s Mason.
WHAT’S NEXT? Studying one pair of twins can’t prove risks of spaceflight, researchers cautioned. And longer missions, to the moon or Mars, will mean greater stress and radiation exposure.
Colorado State’s Bailey plans to study 10 additional astronauts on year-long missions, using the twin findings as a road map.
“We need to get outside of low-Earth orbit and we need for the astronauts to spend longer periods of time to really evaluate some of these health effects,” she said.

"Ohio passes 'heartbeat' abortion bill, governor will sign",www.nbcnews.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/ohio-passes-heartbeat-abortion-bill-n993321,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — A bill imposing one of the most stringent abortion restrictions in the nation was signed into law in Ohio. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed the heartbeat bill Thursday, breaking with his predecessor, Republican John Kasich, who had vetoed the measure twice.
Ohio's closely divided politics had slowed the progress of the bill as it has caught momentum elsewhere, forcing years of debate in the state where the bill originated.
""Victory!"" exclaimed Faith2Action, the Ohio-based anti-abortion group that originated the heartbeat concept in 2010.
Related News Mississippi's new 'heartbeat' law bans most abortions at 6 weeks DeWine's action came a day after the latest version of the bill, which outlaws abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature. Doctors say a fetal heartbeat can be detected using transvaginal ultrasound technology as early as five weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.
Even before the bill was signed, the ACLU of Ohio said it was preparing a constitutional challenge to the law on behalf of Pre-Term Cleveland and three other Ohio abortion clinics.
The legal challenge is what the bill's backers have always wanted. They hope to provoke a legal challenge with the potential to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until viability, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.
""The heartbeat bill is the next incremental step in our strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade,"" said Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis. ""While other states embrace radical legislation to legalize abortion on demand through the ninth month of pregnancy, Ohio has drawn a line and continues to advance protections for unborn babies.""
Kellie Copeland, director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said lawmakers and the governor have plunged the state into ""a dystopian nightmare where people are forced to continue pregnancies regardless of the harm that may come to them or their family.""
Related News Georgia House panel approves anti-abortion 'heartbeat' bill The law makes no exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.
EMILY's List, a national group that supports candidates who favor abortion rights, also decried the Ohio bill, as did the Democratic National Committee.
DNC CEO Seema Nanda called it ""the latest example of how the Trump administration's extremist, anti-women policies have emboldened legislators across the country to attack women's access to health care.""
The latest version of the bill passed out of an Ohio House committee Tuesday. The full House approved it Wednesday and, that same day, the Senate agreed to House changes and sent it to DeWine.
During Wednesday's House debate, State Rep. Michele Lepore-Hagan, a Democrat, shed tears as she talked about the harm the bill could do.
""I'm concerned that our kids are going to leave, that we're going to lose a large amount of young people who don't want to live in an oppressive atmosphere,"" she said.
State Rep. Candice Keller, a Middletown Republican, called the legislation ""the most compassionate bill we've ever passed.""
Prohibiting abortions at the first detectable heartbeat means prohibiting virtually all abortions, said Dr. Michael Cackovic, a specialist in maternal fetal medicine at Ohio State University Medical Center. He said current standard practice, which involves transvaginal ultrasound, can reliably detect a heartbeat five to six weeks into pregnancy.
""Essentially, that's three to four weeks after conception, or one to two weeks after a missed period,"" he said."

Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee chairman, sent a letter dated Wednesday to Attorney General William Barr instructing him to make John Gore, a principal deputy assistant attorney general, available to answer questions related to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross' decision to add a citizenship question to the census.
""The committee expects Mr. Gore to testify in accordance with the Committee's lawful subpoena and the Committee's rules,"" Cummings wrote in the letter shared with NBC News on Thursday by a committee spokesperson. ""If Mr. Gore fails to comply with the subpoena, the Committee will consider him to be in contempt of Congress.""
Gore, who was slated to testify Thursday, did not appear. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Rep. AOC questions Secretary Ross: 'Why are we violating the law?' March 15, 2019 02:59 Cummings' move comes weeks before the Supreme Court is set to consider whether the Trump administration's addition of the citizenship question violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. Three federal judges have already ruled that Ross' actions were unconstitutional and violated federal law.
Ross, whose agency oversees the Census Bureau, faced tough questioning last month from Democrats during a committee hearing about whether he lied to Congress about his decision to add the question.
Gore emerged as a key figure during the hearing. Ross claimed he decided to add the question in December 2017 after he learned that the Justice Department might want it included, a rationale Democrats rejected.
The committee voted earlier this month, 23-14, to issue a subpoena to compel Gore to testify and the Trump administration to provide additional information about the citizenship question.
Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a letter earlier this week to the committee that he would not make Gore available unless a department representative accompanied him. However, committee rules prohibit Justice Department lawyers from attending. Boyd, however, claimed the rule ""would unconstitutionally infringe upon the prerogatives of the executive branch.""

Bernie Sanders wants incarcerated people to vote. Here's why he's right.,www.nbcnews.com,Chandra Bozelko,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/bernie-sanders-wants-incarcerated-people-vote-here-s-why-he-ncna993476,"Bernie Sanders' suggestion that all states should allow incarcerated people to vote , instead of re-enfranchising them one-by-one after incarceration, is a constructive way of bypassing the voting rights debate and getting right down to the idea that one remains a citizen even after being convicted of a crime. (Elizabeth Warren wasn’t opposed to the idea a week before.) Disenfranchising people is a form of “civil death” — stripping live people of civil rights, almost as if they had died, just because they’ve been convicted of a crime. Certain rights have been restored in some states for prisoners, making their conditions more like a civil vegetative state; the right to marry, the right to free speech, the right to access the court and the right to religious freedom have been granted, sometimes under court order and occasionally with exceptions . The most basic right in a democracy though — and the one that could bring them back to civil life— is the right to vote, and it remains elusive for prisoners in 48 states (as well as for many formerly incarcerated people in 35 states ).
Currently, only two states - Vermont and Maine - allow prisoners to vote from behind bars, regardless of their conviction status. But Utah allowed it until 1998 and Massachusetts prisoners could vote until 2000 , when the state rescinded that right after a few of them formed a PAC and stated their intention to both vote and influence local elections. In other words, the disenfranchisement of people upon conviction is hardly a universal or required practice.
 Jeffrey Wright: Incarcerated people have a lot to teach us about preventing crime and violence. I listened, and you can, too. And, the U.S. Census Bureau already counts inmates as potential voters in the districts in which their prisons stand (though not in their hometowns), even when they can’t vote. This practice of prison gerrymandering has attracted some attention recently because, as advocates like the Prison Policy Initiative have argued, it violates the “ one person-one vote ” rule by artificially expanding the populations of prison-adjacent towns where prisoners won't live after release, and thus artificially undercounting their home districts.
Those who argue against felony re-enfranchisement and in-prison voting often rely on the theory that a prison constituency would automatically be a Democratic constituency. That’s not necessarily the case: The prisoner who started the PAC in Massachusetts used his vote , while he had it, to help elect President George W. Bush, and inmates in Puerto Rico — 6,195 of them — voted in 2016’s Republican primary (constituting one-sixth of the voters).
But perhaps more importantly than the fairness argument is that allowing people in prison to vote and enter national political conversations might be the best way to eliminate the enduring, expensive problem of dangerous prison conditions. That inmates have so little political power has allowed them to be victimized and killed in poorly managed facilities with virtually no political repercussions for those who have designed, funded and essentially administered the current system.
Missy Shea of the Vermont Secretary of State's office helps inmates at the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility through the voter registration process in Rutland, Vermont, on Oct. 2, 2008. Toby Talbot / AP file But if candidates have to vie for prisoners’ votes will humanize them, they'll also have figure them into lawmaking considerations.
This is — or at least should be — of vital consideration to both those invested in prison conditions and anyone with a conscience. Just last week, the Department of Justice delivered a report summarizing a two-year investigation into Alabama prisons that concluded that conditions there are so severe and dangerous that they violate the Eighth Amendment guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. In the report’s preface, investigators describe five stabbings, six beatings and four sexual assaults that happened in Alabama prisons in just one week in September 2017. The rest of the report recounts more knifings, rapes and inmates being tied up for days without anyone noticing. This is just the substantiated accounts from prison records; there’s likely more violence that hasn’t been reported.
It’s not just Alabama. Prisoners lose their lives to abuse and neglect around the country. When violence claimed the life of noted mobster Whitey Bulger at the federal penitentiary in Hazelton, Pennsylvania, it was the third murder in six months at that facility . Seven men were stabbed to death during the April 2018 riot at Lee Correctional Institution in South Carolina . In Texas, 23 people have lost their lives to extreme heat in uncooled prisons since 1998. And, when natural disasters strike a prison, inmates may be left out of evacuation efforts entirely.
Underfunding, ultimately, caused all of these deaths; no one wanted to pay for air conditioning in Texas, and violence explodes into cracks in prison staffing because correction officer vacancies are reaching untenable levels in many states. Saving their lives isn’t a question of ability; it’s a question of priority.
 Reading gives people in prison hope. But some states want to take their books away. Elected officials are the people who can solve these problems. And if this level of regular violence and death beset almost any other population — and certainly a majority white population — politicians would have spent money to stop it already. But, in part because incarcerated people lack political power, many politicians have deemed them expendable.
Perhaps no one lives more subject to the laws of the United States than the American prisoner, and yet he or she has no say in them. Allowing him or her to vote is how we end the dehumanization of incarcerated citizens. Not only will investment of rights resurrect them civilly, prisoners’ participation will ultimately affect policy for the better and make our prisons more humane.

What is the best Stephen King movie? New 'Pet Sematary' revives a classic debate,www.nbcnews.com,Noah Berlatsky,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-best-stephen-king-movie-new-pet-sematary-revives-classic-ncna993361,"With the release of the new “Pet Sematary” film premiering over the past weekend I've been wondering — what is the best Stephen King film adaptation? It's certainly not the new “Pet Sematary” — an enjoyable but innocuous genre exercise which mostly misses the book's emotional weight. Many people would probably vote for Brian De Palma's clinically cruel version of “Carrie,” from 1976. Others might prefer Stanley Kubrick's gleefully manic 1980 “The Shining,” with Jack Nicholson shoving huge chunks of melting scenery into his dribbling maw.
For me though, right now, the King adaptation I'm most attached to is David Cronenberg's 1983 film “The Dead Zone.” It's not the scariest film version of King's work; it certainly doesn't have the jump scares that fill the new “Pet Sematary.” It's not even exactly a horror film. But the movie’s vision of an icy, frightened America feels eerily prescient — as is its offer of a bleak hope, almost indistinguishable from despair.
For me though, right now, the King adaptation I'm most attached to is David Cronenberg's 1983 film “The Dead Zone.”
“The Dead Zone” is about Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken), an English teacher who spends five years in a coma following a car crash. When he wakes up, his fiancé Sarah (Brooke Adams), has married another man. He's also gained disturbing psychic abilities; he can see glimpses of someone's past and future when he holds their hand.
(Spoilers below.)
By this means, Johnny accidentally discovers that populist third-party Senate candidate Greg Stillson is a dangerous religious psychopath, and that he will eventually become president and start a nuclear war. To prevent this outcome, John tries to assassinate Stillson. He misses on the first try, and then Stillson uses Sarah's baby as a human shield to prevent a second attempt. Johnny is shot by a bodyguard, but his psychic powers allow him to see that images of Stillson risking the life of an infant will lead to the candidate's downfall anyway. ""You're finished,"" he tells Stillson, with satisfaction. Then Johnny dies.
More than any other director, Cronenberg captures the cold inevitability of King's world. Christopher Walken is all awkward angles and repressed bitterness as he limps through the frigid Maine landscape. His face is often so clenched it seems like his skull is going to pop through his skin. His gaze is transfixed by a future that slides towards him with the grimly lumbering grace of the tractor trailer that collides with him on the highway.
""Do you know what God did for me?"" Johnny demands, jerking like the words are being pulled from him by some sadistic puppeteer. ""He threw an 18-wheeled truck at me and bounced me into nowhere for five years! When I woke up, my girl was gone, my job was gone, my legs are just about useless... Blessed me? God's been a real sport to me!""
Related Opinion 'Pet Sematary' is best when it explores the destructiveness of male fragility, not zombies King's novels are filled with gods who “sport” with humans; fate in his books is often an actively malevolent horror. “Pet Sematary” just about robs its characters of free will. They're doomed as soon as they buy their new house, which rests too close to the evil, stony graveyard — old neighbors, cats, and tractor-trailers on the road near their home are all collaborating in a conspiracy of evil.
Similarly, ""11/22/63"" is a time travel story about the immutability of history, with fate reaching down to crush anyone who tries to alter its slow, grinding procession. In “The Stand” and “It,” the protagonists are pushed about by shadowy forces, some supposedly good and some supposedly evil, but all moving humans here and there like pieces on a dark gameboard. King's characters are like the contestants in “The Long Walk:” They put one foot in front of the other on a preordained trail, marching towards their own demise.
King's characters are like the contestants in “The Long Walk:” They put one foot in front of the other on a preordained trail, marching towards their own demise.
Johnny certainly fits that mold. As soon as he appears on screen, enthusiastically quoting Edgar Allen Poe's “The Raven,” you know he's doomed — a pinned insect, thrashing slowly until the movie's runtime ticks down. Johnny's visions are little movies within movies; he watches children burn, or drown, or the world end in fire. ""I stood there and did nothing!"" he shouts after seeing a murder in a vision. Johnny stares frozen, like the audience, as those sharp scissors come out and down, and everyone dies.
But in “The Dead Zone,” unlike in many of King's other works, the sense of futility is at least partially an illusion. The future Johnny sees isn't set in stone. He can change it if he's willing to act.
Doing so comes at some risk. Jonny's psychic abilities give him terrible headaches and leach his life away. And there are more mundane costs as well. He is shot while foiling a murderer; he loses a job because he's so insistent that one of his students stay home from an ice hockey game. Defeating Stillson costs him his life. Moving the ugly, dead weight of fate requires not just vision but sacrifice. It's a cold, unpleasant business. But it's possible.
Related Opinion 'Shazam!' is a superhero movie trying to reclaim the genre's exuberant potential Given our current situation, even “The Dead Zone” feels overly optimistic. Greg Stillson is a religious maniac, but his brand of populism isn't curdled in bigotry, like that of the current GOP. Assassination attempts rarely solve political problems as neatly as they do in the film. And of course, Stillson's career disintegrates after he threatens the life of a baby on camera. Maybe Trump would finally be done if he did such a thing, but I'm not as sure as I'd like to be.
But the greatness of “The Dead Zone” is less about the specifics of the plot than it is about the way it treats mourning as a door, rather than as a blank wall. In “Pet Sematary,” the family is buried by their own inescapable sadness. Despair is their fate, and their fate is despair.
Johnny's misery, though, doesn't (just) isolate him. It also helps him see what others need, and how he can help them. We're all born to grieve, which is both a doom and a basis for solidarity. The heart of the dead zone is cold. But it's still a heart.

""I know nothing about WikiLeaks,"" Trump told reporters at the White House, where he met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. ""It’s not my thing. I’ve seen what’s happening with Assange.""
Later Thursday, during a White House event with World War II veterans, Trump said, ""I don’t know much about it.""
Assange was apprehended Thursday morning at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had been granted asylum for nearly seven years before Ecuador allowed British authorities access to take him in.

Trump cited the results of WikiLeaks' efforts attacking Clinton during his 2016 campaign.

""I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 11, 2016. ""She is unfit to run.""
Later that month, at a rally in North Carolina, Trump said, ""we love Wikileaks.""

""We need to make sure that businesses there respect these values."" Supporters of PETA and LGBT rights protest outside of a Chick-fil-A in Hollywood, California, on Aug. 1, 2012. Tibrina Hobson / FilmMagic file April 11, 2019, 6:54 PM GMT / Updated April 11, 2019, 9:48 PM GMT By Janelle Griffith A California city that last year approved the addition of a Chick-fil-A at its local airport now wants to send a message of support to LGBTQ people as the opening date for the fast-food restaurant nears. The San Jose City Council voted 11-0 on Tuesday to hang rainbow flags in support of LGBTQ people and pink, blue and white flags for transgender rights at or near a Chick-fil-A due to open in May at San Jose International Airport. Rosemary Barnes, a spokeswoman for the airport, said it will decide where to place the flags. The council's vote comes as two other cities around the country have blocked Chick-fil-A from opening at their airports over concerns that the restaurant chain has a record of supporting anti-gay organizations. Ken Yeager, the first openly gay elected official in Santa Clara County, told NBC News on Thursday that he submitted the flag idea to the city council at the Tuesday night meeting. ""I made the suggestion to put the flags next to the restaurant, and council members liked that idea but also said that maybe put flags elsewhere, too, like outside,"" Yeager said. San Jose Vice Mayor Charles Jones said the plan is to have a flag or flags near the restaurant and outside of the airport. The city council last year decided to allow a number of restaurants including Chick-fil-A to open in the airport food court, which some council members now say was an oversight. Paul Escobar, president of a nonpartisan LGBTQ political action group in the Bay Area, organized a small protest outside of San Jose City Hall on Tuesday before meeting with council members about his concerns that having a Chick-fil-A at the airport would send the wrong message. “This is public space,"" Escobar said. ""We know that this is a strong and inclusive community. We need to make sure that businesses there respect these values."" Chick-fil-A has been blocked from opening restaurants at two airports in recent weeks — at San Antonio International Airport in Texas and Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York — over what some legislators and city council members have cited as the company's legacy of anti-LGBT behavior. Earlier last month, ThinkProgress published a report based on newly released tax filings that claimed Chick-fil-A donated $1.8 million to anti-LGBTQ groups in 2017, including one that allegedly bars employees from ""homosexual acts."" Chick-fil-A did not immediately return a request for comment from NBC News on the San Jose vote but said last week in a statement that “recent coverage about Chick-fil-A continues to drive an inaccurate narrative about our brand."" The company said it does not ""have a political or social agenda"" and that ""it embraces all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity."" ""We want to make it clear that our sole focus is on providing delicious food and welcoming everyone — not being a part of a national political conversation,"" the company said. Janelle Griffith "
"Trump's sister retires, ending inquiry into judicial ethics complaints",www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-s-sister-retires-ending-inquiry-judicial-ethics-complaints-n993556,"NEW YORK — 's sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes. The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.
A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.
The April 1 order said Barry's voluntary retirement ends the review stemming from claims based on the news article alleging that Barry may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions that occurred mostly in the 1980s and 1990s.
Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.
The order said the complaint process was meant to correct conditions interfering with the ""effective and expeditious"" administration of court business. It said the resignation meant that Barry can no longer perform any judicial duties and thus can no longer be investigated.
Barry didn't respond to an email seeking comment.
The 15,000-word Times report last year said that Trump's father, Fred, transferred ownership of most of his real estate empire to his four living children before he died in the late 1990s.
The Times investigation, based in part on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents including confidential tax returns from the father and his companies, concluded that the value of the properties was vastly understated when they were reported as $41.4 million. It said the properties were later sold over the next decade for over 16 times that amount.
The Times reported Trump's parents transferred over $1 billion to their children. It said that the transfer should have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million, but that the children paid only about $52.2 million.
Trump has called the Times exposé a false ""hit piece.""
Scott Shuchart, an attorney who filed one of the complaints, said he was ""absolutely disappointed"" that Barry was able to end scrutiny of her actions by retiring.
""If the Times story is correct, then she participated in a decades-long multimillion-dollar tax fraud. That should be an impeachable offense. She gets her full salary,"" he said.
""I think it's appalling that we're continuing to pay this criminal and that she now has completely avoided consequence,"" Shuchart added. ""It's ridiculous.""
If members of the family did break any laws, the expiration of a statute of limitations makes a criminal prosecution unlikely, though lawsuits might be possible.
With a recently approved retroactive pay raise for federal appellate judges, Barry will receive $223,700 annually in retirement.
After her brother's election, Barry gave up her court staff and took inactive status in early 2017.
A Republican, she was nominated for a judgeship by President Ronald Reagan and was elevated to the circuit court by President Bill Clinton.

"Andrew Yang's campaign and supporters struggle to push away extremists, leaked chats show",www.nbcnews.com,Ben Collins,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/andrew-yang-s-campaign-supporters-struggle-push-away-extremist-support-n993241,"Andrew Yang, a long-shot candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, has won some attention in the national political debate in recent months thanks in part to a fervent online support network called the “Yang Gang” that pushes support of the candidate on several social media platforms. But the campaign’s internet-driven momentum and Yang’s signature policy position — that the U.S. government should provide a universal basic income of $1,000 per month to every American adult — have also attracted some of the web’s most politically extreme fringe groups , often alt-right users from the fringe internet forum 4chan who express racist views. Yang has publicly disavowed this support, leaving staffers and supporters to play a delicate game of embracing some online promoters while distancing themselves from others.
The tension between Yang and some of his supporters has been on display in online chat rooms, one of which has been used by the campaign to organize online support. The chat rooms are hosted on Discord, an internet startup that has grown quickly in recent years and become a popular destination for internet subcultures.
In one room, moderators that run the chat have had to post rules like “no slurs, no racism. I see it, you get one warning then you're gone.” According to transcripts acquired by NBC News from a member of the chat room, the discussions have included debates on the merits of support from the alt-right and whether sentences like “jews aren't humans,” which was posted and deleted from one chat, are allowed in any way among supporters.
Yang, 44, a first-generation American born in upstate New York, announced his candidacy in late 2017, far earlier than most other candidates. And though he had far less name recognition than other candidates, his popularity on the internet — driven in part by an appearance on the podcast of Joe Rogan , who is particularly popular on Reddit and 4chan — has given his campaign a significant boost. Rogan is a comedian and mixed-martial-arts commentator with strong libertarian leanings who supported Gary Johnson for president in 2016.
Found this on the Yang subreddit. Could someone explain to me why Trump fans would turn into Yang fans? pic.twitter.com/zqZVNPReiz
— JD-800 💽 (@thejd800) March 7, 2019 While Yang’s politics don’t mirror those of the internet’s fringe, his basic income policy and efforts to find common ground with figures like Rogan have given him a dose of internet street cred. The one thing about Yang that does appear to resonate uniformly is his signature policy position — a universal basic income of $1,000 per month given to every American adult.
Many memes offer Yang as an alternative to President Donald Trump because of his basic income plan, offering a kind of internet-friendly nihilism that free money overshadows any of the troll-friendly politics of the 2016 election.
“You can’t give them an inch.” The internet’s embrace of Yang has drawn comparisons from experts and internet denizens to the online support that Trump received in the run-up to the 2016 election, who point to the emergence of Yang-based memes, which are usually altered pictures with political messages.
In an interview with NBC News, Yang said he was “frankly mystified” by their support. None of his policies have touched on the issues that galvanized Trump’s online support, such as immigration or nationalism.
“I’ve already disavowed any racist or hateful supporters. I don’t want that support. At the same time, I’m not participating in those channels,” Yang said. “The main thing we can do is highlight how my ideologies are the antithesis of what [those groups] stand for.”
The experience of the Yang campaign highlights the difficulty in trying to differentiate conventional online supporters from extremists.
Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse whose research focuses on internet trolling campaigns and the alt-right, said the campaign by 4chan trolls to hijack Yang’s support base reminds her of Trump’s alt-right support in 2016, except “a little more dangerous.”
“A lot of people think lower-level trolling is fine. The issue is you can’t give them an inch,” said Phillips. “There’s a small number of people who know which buttons to push to slowly radicalize people to these racist messages. And they’ve been pushing the same exact buttons for 10 years.“
Discord Transcripts of a chat on Discord provided to NBC News reveal a complicated picture of supporters trying to expel Yang’s racist supporters without inviting backlash from one of the most toxic parts of the internet, while also coordinating with Yang campaign staffers.
Users in the chat, called “Andrew Yang 2020” — where supporters discussed the anti-Semitic comments and where to draw the line on them — were frequently told to “check in with Carly,” a reference to Yang’s deputy chief of staff Carly Reilly, and many report back with responses from the campaign.
pic.twitter.com/SZCcL63uyl
— YangMemes™ 🐲💰☯️ (@YangMemes) April 8, 2019 Those conversations included everything from recommendations to consolidate two separate “Yang Gang” support groups to getting sign-off on creating “a nationwide Yang Gang for martial artists.” People in the Discord chat said Reilly approved both. Reilly did not directly respond to a request for comment.
The transcripts of the Discord group span from its creation in August 2018 to March, and show members frequently compiling ideas and sending them to members of the campaign — and expressing concern that the chat and Yang’s campaign were beginning to attract far-right internet trolls.
One chat room run by a group called “Fight Club” was designated for fights that may have become too problematic for the general campaign chat. The split proved difficult to moderate, with moderators posting a rule in the general campaign chat: “no slurs, no racism. I see it, you get one warning then you're gone.”
""Kick them out."" Yang campaign director Zach Graumann said that the campaign worked with some individuals in the Discord chats, but that the campaign itself was “not actively in that group at all” outside of Reilly’s account.
Graumann said that he worked with one volunteer who happens to be a frequent poster in Discord on a 3,000-person meet-up in San Francisco, and that the campaign interacts with “a lot of these online forums” but not on a “direct level.”
“What we stand for is very, very clear. There's no signaling; no ulterior motives. We’re trying to make the country whole for your kids and mine,” Graumann said. “We said, ‘If someone is not living up to our values, kick them out.’”
By early March, some users on the campaign-tied Discord began to accept that members of 4chan’s far-right politics board, called /pol/, had infiltrated the group, although reactions to their pervasiveness were mixed. Several users in the chat saw similarities between Trump’s base of internet support in the run-up to the 2016 election and Yang’s emerging support.
“This is exactly what the Trump grassroots looked like in 2016,” wrote a user in one of the chats.
But the Yang campaign’s efforts to keep extremists at bay has shown some signs of success. Transcripts of a separate Discord chat called “Yang Gang 2020” acquired by NBC News show some fringe supporters expressing frustration that the campaign has been unwilling to engage with them, highlighting how the internet is a double-edged sword for the Yang campaign.
“Why is the official Yang discord shooting themselves in the foot?” a user on the 4chan-based board asks. “Don’t they realize we are in control of the memes and they can’t win without us?”

Comey on Barr's 'spying' claim: 'I don't know what the heck he's talking about',www.nbcnews.com,Dartunorro Clark,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/comey-questions-barr-s-spying-claim-i-don-t-know-n993561,"Former FBI Director James Comey said Thursday that he had ""no idea"" what Attorney General William Barr meant when he testified that he believed the government spied on 's 2016 campaign. ""I have no idea what he’s talking about, so it's hard for me to comment,"" Comey said in response to a question at the Hewlett Foundation's conference. ""Maybe the only thing I can say generally is — I think that his career has earned him the presumption that he will be one of the rare Cabinet members who will stand up for things like truth and facts, and institutional values.""
He added, ""So I still think he’s entitled to that presumption. Language like this makes it harder, but I still think he’s entitled to that presumption. And because I don’t know what the heck he’s talking about, that’s all I can say.""
At a Senate subcommittee hearing Wednesday, Barr — defending his decision to order a review of the Trump-Russia probe's origins — said government ""spying"" on Trump’s 2016 campaign ""did occur"" and raised questions about inappropriate surveillance and whether the FBI followed its own rules.
'I expected better': Lawmakers react to Barr claiming spying on Trump campaign April 11, 2019 02:42 “For the same reason, we’re worried about foreign influence in elections ... I think spying on a political campaign — it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal,” Barr said when asked why he plans to probe the origins of what would become special counsel Robert Mueller's almost two-year Russia investigation.
He later added, ""I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now, I do have some questions about it. I have concerns about various aspects of it.""
Barr added that he wasn't launching an investigation of the FBI, but said, ""I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon."" He did not elaborate on who he believes failed and how.
Until Trump fired him, Comey was leading the investigation into Russian election interference and any possible Trump campaign involvement. Mueller, a former FBI director, was appointed special counsel May 17, 2017 — eight days after Comey's removal.
Trump on Thursday agreed with Barr's assessment.
""I think what he said was absolutely true, there was absolutely spying into my campaign,"" Trump said when asked if he was pleased with Barr's statement at the congressional hearing the day before. ""I'll go a step further; in my opinion, it was illegal spying, unprecedented spying and something that should never be allowed to happen in our country again.""
Trump on Wednesday blasted the Russia probe as “an attempted coup” against his presidency after Barr said in a letter to Congress last month that Mueller found no collusion between the president's campaign and Russia. Trump said the probe was “started illegally” and that “every single thing about it” was “crooked"" — a claim that echoed his past allegations about the investigation.

Lucky Lee's and the long history of 'excessive' Chinese food,www.nbcnews.com,Charles Lam,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/lucky-lee-s-long-history-excessive-chinese-food-n993451,"Lucky Lee’s in New York City has been open for less than a week, but the restaurant — which serves what it calls “healthified” Chinese American food — has become the target of ridicule, with some calling the way the restaurant markets itself racist. Food publication Eater reported this week that the restaurant used what it called “clean” recipes lacking gluten, refined sugar and other ingredients, and owner Arielle Haspel, who is not Chinese, told the publication that the restaurant avoided MSG because some “people claim to have certain reactions” to it, though she acknowledged that there is little scientific evidence to support the claims.
Critics on social media took issue with the way the restaurant marketed itself, saying it made it seem like all Chinese food was unhealthy and played on racist beliefs about the cuisine. Some also noted that the “Lee” in Lucky Lee’s referred to Haspel’s husband, who is not Chinese, and took issue at a restaurant attempting to capitalize on Chinese food while being owned by non-Chinese people.
Reached by email, Haspel declined to comment. In a social media post, the restaurant attempted to clarify its position.
“Some of your reactions made it clear to us that there are cultural sensitivities related to our Lucky Lee’s concept. We promise you to always listen and reflect accordingly,” the restaurant wrote in part on Instagram . “Chinese cuisine is incredibly diverse and comes in many different flavors (usually delicious in our opinion) and health benefits.""
The restaurant also noted that Haspel and her husband, who are both Jewish American, grew up eating Chinese food regularly.
“Similar to many other Jewish New Yorkers' diets, bagels, pastrami sandwiches and yes, American Chinese food, were big and very happy parts of their childhoods,” the post read. “We love American Chinese food and at Lucky Lee's it is our intention to celebrate it everyday and serve great food.”
Chinese food has historically dealt with suspicion attributed in part to perceived “excessive” cooking practices.
Related News 'Dirty Chinese Restaurant' game, criticized for racism, will not be released In a 2009 paper published in the research journal Social History of Medicine, historian Ian Mosby examined the “Chinese restaurant syndrome,” which was first formally described in the late 1960s and came about after eating at Chinese restaurants.
The effects attributed to the syndrome could range from mild headaches, numbness and general weakness among other symptoms and were popularly attributed to MSG.
But, Mosby found, much of the popular and scientific discourse around the syndrome and its cause was affected by popular racist beliefs about Chinese cooking as “exotic,” “bizarre” and “excessive.”
“Because Chinese food reflected certain longstanding fears and curiosities about an exoticised ‘orient’ in the American popular consciousness, the assumption that the use of MSG in Chinese food was somehow less safe than when used in other food products went largely unchallenged in most of the scientific and medical literature examining the condition,” Mosby wrote.
Writing in Eater , Los Angeles-based food journalist Esther Tseng connected Lucky Lee’s to other recent cases of non-Chinese chefs opening Chinese restaurants , including Andrew Zimmern, who apologized last year for the way he promoted his new restaurant, Lucky Cricket .
Related News Andrew Zimmern apologizes after criticized for 'offensive' comments about Chinese restaurants Those restaurateurs made similar mistakes, Tseng noted, including not understanding the historical context around Chinese food, making excuses, and failing to apologize sincerely.
Speaking to NBC News last year, Krishnendu Ray, an associate professor of food studies at New York University, aligned with Tseng’s arguments, noting that popular attitudes in the United States toward minority cuisines tended to shift from ""disdain and disgust"" to a search for authenticity.
“My argument isn’t that one can only cook the kind of food that aligns with his or her bloodlines or upbringing,” Tseng wrote earlier this week. “The point is — and always was — to respect the origins of the food, as well as the journey it took to get there and to do due diligence to educate oneself, listen, and learn about it.""

Not only did he just announce he will be adapting the Broadway musical “The Prom” as a movie for Netflix, but he also told Variety that he’s holding fundraisers for presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. “I’m having a benefit for Kamala Harris at my house on Friday in LA,” he told Variety on Tuesday night while hosting a special performance of “The Prom” to raise money for Hetrick Martin, GLAAD, and the Trevor Project. “And I’m having a benefit for Pete [Buttigieg] in June.”
Related NBC OUT Creator of gay Broadway musical, 'The Prom,' invites Mike Pence to the show He’s been particularly struck by Buttigieg’s reception as the first openly gay contender for the presidency. “I always make a joke that I’m running for gay president, so I’m thrilled,” he said, laughing. “I think the party and the voters will say who’s the best, but my job is to support, and I believe in both those candidates. In a dream world, they’d unite. I think that’d be a great ticket.”
Murphy said he’ll be turning “The Prom” into “a huge Netflix movie event” slated for release next September, in the hopes of “changing hearts, minds, and votes” leading up to the 2020 election.
Like the musical’s young heroine, Murphy grew up in Indiana and was barred from taking his boyfriend to prom. “I went with my best female friend, and as a protest I wore six-inch yellow platform boots as a tribute to Bananarama, so I got a little radical renegade-ness in,” he told Variety. “But I was talking to the producer [Bill Damaschke] after the show, and I said, ‘I wish there had been something like this for me when I was that age so that I didn’t feel so alone.’”

“We’ll go to the prom now!” the “Pose” star replied, laughing. He later told Variety that the exchange wasn’t far off from his own experience as a teenager. “I took a nice Jewish girl to the prom, Alexandra Berger. We met in first period of senior year, and on day two, she asked me to the prom,” he said, grinning at the memory. “She was like, ‘Yeah, let’s just do that together.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, girl, yes we should.’ It was fun!” Berger knew he was gay, though not everyone did. “After the prom, we went back to her house and fell asleep in her bed together, and her mother freaked out,” he recalled. “She was like, ‘Mom, what do you think is gonna happen?’” The two have stayed in touch ever since. “She lives in Brooklyn with triplets. I’ve got her number right now!”

I owed the IRS after making this tax mistake in college,www.nbcnews.com,"Jessica Bursztynsky, CNBC",04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/i-owed-irs-after-making-tax-mistake-college-ncna993501,"I’ve been filing taxes since I was in high school. But during my junior year in college in the fall of 2017, I received something strange in the mail: a 1099-MISC form , a tax document that details payments made to independent contractors.
This slip of paper broke out the details on the $1,500 I earned during an internship at a local newspaper in Champaign, Illinois, that summer.
The IRS also had a surprise in store when I filed during the spring of 2018: a tax bill of nearly $200.
It was a tough personal finance lesson, and I’m probably not the first to learn it.
Paying taxes for the first time can seem complicated. It can seem like a high pressure event.
Sean Stein Smith AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS’ FINANCIAL LITERACY COMMISSION
College students nabbing their first gigs as interns or seasonal workers likely don’t know that the IRS needs to take its cut of their earnings.
If student workers aren’t planning for taxes, they’re also more likely to be unprepared when the taxman sends them a bill. This is especially the case if they are paid in one lump sum with no taxes withheld.
“For a college sophomore or a college senior, having these conversations about money can be uncomfortable,” said Sean Stein Smith, a CPA and member of the American Institute of CPAs’ Financial Literacy Commission.
Although awkward, it’s important to start now in order to save yourself the stress later on.
‘Pretty crushing’ Kini Allen posted on Twitter about her son having to pay taxes for an internship required by his college.
Allen said her son, who has worked part-time jobs before, was focused on getting an interesting internship that paid and fulfilled his graduation requirement.
When it came time to file taxes this February, Allen said the results were “pretty crushing.”
My kid took a partially paid internship (one that was REQUIRED by his school) over the summer. He was paid for some hours and unpaid for the bulk of his time there. And now he owes money on his taxes. I can not believe this. I now think internships are stupid and a scam.
— Kini (@kinilei1) February 13, 2019 “They either didn’t fully explain the implications or he didn’t know enough to understand them,” she said.
“He’s a bright kid but wouldn’t have known to ask if he’d be paid as independent contractor,” Allen said. “Or if they mentioned that he’d get a 1099, he wouldn’t know to ask.”
W-2 vs. 1099 The amount of tax you’ll pay on your income will depend on whether you’re working as an independent contractor or as an employee.
Employees, who have annual wages and taxes withheld, are responsible for a 7.65% payroll tax to fund Social Security and Medicare.
Employers kick in another 7.65% to cover their share.
Independent contractors are responsible for self-employment taxes, which add up to 15.3%.
This tax has two parts: 12.4% goes to Social Security and 2.9% goes toward Medicare.
Workers also have different ways to pay these taxes, based on their classification.
For instance, employers are responsible for withholding taxes from their employees’ wages. This way, workers pay their income and payroll taxes over the course of the year.
On the other hand, independent contractors generally pay estimated taxes every quarter. There is an exception for self-employed people who will owe only a small amount to the IRS.
“Generally speaking, individuals who expect to owe less than $1,000 in taxes after taking into account federal income tax are exempt from the quarterly income tax requirement,” Smith said.
As for international students who come to the U.S. for school, their student visa will allow them to spend substantial time stateside without being subject to tax on their worldwide earnings, according to Katelynn Minott, a CPA with BrightTax.
However, because they might have a part-time job as a student, that income is considered U.S.-sourced and would be subject to taxes, she said.
Do I have to file? Whether you are required to submit a tax return depends on your filing status and your gross income .
Single filers who are under 65 must file a 2018 return if their gross income was at least $12,000. The income threshold is a little higher — $13,600 — for singles who are 65 and up.
Married couples who file jointly are required to submit a 2018 return if their gross income was at least $24,000.
If one spouse is at least 65, that minimum income threshold goes up to $25,300. The number is even higher if both are 65 and up: $26,600.
Related Good Cents Good Cents Don't fall for this trick question — get smarter about your money Finally, single dependents who are under 65 and aren’t blind are required to submit a 2018 tax return if they had unearned income (taxable interest and capital gains, for instance) over $1,050, or if their earned income (salaries, wages and taxable scholarships and fellowships) exceeded $12,000.

Media for Medical / UIG via Getty Images Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 11:33 PM GMT / Source: Reuters By Reuters Pregnant women are more likely to have complications during labor and cesarean deliveries than during vaginal births, and a new study offers fresh evidence that older mothers are most at risk. Rates of cesarean deliveries, or C-sections, have risen in the developed world to more than 20 percent of births, even though the World Health Organization recommends this surgery only for the roughly 10 to 15 percent of cases when the health of the mother or baby is in danger. While C-sections can be life-saving, the procedures carry risks like infection, excessive bleeding, damage to reproductive organs and blood clots. For the current study, researchers wanted to get a clearer picture of how often complications might result from the surgery versus from underlying medical problems that might have caused mothers to get these operations. To do this, they examined data on 1,444 women who experienced severe complications after delivery that were unrelated to pre-existing health problems. They also looked at a comparison group of 3,464 women who didn't have complications. Women who had C-sections were 80 percent more likely to have complications than those who delivered vaginally, researchers report in the journal CMAJ. And women over age 35 who had C-sections were almost three times more likely to have severe complications. ""Overall, delivery is safe,"" senior study author Dr. Catherine Deneux-Tharaux of INSERM in Paris said by email. ""However, in a minority of cases, severe complications can occur in the mother during or soon after the delivery. This happens in about 1.5 percent of deliveries and the main cause is major hemorrhage."" As women age, the uterine muscle loses its ability to contract efficiently, and this can contribute to heavy bleeding after C-sections among older women, Deneux-Tharaux said. ""The physiological stop in bleeding after birth involves a contraction of the uterus; that might be reduced in older women,"" Deneux-Tharaux said. About 85 percent of the complications involved bleeding after delivery. Roughly 36 percent of the women who had severe complications delivered by C-section, compared with 18 percent of the mothers who didn't have complications. Women of all ages had an increased risk of complications with C-sections that were performed after mothers went into labor, a decision that is often made because of medical issues that arise for women or for their babies. Mothers under 25 years old who had C-sections done after they started labor were 60 percent more likely to have complications than their counterparts who had a vaginal delivery. Pregnant women 35 or older who had C-sections after they went into labor were four times more likely to have complications than mothers over 35 who had vaginal births. For C-sections scheduled before women went into labor, however, only the oldest women in the study had an increased risk of complications. Mothers 35 and older who had C-sections without first going into labor were five times more likely to have severe complications than mothers who had vaginal births. The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how C-sections might cause complications or to determine how the timing of these surgeries relative to the start of labor might impact the risk. The researchers also acknowledge that they could not account for every circumstance when a pre-existing problem or complication might have been the reason a C-section was performed. Even so, the results should give women another reason to be cautious about scheduling a C-section unless they're certain it's necessary, said Laura Schummers, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who wasn't involved in the study. ""The risks of cesarean delivery accumulate over a woman's lifetime, with a first cesarean increasing risks in subsequent pregnancies, increasing likelihood of a second C-section, and increasing complications in that second cesarean,"" Schummers said by email. ""As more women delay childbearing to age 35 or beyond, this study underscores the importance of judicious C-section decision-making, particularly for women in this age group who may go on to have additional pregnancies.""

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 10:39 PM GMT / Updated April 11, 2019, 11:08 PM GMT By Frank Thorp V and Rebecca Shabad WASHINGTON — Herman Cain, who President Donald Trump has been considering for a nomination to the Federal Reserve board , does not appear to have enough support to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Assuming all 47 Senate Democrats were to vote against Cain, who has yet to be nominated, the four Republicans have already come out against his potential nomination would translate into 51 “no” votes stacked up against him ahead of any confirmation hearings. Trump: I've told my folks Herman Cain is 'the man' for Fed seat April 4, 2019 00:31 The four Republicans who have expressed opposition to the 2012 GOP presidential candidate include Sens. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, and according to multiple news outlets, Cory Gardner of Colorado. “I would prefer not to have to vote on him,” Cramer told NBC News. “We could find somebody that would go through the process much easier than Herman Cain.” Spokeswomen for both Murkowski and Romney said they would not support Cain’s nomination, if Trump were to select him. “I feel that we can’t turn the Federal Reserve into a more partisan entity,” Romney told NBC News. “That would be the wrong course.” Cain is the former head of the Godfather’s Pizza chain and ran an successful bid for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, dropping out of the race ultimately due to sexual harassment allegations against him , which he has denied. He previously served on the board of directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in 1992, later serving as its chairman. Asked about Cain Wednesday, Trump said, “I like Herman Cain. Herman is a wonderful man. A supporter of mine for a long he ran a good campaign. It's up to Herman. He already sat on one of the fed boards. He is somebody I like a lot. As to how he is doing in the process, that I don't know. You go through a process.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was noncommittal earlier this week on Cain’s possible nomination, as well as the nomination of Stephen Moore to the Federal Reserve Board. “We're going to look at whoever the president sends up, it's his choice to decide, and once he makes a nomination we'll take a look at it,” he said. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said Thursday at its annual retreat in Leesburg, Virginia that Cain is “unqualified” and said he wasn’t sure if Trump’s nominations represent “reality or a Saturday Night Live skit.

"Kentucky congressman's genius rep takes a hit after he challenges John Kerry's ivy league ""pseudoscience"" degree",www.nbcnews.com,Corky Siemaszko,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kentucky-congressman-s-genius-rep-takes-hit-after-he-challenges-n993646,"This Kentucky congressman has two engineering degrees from MIT, two dozen patents to his name, and was dubbed a “whiz kid” after he developed technology which enabled people to “ interact with computers using their sense of touch.” But Rep. Thomas Massie’s reputation as a genius took a hit Wednesday after he tangled with former Secretary of State John Kerry at a House committee hearing on the dangers of climate change.
Massie apparently thought he could discredit Kerry by getting the former senator to admit that he has — wait for it — a political science degree from Yale University.
“Okay, so it’s not really science,” Massie said. “So I think it’s somewhat appropriate that someone with a pseudoscience degree is here pushing pseudoscience in front of our committee today.”
“Are you serious?” an incredulous Kerry fired back. “Is this really serious? This is really happening here?”
From there, the back-and-forth grew more heated.
“This is just not a serious conversation,” Kerry said.
Massie on Thursday insisted he’d won the debate by getting Kerry to admit “he doesn’t have a science degree.”
When I asked Kerry if he had a science degree, he answered “no” but forgot to turn his microphone on. The left has been using his flub to conceal what this exchange proved which is Kerry admitted he doesn’t have a science degree, even though his degree says “science” https://t.co/ZWqQOOJndA

Watch this for your morning laugh. @RepThomasMassie is apparently serious but this is the dumbest line of questioning in committee this year, and that’s hard to do. pic.twitter.com/QIuaPuzCbA
— Bakari Sellers (@Bakari_Sellers) April 10, 2019 NBC News reached out to Massie on Thursday to see if he has any regrets about his clash with Kerry and to explain how he, a man of science, squares climate change skepticism with the fact that the overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is a real and present danger to the planet. Massie did not return requests for comment.
Also, NBC News had hoped to ask Massie about the Tesla he drives and the fact that he uses, according to his web site , “a combination of solar, geothermal, propane and wood” to power the off-the-grid house he built for himself, his wife and their four children on a cattle farm in Lewis County, Kentucky.
Back in January 2018, Massie posted a video about his quest to give his home a power boost by scavenging a battery from a totaled Tesla.
Bill Aulet, who now directs the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship , was president of SensAble Technologies — the high-tech company Massie and his wife, Rhonda, founded in Woburn, Massachusetts — from 1996 to 2002. He called Massie's duel with Kerry ""classic Thomas.""
“He’s a human troll in the sense that he likes to stir things up,” Aulet told NBC News. “He’s a contrarian and he has his own point of view on things like climate change.”
And contrary to what his critics are saying, Massie is no fool.
“I’m not saying I agree with him,” Aulet said. “But he’s incredibly smart and if you’re going to disagree with him you’re going to have to bring facts. He’s one of those guys who will ask, 'What data do you have on this issue?'”
Massie was born in Huntington, West Virginia, and grew up in the small depressed town of Vanceburg, on the Ohio River in northeastern Kentucky.
The son of a beer distributor, Massie grew up taking things apart, creating contraptions, and competing in science fairs. His high school sweetheart and future wife shared his passion.
By 1989, Massie was at MIT and soon distinguished himself by winning a campus-wide robotics design competition by coming up with a machine that harvested ping-pong balls.
“He was probably the first person from his zip code that ever went to MIT,” Aulet said. “Thomas was not a fish out of water at MIT. He loved it here. This is a place full of people who don’t quite fit in anywhere else.”
Rhonda followed Massie to MIT two years later and together they constructed the early prototypes of The Phantom, a device that an Xconomy profile of the congressman described as able to “simulate being able to touch and manipulate objects in the virtual world with your hand.”
They incorporated their fledgling business in Kentucky while Massie continued coming up with patented technological innovations that found their way into products produced by Google, Microsoft and other companies, according to Xconomy.
At its peak, SensAble had hundreds of customers and employed 60 to 70 people.
But by 2003, the Massies had enough of running the company and living in New England and decided to move back home, where they bought 1,200 acres and started constructing a new life and home.
It was anger over plans to raise property taxes to pay for a federal conservation in the county that launched Massie into politics. In 2010, he rode the tea party wave to win the race to be his conservative Republican county’s top executive.
Backed by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Massie was elected to Congress in 2012 and quickly carved out a reputation as one of its most conservative members. He is in favor of things like eliminating the federal Department of Education and repealing Obamacare. He is pro-gun and anti-abortion.
Aulet, who jokingly referred to himself as a “coastal elite,” said that while he does not agree with Massie on most issues he doesn’t question his sincerity.
“Thomas told me that when he first got to Congress the speaker sent somebody down to sit next to him and get him to change his vote on some issue,” Aulet said. “Thomas told him, ‘What data do you have on this issue? I’m not going to change my vote unless you give me more data.’ He’s a nice guy, but he’s not a go along to get along kind of guy.”

Sterling Van Wagenen, 71, is accused of inappropriately touching a girl on two occasions between 2013 and 2015, according to a probable cause statement filed with the charges on April 4. The alleged abuse occurred in two northern Utah cities when the girl was between the ages of 7 and 9, online court records show. Van Wagenen's attorney, Steven Shapiro, declined to comment. Van Wagenen didn't return an email and phone call. He has not yet entered a plea to one count of felony sexual abuse of a child. Van Wagenen co-founded a Utah film festival that came to be known as Sundance Film Festival with Robert Redford and was the Sundance Institute's founding executive director, according to his biography page on the University of Utah website, where he was a part-time instructor until his recent resignation. Sundance Film Festival officials didn't immediately return an email and phone message seeking comment. His affiliation with the organization ended in 1993 when he left the advisory board, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Van Wagenen, who posted $75,000 bail, is scheduled to be in court on May 2 for a scheduling hearing. The case was reported to police by child protective services after the girl told her parents about the alleged abuse. Executive producer Sterling VanWagenen on March 15, 2015 in Austin, Texas. Dustin Finkelstein / Getty Images for SXSW file Van Wagenen produced the 1985 film, ""The Trip to Bountiful,"" a story of an elderly woman who longs to return to her home that earned the late actress Geraldine Page an Oscar for her starring performance. He also directed the 1992 film ""Alan & Naomi"" about the trauma of the Holocaust on children and was a producer of the 1991 move ""Convicts"" starring Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones. More recently, he was a director of the 2009 documentary called ""Learning from the Light: The Vision of I.M. Pei"" about a well-known architect and an executive director of the 2018 historical tale ""Jane and Emma"" about a black woman's friendship with the wife of Joseph Smith, the founder of The Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints. Van Wagenen resigned from his part-time instructor position at the University of Utah's Film and Media Arts Department on Feb. 15 after being put on administrative leave on Feb. 5, university spokesman Chris Nelson said. He said the university can't provide any more details other than to say he had worked at the university since October 2012. Van Wagenen's resignation came after a man came forward to accuse Van Wagenen of molesting him as a boy in 1993. No charges have been filed in that case, which was made public by a website that serves as a watchdog for The Church of Jesus of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church. The church-owned Brigham Young University in Utah has employed Van Wagenen as an instructor and director of content for its broadcasting arm. University spokeswoman Carri Jenkins didn't immediately return an email and phone message seeking comment. Van Wagenen also periodically worked for the church as a producer and director for many years on a variety of projects, church spokesman Eric Hawkins said. The church wasn't aware of any of Van Wagenen's alleged behaviors until recently and reported them to authorities, Hawkins said. He declined to say if Van Wagenen has been kicked out of the faith, citing church policy to keep personal matters private. The church considers child abuse to be among the most serious sins and that anyone who commits the act should be held accountable, Hawkins said."

Roy Rochlin / Getty Images file Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 11:23 PM UTC By Claire Atkinson Just two days after government hearings on how hate speech proliferates on social media, one of the world’s largest advertisers said it is reviewing how and where it spends its ad dollars. Marc Pritchard, the chief brand officer of P&G, which spends billions of dollars per year on advertising, said Thursday that the continued problems of social media have created the need for change. “Digital media continues to grow exponentially, and with it, a dark side persists,” he said during a speech before about 800 advertising executives who had assembled in Orlando, Florida, for the annual meeting of the Association of National Advertisers, or ANA, a major trade group representing the advertising industry. “Privacy breaches and consumer data misuse keeps occurring,” Pritchard said. “Unacceptable content continues to be available and is still being viewed alongside out brands. Bad actors are finding ways to create divisiveness and social unrest.” Pritchard’s speech adds to growing pressure from politicians, activists and consumer advocates for tech companies to do more to address issues including the spread of hate speech, algorithmic bias and government-backed manipulation. While advertisers have in recent years grown more comfortable criticizing the major tech companies, Pritchard’s words were some of the strongest yet and included a warning that some changes were already underway. “We need to begin charting the course in a different way going forward,” he said, noting that the consumer goods giant was forming “new partnerships with entirely new platforms and media companies that prove from the very start that their content is safe and under their complete control.” P&G was the biggest spender on Facebook in 2018, according to data from marketing analytics company Pathmatics. Moving forward, Pritchard said the firm preferred to spend its ad dollars with those who “enable common sense moderation of comments,” versus, “disproportionately amplifying controversy or worse, hate.” U.S. tech have faced mounting scrutiny — particularly Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube — and rely on advertising for the majority of their revenue. While the companies have faced some small advertiser boycotts in recent years, there have been few signs of a broad pullback by marketers. Raja Rajamannar , chief marketing and communications officer for Mastercard, told NBC News he agreed with Pritchard and that major advertisers bore responsibility for pushing tech companies to change. “We have a significant purchase power as an industry,” Rajamannar, who is also the president of the World Federation of Advertisers, said “The key thing, we have to be able to work to develop with the platforms and keep working towards a solution. This is something we as marketers care about very deeply and if it’s not happening we’ll have to keep relooking at our space.” Bob Liodice, chief executive of ANA, said that companies including P&G are discussing the creation of norms that would hold social media companies to a set of standards around privacy and civility. Another group, the World Federation of Advertisers, a global trade association for advertisers, issued a statement in late March at a global marketer conference calling on members and brands to take action and, “to put pressure on platforms to do more to prevent their services and algorithms from being hijacked by those with malicious intent.” Facebook has made a series of announcements about new programs and changes meant to address the issues on its platform. While the company has at times pushed back against certain critiques, it welcomed Pritchard’s comments. “We applaud and support Marc Pritchard’s sentiments for again making a bold call for our industry to collectively do more for the people we serve,” Carolyn Everson, Facebook’s vice president of global marketing solutions, said in an email. “We continue to invest heavily in the safety and security of our community and are deeply committed to ensuring our platforms are safe for people and safe for brands.” Claire Atkinson"
