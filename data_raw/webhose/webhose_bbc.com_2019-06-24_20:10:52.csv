Tory leadership: Who gets to choose the UK's next prime minister? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48395211,"How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket
Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role.
They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before.
From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs.
Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class.
But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade.
Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector.
Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over £30,000, and one in 20 put it at over £100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties.
On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties.
It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file.
So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male.
Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65.
They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west.
So much for demography and geography. What about ideology?
Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole.
On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. "

German Jews warned not to wear kippahs after rise in anti-Semitism - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48411735,"Berlin anti-Semitic attack caught on video
A sharp increase in the number of anti-Semitic offences was recorded by the German government last year.
Official figures showed 1,646 hate crimes against Jews were committed in 2018 - an increase of 10% on the previous year.
Physical attacks against Jews in Germany also rose in the same period, with 62 violent incidents recorded, up from 37 in 2017.
Speaking to the Handelsblatt newspaper, Justice Minister Katarina Barley said the increase in anti-Semitic crimes was ""shameful for our country"". What did Felix Klein say?
Mr Klein suggested ""the lifting of inhibitions and the uncouthness"" of society could be behind the spike in anti-Semitic crimes.
The internet, social media and ""constant attacks against our culture of remembrance"" may be contributing factors, he said.
He also called for police officers, teachers, and lawyers to receive training to clarify ""what is allowed and what is not"" when ""dealing with anti-Semitism"".
His comments came weeks after Germany's top legal expert on anti-Semitism said the prejudice remained ""deeply rooted"" in German society.
""Anti-Semitism has always been here. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,"" Claudia Vanoni told the AFP news agency. Why is anti-Semitism on the rise?
Jewish groups have warned that a rise in popularity of far-right groups is fostering anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities throughout Europe.
Since 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been the country's main opposition party. AfD is openly against immigration but the party denies holding anti-Semitic views.
However, a number of comments from their politicians, including remarks about the Holocaust, have drawn criticism from Jewish groups and other politicians.
Last year, a survey of thousands of European Jews revealed that many were increasingly worried about anti-Semitism. Related Topics "

Mr O'Neill, who has been in office for seven years, has faced calls for his resignation for weeks over a range of issues.
But after several more defections on Friday he accepted he did not have the support to continue.
Mr O'Neill, 54, said he would hand over office to former PM Sir Julius Chan.
""It is important that we maintain a certain amount of stability. We have heard the calls and we have agreed for a change of government,"" Mr O'Neill told reporters in the capital Port Moresby, according to Papua New Guinea (PNG) broadcaster EMTV.

""I want to thank the Prime Minister Peter O'Neill for all that he has done to bring this country (to where it is) today,"" he told journalists.
""We are not just going to be a caretaker government, we will work. I don't intend to be a lame duck. We will move this country forward.""
However, the opposition said it had the support of enough MPs to form a new government.

Venezuela crisis: Delegates to meet for Norway peace talks - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48412400,"What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? What do we know about the talks?
Norway's foreign ministry released a statement saying the ""main political actors in Venezuela"" would take part in the discussions, as it reiterated its commitment to ""supporting the search for an agreed-upon solution"" to the crisis.
Preliminary discussions, with each side talking separately with Norwegian officials, were held earlier this month.
Mr Guaidó confirmed in a statement that his representatives ""will talk with both the Norwegian government and with representatives of the regime"" in the upcoming discussions.
The opposition delegation will be headed by deputy parliament speaker Stalin Gonzalez and former Caracas area Mayor Gerardo Blyde, both of whom were involved in the initial talks, he said.
Venezuelan Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez and the governor of Miranda province, Hector Rodriguez, are expected to lead the government delegation, after attending the previous round.
Mr Maduro thanked Norway on Twitter for its mediation efforts.
Previous attempts at mediation between the two Venezuelan sides have failed. However, Norway has in the past successfully mediated in the Colombian armed conflict. Do protesters support the talks?
The ruling Socialist Party has publicly endorsed the talks, while Mr Guaidó has appeared more cautious.
Many opposition supporters who have spent months trying to push Mr Maduro from power are against the discussions.
They argue that the president has previously used dialogue as a stalling tactic to remain in power while living standards have declined.
Without directly referencing the Norway talks, Mr Guaidó told supporters on Saturday that the opposition would not repeat past errors.
""They will never fool us again with a false dialogue like [in] 2017,"" he said. ""That's why today we're in the streets."" "

New memorial to Alnwick police officer killed in 1875 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-48413450,"New memorial to Alnwick police officer killed in 1875 26 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Police Memorial Image caption Campaigners raised £3,000 for the new headstone A memorial stone to a police officer killed in a Northumberland riot more than 140 years ago has been renewed.
Sgt John Hately, 38, was struck by a stone during a disturbance in Alnwick in March 1875 and died at the scene.
Colleagues from the then Northumberland County Constabulary raised cash for a headstone at Alnwick Cemetery.
Over the years it became eroded due to the weather, and was unreadable. Now it has been replaced and rededicated after a fundraising campaign.
Reports at the time said Sgt Hately and several other officers had been surrounded outside the Angel Inn pub while trying to take a man into custody.
Sgt Hately was struck by a stone thrown from the crowd and later died. A subsequent post mortem examination said he died from heart failure. 'Fantastic support'
A group of retired Northumbria Police officers sought help from various organisations including the Police Roll of Honour Trust, Police Federation and the National Association of Retired Police Officers, to raise £3,000 to replace the headstone.
It has now been rededicated, with current chief constable Winton Keenen saying those who had died protecting others should be remembered.
He said: ""It is an honour to be able to pay my respects to Sgt John Hately and I'm privileged to say I serve with many great officers, staff and volunteers who, like him, put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities.""
David Acheson, Roll of Honour Trust secretary, said: ""We are proud to have led the restoration of Sgt Hately's gravestone.
""Honouring our fallen colleagues, regardless of how long ago they may have died, is of critical importance to us.
""The support of local retired officers, the Northumbria Police Federation and indeed Northumbria Police has been fantastic and we're very grateful.""
Bob Watson, secretary of the Northumbria Branch of the National Association of Retired Police Officers, added: ""No matter how long ago he died, John Hately is still one of the 'Police Family', and deserves the honour shown from serving, retired officers and the public alike.""
Sgt Hately left a widow and eight young children. Related Topics"

'Surviving my daughter's sudden death' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48384044,"'Surviving my daughter's sudden death' By Kev Geoghegan Arts and entertainment reporter 26 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Joni Greene Image caption Jayson Greene writes about his family's attempts to deal with the death of daughter Greta Greta Greene was two years old when she was struck on the head by a falling piece of masonry from an apartment building in her home city of New York in 2015.
She died of her injuries the next day, the innocent victim of a one in eight million tragedy.
Now, her father, ex-music editor and writer Jayson Greene, has written a book, Once More We Saw Stars, about his family's heartbreaking attempts to heal after her death.
The book began as a journal, kept by Jayson in the days and weeks following Greta's death. Drawn to writing
It was written in lucid moments between the intense grief and anger he felt, anger which took on a primal form when he would take himself to deserted parks or to the NYC waterfront and scream into the emptiness.
""Honestly, the days following the accident, we were all still in acute shock and trauma,"" he says.
""I found myself drawn to writing, I would write down everything I was thinking. And I remember thinking to myself, kind of in that weird, detached way when you can have a voice going in the back of your head, 'oh, this seems silly and odd that I'm writing'.
""A month after the accident, I went to see my trauma therapist and I told her offhand that I had been writing. She said: 'You've been writing down actual sentences?'
""Having worked with hundreds of people, she said it was highly unusual that anyone had the capacity to write sentences down in this particular stage of shock. And I think a little light bulb went on"".
But Jayson didn't share his journals and the dark thoughts contained within, shielding them even from his wife Stacy.
""She was grieving her way and she didn't need to read the stuff that was going on my head, I just wanted everything to end, not necessarily in a wanting to kill myself way, but I just wanted everything to stop"". Getty Images I saw appear / Some of the beautiful things that Heaven bears / Where we came forth, and once more saw the stars Dante Alighieri Closing words of Inferno
Split into six chapters, the first and second see Jayson describe in wrenching detail the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, from the decision to donate Greta's organs, to the weeks after when they were cared for by their families, to the crushing reality of returning to an apartment still filled with the toys and clothing of their dead child.
Part of their grieving process takes them first to a yoga retreat in Massachusetts, where they attend group counselling sessions under the guidance of a spiritual medium, to a ranch in New Mexico where they are led through a shamanistic ritual.
Even in the depths of grief, it must have been something of a leap for a journalist, well versed in cynicism and generally pursuant of cold, hard facts.
""I think that we used those moments for connection,"" explains Jayson. Coping mechanism
""I think my belief didn't really factor into those experiences, because belief is a decision that you sort of make about something. I think we were moving from an instinctive place.
""Sometimes scepticism is to mask discomfort with something, it's your coping mechanism for shielding yourself from experiences that you don't want to have because you're simply afraid of them.
""I think it's something that you can get lost in when you're used to analysing everything, but analysing the death of your child is meaningless. That's one of the first things I became aware of.
""How pitiful was my intellect, which had been sort of this weird tool that I used to scrape my way through the world, it's like I was holding a plastic spoon trying to hit a mountain. 'Feel your way through'
""It was like, what, what am I doing with this? How can I figure out with my with my mind, why my daughter is gone, why my two-year-old only child has disappeared from this world.
""There's no thought I can have that will somehow light this up for me, right?
""You have to feel things and have to feel your way through them. And so I think, as a journalist, my brain was like an overdeveloped muscle and I'd ignored the rest of myself.""
Despite his job as a music editor, Jayson steers clear of the well-worn cliche of its ability to alter the emotional state of the listener.
He writes of the Elliott Smith song, Between the Bars, that he would sing to Greta as she slept, and how he would never sing it again. 'Blocking off the world'
He also shares the impact of a live show by the singer Mitski, which made him realise: "" 'Greta will never have a profound moment of self-expression or live a life... full of art and possibility'.
""I think it's put it in perspective,"" he says of his changed relationship with music.
""There are things that music can't do, there are things that listening to music alone can't do, I think that it reminded me of the importance of connecting with music with people.
""You do so much listening to music alone. I was very aware for the first time of how much time I spent blocking off the world with headphones and what seemed to me often to be this communing with something, was often just a way of sort of hiding. 'Protective circle of friends'
""That's why with the songs that did connect, we're reminded that music is at its best when it's at the centre of some kind of community of people.
""When I went to see Mitski, I was surrounded by friends who knew what had happened. And they were kind of forming this protective circle around me.""
""I think if it's changed my relationship to music, it's refined my awareness of the ways in which I use music to connect or ways in which I use it to disassociate and I think it's made me more mindful of that."" Image copyright Jayson Greene Image caption Jayson Greene, pictured with Stacy and their son Harrison
The final chapters of Once More We Saw Stars are given over to Jayson and his wife discovering they are pregnant with their second child Harrison.
Though it gives the book a cautionary ""upward lilt rather than lift"" says the author, he did not want to end on a suggestion the birth of a child was in any way, some kind of resolution or end to the story.
""I understand there's this suggestion within the framework, somehow, that because we had Harrison, our lives were complete and whole and all these things.
""I didn't want to tell a story like that. Because it felt false. I felt a moral need to not replace Greta with Harrison in our lives in a story. 'Loss forever an undernote'
""Stacy and I had decided to live for each other because we didn't know if we'd have another child. And if we did, we weren't going to have a child who was burdened with the grief that we carried, and expect to live for us.
""I couldn't tell a story in which Harrison saved our lives, because Harrison has his own life.
""And so the book ends in this ambivalent place, I think there's a beauty to the fact that I can talk to both of my children, but one of them is not here.
""The loss will forever be this undernote in our lives, always humming beneath the surface.""

BBC - Future - The places that escaped the Spanish flu,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181023-the-places-that-escaped-the-spanish-flu,"Disease The places that escaped the Spanish flu In places like Alaska, the Spanish flu exacted a terrible toll. But while some communities suffered many deaths, others nearby escaped the carnage. How? By Richard Gray 24 October 2018
Filthy and frightened, the three young children staggered up the beach. Their tiny frames were feverish and behind them, on board the small sailboat they had drifted ashore upon, lay the bodies of two dead men.
The group had been attempting to flee an outbreak of disease that had devastated their small, isolated village further upstream from the spot where they run aground on the Naknek River in Bristol Bay, Alaska. The three young survivors were quickly taken to a hospital run by a salmon canning company.
Their unexpected arrival at the Alaska Packer Association’s “Diamond O” cannery on the Naknek announced that “Spanish flu” had taken hold in this remote, largely ice-bound part of the world. The inhospitable winter weather conditions had prevented travel to the area between the months of September and May, meaning it had escaped the waves of influenza that swept the world during 1918.
By the time the pandemic had run its course, it claimed somewhere between 50 and 100 million lives – more than the total number of deaths from the terrors of World War One.
The arrival of the boat at the cannery on 4 June 1919 indicated the disease had finally found its way to the remote native Inuit communities that dotted the Alaskan coastline. The next day, the superintendent of the cannery dispatched a team to the children’s village to see if they could help.

What they discovered was horrifying.
Reports from the men on the expedition described the village of Savonoski as being in a “deplorable state” and “ wretched ”. Nearly all of the adult population in the small cluster of around 10 houses were dead. Those still alive were gravely ill and told how their relatives had dropped even as they walked around . The team from the cannery buried the dead in a mass grave and brought those still alive back to the hospital in Naknek.
It was a picture that was repeated in villages all across Alaska. In just a few days nearly 200 people would die from the disease in the Bristol Bay area, leaving dozens of children orphaned. From some places, stories emerged of packs of stray dogs feasting on the bodies of the dead . In some communities, up to 90% of the population died and the mortality rates were some of the highest in the world. View image of Bristol Bay in Alaska (Credit: Getty Images)
Yet, just a few miles from some of the worst hit areas of Bristol Bay, one community in a tiny settlement called Egegak escaped the disease entirely.
“It is strange to relate that Egegak was the only village on Bristol Bay that was not troubled with the malady,” the Alaska Packing Association’s superintendent at Naknek station, JF Heinbockel was to say in his official report of the epidemic . “The natives there were apparently just as healthy when we left as they ever were.”
Other medical reports stated that some villagers at Egegak showed only mild symptoms of the disease. It appears they were lucky.
“More people per capita died from influenza in Alaska than almost anywhere else in the world,” says Katherine Ringsmuth, a historian who has been piecing together the story of the canneries in Bristol Bay . “Some places like Egegak escaped it and no one really knows why.”
The survival of these so-called ;escape communities’ could prove valuable today as public health officials look fearfully towards the next influenza pandemic
As the world tried to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of the global pandemic, stories began to emerge of similar places that had escaped the virus. There were not many – a handful of remote islands, rural towns, walled asylums and schools were left unaffected.
But the survival of these so-called “escape communities” could prove valuable today as public health officials look fearfully towards the next influenza pandemic.
The lessons they contain are considered so important that the US Department of Defense’s Threat Reduction Agency investigated the handful of the places across the United States that were untouched by Spanish flu in the hope of gleaning some clues about how to keep military personnel safe in the future.
In all, the authors of the report focused on seven communities that they found had escaped the virus, although they say there may have been others they did not identify. Among them were the rural farming village of Fletcher, in northern Vermont, and Gunnison, Colorado, a remote town in the Rocky Mountains. Princeton University in New Jersey, Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, the Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Blind in Pittsburgh and the Trudeau Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Saranac Lake, New York.

“These communities basically shut themselves down,” explains Howard Markel, an epidemiological historian at the University of Michigan who was one of the authors of the study. “No one came in and no one came out. Schools were closed and there were no public gatherings. We came up with the term ‘protective sequestration’, where a defined and healthy group of people are shielded from the risk of infection from outsiders.”
The people of Gunnison managed this by erecting guarded barricades on the main highways in and out of the surrounding county. Railway passengers were forced to submit to two days of quarantine upon arrival.
The sanatorium and school for the blind benefited from being relatively closed communities already, with walls to confine those who lived there also helping to protect those inside from the disease running rampant through the communities on the outside.
Being hard to reach also helped to protect other communities in 1918. The US naval base on the island of Yerba Buena, in San Francisco Bay, was only accessibly by boat. The base’s 6,000 residents were confined to the island and no visitors were allowed ashore. The few arrivals allowed on the island were confined to quarantine, were given three times daily throat sprays, and had to maintain a distance of 20 feet from one another.
For severe pandemics it might be cost beneficial for some islands to close their borders
When these measures were lifted in November 1918, as reports of cases in San Francisco were on the decline, the base experienced only mild cases, but at least three people did die.
“The moment you open up the gates, the virus enters in the bodies of people who come in,” says Markel. “Protective sequestration is only as good as long as you are doing it.
“The notion that you can shut down a modern city or even a university today is not very likely though. It is extremely expensive and disruptive.”
But there may be some benefit to keeping the virus out for as long as is possible. American Samoa implemented a five-day quarantine for all boats that kept influenza from its shores until 1920. When it finally did arrive, the virus appears to have lost much of its sting and there were no deaths attributed to influenza in a population of more than 8,000 . The main island of Samoa to the northwest, however, lost around a fifth of its population to the pandemic. View image of Nakenek River in Alaska (Credit: Getty Images)
A similar story unfolded on the on the Australian island of Tasmania, which implemented strict quarantine measures for boats arriving on its shores that required all passengers and crew to be isolated for seven days. When the infection penetrated the island in August 1919, medical officers reported that it was a milder infection than that on the mainland. The death rate on Tasmania was one of the lowest recorded worldwide.
“For some islands, it might have been a mix of chance, remoteness and small numbers of travellers,” says Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand. “This experience has some modern relevance – for severe pandemics it might be cost beneficial for some islands to close their borders.”
Other islands had similar success at keeping the pandemic at bay. The French territory of New Caledonia in the South Pacific did not experience an outbreak until July 1921 , again escaping with just a mild form of the disease.
In some areas, the older populations particularly were not as affected as much because they had some protection – Gerardo Chowell
It’s not clear why those attempts to delay the arrival of the disease reduced the mortality rates in these places. But research has suggested that over time, as the virus burned its way through populations, it accumulated mutations that naturally reduced its capacity to cause disease.
Another possibility could be that some populations may have acquired a degree of immunity against the pandemic strain from comparatively harmless seasonal flu strains that were circulating in the years running up to 1918.
In Denmark, for example, the pandemic claimed just 0.2% of the population while in Australia just 0.3% died . China also escaped lightly, with relatively few deaths – again something that has been attributed to some existing immunity within the population. Some large cities also reported lower mortality rates than might be expected in places where the risk of passing the virus from person to person is high, perhaps also due to immunity obtained in earlier less deadly outbreaks .

“This is known as the ‘antigen recycling hypothesis’,” says Professor Gerardo Chowell, an epidemiologist at Georgia State University who has been attempting to piece together the events that led to the 1918 pandemic . “In some areas, the older populations particularly were not as affected as much because they had some protection that they probably acquired when they were children.”
While the idea is still debated, it has provided some clues that could help health officials in the fight against future pandemics. Today some countries offer annual vaccinations against seasonal flu strains that can help their populations build up temporary immunity. According to research by Jodie McVernon , an immunologist at the University of Melbourne, this could “provide important protection in the early stages of a new pandemic”.
“The more times you get vaccinated, the more you are exposed to different versions of the flu virus,” adds Markel.
Transportation was much scarcer than nowadays and the population of Brazil was much smaller, so it is easy to see that Marajo might have got lucky
But locations even with this potential immunity still saw people fall ill and some deaths. Just two small chains of remote volcanic islands in Fiji, in the South Pacific – the Lau and Yasawa islands – along with Marajo island on Brazil’s Amazon delta, and a handful of tiny communities in Alaska and the Bering Strait could claim to have been left entirely untouched by the pandemic.
Their isolated locations and lack of outside visitors meant these island communities were never exposed to the virus.
“Transportation was much scarcer than nowadays and the population of Brazil was much smaller, so it is easy to see that Marajo might have got lucky,” says Wladimir Alonso, a technical officer at the World Health Organization who has studied the patterns of the 1918 pandemic in Brazil. “But you would expect the population to remain immunologically susceptible to the pandemic virus.” View image of Copenhagen in early 1900s (Credit: Getty Images)
This could mean that these remote locations were hit by the virus at a later date, but the very isolation that protected them from the waves of flu hitting other parts of the world meant these cases went unreported.
Blood tests conducted in Alaska, however, have confirmed that some remote populations were never exposed. People in the Yupik settlements of Gambell and Savoonga on St Lawrence Island in the Bering Strait and the even more remote Saint Paul Island further to the south, showed no trace of antibodies to the 1918 virus when they were tested in the 1950s.
While it appears these places were largely protected by their geography alone, other communities took matters into their own hands. Villagers in Barrow and Wainwright in north Alaska posted armed guards around their villages and travel between settlements was prohibited. When scientists tested people living in a number of remote settlements in north Alaska , they found they too were free of antibodies, suggesting they had never been exposed.
It appears that many of these villages were given advanced warning of the oncoming virus as it spread across Alaska by dog sled teams that raced ahead of the infection to alert villages. It was an incredible gamble – mail delivery teams and seal hunters moving through the region were already spreading the virus from settlement to settlement – but one that paid off.
One native Inupiaq community placed armed guards eight miles south of the town. It was among those villages to evade the flu completely
One native Inupiaq community called Shishmaref, situated on a barrier reef island to the north of the Bering Strait, received news in this way and were able to place armed guards eight miles south of the town with orders not to let anyone pass . It was among those villages to evade the flu completely.
“A few places had warning,” says Nicole Braem, a cultural anthropologist with the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, which is part of the US National Park Service. “Numerous settlements in Alaska were unaffected, largely because of quarantines established along travel routes or their remoteness. Communities at the time were very self-sufficient for food and clothing. They were not as dependent on food and goods imported from elsewhere in the United States [compared to today].”
In the modern world, shutting down settlements like this would be far harder. Few places are now not dependent on goods brought in from around the world. Global travel networks and supply chains could also mean few places would be remote enough to escape a modern pandemic.

“In 1918 they had very little idea about viruses or what caused the pandemic,” says Howard Markel. “Today we would have a better shot at coping with it – we have antivirals, hospitals with intensive care units, respirators and much better surveillance. But we travel further and faster than we ever have before, so the spread could be much faster than we could cope with.”
Some communities in 1918 also appear to have escaped the virus against all logic. The 737 people living in the town of Fletcher, Vermont, defied advice to avoid contact with the outside world, holding a dance and attending a county fair in a neighbouring town. The town even hosted a wedding for a soldier from a military camp in Massachusetts that saw 28% of its population hit by influenza and suffered 757 deaths in the same month as the wedding. Despite 120 guests attending the wedding, the residents of Fletcher appeared to have dodged a bullet.
And this good fortune is perhaps the greatest lesson that the escape communities of 1918 have to offer modern health officials. Many communities that implemented rigid protection and quarantine measures were still hit by the pandemic.
The disease struck so quickly, most people didn’t have a chance to respond
It was a lesson that the communities of Bristol Bay in Alaska learned the hard way.
“Although they knew about the flu and did what they could to prevent it from coming, it arrived anyway,” says Katherine Ringsmuth. “The disease struck so quickly, most people didn’t have a chance to respond.” A fall in salmon stocks may have ultimately helped the Egegak village. “It was a terrible year for salmon as they had been producing so much canned salmon for the war effort in Europe, it caused the fish numbers to decline.
“It might have meant no one had any reason to visit the area. It was just chance.”
Survival, it seems, can sometimes come down to blind luck.

Letter from Africa- The art of drawing your address in The Gambia,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47968968,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel In our series of letters from African journalists, Sierra Leonean-Gambian writer Ade Daramy explains why it is easy to get lost in The Gambia.
""Turn right at the red shipping container, opposite the school on the highway, you'll see two roads, take the one to the right and then left at the unpainted corner shop at the second junction...""
This is part of what passes for giving directions to an address in many parts of The Gambia.
Once you leave the capital, Banjul, and head into the surrounding cities, you find yourself struggling to find anything more than a few named streets.
When I went online to look at maps of the country, the full horror of the situation dawned on me: there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of nameless streets.
I have often wondered whether Irish rock band U2 were actually thinking of The Gambia when they wrote their hit Where the Streets Have No Name. 'Note the landmarks'
The exception is Banjul, where roads with names like Clarkson, Wellington, Anglesea, Lancaster, Peel and Haddington retain the legacy of the British colonial era, when this neat little city was called Bathurst.
More recent-ish ones in Banjul bear names such as Nelson Mandela Street, OAU Avenue and Ecowas Street.
But most Gambians, some in their dotage, have never lived in a street with a name or a house with a number. Ade Daramy Sierra Leoneans, by comparison, revel in recounting street names and the country even has a tradition of streets competing in football games against each other"" Ade Daramy Journalist
And yet everywhere you go and are asked to fill in a form, which happens a lot, there is a box marked ""address"".
After having negotiated this at several places, I went to open a bank account and joked with the account manager: ""Why bother with asking people's addresses, if they live in unnumbered houses in unnamed streets?""
I certainly was not prepared for the answer, delivered with a casualness bordering just this side of nonchalance: ""The box is big enough for you to draw where your house is, in relation to the nearest landmarks."" Image caption People often have to draw their addresses on forms in The Gambia
So it was that I put my especially poor drawing skills to giving a vague representation of my abode in relation to the local petrol station and police station.
Though when I went back recently to the bank, the manager almost had the last laugh, saying the forms had been redesigned - no longer was there the big box to test one's drawing skills, but there is still an ""address"" box, followed by ""nearest bus stop/landmark"". 'I give up explaining'
As I recently walked along one of Gambia's long main thoroughfares - Kairaba Avenue, a name taken from the middle name of independence leader President Dawada Kairaba Jawara - I thought I'd make an enquiry in one of about 30 or so side streets that lead off it.
On a properly paved street, I asked the Lebanese owner, who said his mini-supermarket had been there for many years: ""Can you tell me the name of this street, please? I want to tell someone to come and meet me here later.""
""Err, I don't know about a name - just tell them: 'The street opposite Pipeline Mosque, off Kairaba Avenue.'"" Image copyright Ade Daramy Image caption This is the street opposite Pipeline Mosque, off Kairaba Avenue
So for people fielding 10 phone calls in a day from those wanting to pay a visit, they could spend a large part of that day giving directions.
And yet, when I mention this to folks who have lived here for a while or for all their lives (and don't mind losing the odd hour or two a day giving directions), they act as if it is the most normal thing in the world.
I frequently give up explaining and say: ""Meet me at the turntable"" - as roundabouts are called here - or the ""traffic light"" and proceed to meet the person at one of these obvious landmarks, saving us both lots of time. Image copyright Google Image caption Even if you zoom in on Google Maps, streets have no names off Kairaba Avenue
Am I missing something? Is there a local custom or superstition about naming streets? If so, it must be a recent phenomenon; after all, those old streets in Banjul pretty much all have names. Parcel-delivery problems?
Or is it just that successive governments, including the rapidly unravelling current coalition, have always had better things to do than attend to this ""small"" matter?
Other former colonies in the region - English and Portuguese - have street names. Sierra Leoneans, by comparison, revel in recounting street names and the country even has a tradition of streets competing in football games against each other. Hard to ""announce"" a winner if there is no street name. More on The Gambia:"
European elections 2019: What we know so far - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48415362,"Key things to watch out for in European vote 1. Centre falls away In Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-right Christian Democrats got 28% of the vote - their worst-ever performance in European elections. Meanwhile the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) also did poorly, coming third with 16%. In the European Parliament in Strasbourg, they provide MEPs to the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) respectively. The EPP and S&D have always held more than half of the seats between them. But official projections based on exit polls now say the EPP and S&D could lose about 92 seats, bringing their share of down to 42.6% - a drop of more than 12%. Image copyright AFP Image caption Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party beat French President Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche However another centrist grouping, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), is set to increase its share to 102 seats from 67 in 2014. French President Emmanuel Macron's La République En Marche is set to join the group and it could play a kingmaker role. Outgoing ALDE group leader Guy Verhofstadt hailed a ""historical moment"" because of what he said was a ""new balance of power"". 2. Green wave Many European countries have seen a rise in the Green vote, from the Nordic countries to Portugal. In Germany the Green party more than doubled its vote share to come second with 22%. The BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin says the Green party captured the zeitgeist while the other parties have struggled to put together a coherent environmental policy. Our correspondent says about a third of those under the age of 30 voted Green. In the run-up to the vote 90 influential YouTubers urged followers to vote for parties that took climate issues seriously. They told voters to avoid the AfD, which they said denied climate change was even happening. Image copyright AFP Image caption German YouTubers including Rezo, seen on a placard at this protest, had called for people to vote for parties that took climate change seriously In France, green group Europe Écologie Les Verts (EELV) is on course to come third with 13.2%. Both Mrs Le Pen and Mr Macron have emphasised their green credentials. Mr Macron wants to shift to green technology and energy while Mrs Le Pen said her brand of localism was good for the environment. In Portugal, the green PAN party (People-Animals-Nature) is on course to win its first ever seat in the European Parliament, possibly even two. The Greens have won a historic second place in Finland but in Sweden, home to climate activist Greta Thunberg, they have gone into reverse. They are projected to poll 9.5%, down almost 6%. In Ireland, early exit polls give the Green party 15%. Advertisement 3. Mixed picture for nationalist right In France Marine Le Pen's National Rally party - formerly the National Front - is heading for first place with 23.4% of the vote, narrowly ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's centrist grouping, which got 22.4%. Turnout was reportedly high in areas where her party has previously done well and also in areas where support for the anti-government ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) movement is strong. Mrs Le Pen has changed her position on EU membership, saying she now wants to stay in the bloc. In Germany the far-right AfD is predicted to get under 11%, up from 7.1% in 2014. In the Netherlands the Forum for Democracy and the Freedom Party of Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders together won nearly 16%, but Mr Wilders' party has seen a steep decline. Image copyright EPA Image caption In the UK, which voted on Thursday, Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party is expected to do well Results in Spain give new far-right Vox party getting only 6.2% of the vote, down from the 10.3% it achieved in Spain's national election. In the UK a new anti-EU party, the Brexit Party is heading for victory at the expense of the Conservative Party, while pro-EU Liberal Democrats are taking votes from the traditionally centre-left Labour party. Far-right and Eurosceptic parties are currently split between three groupings in the European Parliament - the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the two far-right groupings Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF). However, Matteo Salvini, whose right-wing nationalist League party is predicted to win the Italian vote, is hoping to found a new grouping, the European Alliance for People and Nations, with the support of several parties. What happened where? Austria The ruling People's Party (ÖVP) has won with a record 34.9%, despite a scandal that has led to the collapse of its coalition government with the far right. ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz is facing a no-confidence vote on Monday which could put him out of a job. The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) - which quit the government after its leader Heinz-Christian Strache was exposed in a video sting - does not appear to have been that badly affected by the scandal. It came in third place with 17.5% of the vote, down only slightly from 2014. Belgium Far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang got 4.3% in the European election - but won a much larger 14% of the vote in the country's federal election, held at the same time. Croatia Initial results give the governing HDZ four of the 12 available seats. The centre-left SDP party gets 18.5%, seen as a disappointing result. Finland The Finnish Green party (VIHR) won 15.9% of the vote, coming behind the centre-right KOK party with 20.7% but ahead of the centre-left SDP with 14.7%. Greece It's been a bad night for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's left-wing Syriza party which has been beaten by opposition conservative New Democracy party. First official projections give New Democracy a nine-point lead. Mr Tsipras has said he will call snap elections, which may take place at the end of June. New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis has called on Mr Tsipras to resign. Ireland The centre-right Fine Gael party of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is heading for a big victory, exit polls suggest. But Ireland's electoral system means the results will take some time to come through. Netherlands The Dutch Labour party has won, as expected, with 18% of the vote. It's a dramatic victory for Labour, who have been celebrating ""an unexpected comeback"". Portugal Green party PAN is set to enter the European Parliament. No pollster or projection had predicted this.

European elections 2019: Investigating false and misleading video - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Reality Check Team Bbc News,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48345019,"Is Russia trying to sway the European elections?
However, the incident did not take place in Italy - the statue in the video was part of the Ain El Fouara fountain in Setif, Algeria.
Various media outlets, including an Egyptian television station, news agency Agence France Presse (AFP) and TV network France24, reported on the incident in Algeria at the time, which took place in December 2017. Reports at that time contained footage resembling the video posted recently.
For further confirmation of the location, details from the video match photos of the monument in Setif.
There is the statue itself and the distinctive street lamps above it. A street view shows the same buildings surrounding the square in Setif that appear in the video.
Some posts claimed that the statue is of the Virgin Mary. But in fact it is of a mythological creature called a Naiad, reported AFP.
Multiple versions of the video posted in different languages appeared on social media and, despite it being debunked by fact-checking organisations, it generated tens of thousands of shares and referrals in recent weeks. A version of the video uploaded last year has reached 2.7 million total views on Facebook. The role of negative memes
Countless election memes and unofficial pledge cards were created to mock and, in some cases, misrepresent politicians.
A mocked up election pledge card bearing the centre-left Italian Democratic Party (PD) logo wrongly linked a quote about Libyan refugees to the party leader Nicola Zingaretti.
It said that after the party won the European elections, it would ask Europe to pass a ""directive to open all Italian ports to immediately receive 800,000 Libyan refugees"".
The PD confirmed to the BBC that Mr Zingaretti never made this statement and that those responsible for the claim have been reported to the police.
The memes were shared by groups supporting right-wing policies.
The United Nations-backed prime minister of Libya mentioned the 800,000 figure in a recent interview with an Italian newspaper.
But the figure he referred to appeared to be a rough estimate of the overall number of people who ""could try to reach Italian ports"" if the situation in Libya continues to worsen.
The Italian foreign minister responded by saying there was no evidence for this high number.
Just over 1,000 migrants have entered Italy across the Mediterranean sea this year, according to the UN.
Last year there were 23,370 arrivals, significantly fewer then the previous years when more than 100,000 migrants entered the country annually. French president egged
Footage of Emmanuel Macron being heckled and having an egg thrown at him as he entered a building was shared on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit.
A UK-based Facebook page published a version of the video on 5 May under the caption: ""Footage has emerged this week of President Macron being egged and receiving an extremely hostile welcome and it almost spirals out of control. Imagine this had happened to President Putin? It would be all over the BBC and MSM!""
In April, a German Facebook account posted the same video, which has been shared more than 4,000 times and viewed nearly 200,000 times.
An article on a Dutch website suggested the media refused to publish the video.
However, the recording was from 2016 when Mr Macron was economy minister and a crowd of protesters in Paris confronted him about labour reforms.
Lots of outlets reported on the incident at the time including the Daily Telegraph and Euronews. Old protests at Rome's Colosseum
There have been plenty of examples of old videos being recycled, making it unclear when the footage was first taken. For example, a recording from 2016 that emerged recently of Muslim worshippers outside the Colosseum in Rome.
Two Twitter accounts claimed (though their tweets were not widely shared) that Muslims had gathered there on 19 May 2019.
The same video was posted by anti-Islam Dutch politician Geert Wilders.
Another account suggested Muslims were protesting against current Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini for closing down mosques.
Using an online video verification tool and a Google reverse image search of a thumbnail from the video, it can be traced back to a piece on an Italian website in October 2016, which was filmed during a protest by hundreds of Muslims against the closure of makeshift mosques in Italy.
The 2016 video has the same audio and sequence of shots - the camera pans to the crowd gathered to the left of the Colosseum and shows people arriving. "
European elections 2019: Major centrist blocs braced for losses - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48417744,"People to look out for in the EU elections
""For the first time in 40 years, the two classical parties, socialists and conservatives, will no longer have a majority,"" said Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the ALDE.
""It's clear this evening is a historical moment, because there will be a new balance of power in the European Parliament,"" he said.
There were major successes for the Greens, with exit polls suggesting the group would jump from 50 to around 67 MEPs. Follow the latest results via the European Parliament website
But gains for nationalist parties in Italy, France and elsewhere means a greater say for Eurosceptics who want to curb the EU's powers.
Matteo Salvini, who leads Italy's League party, has been working to establish an alliance of at least 12 parties, and his party set the tone winning more than 30% of the vote, according to partial results. Beyond the status quo
This outcome reflects a tendency already apparent in national elections all over Europe: rejection of the status quo. Look at the beating meted out to France's centre-right and centre-left, to Angela Merkel and her Social Democrat coalition partners, plus the slap in the face delivered to the UK's Conservative and Labour parties.
Europe's voters are looking elsewhere for answers. They're drawn to parties and political personalities they feel better represent their values and priorities.
Some are attracted by the nationalist right, promising a crackdown on immigration and more power for national parliaments, rather than Brussels. Italy's firebrand Deputy PM Matteo Salvini is a successful example, as is Hungary's Viktor Orban.
Other voters prefer a pro-European alternative, like the Green Party and liberal groups. They also performed well in these elections. Read more from Katya Who were the winners and losers?
In Germany , both major centrist parties suffered. Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats dropped from 35% of the vote in 2014 to 28%, while the centre-left Social Democratic Union fell from 27% to 15.5%.
The right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) performed worse than expected - projected in exit polls to win 10.5% - while still improving on its first results in 2014.
In the UK , the newly formed Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, secured about 32% of the vote , amid gains for the Liberal Democrats and significant losses for the Conservative and Labour parties. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The winners and losers in the UK
Amid mixed results for far-right parties across Europe, Ms Le Pen's National Rally party - formerly the National Front - was celebrating victory in France over Mr Macron's party, securing 24% of the vote to his 22.5%.
A presidential official described the outcome as a ""disappointment"" but ""absolutely honourable"" compared to previous results.
In Hungary , Viktor Orban, whose anti-immigration Fidesz party took 52% of the vote and 13 of the country's 21 seats, was also a big winner.
""We are small but we want to change Europe,"" Mr Orban said. He described the elections as ""the beginning of a new era against migration"". Image copyright EPA Image caption Marine Le Pen's National Rally beat Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance - but not by far
In Spain , the ruling Socialist party (PSOE) took a clear lead with 32.8% of the vote and 20 seats, while the far-right Vox party won just 6.2% and three seats - coming in fifth.
In Greece , Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for an early election after the opposition conservative New Democracy party won 33.5% of the votes to 20% for his Syriza party.
The right-wing ruling Law and Justice party did well in Poland , winning 45% of the vote, and 27 of the country's 51 seats. Why was the turnout so high?
EU citizens turned out to vote in the highest numbers for two decades, and significantly higher than the last elections in 2014, when fewer than 43% of eligible voters took part.
Turnout in Hungary and Poland more than doubled on the previous poll, and Denmark hit a record 63%.
Analysts attributed the high turnout to a range of factors including the rise of populist parties and increased climate change awareness. How does the European Parliament work?
It is the European Union's law-making body.
It's made up of 751 members, called MEPs, who are directly elected by EU voters every five years. These MEPs - who sit in both Brussels and Strasbourg - represent the interests of citizens from the EU's 28 member states. Image copyright EPA Image caption The European Parliament is the EU's law-making body
One of the parliament's main legislative roles is scrutinising and passing laws proposed by the European Commission - the bureaucratic arm of the EU.
It is also responsible for electing the president of the European Commission and approving the EU budget.
The parliament is comprised of eight main groups that sit together in the chamber based on their political and ideological affiliations. Related Topics"

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage: “There’s a massive message here” The Brexit Party has taken the lead in the UK European election results, with the pro-EU Lib Dems coming second.
The Conservatives and Labour have suffered heavy losses, with the former heading for less than 10% of the vote.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the two main parties “could learn a big message” from the results.
Overall, out of 64 MEPs declared, Mr Farage’s party has won 28, the Lib Dems 15, Labour 10, Greens seven, the Tories three and Plaid Cymru one.
Scotland is yet to declare, but the SNP is on course to increase its number of MEPs from two to three. The Brexit Party is predicted to win one.
Meanwhile, Northern Ireland’s count does not begin until Monday, with the results expected on Tuesday.
Polling expert Sir John Curtice said the results showed just how polarised the country has become – the combined tally for the two parties in favour of no deal – UKIP and The Brexit Party – amounts to 35%. The combined tally for parties who want another referendum parties is 40%.
So far: Ten out of 12 regions have declared The Brexit Party has received the highest share of the vote in nine of the 10 regions declared – it is heading for first place overall, with somewhere around a third of the vote The Conservative Party has been widely rejected by the electorate and is heading for fifth place The Lib Dems have taken second place with 20% of the vote – a vote that is clearly much higher in areas that backed Remain. In London, the Lib Dems came first and the Tories fifth The Green Party is also making gains, the party’s best performance since 1989 Newly-formed Change UK has not won any seats yet, but leader Heidi Allen says they are “down, but we are not out” The Labour Party has fallen to third place and is on course to end up with less than 15% of the vote, an even worse performance than the previous low in 2009
All 28 EU member states are electing MEPs, and countries have been voting since Thursday.
The UK is electing 73 MEPs for its 12 regions under a system of proportional representation. The results for your area are not in yet
Conservative MP Helen Whately told the BBC: “We knew these were going to be bad elections.
“We wanted to have left Europe by now. It is frustrating for us and for people who usually vote Conservative.”
Brexiteer Tory Mark Francois said The Brexit Party had “romped it”.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the elections had “become a proxy second referendum” after the Conservative’s failue to deliver Brexit.
He said his party would “reflect on these results on both sides of the Brexit divide” and the issue “will have to go back to the people” through a general election or a public vote.
Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said the party needed to “urgently” re-think its Brexit position after the “disastrous” election results.

Alastair Campbell, former spin doctor to Tony Blair and prominent member of the People’s Vote campaign for another referendum, said for the first time in his life he had voted for the Lib Dems.
Lib Dem Sir Ed Davey said: “If you add up all the votes of the Remain parties, there is a strong message.
“The Lib Dems are leading that Remain vote and have an awful lot to be pleased about.”
Change UK leader Heidi Allen told the BBC that her party, which has not won any seats so far, was “down, but we are not out”.
She said the results showed there had been a “massive swing to Remain”.

The Brexit Party is running at an average of 44% of the vote in those council areas where more than 55% voted to Leave in 2016.
In areas where less than 45% voted Leave, the Lib Dems averaged 50% of the vote.
Figures suggest that the turnout in some areas rose sharply, while others saw a fall compared with the last election in 2014.
Wales saw the highest increase in turnout, with a five percentage point increase to 37.3%. The South East, South West and North East also saw a boost in the number of people casting their vote.
But in Northern Ireland turnout fell nearly six percentage points to 45.1%, while smaller drops were also recorded in the West Midlands, North West and Eastern regions.
Both of our big main parties are being punished severely for the meltdown in Westminster over Brexit.
The flip-side for the smaller parties? The Lib Dems are buoyant and of course, Nigel Farage is back with a vengeance.
A European election may not be a direct proxy for a UK general election, but nevertheless, after tonight, millions of voters in regions up and down the country will be represented by parties other than the big two.
It also casts doubt on the idea that compromise can win out. Instead, the clear message seems to be that people want clarity – whether that be Leave or Remain – when it comes to Brexit.

Russian data theft: Shady world where all is for sale - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48348307,"Putin, power and poison: Russia’s elite FSB spy club
But Russia stands out for the ease with which an ordinary person can obtain secret data held by state agencies.
""It's a combination of the classic problems of corruption and a degree of lack of control over access to the data,"" Mark Galeotti, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Russian. Lax enforcement
Russia only rarely prosecutes people for selling confidential data, but when such cases do go to trial, they offer a glimpse of how the trade works - and why it persists.
In 2016, in the Moscow suburb of Vidnoye, the deputy head of field inspections at the local branch of the Federal Tax Service was convicted after selling information about the income and assets of several Russians for 7,000 roubles. He received a fine and sentence, but both were waived under an amnesty to mark Victory Day.
In at least one case documented by the BBC, this failure to keep a lid on official data has backfired on Russia, exposing the activities of Russian spies.
Last year, Dutch authorities released the names of several people it said were involved in spying . A search for those names in a Russian car registration database - which is supposed to be secret and controlled by the interior ministry, but has been leaked to murky private operators - revealed those individuals' addresses.
They were traced to a building in Moscow used by the GRU - Russian military intelligence. Image copyright FBI Image caption The FBI released this ""wanted"" poster, naming and picturing the seven men
It was an embarrassing revelation for a country run by President Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer, which prides itself on the excellence and secrecy of its intelligence services.
But Russia's security apparatus is up against powerful market forces. Officials can supplement their often meagre wages by selling data on the black market.
To find out how easy it was to order personal data, BBC Russian contacted one online forum and requested the personal data of one of its correspondents.
Within a day, and for less than 2,000 roubles, a file was emailed containing extracts not only from his current passport but from every passport he had held since the age of 14. Image caption Data for sale included a BBC journalist's passport details
The correspondent then revealed he was from BBC Russian and asked the seller to answer some questions. He agreed, asking to remain anonymous.
He told BBC Russian he thought of his operation as a ""detective agency"". After leaked information exposed the identities of Russian intelligence operatives, he said, there was a crackdown on the trade by Russian law enforcement. That forced some operations like his out of business.
""But they are gradually coming back. It's not something that can really be stopped,"" he said.
And it's not only Russian citizens whose data can be bought: BBC Russian ordered information about the correspondent's wife, an EU citizen, and was given data including phone records, date of birth and passport information.
One person convicted of selling confidential data agreed to speak to BBC Russian. Anatoly Panishev, 28, an ex-employee of the mobile phone company Tele2 in Saransk, had sold the personal data of company clients.
""I only went into this because I was thinking about quitting my job,"" he said. ""Then a proposition came up. And so yes, I decided to make some money from it.""
Panishev earned more than 40,000 roubles in 2018 for his illegal activities, before being convicted and given an 18-month suspended sentence.
""A lot of other countries, particularly in Western Europe and North America, are very careful about data, because they need to worry about lawsuits and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR],"" Mark Galeotti says.
""But Russia doesn't appear to have put as much security into protecting this data as it should have."" Related Topics "

The journalists were outside a police station in the capital Managua, complaining that raids on the offices of a news website were illegal.
Witnesses said riot police armed with batons dispersed them with force.
Nicaragua has been rocked by months of protests against President Daniel Ortega.
The anti-government protests were declared illegal by Mr Ortega in September following five months of often violent clashes in which hundreds of people were killed. He accuses protesters of planning a coup against his Sandinista party government.

In Saturday's confrontation, a witness quoted by Reuters said at least seven journalists from international and national media were grabbed and kicked by police.
They included Carlos Fernando Chamorro, who runs the news website Confidencial. He accused the police of acting without any justification.
Mr Chamorro is the son of former Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro who led an anti-Sandinista coalition in 1990 to defeat Mr Ortega in elections.

""Three officers beat me. They kicked me in the leg trying to knock me down,"" said Néstor Arce, a journalist at Confidencial.

Demonstrators in the Central American country first rallied against planned changes to the country's social security system, but the protests soon escalated to include the demand for President Ortega to resign.
Mr Ortega, who has been in power since 2007, accuses the demonstrators of planning to overthrow his democratically-elected government and of inciting violence.
Local human rights groups as well as the United Nations Office for Human Rights have documented alleged human rights violations which range from illegal detention to torture. Related Topics"

Fighting between inmates at Brazil prison kills 15 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-48420484,"In pictures: Brazilian inmates create fashion behind bars
""It was not a rebellion, it was a fight among inmates,"" Col Marcus Vinicius, who is in charge of prisons in Amazonas state, said.
He said the fact that the killings had happened during visiting hours broke an unwritten prison rule of ""never to kill during a family visit"".
Col Vinicius said murders inside jails were inevitable: ""We have to have the maturity to understand that in any prison in the world, when someone wants to kill, they will kill."" What are Brazilian jails like?
Brazil has the world's third-largest prison population with more than 700,000 people in jail, not counting the more than 35,000 held in police facilities, according to data from the World Prison Brief .
Prisons suffer from serious overcrowding, with the number of prisoners almost double that of the official capacity.
Many prisons are run by the inmates and there are frequent clashes between rival gangs. Riots to demand better conditions and prison escapes are also common.
Attempts to reform the prison system and to introduce tighter controls have met with resistance from powerful criminal gangs which operate both inside and outside of jails. What has the reaction been?
The crisis in the Amazonas jail system is not new. In January 2017, in the worst jail violence in Amazonas state, 56 inmates were killed in Anísio Jobim prison .
Following those killing, officials launched an investigation which concluded that there had been a number of failings at the jail.
They included a lack of communication between prison authorities and the police, which meant that the latter had not been alerted when officials found out about plans to launch a riot.
In the following days there were also uprisings and riots in other jails in Manaus.
National security forces were deployed to Anísio Jobim jail and others in the wake of the 2017 killings and, according to local media, the forces were still there when the latest killings happened.
Amazonas State Governor Wilson Lima said that the justice ministry would send a ""prison intervention team"" to Manaus.
In the past, rival gangs have been separated within prisons by placing them in different wings and using shipping containers to divide the prison yard.

European Elections: What they tell us about support for Brexit - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Sir John Curtice Professor Of Politics At Strathclyde University,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48402593,"Image copyright Getty Images There were two largely separate battles taking place in the European elections in the UK.
The first was for the support of those who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, many of whom are disappointed that the UK has not yet left the EU.
The second was for the backing of those who voted Remain, many of whom are hoping that the decision to leave the EU might yet be reversed, perhaps via a second referendum.
The outcome of the first battle was decisive and widely anticipated. The second was rather messier, but might have just as important an impact on the debate about Brexit between now and when the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October.
Leavers vote Brexit Party Many Leave voters had previously supported UKIP under Nigel Farage's leadership, before backing the Conservatives in the 2017 UK general election.
They switched en masse towards Mr Farage's new organisation, the Brexit Party. With 32% of the vote, its level of support was as much as five points higher than that of UKIP in the last European elections, in 2014.
The Brexit Party performed much better in those areas that voted most heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum than it did in those places that voted most heavily for Remain.
As a result, the party scored much less well in London (18%) and Scotland (15%) - where a majority voted for Remain - than in the rest of England (36%) and Wales (32%), which had provided the foundations of Leave's success in 2016.
A rebuff for the Tories Because of this surge, the Conservatives fell to just 9% of the vote.
Governments often perform badly in European elections, as voters take the opportunity to express their disappointment with its performance without the risk that their vote might put the opposition into government.
Yet the rebuff suffered by the Conservatives was far worse than the previous worst snubbing to have been suffered by a government in a European election. That was the 15% to which Labour sunk in 2009, during the darkest days of Gordon Brown's premiership.
It was also easily the Conservatives' worst ever performance in a nationwide election. Its performance was weak everywhere - the party did not manage to come first in a single council area.
In sharp contrast to the position in the 2017 general election, when it was much stronger in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-inclined ones, the party did equally badly in both.
It is an outcome that would seem to confirm the message of the opinion polls that the party has lost the confidence of many Leave voters.
However, dramatic though it was, the outcome of the battle between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party had been widely forecast by the polls.
Indeed, politicians had already begun to react to it in the period between Thursday's vote and last night's count.
It arguably contributed to the downfall of Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, while many of the candidates to be her successor are arguing that 31 October should be a firm and final deadline for the UK's exit from the EU.
The European election result will simply ensure that that debate continues.
Kuenssberg: Main parties punished for Brexit contortions UK results at a glance The UK's results in maps and charts The Lib Dems win Remain The second contest in these elections was for the support of those who want to remain in the EU.
The polls had suggested that during the campaign Labour, which has been somewhat equivocal in its support for a second referendum, had been losing the backing of Remain supporters to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens.
However, there was disagreement as to whether the Lib Dems would challenge Labour for second place.
In the event, the Lib Dems won this battle hands down.
The party won 20% of the vote, its best European election performance ever, while Labour secured just 14%.
Sir Vince Cable's party not only beat Labour but managed to come a clear first in those places that voted most heavily for Remain including, most remarkably, in London.
There is no doubt that the party was the single most popular party among Remain supporters, a position that had hitherto been enjoyed by Labour.
The Lib Dems, who are themselves about to embark on a leadership contest, will hope the outcome signals that the party is finally recovering from the dramatic decline it suffered following its involvement in the 2010-15 coalition.
However, it was not the only party in favour of a second referendum to do well.
So too did the Greens, whose 12% of the vote was its best European election performance since 1989. However, in its case support was only marginally higher in Remain-voting areas.
In Scotland, the SNP, led by Nicola Sturgeon, won no less than 38% of the vote, its best ever European election result. It is an outcome that confirms its dominance of the electoral scene north of the border.
In Wales, Plaid Cymru also enjoyed some success with 20% of the vote, its highest since 1999.
Labour loses support Though nothing like as devastating as the loss suffered by the Conservatives, Labour's poor performance could, in truth, also lead to a rethink just as important as that now going on inside the government.
The party's attempt to keep both its Remain and its Leave supporters on board seems to have resulted in a loss of support among both groups.
Although Labour's vote fell most heavily in the strongest Remain voting areas, its vote also fell, by as much as 11 points, in the most pro-Leave areas.
There have already been signals from Labour that it might now fall in more firmly behind the idea of a ""confirmatory vote"" in which whatever deal is eventually struck with the EU is put before voters in a second referendum.
It will hope that this stance will help reverse the loss of support to the Lib Dems and Greens, without losing it too much ground among its minority of Leave supporters.
Such a development would certainly ensure that the government and the opposition are further apart on Brexit than at any point since the EU referendum.

The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket On the other hand, the newest of the pro-second referendum parties, Change UK, led by Heidi Allen, had a bruising night, winning just 3% of the vote.
Even in London, where its hopes were highest, the party managed to win no more than 5% of the vote.
It seems likely that the party will have to seek some form of collaboration with the Lib Dems rather than continue to attempt to compete for much the same body of voters.
Inevitably, the outcome of the two battles led those on the Eurosceptic side of the Brexit argument to say the result showed that the electorate were willing to leave the EU without a deal.
Those in favour of a second referendum claimed the result indicated that voters wanted just that.
Image copyright PA Image caption The Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe celebrates her victory in the South West of England In practice, it would seem safer to argue that the outcome confirmed that the electorate is evenly divided as well as polarised between those two options.
Overall, 35% of voters voted for parties comfortable with no deal (the Brexit Party and UKIP).
Equally, 35% backed one of the three UK-wide parties (Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK) that supported a second referendum. If Plaid Cymru (1%) and the SNP (3.5%) are included, the Remain share of the vote is just over 40%, although the SNP is known to secure considerable support from those who voted Leave.
Far from providing a clear verdict, the result simply underlined how difficult it is likely to be to find any outcome to the Brexit process that satisfies a clear majority of voters.
Meanwhile, the poor performance of both the Conservatives and Labour will inevitably raise questions about the future of the country's two-party system. At 23% their joint tally was well below the previous all-time low of 43.5% in 2009.
European elections are, of course, not the same as a general election; voters have long shown a greater willingness to vote for smaller parties.
However, the issue that caused both parties such difficulties in this election - Brexit - is not going to go away any time soon.
In truth, both the Conservatives and Labour have been on notice that they need to handle the issue much better than they have done so far.
Otherwise, voters might yet turn elsewhere at the next general election too.

France Lyon: Police arrest suspect in parcel bomb attack which hurt 13 - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48420490,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption The device, full of screws, nuts and bolts, went off in Lyon city centre last week French police have arrested four people after a suspected parcel bomb exploded in Lyon last week, injuring 13 people.
The device, packed with screws and ball bearings, detonated outside a bakery on Friday afternoon.
One of those arrested, a 24-year-old man, is the suspected bomber, prosecutors say. Another man and a woman were also reportedly detained.
Police had been hunting for a man seen cycling near the scene of the blast wearing a balaclava and rucksack.
Anti-terrorist prosecutors are leading the investigation, co-ordinating with Lyon police and France's internal security service, the DGSI. What do we know about the suspects?
French media report that one suspect is an IT student of Algerian nationality. A source told news agency Reuters that police arrested him in Lyon after tailing him in the street. It reportedly decided not to arrest him in his apartment in case there were explosives in the building.
The second suspect, according to local press, is a minor who attends a school in the city.
Two other people, a man and a woman, have also been arrested. They are reportedly the parents of one of the suspects.
Last week, police released a picture from CCTV footage of a person they believe carried out the bombing. Image copyright AFP Image caption Police called for information on this man after the blast What do we know about the attack?
The explosion struck near the corner of two crowded pedestrian streets in Lyon's historic city centre.
Investigators have recovered screws, ball bearings, along with a printed circuit, batteries and a remote-controlled trigger device.
Denis Broliquier, the city's district mayor, told press that ""the charge was too small to kill,"" and a government source told AFP news agency it had been a ""relatively weak explosive charge"".
Those hurt, including a girl aged eight, appear to have suffered superficial injuries.
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner confirmed one of the arrests in a Tweet on Monday , saying joint action by several agencies had been ""decisive"".
No-one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
The last time a parcel bomb had exploded in France was in 2007 when a device killed one person and injured another in front of a law office in Paris. Police never found the bomber.
Jihadist gun and bomb attacks have killed more than 250 people in France since 2015 and the country remains on high alert, with military patrols a regular feature of security in cities including Lyon. Related Topics"

European elections 2019: Country-by-country roundup - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48420697,"New MEPs to watch out for Austria (18 seats)
The ruling conservative People's Party (ÖVP) won with a record 34.9%, despite a scandal that led to the collapse of its coalition government with the far right. ÖVP leader Sebastian Kurz was removed from his post of chancellor in a parliamentary vote shortly afterwards.
The far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) - which quit the government after its leader Heinz-Christian Strache was exposed in a video ""honey trap"" sting - was not crushed by the scandal. Provisional results show it came third, with 17.2%, down only slightly from 2014. Belgium (21)
In Belgium's big night of European, federal and regional elections it was far-right Flemish party Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) that made all the headlines.
It won three seats in the European Parliament poll, but surged to second place in the national vote for the federal parliament. Vlaams Belang wants the northern Flanders region to split from the rest of Belgium. Bulgaria (17)
The ruling centre-right Gerb party of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov won with 30.6%, against 26% for its arch-foe, the socialist BSP.
Mr Borisov's very active campaigning in the past week is reckoned to have pushed Gerb ahead of the BSP. Croatia (11)
The governing nationalist HDZ won four seats - two fewer than expected - so it tied with the opposition centre-left SDP, which also won four seats. Cyprus (6)
There was little change politically - the conservatives won narrowly, the ruling DISY taking two seats with 29%, followed by socialist AKEL (27.5% - two seats). Czech Republic (21)
Prime Minister Andrej Babis won a convincing victory for his liberal ANO party, meaning ANO will send six MEPs to Brussels.
The conservative Civic Democrats (in the European Conservatives and Reformists bloc) came second, winning four seats. Denmark (13)
It was a disappointing night for the far-right Danish People's Party (DF), who lost around two-thirds of their votes, coming fourth.
Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen's Venstre Liberal Party overtook DF to become the biggest Danish party in Europe, taking 23.5%. Estonia (6)
Estonia's liberal Reform party won with 25.5%, followed by the Social Democratic Party with 23.3%. Each got two MEPs, while Prime Minister Juri Ratas' Centre Party and the far-right Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) got one each. Finland (13)
The Finnish Green party (VIHR) won a record 16%, coming second behind the centre-right National Coalition Party.
The far-right Finns increased their vote share and retained their two seats. France (74)
The far-right National Rally (RN) led by Marine Le Pen came top with 23.3%, narrowly beating President Emmanuel Macron's liberal alliance led by LREM (22.4%)
It was a symbolic blow to Mr Macron, who has been under pressure from the ""Gilets Jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests. He is one of the strongest pro-EU voices in the bloc, calling for major reforms and challenging the parliament's centrist establishment. Germany (96)
The big winners were the Greens - they nearly doubled their seats, coming second with 20.5%, and the big losers were the Social Democrats (SPD), falling to 15.8%.
In 2014 the SPD had got 27.3%.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) still won, but haemorrhaged support.
The far-right AfD did worse than many expected, winning 11%. Greece (21)
It was a bad night for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's left-wing Syriza party - it was well beaten by the opposition conservative New Democracy party (ND). ND got 33.3%, compared with Syriza's 24%.
Mr Tsipras said he would call snap elections, which may take place at the end of June. Hungary (21)
It was another night of election success for Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose nationalist Fidesz party is currently suspended from the centre-right EPP group in Europe. Winning 52% of the vote, he declared his anti-immigration platform a success.
""Hungarians gave us three tasks. Foremost, stopping immigration all across Europe. They gave us the task to defend the Europe of nations and to protect Christian culture in Europe,"" he told supporters.
He could pull out of the EPP and embrace the embryonic nationalist alliance, changing the parliamentary arithmetic. Ireland (11)
The centre-right Fine Gael party of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar scored a big victory, exit polls suggest. But Ireland's electoral system means the results will take some time to come through. Italy (73)
It was an historic win for the right-wing, anti-immigration League of Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini. His party got 34.3% - confirming him as one of the strongest anti-establishment leaders in the EU.
But the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) surprised many by coming second with nearly 23%.
It was a disappointing night for the League's populist coalition partners, Five Star, who slumped to 17%. Latvia (8)
New Unity, the ruling centre-right party topped the poll with 26.4% and took two seats.
The left-wing Harmony party and right-wing National Alliance also gained two MEPs each, with 17.45% and 16.4% respectively.
The Latvian Russian Union and liberal pro-EU Development/For! won one seat each. Lithuania (11)
The Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats came out on top with 19.7% - translating to three seats.
The Social Democratic Party (LSDP) and the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union (LVZS) followed behind with two seats each. Luxembourg (6)
The Christian Social People's Party ceded one seat to Luxembourg's Democratic Party - who edged them as the national winners by only 0.3% of the vote. Each party took two seats.
The Greens and the Socialist Workers' Party each kept a single MEP . Malta (6)
It was a good night for Prime Minister Joseph Muscat's Labour Party, which won four of Malta's six European parliament seats - gaining one seat and increasing its vote share compared with the 2014 elections.
The opposition Nationalist party saw its vote share dip but took the country's remaining two seats. Netherlands (26)
The Dutch Labour party (PvdA) won with 19% of the vote - a dramatic, unexpected comeback for the centre-left.
The liberal VVD of Prime Minister Mark Rutte got 14.6%.
The newcomer nationalist party of Thierry Baudet, FvD, got 10.9%, leaving the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders far behind and without any seats. Poland (51)
The ruling conservative, anti-immigration Law and Justice (PiS) party came top with 45.6%, well ahead of the pro-EU European Coalition (38%).
It was a record 43% turnout - the highest since Poland joined the EU in 2004 - and a litmus test for national elections later this year. Portugal (21)
The centre-left Socialist Party (PS) won with 33.4%.
The centre-right PSD came second with 22% and remarkably the new green party PAN won a seat for the first time. Romania (32)
The ruling Social Democrats (PSD) - blamed by the European Commission for sluggish progress in tackling corruption - slumped to second place, with 23.4%. The centre-right PNL came top with 26.8%.
The vote was accompanied by a referendum on the government's judicial reforms - an initiative by the president, which irritated the government. Slovakia (13)
A new coalition of pro-EU parties won with 20%, so it will send four MEPs to Brussels: two liberals and two centre-right MEPs.
Three seats go to the ruling leftist Smer party, which got 15.7%. Slovenia (8)
An opposition coalition of two anti-immigrant parties - Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and conservative agrarian Slovenian People's Party (SLS) - won with more than 26.4% of the vote, translating to three seats.
The coalition government's centre-left Social Democrats and Populist List of Marjan Sarec (LMS) got two MEPs each. Spain (54)
It was a convincing win for the ruling Socialists of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who took 32.8% - that is, 20 seats.
It bolsters his power, coming after his April triumph in national elections, though he did not get a majority.
The conservative Popular Party (PP) - similarly pro-EU - was second with 20% (12 seats). For the first time a Spanish far-right party, Vox, got elected to Brussels, with three seats. Sweden (20)
The ruling centre-left Social Democrats won safely with 23.6%.
The liberal-conservative Moderates were second, with 16.8%.
There has been much media attention on the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats: they came third, winning two seats. United Kingdom (73)
It was an extraordinary election for the UK, whose negotiations on leaving the EU are deadlocked. The election was organised late, after the UK missed a 29 March Brexit deadline.
Voters punished the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour Party, with many backing the new anti-EU Brexit Party of Nigel Farage.
The Brexit Party won with 31.7%, and the Liberal Democrats stormed into second place, with 18.5%. Related Topics "
What would a Brexit Party Brexit look like? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48422801,"What would a Brexit Party Brexit look like? By Chris Morris Reality Check correspondent, BBC News 27 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel The UK’s European elections 2019 Image copyright Getty Images The Brexit Party has won the largest share of the vote and the most seats in the UK's European elections.
Many of its policies are unknown, it produced no manifesto, and it has avoided answering detailed questions on immigration or economic policy.
One thing we do know very clearly is that it wants to leave the European Union as soon as possible.
So what would a Brexit Party Brexit actually look like? 'Clean break'
The Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he wants a ""clean-break"" Brexit, abandoning the withdrawal agreement that Theresa May's government negotiated with the EU.
It is notable that Mr Farage tended to avoid the term ""no-deal"" Brexit during the election campaign.
A party spokesman argued that it is a misleading term that gives a false impression.
Without a withdrawal agreement, though, most of the vast network of rules and regulations that have governed the UK's relationship with the rest of Europe for more than 40 years, whether in trade or security or other issues, would disappear overnight.
That's what a clean break would mean. What is the backstop?
While arguing for a swift exit, the Brexit Party has also called for its newly elected MEPs to play a ""major role"" in the Brexit negotiations.
But as the Brexit Party is not in government and has no MPs in the House of Commons that is highly unlikely. The only direct role Brexit Party MEPs might have is if the withdrawal agreement was ever to pass in the House of Commons - there would then be a vote in the European Parliament to ratify it.
A clean break also means - and this was a promise that appeared on a pledge card the Brexit Party produced during the campaign - that it would refuse to pay the £39bn financial settlement, or ""divorce bill"", that the government has agreed in order to settle past debts and future obligations to the EU. WTO terms
And it means the party wants to leave the EU on - as it puts it - World Trade Organization (WTO) terms .
It sounds very simple, and it is a phrase that is also used by several contenders for the Conservative Party leadership.
But what does it mean in practice? Not a lot.
The basic rules of the WTO are really just the baseline of international trade, which don't offer more than the most rudimentary of benefits.
A lot of Brexit supporters - including the Brexit Party - argue that the UK can use something called Article 24 (of GATT - the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) to ensure that the UK can still enjoy free or frictionless trade with the EU.
It would mean no tariffs or taxes would be imposed on goods crossing borders between the UK and its largest trading partner, the European Union.
The trouble with that argument is that you can only use Article 24 if two parties are willing to make an agreement - in this case, the UK and the EU. Neither can impose it on the other.
In other words, you have to agree a deal first and the Brexit Party, along with several would-be Conservative leaders, are prepared to leave without a deal. EU negotiations
Mr Farage argues that there will in fact be a deal of some kind because the EU needs one.
He has been fond of saying that when push comes to shove the EU would ""come running"" to do a quick trade deal with the UK.
That's quite a gamble.
It is certainly true that any significant disruption to trade would hurt both sides, but the EU has said consistently that it values the integrity of its single market more than free trade with the UK, and that that will be its priority.
Of course no deal or a ""clean break"" is not an end in itself. Eventually - and sooner rather than later - the two sides would have to start talking again about a future agreement.
The 27 other EU countries have already agreed that if there is no deal then the first thing they would want to talk to the UK about after Brexit would not be a trade deal.
It would be the financial settlement, citizens' rights and the Irish border - exactly those issues that are dealt with in detail in the withdrawal agreement that has been rejected three times in the House of Commons.
The Brexit Party is offering simple solutions. But the Brexit process is full of complex problems. "
European elections 2019: Slow progress in Irish counts - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Shane Harrison Bbc Ni Dublin Correspondent,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48423896,"Image caption Just two of the Republic of Ireland's 13 seats have so far been filled European election counting has been suspended in one of Republic of Ireland's constituencies following a dispute over vote transfers.
The count in Dublin will resume at 11:00 local time on Tuesday morning.
The dispute comes over the potential distribution of votes for the two remaining seats in the Dublin constituency.
Three of the Republic of Ireland's 13 European Parliament seats have been filled so far.
Counting in the Republic began on Sunday night, but progress has been slow.
Fine Gael's Mairead McGuinness was re-elected in the Midlands-North-West constituency with 134,630 votes.
She will be joined in the European Parliament by the Green Party's Ciaran Cuffe and Fine Gael's Frances Fitzgerald, who were elected in Dublin on the 13th and 14th count respectively.
Image caption Mairead McGuinness is the European Parliament's vice-president The two remaining Dublin seats will be taken by Fianna Fáil's Barry Andrews and Clare Daly of Independents 4 Change.
However, a dispute over whether votes will be distributed between the pair has brought the count to a halt.
The potential transfers will decide which one finishes third and fourth in the poll. The fourth and final seat will only become active if and when Britain leaves the EU, as it one of the UK's parliament seats that has been redistributed by the EU.
Earlier, Ms McGuinness said she was ""delighted, relieved and a bit tired"" to retain her seat.
Durkan eliminated ""I am deeply honoured and humbled by the size of the mandate I have received,"" she said.
Turnout in the election was 49.7%, with the governing Fine Gael party topping the poll with 29.6% of first preferences.
Fianna Fáil had 16.5%, Sinn Féin had 11.7% just ahead of the Green Party with 11.4%, while independents took 15.7% of the vote.
The former SDLP leader, Mark Durkan, who stood in Dublin, has been eliminated.
He said that voters cared less about Brexit than domestic issues.
He added that he did not regret standing for Fine Gael even though the party he once led in Northern Ireland has a working relationship with Fianna Fáil - Fine Gael's traditional rival.
As in the Republic's local elections, Sinn Féin's vote is down.
The party's Dublin MEP, Lynn Boylan, will struggle to hold her seat against the challenge from the independent left-wing Clare Daly, with anxious waits also for Liadh Ní Riada in Ireland South and Matt Carthy in Ireland Midlands-North-West.
'Fragile relationship' Fianna Fáil, the main opposition party, which is in a confidence-and-supply arrangement with Fine Gael, performed the best of all the parties in the local elections.
Image copyright PA Image caption Mark Durkan - who stood for Fine Gael - accepted that other issues eclipsed his anti-Brexit message But Fine Gael is expected to do much better in the European elections.
With a number of members of the Dáil (Irish parliament) certain to be returned as MEPs, there will have to be by-elections, which could destabilise the already fragile relationship between the two biggest parties.
And while both have agreed to continue their confidence-and-supply arrangement for another October budget because of Brexit uncertainty in the UK, there has been a lot of parsing of comments made by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar about another return to the polls.
Image caption Counting in the Republic began on Sunday In two separate interviews with Irish national broadcaster RTÉ, he said he could not rule out a general election this year, but he would not call one in the coming days or weeks.
That has led some to speculate about the possibility of a late-June poll given that the UK will not be leaving the EU before the end of October.
It is the taoiseach's prerogative to call an election - voters will have to wait and see what he decides."
Baltimore ransomware attack: NSA faces questions - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48423954,"The New York Times said the agency did not disclose the problem to Microsoft for more than five years until a breach forced its hand.
Microsoft released a fix for EternalBlue flaw in March 2017.
Weeks later, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers leaked the NSA's related hacking tool online .
The NSA has never confirmed how it came to lose control of its code nor officially commented on the affair.
But the suggestion is that if it had shared its findings with Microsoft at an earlier stage, fewer PCs would have been exposed to subsequent attacks that made use of the vulnerability. Email lock-out
Thousands of Baltimore's city government computers were frozen on 7 May after their files became digitally scrambled.
The criminals responsible demanded 13 Bitcoin ($114,440; £90,200) to unlock them all, or three Bitcoin to release specific systems ahead of a deadline, which has now passed.
The authorities refused. Image copyright City of Baltimore Image caption The city's website informs vistors that it cannot currently process online payments
Local residents have been unable to pay utility bills, parking tickets and some taxes online as a consequence.
In addition, staff have been unable to send or receive emails from their normal accounts.
Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger have told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that they are now seeking ""a full briefing"" directly from the NSA.
""We must ensure that the tools developed by our agencies do not make their way into the hands of bad actors,"" the senator told the paper.
Some security experts say if EternalBlue is truly involved, then IT managers should have installed a patch long ago. Report
But one consultant noted that this may have been easier said than done.
""For some organisations, patching can be a non-trivial exercise, even with a couple of years of lead time,"" said Troy Hunt.
""Specialised systems such as medical devices, for example, often go unpatched for long periods of time.
""Offsetting that risk are factors such as the devices not being internet-connected. although given we're still seeing infections due to EternalBlue two years after it was patched, evidently there are still systems out there both unpatched and exposed."" On the ground in Baltimore:
It's not exactly the talk of the town here - after all, it's not like Facebook has gone down, merely crucial public services.
For those who have been affected, it's very frustrating - a delayed house sale here, a new business that can't open on schedule there. One person told me about how they have been unable to pay for their wedding venue at a place part-owned by the city.
Another told me they couldn't go online to pay a parking ticket - that's not as fortunate as it sounds, trust me.
A further kick in the teeth for this city is the suggestion that this attack used an exploit discovered not by the Russians or Chinese, but by an organisation based just 20 miles away - the US National Security Agency.
City officials want answers on that, but locals don't want it to be a scapegoat. There have been repeated warnings here about severe underinvestment in government IT infrastructure. Related Topics"
Romania corruption: PSD chief Liviu Dragnea jailed - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48421430,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright EPA The head of Romania's ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD), Liviu Dragnea, has been jailed for corruption after his attempts to appeal an earlier conviction failed.
Romania's Supreme Court upheld on Monday a three-and-a-half year prison sentence against Dragnea.
The politician, 56, was found guilty last year of having two party members paid by a state agency for fake jobs.
The ruling came as his PSD suffered huge losses at the European elections.
Prosecutors said that by using his influence as a government official, Dragnea procured fake jobs at a child protection agency for two women working for his party.
The women admitted to working for the party while receiving salaries from the agency.
Dragnea, who denies any wrongdoing, appealed the initial verdict and was allowed to remain free.
In live footage on Romanian television on Monday, the powerful politician was seen being driven in a police car into the Rahova prison on the outskirts of Bucharest.
Dragnea is widely viewed as the most powerful figure in Romanian politics. Romania's mini-motorway built to shame a nation
He was barred from becoming prime minister because of a 2016 conviction for vote-rigging.
But observers say he has still wielded power from behind the scenes, directing his PSD and the government they lead.
The politician was a key figure in the PSD's push for controversial judicial reforms, which have chipped away at the independence of the courts, sparking mass protests in Romania and clashes with the European Union.
The ruling on Monday came as Dragnea's PSD suffered major losses in the European election.
The party fell to second place, behind the opposition National Liberal party, gaining less than 23% of the vote.
Dragnea is also under investigation in a separate case for allegedly forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects.
He has maintained his innocence in the cases against him, saying the charges are politically motivated. Related Topics "

Steve Biro snapped the image of Bruce the bald eagle at the Canadian Raptor Conservancy and first posted it on some Facebook photography groups.
The image of the bird of prey ""staring daggers"" at the photographer with its piercing eyes has since gone viral.
The photo is one of several hundred Mr Biro took of the bird that day.
""He's squared up perfectly, both wings are touching the water,"" he told the BBC. ""That [photograph] was the one that struck me as as little more special than the others. But I still didn't even know how it would resonate with people.""
The photograph eventually made it to the front page of Reddit and has since been picked up by media around the world.
Mr Biro says the eagle, which is used to photographers visiting the bird rehabilitation and research centre in Ontario, seemed irked at where he was positioned with his camera.
""He was actually trying to brush me away from where I was perched,"" he said.
""I could feel the breeze from his wings as he flew over me. The other people who were there were gasping as he came over my head. It was really quite exhilarating.""
Mr Biro said as soon as he got up off the rock where he had been sitting, Bruce the eagle flew over and claimed the spot. "

"Climate activism failing to represent BAME groups, say campaigners - BBC News",www.bbc.com,Hanna Yusuf Bbc News,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48373540,"Climate activism failing to represent BAME groups, say campaigners By Hanna Yusuf BBC News 27 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Press Association The mother of Ella Kissi-Debrah - the nine-year-old girl whose fatal asthma attack may have been linked to illegal levels of pollution - has said there is a lack of representation in climate activism.
People living in parts of London with high proportions of black, mixed or other ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by air pollution compared to those in areas with a high proportion of white people, according to research by the Mayor of London.
Yet people from BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) backgrounds are often invisible in climate protest, says Rosamund Kissi-Debrah - who is due to speak at the World Health Organization on Monday. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The effects of air pollution on human health
Ms Kissi-Debrah, who lost her daughter in 2013, says black or ethnic minority people care about climate change as much as other groups.
""I focus on air pollution, obviously because of what happened to my daughter, but also because people where I live care about pollution.
""Pollution has a direct impact on their lives."" Climate change: Where are we now?
Echoing Ms Kissi-Debrah's comment is Professor Akwugo Emejulu - a sociology lecturer at the University of Warwick specialising in women of colour's activism in Europe.
She says the main reason for what she sees as their lack of representation in activism lies in some of the tactics used by action groups, such as Extinction Rebellion.
One of the strategies adopted by Extinction Rebellion during their 10-day demonstration in April was to get as many activists as possible arrested.
Prof Emejulu says some black campaigners are put off this approach because they fear violence and hostility from the police.
Samantha Moyo is the coordinator for Extinction Rebellion Together - a section within the group that provides training on diversity.
She says it took a lot of effort to overcome her fear of police when joining protest campaigns.
""I don't know what it is about being black that makes you feel scared around police,"" she said.
""I've always got a feeling of, 'they're going to get me - out of everyone here, they're going to come for me'."" Image copyright Gustavo Papaleo Image caption Extinction Rebellion's Samantha Moyo says police presence at protests acts as a barrier of entry for people of colour
Ms Moyo says she only felt safe from police at the latest protests because she was ""holding hands with a fellow protester, who was white"".
She says police could help to reduce the fear sometimes felt by people of colour if they behaved in a more approachable way.
""Something as simple as a smile. Or maybe something like a declaration from a police department, saying: 'We admit this has been a problem', that would be quite healing.
""Or even allowing or creating spaces for people who are traumatised by police to share their stories. A lot of people of colour are traumatised."" Police investigated over teen's injuries
Kids of Colour - a platform for young ethnic minority people to explore identity and ""challenge institutional racism"" - says climate protests do not always allow for the realities they face.
School students around the world recently went on strike to demand action on climate change, but some at Kids of Colour question how inclusive the protests were.
""The school strikes have been fantastic to witness, but it is also a privilege to be able to skip school,"" says one representative.
""Many young people of colour feel a pressure to succeed in education because society does not work in their favour."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Greta Thunberg is the 16-year-old Swedish teen behind the school climate strikes
Economic inequality can be another barrier for people of ethnic and minority backgrounds who are affected by climate change, says Ms Kissi-Debrah.
""Can you imagine giving up 10 days [of work] to sit in central London? It is absolutely not feasible for those in low-paid jobs.
""I'm not saying everyone in Extinction Rebellion is in a privileged situation, but a lot of them were in jobs that make it easier for them to take time off work."" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate activists in Cardiff Bay say ""concrete action"" is needed now - not in the future
The Wretched of the Earth, which describes itself as ""a collective of grassroots indigenous, black, brown and diaspora groups"", wrote an open letter to Extinction Rebellion asking the group to rethink its tactics.
While commending Extinction Rebellion's successes, the letter said ethnic and minority voices were missing from the movement and need to be included early on, in order to effectively challenge systems upholding ""racism, sexism and classism"".
Referencing Miss Thunberg's ""house on fire"" analogy, the group said: ""Our communities have been on fire for a long time and these flames are fanned by our exclusion and silencing.""
So how can pressure groups draw everyone in?
People from BAME backgrounds need to be taken into consideration from the very start, says Prof Emejulu.
""It's not about organising in your own terms and then trying to draw people in. You have to be embedded in the communities with the people that are affected by this.
""It's also about democracy - if democracy isn't reflected in your activism then that's a problem."" Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police prepare to move Extinction Rebellion demonstrators during a march in London
Ms Moyo says Extinction Rebellion is working on taking action to ensure that people of colour are not being left out.
""I'm excited about what we're doing,"" she says, ""because we'll be raising awareness and providing training around racism, colonialism, systemic trauma and other important issues.""
Other campaign groups are also addressing the matter.
Greens of Colour is part of the Green Party, aiming to represent BAME members. And Friends of the Earth (FoE) has also acknowledged there is a problem with diversity in climate debates.
In particular, says an FoE spokeswoman, groups need to be better at recruitment and ""bringing people in that the sector hasn't done very much to interest"".
FoE now gives potential supporters a variety of ways to join and tries to make sure they see their experiences reflected in campaigns.
The spokeswoman adds: ""But we own that we have a long way to go."""

Two ex-Liberal ministers to seek re-election as independents - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48360557,"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jody Wilson-Raybould (L) and Health Minister Jane Philpott (R) Two Canadian politicians who were expelled from the Liberal party over the SNC-Lavalin affair are running again as independents.
Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott have both announced their intention to seek re-election later this year.
The two former cabinet ministers had cried foul over how the Trudeau government was handling the prosecution of the Quebec firm.
The next Canadian general election is scheduled for this October.
""I am confident running as an independent is the best way to transform our political culture,"" Ms Wilson-Raybould told reporters in Vancouver on Monday.
In a separate announcement in a Toronto suburb, Ms Philpott also announced her intention to run again without any party affiliation.
Ms Philpott and Ms Wilson-Raybould both said that Canadians need to elect more politicians empowered to represent their constituents in the House of Commons.
Earlier this year, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned from her cabinet post and accused Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and members of his inner circle of attempting to meddle in a criminal case involving SNC-Lavalin.
Not long after, Ms Philpott - one of Mr Trudeau's top ministers - quit, saying she has lost confidence in the government's handling of the affair.
Wh at is the background ?
Both former ministers were central actors in a political controversy that dogged Mr Trudeau for weeks and hammered at his popularity.
The affair began in early February, when the Globe and Mail newspaper reported allegations of political interference in the case against SNC-Lavalin.
The newspaper reported that Mr Trudeau's office had pressured Ms Wilson-Raybould - at the time serving as federal justice minister and attorney general - to push the public prosecution service to consider a deferred prosecution agreement for the firm.
An attorney general is supposed to act independently with respect of his or her prosecutorial function. Three ways this story is a problem for Trudeau
On 12 February, Ms Wilson-Raybould resigned suddenly from cabinet.
She later testified before a parliamentary committee that, as attorney general, she and her staff had faced four months of a ""sustained"" and ""inappropriate effort"" to push for a possible agreement for SNC-Lavalin.
The agreement - similar to regimes in the US and the UK - essentially suspends prosecution while allowing a firm to agree instead to alternative terms or conditions.
Ms Philpott resigned shortly after.
In April, Mr Trudeau expelled both women from the Liberal party caucus, saying that trust had been broken between the two and other Liberal MPs.
SNC-Lavalin is one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies.
The company and two of its subsidiaries face fraud and corruption charges in relation to approximately C$48m ($36m; £28m) in bribes it is alleged to have offered to Libyan officials between 2001 and 2011.
It has openly lobbied to be allowed to enter into a remediation agreement instead of going to trial, saying it has cleaned house and changed its ways. Related Topics "

The SNP leader predicted victory in a second vote, with Scotland becoming ""an independent country just like Ireland"".
Ms Sturgeon also confirmed legislation setting out the rules for another independence referendum will be published at Holyrood on Wednesday.
Sturgeon wants Scottish independence referendum by 2021 Will there be indyref2 before May 2021? UK government 'will say no indyref2' The first minister, who met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during her Irish trip, had previously said she wanted to hold a second vote on Scottish independence by May 2021 if the country was taken out of the EU.
'Right time' Speaking after her party secured 37.7% of the Scottish vote in the European elections she gave a clearer indication of her preferred timeframe.
Ms Sturgeon said: ""There will be another Scottish independence referendum and I will make a prediction today that Scotland will vote for independence and we will become an independent country just like Ireland, and the strong relationship between our two countries now will become even stronger soon.
""I want to see Scotland having the choice of independence within this term of the Scottish Parliament, which ends in May 2021, so towards the latter half of next year would be when I think is the right time for that choice.""
Image copyright PA Image caption Ms Sturgeon met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Monday In a separate BBC interview, Ms Sturgeon said she would bring forward legislation later this week at Holyrood paving the way for a second independence vote.
She said: ""This week we will bring forward legislation to put in place the rules for giving people the choice in an independence referendum over a Brexit future or a future as an independent European nation.""
Ms Sturgeon has previously said that in order to put a future Yes vote beyond doubt or challenge, she would want the UK government to give Holyrood the power to hold a new referendum through a ""Section 30 order"" or similar mechanism.
The UK government has insisted it would not support such a vote at the present time, arguing that the matter was supposed to be ""settled for a generation"" by the independence referendum in 2014.
The Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden criticised the first minister's comments on independence, accusing her of ""hypocritical deceit"".
He said: ""The SNP went into this election pretending to voters that it was nothing to do with independence.
""Yet within hours of it being announced, Nicola Sturgeon is specifically using it to argue for separation.
""That's fraudulent behaviour from an SNP government that's meant to be running the country, not trying to break it up."""

Having been backed by BBC Music Introducing, The 1975 have risen through the ranks of not only Big Weekend, but festivals all over the world.

""We're all music obsessives.
""There are really interesting guitar bands around like Black Midi and Pale Waves.""
The latter are signed to the same label as The 1975 and have toured with them several times. Image caption The 1975 headlined Radio 1's Big Weekend in Middlesbrough on Sunday
They're also about to record an EP to follow their 2018 debut album, which Matty will have a hand in overseeing.
""It's so good to have such a creative mind on our side,"" says Pale Waves singer Heather Baron-Gracie, who performed at the festival earlier in the day.
""When we were on tour he'd just walk into our dressing room and say: 'Let's try this on the new stuff' or 'that's not really working'.
""They're really inspiring to a band like us.
""Because they've been doing it for so long we really respect what he has to say.""
Matty says having that level influence on the careers of younger artists is something he takes very seriously.
""We're working with so many new artists.
""We're so lucky to be able to do shows like this and then try to bring people with us and create the same world for them.""

Fertility paradox in male beauty quest - BBC News,www.bbc.com,James Gallagher Health,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48396071,"Fertility paradox in male beauty quest By James Gallagher Health and science correspondent, BBC News 28 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Scientists have uncovered an evolutionary paradox where men damage their ability to have children during efforts to make themselves look more attractive.
Taking steroids to get a buff physique or anti-baldness pills to keep a full head of hair can damage fertility.
It has been named the Mossman-Pacey paradox after the scientists who first described it.
They say it causes a lot of heartache in couples struggling to conceive.
""I noticed some men coming in to have their fertility tested and these guys were huge,"" says Dr James Mossman, now at Brown University in the United States.
He was studying for his doctorate in Sheffield when he made the connection with steroid abuse.
He told the BBC: ""They are trying to look really big, to look like the pinnacles of evolution.
""But they are making themselves very unfit in an evolutionary sense, because without exception they had no sperm in their ejaculation at all."" Image caption Dr Mossman and Prof Pacey: Originators of the paradox theory
Anabolic steroids mimic the effect of the male hormone testosterone in the body and are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase muscle growth.
They are regularly used by bodybuilders.
Prof Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield, added: ""Isn't it ironic that men go to the gym to look wonderful, for the most part to attract women, and inadvertently decrease their fertility.""
Anabolic steroids fool the brain's pituitary gland into thinking the testes are going into overdrive.
So the glands react by shutting down the production of two hormones - called FSH and LH - which are the key hormones that drive the production of sperm.
The researchers say there is a similar theme in men using medication to prevent male pattern baldness.
The drug finasteride changes the way testosterone is metabolised in the body and can limit hair loss, but side effects can include erectile dysfunction and a hit to fertility.
Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""I would say more anabolic steroid users are likely to become sterile than you would think - 90% probably.
""Baldness is a bit more hit-and-miss, but sales are going through the roof and that makes it an increasingly common problem."" 'Evolutionary dud'
The measure of success in evolutionary terms is passing on your genes (instructions in your DNA) to the next generation.
Dr Mossman said taking these vanity-based medications might make you more attractive but could turn you into ""an evolutionary dud"".
It is not the equivalent of the extravagant peacock's tail, which makes males more attractive to females and increases the chances of passing genes on to the next generation.
There are some examples in the natural world where an animal sacrifices their ability to breed.
Some bird species perform co-operative breeding in which individuals forego having their own offspring to help raise the descendants of close relatives.
But even this can make sense in evolutionary terms as half of your genes are shared with siblings so they are still being passed on, just indirectly.
Dr Mossman suspects ""thinking you're more appealing to the opposite sex, but killing your fertility"" is probably unique to humans.
Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""The irony is one thing, but I think the key message is for fertility patients.
""It keeps cropping up in clinics and the message is not getting out to young men that it's a problem and a bit of info could save them a lot of heartache.""

Poland was the biggest net recipient of the EU budget (getting more back than it contributed in the first place), followed by Greece, Romania, Hungary and Portugal.
Luxembourg and Belgium, two of the richest EU countries, are also on the list of EU budget net recipients because they receive a high proportion of the funding for administration as many EU institutions, such as the Commission and the European Parliament, are based there.

Judge Bruno Savino ruled on Monday that Adélio Bispo de Oliveira was not fully aware of his actions at the time and cannot be jailed over the incident.
Instead he should be referred to a mental health institution, he said.
Mr Bolsonaro, who required surgery after the incident, said he believed the attack was politically motivated.
However police had earlier said they would investigate Mr de Oliveira's mental health after he told them he was acting ""on God's orders"".
Judge Savino said his decision on Monday was based on reports presented by Mr de Oliveira's defence lawyers. Brazil's unlikely president
Mr Bolsonaro, 64, suffered a deep and life-threatening wound to his intestines and lost 40% of his blood when he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally in Minas Gerais last September.
The far-right politician was placed in intensive care, fed intravenously and had to have a colostomy bag fitted. The bag - a small pouch used to collect waste from the body when the digestive system is no longer functioning as a result of an illness or injury - was removed in January.

Mr Bolsonaro, who took office as the country's new president on 1 January this year, is a divisive politician whom some analysts have compared to US President Donald Trump.
Adélio Bispo de Oliveira, meanwhile, is a left-wing supporter who had been very vocal in his criticism of Mr Bolsonaro, posting messages on Facebook denouncing his policies.
Immediately after the attack in September, he was grabbed by supporters of Mr Bolsonaro, manhandled and beaten before being taken into police custody. Related Topics "

Contenders to be the UK's next prime minister are making their pitches to fellow Conservative members, a day after waking up to news of a disastrous European election performance. And after some candidates said the option of leaving the European Union without a deal must be retained, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggests his party would be committing ""political suicide"" by actively pursuing this alternative through a general election. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hunt says the strategy would have Labour's Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 by Christmas.
Environment Secretary Michael Gove has a different focus , pledging to allow EU nationals living in the UK at the time of the referendum to apply free of charge for citizenship. International Development Secretary Rory Stewart tells the BBC he would make space for a national conversation on Brexit, while Housing Minister Kit Malthouse declares his intention to run via the Sun, describing himself as ""the new face, with fresh new ideas"".

Peter O'Neill told reporters on Sunday he was going to hand power over in the interest of ""political stability"".
The decision followed a series of high-level defections to the opposition.
But Mr O'Neill has yet to formally hand in his resignation, and launched a bid to block a no-confidence vote in his government with the Supreme Court.
What's more, the ally he said he would hand power to - Sir Julius Chan - has now said it was a ""huge misunderstanding"" and he would not become prime minister.
Sir Julius, a former prime minister, told The Guardian that ""the existing prime minister has no power to nominate a new prime minister"".
Papua New Guinea country profile PNG missing 300 cars after global summit Mr O'Neill's leadership has been under pressure over a range of issues, including a multi-billion-dollar gas project signed this year with French company Total and the US firm ExxonMobil.
Although the project would almost double PNG's gas exports, local communities have raised fears that they will be excluded from the benefits.
An attempt by the opposition to hold a no-confidence vote earlier this month was stalled after the government adjourned parliament for several weeks.
But with parliament reconvening on Tuesday, opposition figures warned they would press ahead with plans to topple Mr O'Neill - who has been in power since 2011.
If he does officially resign, MPs will get to choose a new prime minister. The opposition says it has enough support to form a new government.
The court has said it will hear Mr O'Neill's challenge on Friday."

He said he would ""always be Labour"" but acted ""in the best interests of what the Labour Party should be doing"" by supporting a pro-Remain party.
Shadow minister Dawn Butler said members who admitted voting for another party were ""automatically excluded"".
""It's just part of the rule book. Everyone knows that,"" she said.
Mr Campbell, a lead campaigner for another Brexit referendum, revealed during the BBC's election night broadcast on Sunday that he had voted Liberal Democrat.
After his expulsion, he told reporters: ""I think it's a strange thing to do, and I think people will inevitably draw the contrast between the lack of rapidity in dealing with cases involving anti-Semitism.""

Mr Campbell added that he believed other Labour MPs, councillors and peers voted in the same way as he did to try and make the leadership alter its position on Brexit.

Following Mr Campbell's expulsion from the party, former Labour ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth said they had voted for parties other than Labour in the European elections.
Calling on Labour to reinstate Mr Campbell, Mr Clarke said he voted Liberal Democrat as a ""one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour's position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit"".
The former home secretary said Mr Campbell's expulsion was ""a disgrace and only compounds Labour's current political difficulties"".
Mr Ainsworth - a defence secretary in Gordon Brown's government - told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: ""Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life.
""I didn't intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so.""
Who is Alastair Campbell? Image copyright PA Image caption Alastair Campbell with former PM Tony Blair Mr Campbell was a political journalist before coming to prominence in Whitehall as a key member of the Labour PM's staff in 1994.
He served as Mr Blair's chief press secretary until 2000 and was a controversial figure, heavily involved in policy, including over the Iraq War.
Since leaving government, he has opened up about his struggles with depression and alcoholism, and works with a number of charities.
He also campaigns for the People's Vote and is editor-at-large of The New European magazine.
Labour MPs have used Twitter to criticise the move to expel Alastair Campbell.
Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that Mr Campbell was ""expelled quicker than a man who threatened to kill me [and] quicker than a man in my [local party] who denied the Holocaust"", adding: ""Both are only still suspended.""
Barking MP and campaigner against anti-Semitism Margaret Hodge said the party's ""priorities are all wrong"",
And former Lord Chancellor in Mr Blair's government, Lord Falconer, said Mr Campbell was ""Labour through and through"", adding: ""Voting [Lib Dem] once in a lifetime on one issue should not lead to expulsion.""
But Labour activist and commentator Owen Jones questioned why there was ""controversy"" over his expulsion, adding: ""The rule is, if you say you're voting for another party, you auto exclude yourself.
""Those arguing this rule shouldn't apply to Alastair Campbell do so because they agree with him and for no other reason.""
Last week, veteran Conservative and pro-European Lord Heseltine admitted he planned to vote Lib Dem in the election. The party responded by effectively expelling him.
'Catastrophe' Labour's share of the vote fell to 14% in last week's European elections and several senior figures have blamed a lack of clarity around Brexit.
The party agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election.
But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"".
Deputy leader Tom Watson said that nuanced stance had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", while former PM Tony Blair said it was not ""possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides"".
After the results, Mr Corbyn insisted his policy had been ""very clear"" all along - but sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote""."

The rhino once roamed across much of Asia, but has now almost disappeared from the wild, with fewer than one hundred animals believed to exist.
The death of Tam, who lived at a wildlife reserve on the island of Borneo, was announced on Monday.
A female called Iman is now the only remaining member of the species in Malaysia.
After decades of deforestation and poaching, it's now thought only 30 to 100 Sumatran rhinos remain in the wild, most on the nearby island of Sumatra.
Tam was aged 30 or more and had been living at a reserve in the Malaysian state of Sabah since being discovered wandering in a palm oil plantation in 2008.
Efforts to breed him with two captured females proved unsuccessful.

Announcing his death, Malaysian officials said Tam was believed to have died of old age, although more would be known following a post mortem.
Cathy Dean, CEO of the London-based charity, Save the Rhino International, said despite the death of Tam, there was still hope that the species could be saved from extinction.
Sumatran rhinos have been hard hit by poaching and habitat loss, but the biggest threat facing the species today is the fragmented nature of their populations. Image copyright Save the Rhino International Image caption Rosa is one of the last remaining hopes for the future of the species
""Sumatran rhinos have really suffered from the fragmentation of their habitat,"" said Cathy Dean.
""With logging, with roads for development, the patches of forest available are shrinking. Frankly it's hard for them to find each other to mate and breed successfully.""
Hopes rest on a last-ditch attempt to bring together male and female rhinos, which are naturally solitary animals, for breeding purposes.
Experts believe that as few as 20 unrelated individuals could provide enough genetic diversity to save the species from extinction.
""There are a few animals in captivity in the Sumatran rhino sanctuary, and we're trying to get those to breed as fast as we can,"" she said. Shrinking habitat
The Sumatran rhino once roamed from the foothills of the Himalayas in Bhutan and north-eastern India, through southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and the Malay Peninsula, and onto the islands of Sumatra and Borneo in Indonesia.
The species is now confined mainly to Sumatra and is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN .
The IUCN says over-hunting for its horn and other medicinal products has driven the animal to the brink of extinction.
There are a handful of Sumatran rhinos in captivity, mostly in Indonesia and Malaysia, with a few in the US.

Mr Varadkar's comments come after Theresa May announced she will stand down from her position on 7 June.
The taoiseach said there was a ""possibility that the new British prime minister may try to repudiate the withdrawal agreement"".
In response, DUP leader Arlene Foster said Mr Varadkar should recognise the flaws in the withdrawal agreement.
Mr Varadkar said Ireland will ""stand firm"" on its position against a hard border between NI and Ireland.
Theresa May quits: UK set for new PM PM's exit 'may be dangerous' for Ireland ""There is growing risk of no deal. There is of course a possibility that there may be a new British government that might follow a different course, a more European course, I can't predict either of those things,"" Mr Varadkar said in Brussels, ahead of an EU summit of European leaders.
""But what I can say is the European Union and Ireland will stand firm in our position that there can't be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and we need a legal Treaty guarantee of that.""

""There's no question about the fact that the Brexit Party did very well in the European elections in Britain, and so did all the Remain parties. If you add up their support, it's slightly higher in fact,"" said Mr Varadkar.

""There is one unionist, one Alliance Party MEP and one nationalist.

""Northern Ireland had two 'remain' MEPs before the election too.""
Last week, Theresa May announced she would quit as Conservative leader, paving the way for a leadership contest.
While the official race gets underway in early June, several members of the party have announced their candidacy.
It is expected the winner, due to be announced in late July, will also become the prime minister.
One of those seeking nomination is Jeremy Hunt, who told BBC Radio Radio 4's Today programme he would create a new UK negotiating team - drawn from all sides of the Tory Party, plus members of Northern Ireland's DUP.

When asked about Mr Hunt's suggestion, Mr Varadkar said it would be ""for the new prime minister to decide how to structure their negotiating team""."

""My heart is sore for Lynn Boylan,"" Ms Anderson said.
""There's obviously a disconnection between ourselves and the voters. I think the turnout across the board shows that all the political parties need to re-engage more,"" she said.

During a press conference in Tokyo on Monday, Mr Trump said he agreed with North Korea when it called Mr Biden a ""low IQ individual"".
The Biden campaign responded that the president's comments were ""beneath the dignity of the office"".
Mr Biden is the current front-runner to face Mr Trump in next year's election.
Defending his comments in a tweet on Tuesday, the US president appeared to suggest that he had been generous when quoting the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's description of Mr Biden.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil.

What surprise US Supreme Court ruling means for abortion - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Anthony Zurcher North America Reporter,05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48440094,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The abortion battle explained in three minutes In a surprise move, the Supreme Court has issued a pair of decisions on an Indiana law restricting abortions, offering clues on how the nine-member court - with two new justices appointed by Donald Trump - could view the contentious issue in the days and years ahead.
The court's actions were a mixed bag for those on both sides of the abortion debate.
In an unsigned opinion, the justices upheld a state requirement that all foetal remains - whether the product of a miscarriage or an abortion - be either buried or cremated.
Anti-abortion activists viewed the provision as a step toward recognising foetal tissue not as medical waste but as human remains deserving dignified treatment.
Abortion rights groups countered that the Supreme Court precedent does not consider a foetus to be human. The purpose of the Indiana law, Planned Parenthood wrote in a statement, is to ""shame and stigmatise"" women seeking abortions.
A majority of the justices sided with Indiana, holding that the burial provision advanced a legitimate interest of the state, even if the law wasn't ""perfectly tailored"" to address foetal remains in all circumstances. Image copyright Getty Images
The second portion of the Indiana law at issue was where the real fireworks could have erupted - but didn't. The justices declined to reverse, or even review, a lower court's ruling invalidating the portion of the Indiana law that prohibited elective abortions performed because of the race, gender or ""disability"" of the foetus.
While there is little evidence of abortions performed because of race or gender in the US, physicians regularly test for foetal abnormalities, presenting parents with the decision of whether to terminate the pregnancy. In pictures - protests across US against abortion bans
If the court had chosen to consider the case - with full legal briefings, oral arguments and a ruling sometime next year - it could have served as the vehicle to reverse the 1973 Roe v Wade precedent upholding a woman's unfettered right to abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Instead, the court sidestepped the matter, prompting a rebuke from Jeanne Mancini, president of March for Life.
""No one deserves to lose her life just because she was born with Down syndrome or because of the colour of her skin,"" she said. Image copyright Getty Images
Justice Clarence Thomas, a conservative member of the court, agreed with the decision - but said his colleagues would eventually have to act.
""Given the potential for abortion to become a tool of eugenic manipulation, the Court will soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana's,"" he wrote in a concurring opinion.
With nearly a dozen states enacting new abortion regulations and outright prohibitions in 2019, this won't be the only opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider whether there is a constitutional right to abortion. How US abortion debate got to this point
Anti-abortion activists, and state legislatures with anti-abortion majorities, may believe that with the addition of Mr Trump's appointments, there is a majority on the court willing to finally put a stake through the heart of Roe.
Tuesday's decisions, however - made with little fanfare and no advanced notice - could be an indication that a majority of the justices on the court are in no hurry to reverse 46 years of precedent.
That won't stop the issue from being pulled into the vortex of America presidential politics, however.
Several Democratic candidates are calling for congressional legislation protecting abortion rights across the US - including states that have recently tried to curtail the procedure.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump has reiterated his opposition to abortion except in the cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.
Content is not available
Also on Tuesday an abortion clinic in St Louis announced that it may be forced to stop performing the procedure on Friday because the state had yet to renew its licence. If that happens, Missouri would become the first state since Roe was decided to have no abortion clinics within its borders. Five other states have only one.
The Indiana ruling could indicate the Supreme Court does not want to wade into abortion politics in the middle of a presidential campaign season. The justices may avoid the issue for now, but they can do little to stop the increasingly heated battle over Roe and the legality of the procedure. Related Topics"

Belgium's ex-King Albert II submits DNA in paternity case - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48440845,"These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption Belgian artist Delphine Boël (L) alleges Albert II is her father Former Belgian King Albert II has submitted a DNA sample to avoid fines of €5,000 (£4,370) a day over claims he fathered a love-child in the 1960s.
The 84-year-old, who has been fighting the paternity claim of Belgian artist Delphine Boël, 51, for over a decade, provided a sample of saliva on Tuesday.
Earlier this month, a Belgian appeals court ruled the former monarch should be penalised for refusing the test.
The ex-king, who reigned from 1993 until 2013, denies the paternity claim.
""He noted that the court had decided that the conclusions of this examination would be strictly confidential until a new judicial decision,"" his lawyer, Alain Berenboom, said in a statement.
A court verdict is not expected until the end of this year.
The former king was ordered by a Brussels court in February to provide a sample within three months or risk being presumed to be the father of Ms Boël. What is the background of the case?
Rumours that the king had an illegitimate child first emerged in 1999 in an unauthorised biography about his wife. The allegation prompted a royal scandal and enduring media gossip in Belgium.
Ms Boël first alleged on the record that King Albert was her biological father during a 2005 interview.
Her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, has claimed the two had an affair between 1966 and 1984 when he was still Prince Albert of Liège.
However, following his older brother's death in 1993 at 62, King Albert unexpectedly came to the throne.
He held the position until July 2013, when he announced his abdication - citing ill health - and was replaced by his son, Philippe. He is said to receive an annual income of about €1m.
Shortly after, Ms Boël opened court proceedings to prove her paternity, provoking speculation the scandal had influenced the move. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Princess Paola of Belgium (later Queen Paola) and Prince Albert of Belgium with their children in 1969
Earlier this year, he refused to fulfil a 2018 court order to undergo DNA testing and launched an appeal.
A court had initially set a three-month limit for him to provide a saliva sample for testing - saying that without it, Ms Boël would be assumed to be his daughter and be eligible for any inheritance.
Belgium has a constitutional monarchy in which the king plays a largely ceremonial role. Who is King Albert II? Born in 1934 as second in line to the throne Married Italian Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria in 1959 The couple have two sons and a daughter Became king in August 1993 following the death of his older brother, King Baudouin With his constitutional role, stepped in during country's 2010-2011 political stalemate Served as monarch for two decades until his 2013 abdication Lost his immunity held as king after abdication Related Topics "
How Nigeria and its president are being held to ransom - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-48435964,"How Nigeria and its president are being held to ransom By Nasidi Adamu Yahaya BBC Africa, Lagos 29 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Nigeria Police Force Image caption Suspected kidnappers carrying guns were arrested last week by police The pomp and ceremony of Muhammadu Buhari's inauguration will not mask the huge challenges the 76-year-old Nigerian president faces during his second term in office - in particular the booming business of kidnapping for ransom.
Even one of the president's relations - a traditional ruler in Daura in northern Nigeria - is currently being held after he was seized from outside his house earlier this month by gunmen.
In March, a well-known Muslim cleric in Kano, who campaigned for Mr Buhari ahead of his re-election, was held for 12 days by kidnappers demanding $833,000 (£657,000) for his release. Image copyright Nigerian Army Image caption Cleric Ahmed Sulaiman (R) said his 12-day ordeal with the kidnappers was terrifying
""Eight young men were assigned to guard us. They would smoke cigarettes and marijuana and blow the smoke into the hut, abusing and threatening to kill us since our people didn't care to bring the ransom in time. They issued all sorts of threats,"" Ahmed Sulaiman told the Daily Trust newspaper, adding that his freedom was secured as part of a prisoner swap .
Gangs nationwide kidnap both rich and poor people, often collecting ransoms of up to $150,000 - and sometimes killing abductees whose families fail to pay.
Before a World Cup match last year, Nigeria and Middlesbrough footballer John Mikel Obi was told that his father had been abducted for a second time, and threatened with death.
""I thought that after the match I would probably find out they had decided to shoot him,"" he said. He reportedly paid $28,000 for his father's release. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Father's kidnap was heartbreaking - Mikel
A major highway out of Abuja, linking the capital to the city of Kaduna, has become so notorious for kidnapping that many travellers are opting to board trains instead, even though the service to Kaduna is limited and racketeers are selling tickets to commuters at inflated prices.
A top ruling party politician and his daughter were abducted on the highway in April, and their driver was shot dead at the scene. Relatives told the BBC that a ransom was paid to free them. 'Fear of farming'
What started as a money-making scheme about 15 years ago in the southern Niger Delta with the kidnapping of oil workers has mushroomed across the country. Syndicates have also been taking a leaf out of Boko Haram's books by using the tactics of the Islamist militants to raid whole communities on motorcycles, making off with their leaders. Image copyright AFP Image caption Nigeria marked five years since the Chibok girls were abducted in April - more than 100 are still missing
When Mr Buhari took his oath of office in 2015, he promised to tackle the Boko Haram insurgency which has blighted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the north-east over the last decade.
The militants' power has diminished over the last four years, but they are still active. Many in the north-east remain homeless or in captivity, including more than 100 of the girls abducted from a school Chibok in 2014 .
Now the high levels of insecurity elsewhere, especially in the north-western states of Zamfara, Kaduna and Katsina, has left many feeling terrorised.
The governor of Katsina, Mr Buhari's home state, told the BBC that he feared there would be a serious food crisis later this year because the fear of kidnapping was keeping so many farmers from their fields. Top challenges for President Buhari Image copyright AFP
Insecurity: The surge of kidnappings and killings by bandits, especially in the north-west, coupled with the resurgence of a Boko Haram faction affiliated to the Islamic State group are his greatest headaches.
Economy: Dependent on oil for 70% of government revenues, fluctuating prices leave the country vulnerable. The World Bank has predicted sluggish growth this year at 2.2% - bad news with unemployment at more than 20% and nearly half the population living in extreme poverty.
Corruption: The president made some efforts in his first term to counter graft, which has seen tens of billions of dollars drain out of the exchequer. But he has been widely criticised for not taking action against some of his associates.
Infrastructure: Despite the billions of dollars being pumped into numerous building projects, the Securities and Exchange Commission has estimated that Nigeria's infrastructure deficit will hit $878bn by 2040, making it hard for businesses to prosper. Nigeria in nine maps and charts
Last month, the Senate said more than 4,000 Nigerians and foreigners were currently being held by kidnappers. However, some MPs conceded that the figure was an estimate and the real tally was possibly higher.
Police chief Mohammed Adamu said that between January and April this year, at least 685 people were kidnapped across the country, 365 of them in the north-west. Operation Puff Adder
Meanwhile, the police spokesman, Frank Mba, told the BBC that officers were being monitored after allegations that security personnel had been involved in the lucrative kidnapping trade - though he said there was no credible information to back up such accusations.

He said the spate of kidnappings had reduced thanks to Operation Puff Adder, a recent initiative to target the ringleaders. He added that 93 suspected kidnappers had been arrested in the last two weeks.
The Nigerian police's Twitter feed is full of posts about the crackdown . However, many are angered by the situation and feel the problem is not being taken seriously - a view apparently supported by headlines such as this from last week's Premium Times: "" 27 Nigerians were kidnapped from four states in 48 hours "".
A joke President Buhari made in response to a question about the kidnappings also misfired on social media. He said about the police chief: ""I think he is losing weight; so, I think he is working very hard."" "

Speaking at a press conference, Song Liuping said the trade ban would also ""directly harm"" American companies and affect jobs.
Washington recently added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence.
The trade ban is part of a wider battle between the US and Huawei.
Washington has moved to block the Chinese company, the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment, on national security concerns.
Huawei has repeatedly denied claims the use of its products presents security risks, and says it is independent from the Chinese government.
""Politicians in the US are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company,"" Mr Song said.

The next US-China battleground What did Huawei say about the trade ban? Mr Song said the decision to put Huawei, which is also the world's second largest smartphone maker, on the so-called ""entity list"" would have far-reaching implications.
""This decision threatens to harm our customers in over 170 countries, including more than three billion consumers who use Huawei products and services around the world.""
""By preventing American companies from doing business with Huawei, the government will directly harm more than 1,200 US companies. This will affect tens of thousands of American jobs.""
What about other US moves against Huawei? Speaking to reporters in Shenzhen, Mr Song also outlined steps that Huawei had taken in relation to a lawsuit it filed against the US government in March .
The case relates to restrictions that prevent US federal agencies from using Huawei products.
Image copyright Getty Images The firm said it has filed a motion for a ""summary judgement"", asking US courts to speed up the process to ""halt illegal action against the company"".
""The US government has provided no evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. There is no gun, no smoke. Only speculation,"" Mr Song said.
A hearing on the motion has been set for 19 September."

Myanmar military accused of fresh war crimes in Rakhine - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48444704,"Myanmar military accused of fresh war crimes in Rakhine 29 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright AFP Image caption More than 30,000 mainly Buddhist civilians have been displaced in the latest fighting Myanmar's army is committing fresh war crimes against ethnic groups in Rakhine state, according to human rights group Amnesty International.
In a new report, Amnesty accuses the army of carrying out extrajudicial killings, torture and arbitrary arrests amid an operation against an ethnic Buddhist guerrilla force.
The army has denied the allegations.
Soldiers were previously accused of mass human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine in 2017. What awaits the Rohingya back in Myanmar?
The military launched new operations in the area this year, after being instructed by the government to ""crush"" the Arakan Army rebels.
The western state is home to a number of ethnic groups of which the Buddhist Rakhine is the biggest.
In its report on Wednesday, Amnesty said civilians had been killed and injured in ""indiscriminate attacks"".
""Less than two years since the world outrage over the mass atrocities committed against the Rohingya population, the Myanmar military is again committing horrific abuses against ethnic groups in Rakhine state,"" Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty's regional director for East and South-East Asia, said in a statement.
""The new operations in Rakhine state show an unrepentant, unreformed and unaccountable military terrorising civilians and committing widespread violations as a deliberate tactic.""
The human rights group made the allegations after speaking to dozens of people living in areas affected by the conflict and analysing photographs, videos and satellite imagery.
The report documents seven unlawful attacks that killed 14 civilians and injured at least 29 more. It also details incidents of torture, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests.
The military admitted last month to killing six unarmed detainees, saying it did so because they tried to grab the soldiers' weapons.
But army spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun denied Amnesty's allegations.
He told AFP news agency that the military acted within the law and ""avoided harming civilians"".
""This was an operation to clear terrorists. We were careful not to commit any war crimes,"" he said.
The Arakan Army was also accused by Amnesty of committing ""abuses against civilians"", including abductions, though on a smaller scale.
A spokesman for the group denied the claims, telling AFP: ""I can firmly say it does not happen.""

English 'short-changed on care funding' - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Nick Triggle Health Correspondent,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48438132,"Image copyright Getty Images Public spending on care for the elderly and disabled is much higher in Scotland and Wales than England, figures show.
In England, £310 per person is spent each year on services such as care homes and home help for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.
But in Scotland, £445 is spent - 43% more than in England - and in Wales it is £414 - 33% more.
The analysis has been produced by the Health Foundation using official spending and population data.
The think-tank said the differences were ""huge"" and had a major impact on the care that could be provided by councils to these vulnerable groups.
What's happened to the social care plan? 'I'll be broke if I live to 100' NHS care funding a 'postcode lottery' It comes after the BBC revealed a number of councils are at risk of running out of their reserves if current spending continues .
Care spending is likely to be a significant factor in this given it accounts for more than half of local authority budgets.
Ministers in England have promised that new plans for care, including funding, will be published soon.
How the system is failing the vulnerable Social affairs correspondent Alison Holt
Over ten months, a Panorama team and I saw for ourselves the dilemmas that social care staff in Somerset were facing almost daily - as they juggled the increasing need for help from people who are older or disabled alongside the county council's severe financial pressures.
At the heart of the difficult decisions they were having to make were people, such as 37-year-old Martine. She has severe arthritis and her husband David was exhausted from caring for her and their triplet sons, day and night.
Or Paul, who had learning disabilities. His family had to fight for a place at a specialist residential home, which cost more than the council felt able to pay.
And then there was Barbara, bewildered by dementia, whose daughter viewed the day centre she attended as a life line. It closed because of council cuts. They were offered alternatives, but they lost something that worked.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Martine has a form of arthritis which means she is completely immobile The pressures we saw are not unique to Somerset, they are being faced across the country as our population ages.
Two things were particularly striking. The first was how hard people were working to plug the gaps in a system buckling under the strain.
The second was the cruelty of seeing families, often at a time of crisis, being confronted by a care system that is confusing, hard to navigate and where few really know what they will have to pay to get the support they need.
Watch BBC Panorama Care in Crisis: Who cares? Wednesday 29 May at 9pm on BBC One
How significant are the differences? Public spending per head tends to be higher in other parts of the UK than it is in England.
Economies of scale and the rural nature of Wales and Scotland are key drivers for this.
But the analysis suggests what is happening with care spending far outstrips this.
For example, health spending in Scotland is just 8% a year more than it is in England - five times less than the difference in care funding.
Anita Charlesworth, from the Health Foundation, said: ""While there are differences in the populations and needs of the UK countries, this cannot possibly account for the huge differences in per head spending on publicly-funded social care.
""Considering the scale of the problem in England, it is perhaps unsurprising that the long-delayed social care green paper is still 'forthcoming'.
""One reason governments have struggled is that any solution is expensive. But transformation is now, more than ever, needed to make the social care system fair and sustainable in the future.""
The analysis shows spending per head fell by a tenth once inflation was taken into account between 2010-11 and 2016-17 in England.
If funding levels had grown in line with demand, councils would be spending in excess of £23bn a year rather than the £17bn put aside, the think-tank said.
Over the six-year period spending had also fallen in Scotland and Wales, although not by as much.
What does the extra funding allow Wales and Scotland to do? In all parts of the UK, care is means-tested with people expected to contribute towards the cost of their care.
But since devolution, differences have emerged in approaches to care.
In England, anyone with assets of over £23,250 has to pay the full cost of their care.
But in Scotland personal care, such as help washing and dressing, is provided free to everyone assessed as being entitled to care.
Meanwhile, in Wales the cost of help in the home is capped, currently at £90 a week.
The point at which individuals are liable for the full cost of all other services is also higher than the £23,250 threshold.
It means the amount people pay for care is likely to be higher in England - particularly for older people who are more likely to have built up assets than younger disabled people.
The cost of care is one of the major factors behind why increasing numbers of people struggle without the support they need, Age UK says.
It estimates there are around 1.4 million over 65s who get no care or not enough care.
Councillor Ian Hudspeth, of the Local Government Association, said the system was at ""breaking point"".
""More and more people are increasingly unable to get the quality and reliable care and support which enables them to live more fulfilling and independent lives.""
He added it was ""absolutely vital"" the government took action.
Ministers in England has been promising a green paper will be published setting out its plans to reform social care since the 2017 general election.
A number of options are understood to have been discussed including a dedicated social care tax on the over 40s and asking for some kind of contribution for those with significant assets, such as property, in return for greater universal entitlement to support.
But the publication of the green paper has been delayed on numerous occasions as ministers have focussed their attentions on Brexit.
The Department of Health and Social Care said the plans would be published at the ""earliest opportunity"" and pointed out a national recruitment campaign to encourage people to apply for jobs in the care sector had already started.

""I represent the youth and they would be proud that I wear what they do,"" Chakraborty told the BBC.

The two women certainly looked different from the typical Indian female MP. For one, not many women this young have been elected to India's parliament - and most women MPs tend to wear traditional attire like saris.
But not everyone was offended by their sartorial sense. Several people have jumped to their defence since news of the trolling spread.

'Don't ignore' credit card warning letters - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Kevin Peachey Personal Finance Reporter,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48446804,"Image copyright PA People with long-standing debts on credit cards are receiving letters encouraging them to make more than the minimum payments.
Rules set by the City regulator mean that many people will now be receiving a second reminder suggesting they speed up repayments.
Providers could suspend cards if borrowers fail to take action by March.
Debt charity StepChange has raised concerns that the warnings may not be clear enough.
Debt spiral The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) imposed the rules after it emerged that providers had made large profits from their 3.3 million UK customers in persistent debt.
Persistent debt is defined as when customers have paid more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period.
These cardholders were paying an average of £2.50 in interest and charges for every £1 of debt they repay.
Set curfew for online money lending, say academics MPs demand regulator to crack down on bailiffs Crippling debt 'linked to depression' Credit card companies allow customers to opt out of unsolicited increases in their credit limit. Those who have been in persistent debt for 12 months or more no longer receive such credit limit rises.
Firms were also told to send letters to borrowers after 18 months and 27 months of persistent debt, urging people to pay off credit card debts at a faster rate.
After three years of persistent debt, the credit card company must offer customers a way to repay their balance in a reasonable period, but such a plan could raise repayment amounts.
They could also cut, waive or cancel any interest, fees or charges from that point if borrowers are struggling to repay.
However, StepChange said that as letters from card providers varied, it was not always entirely clear to individuals what was going to happen by next March.
Its own pilot project suggested that few people had taken any action so far.
""This begs the question about whether that's because they haven't realised the importance of doing so, haven't noticed their firm's communications, or simply can't afford to pay more,"" said Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange.
""At this point, there may be significant numbers of people with hidden problem debt who are coping on a minimum payment basis, but could tip over into difficulty once higher payments are required.""
How the debt racks up A customer who borrows £3,000 on a credit card with an APR of 19%, and only makes minimum repayments - starting at £74 per month and reducing over time - would typically take 27 years and seven months to pay it off (assuming there is no further spending on the card). The interest paid would be £4,192 If the customer fixed their repayments at £74 per month rather than only making minimum repayments, they would pay it off in five years and two months. The interest paid would be £1,576 If they set their monthly repayment at £108 per month, they would pay their balance off in three years. The interest paid would be £879 Source: FCA"

Government forces recaptured Kafr Nabouda on Sunday, while al-Habeet is still held by opposition forces led by the jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).
HTS was known as al-Nusra Front before it broke off formal ties with al-Qaeda three years ago. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN. Why is there a war in Syria?
Syria's state news agency, Sana, reported on Wednesday that the army had targeted al-Nusra Front vehicles and ""dens"" in southern Idlib in retaliation for their breaches of the truce agreement brokered in September by Russia and Turkey, which backs mainstream rebel groups.

On Tuesday, Syria's permanent representative to the UN, Bashar al-Jaafari, told the Security Council that it was the government's ""right and duty to protect its citizens from terrorism"".
""Syria will spare no effort to rescue its citizens from the dominance of terrorist organisations in Idlib which take people as human shields and to put an end to the attacks of those terrorists on civilians in the neighbouring towns and cities,"" he said. Image copyright AFP Image caption North-western Syria is home to an estimated three million people, many of them displaced
But the UN's Deputy Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Ursula Mueller, warned that a further escalation in hostilities in north-western Syria would overwhelm the humanitarian community .
""There is no question today about whether you, members of this council, are aware of the tragic humanitarian situation in Syria - you clearly are,"" she said.
""The question today is what you will do to protect civilians in Idlib - the latest example of an entirely known, predictable and preventable humanitarian disaster unfolding before our eyes.""
Ms Mueller said both sides appeared to have failed to respect of the principles of distinction and proportionality under international humanitarian law, noting that 22 health facilities and 25 schools had reportedly been attacked since 28 April. Related Topics"

The Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) is calling for the boost in UK science funding to avoid the risk of ""stagnation"".
The UK currently ranks 23rd in its R&D spending as a proportion of GDP.
Case said now was the time for the government to set out details of its plan.
""The government has set out a bold vision for UK science,"" said executive director, Dr Sarah Main.
""It is a potentially transformative one for the entire country. But now is the time for it to put some substance to the plan."" Image copyright Campaign for Science and Engineering Image caption The UK currently ranks 23rd in its R&D spending as a proportion of GDP
In 2017 the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a government target to increase public and private research investment from 1.7% of GDP to 2.4% of GDP by 2027.
The UK currently ranks 23rd in its R&D spending as a proportion of GDP, behind Iceland and Norway. The Government has already pledged an additional £7bn to UK R&D by 2022. But, according to Case, the government has to treble that investment over the following five years if it is to reach its target. This would mean making a commitment to invest £21bn.
The investment would raise Britain's ranking to 13th if other countries maintained their level of spending. But the UK would still be below Belgium. 'Scale and urgency'
James Wilsdon, who is professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said that the report was a timely reminder of the ""scale and urgency"" of the funding of UK science at a time when the minds of politicians have been dominated by Brexit.
""As the beauty parade gets underway for a new PM and leader of the Conservative party, anyone who cares about the long-term economic prospects of the nation should be judging candidates by the seriousness of their commitment to the 2.4% of GDP goal.
""Earlier this month, the German government pledged year-on-year increases of 3% in its research spending up to 2027. As Case shows, if we're to even stand still, let alone move into the premier league of global R&D spenders, we need to see a similarly ambitious plan from the UK government.""
Case's report is drawn from a survey of its membership which includes over 100 organisations, including businesses, universities, learned and professional organisations and research charities. They say that a £21bn pledge could attract an additional £27.5bn of research investment from private sources over 15 years.
Its report warns that a failure to provide such an uplift would lead to ""stagnation"". It also calls for a clear strategy on how the increased money is to be spent effectively.
Case recommends that an early priority should be to increase the number of people studying postgraduate degrees to avoid a skills shortage when the fruits of the investment in research begin to come through. Image copyright Case Image caption Research spending as a percentage of GDP. The UK has fallen behind the European average.
Part of this push should include efforts by the UK Research and Innovation agency (UKRI), which directs research funding, to increase the number of under-represented groups studying science. These include women, people from poorer backgrounds, disabled individuals and black students. Diversity
According to Dr Main, this would entail collecting data on the diversity of those studying science and assessing the approaches that are effective.
""The issue of who is employed and engaged in science is not just to feed the workforce,"" she explained.
""It is to make sure that in ten years' time, after this huge amount of money has been invested, that more people across the UK can have a stake in it, that they have a say in how research is used and how it affects their lives.
""And that this huge change is something that they can be part of and benefit from.""
The report also says that it should be easier for firms to access the myriad of funds and incentives available for research.
A spokesperson from the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy, which is responsible for research, welcomed the report and its recommendations.
""The government is investing record levels into research and development, while working closely with stakeholders to fuel investment in the private sector to ensure we become the global leaders in new and emerging technologies and secure highly-skilled jobs and investment in all parts of the country."""

The aircraft was grounded by regulators worldwide after 157 people were killed when an Ethiopian Airlines' 737 Max crashed. Five months previously a Lion Air 737 Max crashed, claiming 189 lives.
Mr de Juniac told reporters in Seoul on Wednesday that IATA was organising a summit with airlines, regulators and Boeing in five-to-seven weeks to discuss what is needed for the 737 Max to return to service, he said.

Later, Mr Muilenburg told US television station CBS that the crashes have had ""the biggest impact on me"" of anything in his 34 years at the planemaker. 'Steady progress'
In another apology, he said: ""We are sorry for the loss of lives in both accidents, we are sorry for the impact to the families and the loved ones that are behind, and that will never change.

The number of low-paid workers dropped by 200,000 last year, with 120,000 of them aged between 21 and 30, the Resolution Foundation said. It said the introduction of the National Living Wage had ""significantly"" reduced low pay. It could be eliminated altogether by the mid-2020s, research suggested. ""The chancellor and the Labour Party have both announced ambitious plans for its future, either of which would result in the UK having one of the highest minimum wage rates in the world,"" the report said. The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to ""meet the costs of living"" is £9 an hour across the UK and £10.55 an hour in London . Low pay is considered to be hourly pay below two-thirds of the median average across the country. This is the equivalent of £8.52 an hour. The National Living Wage is lower than this, but the Resolution Foundation said the NLW had a beneficial knock-on effect to other low-paid workers. The Foundation said that, in 2018, there were 4.7 million employees on low pay, 17.2% of the total. This was the lowest proportion since 1980, and the lowest number since 1997. Advertisement ""Clearly, the UK still has a significant low pay problem, but it is a problem that is getting smaller after many years of stubbornly refusing to do so,"" the report said. Some 2.8 million (60%) of the 4.7 million low-paid employees in 2018 were women. Owing to the fact they were more likely to be low-paid than men, they saw a greater benefit from the shift to better pay. The number of low-paid women fell by 133,000 between 2017 and 2018. Inequality driving 'deaths of despair' The biggest falls (110,000) in terms of the type of job were said to have taken place in administrative and support services, and the retail sector. The think tank said raising the living wage to a level which would end low pay, by setting it at two-thirds of median hourly earnings for workers aged 25 and over, would represent a further ""huge change"" to the labour market. ""An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage (NLW) continue to rise after 2020 - at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20-year history would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change,"" said the report's author Nye Cominetti. National Living Wage v real living wage The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt its more generous, independently-calculated rate Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""It's positive to see some measures of low pay fall, but there are still around six million jobs paying less than the real living wage - the only rate that's calculated based on what it costs to live. That's millions of families struggling to keep their heads above water, squeezed by rising household bills."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The government should raise the minimum wage to £10 per hour as soon as possible, and young workers, who are most likely to be stuck on low pay, must be given the same rate for the job."" Labour recently said it would extend its plans for a higher £10-an-hour minimum wage to include workers under the age of 18, if it were in government. Currently, under-18s are entitled to a minimum wage of £4.35 per hour, compared with £8.21 for those aged 25 and over. Advertisement 'Raise productivity' Chancellor Philip Hammond was asked on the BBC's Today programme whether the minimum wage should continue to rise after 2020. ""We would only do that if we can be confident that we can do that without damaging the employment prospects of people with lower skills,"" says Mr Hammond. He said initial fears in the 1990s that the minimum wage would cost jobs had not been realised, but said that did not necessarily mean further increases would not be damaging, so he has commissioned a review. ""The key challenge is to support businesses so they can raise their productivity performance as the wages of their employees rise,"" he says. ""Then you get a virtuous circle, where increases in the minimum wage incentivises improvements in productivity, which in turn allows employers to to pay higher wages still."" More on this story "
How damaging is the row over Huawei for US-China trade? - BBC News,www.bbc.com,Ana Nicolaci Da Costa,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48361473,"How damaging is the Huawei row for the US and China? By Ana Nicolaci da Costa Business reporter 30 May 2019 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rising US-China tensions have dashed hopes of an imminent trade deal The US is ramping up a conflict with China, putting their economies and their diplomatic relationship at risk.
It has moved to restrict Huawei's ability to trade with US firms, shortly after reigniting the trade war with tariff hikes.
The latest blows to the Chinese telecoms giant mark a grave escalation in the US-China power struggle.
As the trade war broadens into a ""technology cold war"", the prospect of a deal looks increasingly distant.
""The US action against Huawei is a watershed moment and a very significant escalation of tensions,"" says Michael Hirson, Asia director at the Eurasia Group.
""A trade deal is not doomed but looks very unlikely, especially in the near term.""
The crackdown on Huawei has become a central part of relations between Washington and Beijing, which has primarily played out as a trade war over the past year. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei's Song Liuping says more than three billion customers could be affected
While the US has justified its actions against Huawei based on the alleged risk it poses to national security, US President Donald Trump has also linked it to the trade row.
Only recently, Mr Trump said Huawei could be part of a trade deal between the world's two largest economies.
Such comments risk reinforcing a view that the action against Huawei is about more than just security risks. Grappling with China's growing power
Some see it as an attempt by the US to contain a powerful Chinese firm, and by extension China's growing importance in the world.
""The prospect of a US action hobbling one of China's most prominent tech companies, and key to its global ambitions in 5G, is already evoking a surge of nationalist sentiment in China,"" says Mr Hirson. How damaging are the moves against Huawei?
The US has added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has become a central part of the US-China trade dispute over recent months
At the same time, Mr Trump signed an executive order which effectively bars US firms from using foreign telecoms firms believed to pose national security risks.
""Of the two moves that Trump made - the executive order and adding Huawei to the entity list - the latter is far more impactful,"" says Mr Hirson.
Huawei is the world's second biggest smartphone maker and a key player in the development of next-generation 5G technology.
Its chief legal officer Song Liuping has said that more than three billion consumers could be hit by the US decision to add Huawei to the entity list.
The US moves are already sending ripples across the technology sector.
Google barred Huawei from some updates to the Android operating system. New designs of Huawei smartphones are set to lose access to some Google apps.
""If Huawei phones are undercut by the lack of Android operating system, it would hurt consumers by limiting competition in the cellphone market and causing prices to rise,"" says Yan Liang, associate professor of economics at Willamette University.
Analysts say the clampdown on Huawei could also hurt the development of 5G.
""Huawei also holds a dozen of patents in the 5G development. Limiting Huawei will push back 5G technology and make it more costly to implement,"" adds Prof Liang. How damaging is it for US firms?
Washington's restrictions on Huawei will also hurt US firms. Huawei's Mr Song said more than 1,200 US firms would be ""directly"" hit. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google is one of several firms that has stepped backed from Huawei after the US put restrictions on the Chinese company
The company's founder Ren Zhengfei recently told Bloomberg that Huawei would use more of its own chips if there were further US restrictions, and would reduce its purchases from the US.
Half of the chips Huawei uses are from US companies, and half they produce themselves, he said.
Indeed, some analysts say the US government also risks hurting itself.
""You punish Huawei but you also punish yourself: You lose market share, lose all of your business sales to Huawei,"" says Huiyao Wang, the president of the Centre for China and Globalization in Beijing.
""And also you probably force Huawei to develop on its own - that's not a wise move for the US."" Global Trade "
UK parking space data offered up to app developers - BBC News,www.bbc.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48450198,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could an app tell you where the best parking space is? Data on parking spaces across the UK is set to be standardised, in the hope that it will make finding and paying for parking easier.
From Thursday, local councils are now able to release parking data in the same format.
This means that apps could potentially collate such data and allow drivers to find spaces before they leave home.
However, one expert said he did not feel this would increase parking payments in town centres.
Workplace parking tax considered Where will UK drivers pay for polluting? The government hopes that local councils and companies that publish parking data will switch to the standardised format.
Apps could then gather that data and allow road users to find convenient spaces or pay for their parking online.
Such apps could also highlight the cheapest spaces, or those that are located next to electric car charging points, for example.
The new standards will first be tested in Manchester, Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and parts of Essex, where councils will be given a share of a £1m fund for research projects.
'Intelligent parking' ""Hunting for a parking space and then checking if you have the right change to pay for it isn't the best start to any shopping experience, but it can be the reality more often than not,"" said local government minister Rishi Sunak.
""An intelligent parking system will not only make life easier for commuters, but could also improve footfall to our town centres - meaning both people and local businesses benefit.""
A government report, published in March , into transport innovation in towns and cities said that new technology could help provide more green spaces by reducing the number of parking spaces.
Announcing the new project, Future of Mobility Minister Michael Ellis said new technologies could bring a transport ""revolution"" and help make for ""cleaner, cheaper, safer and more reliable journeys.""
It was not a given, though, that apps built with the newly standardised data really would revolutionise parking, said Steve Vollar, a parking consultant at consultants Hill Cannon.
People are seldom deterred from driving into a town centre over parking availability, he explained.
He also said there would be privacy concerns: ""There will be a lobby who will object to online payment details and knowledge of their movements.""

Russia 'probably' violating nuclear ban, US says BBC News 7 hrs ago © Getty Images The US expects Russia's weapons arsenal to increase ""significantly"" over the next decade
Russia may be violating a ban on the testing of low-yield nuclear weapons capabilities at a site in the Arctic, a top US intelligence official said.
Lt Gen Robert Ashley, the director of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said Moscow was ""probably not adhering to"" the rules of a recognised treaty.
He was referring to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), a multilateral agreement prohibiting nuclear testing.
Russia, which ratified the treaty in 2008, says it complies with the CTBT.
The US has signed but has not yet ratified the treaty. Do we really need nuclear treaties?
""Our understanding of nuclear weapon development leads us to believe that Russia's testing activities would help it improve its nuclear weapons capabilities,"" Lt Gen Ashley said on Wednesday.
He added that the US expected Russia, which he said was likely testing weapons in the Novaya Zemlya islands, to increase its nuclear arsenal ""significantly"" over the next decade.
But analysts received the statement with scepticism. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) said in a statement that it had not detected any unusual activity.
""The CTBTO has full confidence in the ability of the IMS [its monitoring system] to detect nuclear test explosions,"", the organisation said in a statement.
The CTBT, which bans nuclear weapons testing anywhere in the world, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996. It sets out nuclear disarmament as a principle but diplomatically avoids the politics of the issue."
