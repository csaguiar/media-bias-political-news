But the corruption in Mexico is a thousand times worse that in El Salvador.
The drug cartels own Mexico from the individual to the President which is why Mexico will not help us prevent and are even helping the caravans to the US border.
Get it? If Mexico helps the US to block the caravans, then the Cartels are going to enact vengeance on the government.

Introducing what the Trump Administration is calling “efficiency measures,” Barr is looking to make immigration courts as hostile to [illegal] immigrants as possible. The goal seems to be mass immigration hearings, including for those seeking asylum. There will be no individual hearings in Trump’s immigration courts. The situation will be one of immigrants appearing together, and being ruled for or against in groups, regardless of individual circumstances.
While Barr cannot get rid of the judges himself, what he can do is render them obsolete, which is what he is trying to do. The new policies would allow judges to skirt immigration law to make sweeping changes while bypassing Congress and the law. Essentially, under these new policies, single, Trump-appointed judges, can effectively enforce immigration law in their own vision, regardless of existing law, and deport or punish groups of immigrants, including asylum seekers. With these rules, William Barr has complete control over the immigration system, along with the Trump Administration and Trump’s hand-picked judges."

Trump’s behavior has been shown to be illegal, but not chargeable because sitting President’s can not be indicted.
The Russians interfered with our election.
Trump & Co. tried to collude with them.

Trump tried to obstruct the investigation, but was thwarted by his own staff.

Plus its alot easier to out of frustration that the FBI lost confidence without truly knowing anything about how they feel then saying I didn't take blow jobs from my Intern in the oval office during a Government shutdown."
