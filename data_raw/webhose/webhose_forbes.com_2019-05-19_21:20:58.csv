Marshmello And Chvrches Hit The U.K. Top 10 While 'Old Town Road' Rules,www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/21/marshmello-and-chvrches-hit-the-u-k-top-10-while-old-town-road-rules/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin INDIO, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 14: Singer Marshmello performs onstage as a special guest of Khalid during Weekend 1, Day 3 of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 14, 2019, in Indio, California. (Photo by Scott Dudelson/Getty Images for Coachella) Getty After breaking into the top 10 just one week ago, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” rises once again, making its way to No. 1 in the U.K. The song enjoyed an incredibly fast climb to the top, as only two weeks elapsed between when it first broke into the top 40 to when it earned its seat on the throne. “Old Town Road” is one of a number of songs that enjoy gains in performance this week, with two entering the top 10 for the first time.
With seven weeks at No. 1 under his belt, Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi can feel satisfied seeing his biggest hit yet, “Someone You Loved,” dip from the peak position to the runner-up slot. The song is easily the longest-running leader of 2019, though it is still early in the year. ""Someone You Loved"" comes in just ahead of Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy,” which is stationary at No. 3.
After breaking into the top five for the first time last frame, Meduza and Goodboys’ “Piece of Your Heart” improves its standing once again, hitting a new peak of No. 4. Tom Walker’s “Just You and I” also returns to the top five, coming in at No. 5, while Calvin Harris and Rag’N’Bone Man’s “Giant,” which ended up peaking at No. 2, is down to sixth place this time around.
The first new song inside the top 10 vaults all the way from No. 30, so it clearly has a lot of momentum, and it wouldn’t be surprising if it continued to grow in popularity in the country. Russ and Tion Wayne’s “Keisha & Becky” rockets all the way to No. 7, giving both artists their second appearance inside the area.
The Jonas Brothers’ comeback single “Sucker” is down slightly to No. 8, while Dave and Burna Boys’ “Location” also retreats, but just by one slot, making a home at No. 9 this week.
The final spot inside the highest tier on the singles chart is filled by EDM producer Marshmello and indie-pop group Chvrches, who teamed up to create the hit ""Here With Me."" The song is the fifth top 10 for Marshmello, but somehow, just the first for Chvrches, who have been a favorite in the U.K. for years, but who have never succeeded in this way until now."
This Study Shows The Huge Benefits When Leaders Are Vulnerable,www.forbes.com,Mark Murphy,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markmurphy/2019/04/21/this-study-shows-the-huge-benefits-when-leaders-are-vulnerable/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Careers I solve the “people pain points” that keep leaders awake at night. Share to facebook Share to linkedin Getty Being vulnerable can be terrifying for a leader. Derived from the Latin root vulnus, which means wound, vulnerable literally means being susceptible to attack or harm. And that sounds terrifying; who in their right mind would leave themselves open to harm?
But being vulnerable at work doesn’t require such severe measures. It just necessitates admitting that you’re not perfect, that the company isn’t perfect, and that other people may have better ideas.
Vulnerable is certainly not the mindset of the typical leader. Most leaders got promoted into their roles because they projected confidence and self-assuredness and a positive vision. And I’m not going to tell you that those are bad things.
But, as crazy as it sounds, there are huge benefits when people in positions of power (a.k.a. leaders) expose their imperfections, or at least admit that things are not entirely perfect.
When I first launched the study “ The Risks of Ignoring Employee Feedback ,” I had no idea how much employees love it when their bosses share the challenges they’re facing. I, like many putative leadership experts, figured that employees would be happiest hearing their leaders talk about successes; both theirs and the company’s.
After all, when you look through the typical company newsletter, website, internal communications, etc., the messages are almost always happy, upbeat and filled with success stories. Company communications rarely tell employees about the challenges and headwinds and competitive forces the company is facing.
But in our study, we asked more than 27,000 people to rate the statement, “This organization openly shares the challenges facing it.” And we discovered that 21% of people say their organization Never openly shares its challenges and another 21% say the company Rarely does so. Meanwhile, only 15% of employees believe that their organization Always openly shares the challenges facing it.
Now, that by itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but we also asked people whether they would recommend their company as a great organization to work for. And here we discovered that 63% of employees who think their organization Always openly shares the challenges facing it will strongly recommend it as a great organization to work for.
By contrast, only 6% of employees who think their organization Never openly shares the challenges facing it will strongly recommend it as a great organization to work for. In essence, if an employee believes their company openly shares the challenges facing it, that employee is about 10 times more likely to recommend it as a great employer.
Interestingly, when we broke out the data by level in the organization, executives were much more likely than individual contributors to believe their organization Always or Frequently openly shares the challenges facing it (49% vs. 31%). One possible interpretation of this finding is that executives are more comfortable being vulnerable with other executives than they are with frontline employees.
If, for example, I’m sitting in a meeting with other executives that have access to the same data I do about our declining market share, it doesn’t really benefit me to hide that information. The executives in that meeting already have the data, so I might as well be vulnerable and expose my weaknesses and share the challenge.
But now if you ask me, an executive, to discuss those same challenges in front of hundreds or thousands of people who (I believe) might not otherwise have known about them, that initially seems really scary. Of course, a deeper level of thinking would tell me that the people on the frontlines probably already know the challenges we’re facing and by denying or ignoring them, I just look clueless. And that’s the likely reason that employees are ten times more likely to think their company is great if their leaders are open about the challenges they face.
So where should leaders start? I’m not suggesting that you initiate self-flagellation in your staff meetings. But you could try asking your employees what they think are the challenges facing your company. You might be surprised by the accuracy of their answers. If they’ve nailed all the challenges that you’re aware of, then simply confirm their responses by saying something like, “That’s great insight and I would agree with everything you just said.”
And if your employees don’t fully understand all the challenges you face, then just add to their list. Tell them “You’ve identified a bunch of challenges, and I actually think we also face a few more…”
Smart employees find it deeply unsettling to follow a leader who refuses to acknowledge reality, especially when the reality is that there are big challenges on the horizon. It makes the leader appear clueless or insecure (or both) when everyone else can see the challenges that the leader refuses to admit.
The biggest takeaway from this exercise is likely that your employees already know many, if not most, of the challenges you face. So just confirm them by allowing yourself to be vulnerable and saying, ‘Yes, we have challenges.’ Feel safe in being vulnerable by remembering that if an employee believes their company openly shares the challenges facing it (i.e. that their leaders are vulnerable), that employee is about 10 times more likely to recommend it as a great employer.

"In Travel Insurance, Machine Learning Is Turning Conventional Wisdom On Its Head",www.forbes.com,Christopher Elliott,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherelliott/2019/04/21/in-travel-insurance-machine-learning-is-turning-conventional-wisdom-on-its-head/,"You know the conventional wisdom about shopping around before buying? Machine learning may be turning that truism on its head, at least in one industry. Smarter technology is serving up relevant products in the blink of an eye, anticipating your needs before you have a chance to ask a question. Companies hope personalization engines operating behind the scenes can power their way to winning your business.
""Companies are beginning to use artificial intelligence technologies to engage with users,"" says Bret Greenstein, vice president and global head of artificial intelligence at Cognizant Digital Business . They're doing it by optimizing their back-end technology to make it faster and easier for customers to use.

Consider how travel insurance company Allianz Travel Insurance has quietly upgraded its systems. In the last few months, the company has put the finishing touches on an ambitious project to add personalization features to its online storefront and its partners.
The goal: to ensure that travelers get the most appropriate product for their trip and don’t overpay for coverage. Allianz added machine-learning and artificial intelligence technology to offer real-time personalization that delivers the product recommendation in less than a second.
That's right, one second.
The Allianz case study offers a peek behind the curtain of a company that's trying to compete with other travel insurance providers and fighting a perception among experts that a travel insurance partner such as an airline or online agency isn't the first place -- or even the best place -- to buy an insurance policy.
What you don't know when you buy through an aggregator
""There is a prevailing philosophy that the best place to buy travel insurance is through an aggregator,"" says Allianz spokesman Daniel Durazo. Travel insurance aggregators are sites that offer a variety of travel insurance products. ""While the ability to compare products is often mentioned, never mentioned is the lack of visibility into the insurance providers behind the products being offered.""
For example, when you're buying insurance online, it’s impossible to know whether the company offering a product has 24/7 customer service or is only there 9 to 5, Durazo says. You also can't tell whether it adjudicates its claims or if that’s handled by another company. Nor can you tell whether the company manages its own travel assistance services or whether it farms out those duties to another company. That information is available online, but it takes time to find it.
""You don't know if they have an in-house medical team to manage emergencies and evacuations or whether they use a third party,"" he says. ""You don't know if they have a mobile app that has the ability to access policies, file and track claims and get access to local resources.""
What Allianz did to improve its online buying experience
Allianz set out to deliver ""the most appropriate"" products within a partner booking path in less than a second and to answer questions about the reliability and availability of its products. The insurance company's partners include airlines and online travel agencies that sell coverage as an add-on during the booking process. In a world where lengthy delays are the norm, that was a tall order.
To pull it off, Allianz embraced contextual personalization to consider several factors for the trip. Those included:
The booking window.
The period between booking and departure is a critical factor. The longer the period, the higher the probability of an event that would cause customers to cancel their trip. On the other hand, a trip booked on the day of departure makes cancellation coverage unnecessary. By quickly determining the booking window, customers who don’t need cancellation coverage can purchase a product that only covers post-departure travel problems such as travel delay, delayed or lost baggage or medical emergencies. That can result in cost savings to the customer, potentially offering a product that is significantly less expensive than standard products. Post-departure products are often 30% cheaper than comparable products offering cancellation coverage and may cost as little as $19 for a trip.
Trip length.
The longer a trip lasts, the greater the probability of an event that affects the trip. That’s why post-departure benefits such as coverage for travel delays, baggage delay or loss, and medical emergencies become even more important for longer trips. Shorter trips cost less to insure -- that's more money saved for the customer.
Airport codes.
Knowing the origin and destination of a trip can help determine what coverage may be needed for common events at those airports. For example, travel delay coverage and baggage loss may be more important at one airport than another. A vacation trip to the Caribbean may require less coverage than a trip to Asia or Africa, where potential delays, interruptions and medical emergencies may be more of a concern.
Connecting flights.
Itineraries with connecting flights are more likely to experience travel delays, missed connections and lost or delayed baggage. This makes post-departure benefits that cover these events even more important.
Trip cost.
Trips that include a significant investment in nonrefundable travel payments should include cancellation coverage that will refund those payments in the event of cancellation for a covered reason.
Other variables that affect the insurance product you see
Allianz identified other variables that it could hand over to its machine-learning algorithms.
For example:
The number of people traveling -- The bigger the group, the greater the chance of a cancellation or trip interruption. The right travel insurance policy can protect against those losses. Age of travelers -- Families with children or older adults may have different needs than other travelers. Children or older adults are more likely to become sick before a trip. This makes cancellation coverage and coverage for medical emergencies and emergency medical transportations even more important. Paying with miles -- Travelers using frequent flyer miles to pay for their trip can purchase a policy that covers the fee to redeposit those miles if the trip is canceled. This saves money over the cost of a policy that includes traditional cancellation coverage. Policies covering redeposit fees may cost as little as $16. Reason for travel -- Business travelers often have different needs than leisure travelers. They may require coverage for the business equipment and devices they are carrying. Your connections -- International travel makes emergency medical coverage even more important. Overseas medical providers often demand upfront payment for hospitalizations and other serious medical situations. A large travel insurance company like Allianz can guarantee payments to medical providers so that customers don't have to pay large medical bills out of pocket. One way, round-trip or multi-city trips -- One-way trips may not require post-departure benefits, such as emergency medical coverage. Itineraries with multiple stops are more likely to experience delays and baggage issues. Timing of trip -- Trips booked for the winter months or hurricane season may be more likely to experience severe weather events that could cause a missed connection or delay. The machine-learning systems take all of these factors into account, meaning that buying an insurance policy through an airline or online travel agency might be a traveler's top choice.
""The products offered in travel provider booking paths are highly personalized for the traveler’s trip,"" says Durazo. ""The consumer gets the appropriate coverage for their trip and doesn’t overpay for coverage they don’t need.""
How Allianz made travel insurance smarter
The technology behind this customization is impressive. Allianz collects anonymized information to power a personalization engine from a partner like Priceline to help it find the right product for the customer. That reduces the time spent researching companies and products and virtually eliminates the chance that customers will pay for coverage they don’t need.
That's a sharp contrast to insurance aggregators and other providers, which place the burden on the consumer to sift through many offerings to find the product that is most appropriate, according to Allianz.
""Products offered through personalization do this work for the consumer, allowing them to focus on the more enjoyable aspects of their trip,"" says Durazo.
The engine itself takes multiple trip and traveler attributes into consideration, selecting from about 100 different products. What's more, the personalization engine gets smarter every day. Allianz makes more than a billion offers every year, so its personalization engine has learned which products offer the best value for each traveler’s itinerary.
Machine learning is the future
Experts say the type of machine learning that Allianz is doing represents the future of targeted marketing.
""Big data and artificial intelligence can build very accurate user profiles and offer custom benefit configurations for each of these profiles,"" says Dana Adam, a vice president of marketing at RedFalcon.ai , an artificial intelligence company. ""Artificial intelligence enables the personalization of packages like trip cancellation insurance, instead of bundled, predefined packages.""
Joseph Wilck, the faculty director for business analytics at William & Mary's Mason School of Business, says machine learning like this can be helpful.
""I think this is actually useful from a planning perspective,"" he says. ""For example, I have children and in January and February was looking at summer vacation options, so the travel sites that used artificial learning, machine learning, and analytics to watch me offered family-oriented travel options and advertisements.""
But are people ready for this kind of personalization? Wilck says yes. Consumers expect a company to offer an appropriate product.
""For travel purchases, I don’t think this technology is overreaching,"" he says. ""However, more private topics -- like politics, religion, health -- and topics surrounding children may anger consumers if they knew that they were being targeted and watched for those purposes or to those demographics.""
So the next time you see a travel insurance policy offered after you book an airline ticket, you might want to give it strong consideration. It might be the best policy for your next trip."
New York's Best Men's Hair Stylists,www.forbes.com,Katie Chang,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiechang/2019/04/21/new-yorks-best-mens-hair-stylists/,"Takamichi Hair is like an art gallery and chic salon in one. Takamichi Hair When it comes to men’s hair cuts in New York, the options are endless. For something quick and basic, there are barbershops. But since the best way of standing out from the pack is by curating your own unique style, a typical No. 3 on the sides with a high fade just won’t make the cut for many guys today. This is when stylists enter the picture. And what’s the difference between the two? “A barber is trained specifically to cut hair with clippers primarily and usually straight-razor shave,” explains Garrett Bryant, owner of Hawthorne in Chelsea. Takamichi Saeki of Takamichi Hair in the Lower East Side agrees, and adds, “Stylists are trained to cut longer, fuller men's styles, will deal with any length of hair, offer treatments, and primarily use scissors.” In addition to being able to style short or long, and specializing in scissor work, stylists spend more time personalizing the overall experience, and getting to know you better as a person. (This is why so many women develop close relationships with their stylists.) As Dhiran Mistry, a stylist at Soho’s David Mallett , puts it: “I spend as much time on men’s hair, as I do on women’s.” Below, six stylists offering the best of all worlds: unparalleled scissor and people skills, in a stylish setting. Takamichi Saeki is the owner of Takamichi Hair. Takamichi Hair
Where: Takamichi Hair ; 263 Bowery; (212) 420-7979
How much: $200
Why: This airy, light-filled, 2,000-square-foot loft on Bowery is like an art gallery – on display are pieces by Santi Moix and Kat Kohl, pals of Saeki, a former gallerist himself – and hip salon rolled in one. As with every artist, Saeki prioritizes “shape and form,” and enlists a signature technique that “allows hair to grow into the cut.” His work is refined, yet understated and unstudied – so you’ll look sharp for weeks to come.
Hero product: “I can't go out without product. I use a touch of R+Co’s Mannequin Styling Paste ($28) to keep the shape I want all day long – like a sculpture.” Garrett Bryant founded Hawthorne, a unique collaborative styling and coloring concept, in 2018. Hawthorne
Where: Hawthorne ; 100 W. 23rd St, 4th Floor; (917) 886-1167
How much: Above the ear $115, longer cuts $150
Why: Last year, after cutting his chops at the city’s top salons, Bryant struck out on his own and launched Hawthorne, a unique collaborative styling and coloring concept. To ensure each client leaves with a truly original look, Garrett draws inspiration across all types styles and genres. (No wonder his regulars are among the biggest names in the art and fashion world.) “No one should ever look like they just got their haircut – they should just look their best.” (And bonus points for being New York’s only salon to offer gender-neutral and gratuity inclusive pricing.)
Hero product: “ Mare Mediterranean Sea Mist by Reverie ($34) is best at creating natural texture for the perfect undone look. It also smells amazing.” Dhiran Mistry at David Mallett is famed for his stylish, yet wearable haircuts. Dhiran Mistry
Where: David Mallett ; 29 Greene St, 5th Floor of The Webster Soho; (212) 960-8900
How much: $200
Why: For Mistry, developing a personal, honest rapport with his clients is just as important as creating bespoke haircuts. “Communication is key. Men aren’t always the best at expressing themselves, so find someone who really listens and understands what you want and what you like.” Because he’s so easy to chat with, time flies in the impossibly chic salon – which really, feels more like a Parisian apartment – envisioned by acclaimed architect Charles Zana. Before you know it, you’ll be rewarded with “a great-looking haircut but that easily complements your daily routines.”
Hero product: David Mallett’s Australian Salt Spray ($40) smells amazing and works with every hair texture. It helps hair air dry well, and has enough hold without being sticky.” Rodney Cutler factors men's careers and lifestyles before the first snip. Cutler Salons
Where: Cutler Salon ; 465 West Broadway; (212) 308-3838
How much: $160-$200
Why: Though Cutler’s been a longtime staple of New York Fashion Week, the clients of the Australian-born stylist (and former rugby player and current marathoner) tend to be “less influenced by trends,” and more driven by their careers and lifestyle. His roster of regulars may run the gamut, from students to bankers, but they all return to his chair for highly wearable and timeless cuts with an unmistakable twist.
Hero product: “ Redken Outshine ($19.50) is a grooming cream that I can use on most hair types to add texture, smooth fly aways, or even weigh the hair down.” Greg Cassese specializes in artful razor cutting and low maintenance cuts. Greg Cassese
Where: Cutler Salon ; 465 West Broadway; (212) 308-3838
How much: $140
Why: If versatile and low maintenance is more your speed, consider Cassese – who’s renown for his artful razor cutting and cuts that manage to look terrific, even without product or styling – your go-to guy. But don’t be fooled by his laid-back demeanor. “I design everything so it can be worn neat for the office, or textured for the night out.” As for what he digs most about his job? “Making people feel new again.” (Full disclosure: Cassese rescued my locks after a catastrophic cut by a self-proclaimed “celebrity stylist,” and helped me fall back in love with short hair. I’m never going back to long.)
Hero product: “ Fatboy Perfect Putty ($21) is pliable with a matte finish, and is extremely versatile. You can use a lot for a stronger hold, or a little for light texture."" Martial Vivot's salons are discreet and exclusive, with no luxurious detail spared. Martial Vivot Where: Martial Vivot ; 39 W 54th St; (212) 956-2990 How much: $420 Why: The French stylist who loves “changing the world one haircut at a time” may command the highest price of anyone on this list, but his faithful clients believe he’s worth every dollar, if not more. And why? Vivot’s salons are discreet, with the air of an exclusive men’s club (think complimentary liquor, private styling stations, and flat-screen TVs). His cuts are unquestionably exemplary – “my unique approach is texture before length” – and look polished for at least a month. Hero product: “The Martial Vivot Paste ($30) is my favorite, because of its matte and dry finish.”

"'Captain Marvel' Box Office Tops Previous Week, Passing $400 Million Domestic",www.forbes.com,Mark Hughes,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2019/04/21/captain-marvel-box-office-tops-previous-week-passing-400-million-domestic/,"Despite losing 25% of its screens this past week, Marvel Studio's billion dollar blockbuster Captain Marvel actually saw an increase in domestic box office revenue over the past seven-day frame. This comes amid intense anticipate of next week's debut of Avengers: Endgame , and as the latest marketing for Endgame adds Brie Larson's sci-fi superhero to the mix. Tuesday was the only day last week that didn't register a rise over the prior week's corresponding daily sales in North America. Captain Marvel will top $400 million by Sunday close of business stateside.
Brie Larson dressed for combat in Marvel's ""Captain Marvel""
Source: Marvel Studios Captain Marvel should end the weekend with about $1.09 billion, as it cruises toward a $1.1+ billion finish in the next few weeks. Going forward, the film will add an additional $9+/- million from domestic theaters over the next three to four weeks, and a similar amount from foreign markets.
All told, Captain Marvel now seems likely to end its remarkable theatrical run by mid-May, with approximately $1.110 billion for the #23 spot on the all-time worldwide box office charts. Among MCU releases, Captain Marvel is the seventh-highest grossing Marvel picture, behind Avengers: Infinity War , The Avengers , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Black Panther , Iron Man 3 , and Captain America: Civil War .
Brie Larson stars in Marvel's ""Captain Marvel""
Source: Marvel Studios Domestically, Captain Marvel should finish right around $409+ million. That puts it behind only Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , The Avengers , and Avengers: Age of Ultron as the fifth-highest grossing MCU film of all time in North America. It also makes Captain Marvel the second-highest grossing solo superhero film from Marvel Studios, behind Black Panther (which, with $700 million, probably won't be topped by any other solo superhero movies for a long time).
The significance of that last point should not be lost on anybody -- in other words, a black man and a white woman lead the two biggest Marvel solo superhero movies in history, from any studio (Sony, Fox, Universal, or Marvel Studios), at the domestic box office. This is of course assuming Captain Marvel's final North American tally tops Iron Man 3's $409.013 million receipts, which I believe will happen.
There's a possibility that, after Avengers: Endgame hits theaters, Captain Marvel actually continues to enjoy a coattail bump that sees its daily box office hold steady for a bit longer than expected. If that happens, then its final domestic tally will probably jump to somewhere around $412 million, and its global cume will rise to around $1.115 billion. That wouldn't change Captain Marvel's position on the worldwide charts (where, as noted, it will sit at #23), but it could boost the film another notch or two higher on domestic charts, from #26 to #25.

Source: Marvel Studios It's also worth noting that Captain Marvel didn't drop out of the weekend top-5 until its sixth weekend of release, when it fell to the #6 spot in the April 12-14 frame (where it was less than $1 million behind Dumbo ). But this weekend, Captain Marvel could be soaring back into the top-5 again, an impressive feat, and is likely to linger in the top-10 for at least another week or two.

The Solo-Dining Ramen Experience At Ichiran Demonstrates Its Global Appeal,www.forbes.com,Akiko Katayama,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/akikokatayama/2019/04/21/the-solo-dining-ramen-experience-at-ichiran-demonstrates-its-global-appeal/,"It would not be an exaggeration to say that ramen is now a part of American food. Since the early 2000s, the Japanese national noodle dish has become increasing popular in the US. Momofuku Noodle Bar opened in 2004 and caught New Yorkers’ attention by adding American elements to the Japanese traditional food such as using premium bacon in the soup, instead of traditional dashi stock. Shortly after the opening of Momofuku, notable Japanese ramen brands also brought branches to New York, including Ramen Setagaya and Ippudo. The popularity of ramen also triggered American chefs to open ramen joints nationwide, because unlike sushi, ramen has no rules and allows chefs to freely express their creativity. Among the wide array of ramen shops, Ichiran is distinctively unique for offering the signature “solo-dining experience”.
At Ichiran, you will experience minimum human interactions from ordering, eating to paying. Enter the restaurant, and you are led to your seat at “the flavor concentration booth” where communication is only through a window with a bamboo screen. You are also isolated by the dividers on both sides. Sit down and the screen goes up enough to cover the server’s face, and you are handed an order sheet. Only thing you see is the server’s hands. The order sheet lets you create a perfect bowl to your taste with multiple options, including the level of saltiness, richness, amount of the secret sauce and the texture of the noodles. Once the ramen is delivered through the window, you are ready to focus on tasting the profound flavors of ramen in your bowl. (The experience reminds you of the famous scene in the film Tampopo where the master of ramen eating teaches the main character how to start and finish the bowl perfectly).
This somewhat odd concept of the solo-dining booth has proven quite successful. Ichiran was originally founded in Fukuoka, Japan, which is known as the mecca of pork bone-based ramen soup in 1966. After operating a single restaurant for nearly three decades, the company launched the new solo-dining concept in 1993. Now Ichiran boasts 75 locations in Japan, and six abroad in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US with $230 million revenue in 2018.
The company’s first US shop opened in Brooklyn, New York in October 2016, followed by the location in Midtown Manhattan in March 2018, and the third and the biggest restaurant in Times Square in March 2019.
Iori Hanai, Public Relations Manager at Ichiran USA explains why Ichiran’s solo-dining concept is widely accepted. “In Japan, we have the culture to appreciate “ohitorisama” (a solo customer). As an ohitorisama, you don’t have to worry about not having companions and just enjoy the time to relax and taste delicious food by yourself. American diners seem to welcome the idea too.”
Prior to the opening of the first shop in the US, the company conducted an intense research through a members-only shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn to identify the local palate. It took nine years for them to offer “perfect” ramen bowls to American ramen fans.
“When we opened the first location, the media only featured the concept of solo dining. Now we find that people really appreciate the quality of ramen we have been painstakingly trying to deliver, thanks to our customers’ word-of-mouth promotion and posts on social media”, says Hanai.
The “flavor concentration booth” is designed to provide diners with an environment where you can relax and focus on the delicate concoction in a bowl. You can remove the divider between the seats, if necessary.
Ichiran USA Ichiran is planning to expand its operation to other US cities in the East and the West coasts. “Since all of our shops are directly operated, we need to secure the right staff who deeply understand our concept.”
The manager Hanai has been facing cultural challenges since the beginning. “In Japan ‘reading the air’ (understanding the situation without words) is the norm in the whole society, including our head office. Here you need to set goals and explain responsibility of each task and position. We first tried in the Japanese way, and if it did not work, we switched to the American way. After an intense period of trial and error, our staff began to find that, in order to achieve goals at Ichiran, it easier to adapt the Japanese way.

The 'Game of Thrones' Night King Spiral Mystery Has Officially Been Solved,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/21/the-game-of-thrones-night-king-spiral-mystery-has-officially-been-solved/,"There are a lot of fan theories currently flying around ahead of these final episodes of Game of Thrones , especially in the wake of many long-running ones proving to be true like Jon’s secret parentage and claim to the throne. One mystery that reappeared last week was of the White Walker’s spiral symbol, this time a series of limbs with an undead child stuck in the middle, and the entire thing was set on fire by Berric’s sword in one of the most terrifying moments of the show in quite a while. We have seen this spiral symbol, and one or two others, before. Many times, in fact. The White Walkers have made symbols out of bodies previously, and we have seen the spiral in a key flashback, the one where the Children of the Forest sacrificed a man in some sort of pagan ritual at a tree, a man who became a White Walker. Around the tree was the spiral pattern, made up of stones.
But there is no more need to theorize, and we have arrived at an actual answer for this question. I’m not just talking about a really good fan idea that sounds correct, I’m talking about the guy who wrote the premiere and put the flaming spiral in it explaining outright what it means. Here’s Game of Thrones premiere writer Dave Hill talking to the New York Post when asked the question:
“As we saw with Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven, the spiral pattern was sacred to the Children of the Forest, who created the Night King by sacrificing a captured man in a spiral “henge of stones.” The Night King then adopted the symbol as a sort of blasphemy, like Satan with the upside-down cross.”
Game of Thrones
HBO So that’s it. The White Walkers use this symbol, and at least a few other ones, as stolen sacred icons from the Children of the Forest, whom they hate, as a way to dishonor them. I suppose you can then go a level deeper and ask “well, what did the symbol mean for the Children of the Forest then?” But I have a feeling this is going to be as far as this mystery goes, and simply identifying the spiral as a sacred symbol is going to be all the explanation we get.
I was actually surprised to see Hill explain it so straightforwardly, as getting answers to lingering questions from Game of Thrones cast or crew is almost impossible, so I think this may not be some super essential mystery to the story that fans wanted it to be. It’s just the Night King’s way of intimidating people and blaspheming the Children who he hates. And past that, I’m not sure we’re going to extract a deeper meaning out of this, nor do we really need to.
Game of Thrones
HBO With five episodes left, we may not see the spiral again, and if not, I suppose that was quite a final tableau performance from the Night King with a screaming murder zombie child as part of the display this last time.
Now onto the larger quest, is the Night King some random monster, or does he have a secret identity we need to be unearthing?

"'Fortnite' Season 8, Week 8 Cheat Sheet And Challenge Guide",www.forbes.com,Dave Thier,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2019/04/21/fortnite-season-8-week-8-cheat-sheet-and-challenge-guide/,"We're eight weeks into Season 8 in Fortnite: Battle Royale , and things are finally getting going. Ruin is here, promising fiery death for untold portions of the map, and there's a mysterious rune that we can move around the island by whacking at it. It all seems to have something to do with the massive hatch/UFO or what have you that's shown up in the bottom of Loot Lake. We will see the return of the Cube? I hope not: I'm barely over the case of cube fatigue I developed last year. But for anyone looking up to grind the battle pass, the name of the game remains the same: challenges. It's a long way up to that Tier 100 Luxe skin at the top of the game, and you're running out of time in which to get it. Lucky or you, the week 8 challenges are actually fun: we've got giant telephones that have shown up on the map, we've got a good old-fashioned hidden object hunt, and we've even got a treasure map of the kind that had disappeared back in Season 6. If you're trying to get these done as quickly as possible, we've got a handy cheat sheet for you:
Fortnite

Note that I didn't put vending machines on there, because that quickly makes this a map of vending machines and nothing else: there are enough that you should have no problem finding one.
If you want more specific instructions on the treasure map signpost--it can be a bit tricky--Erik Kain has them here.
That should get all of the location-based challenges done for you. Some of the other ones won't be quite as easy to do just by galivanting all over the map, but luckily those aren't that bad either: eliminating opponents at a distance of 50m or more is super simple with Air Royale currently enabled, and doing damage with a balloon attached should be fairly straightforward if you boot up a respawn-enabled mode like Food Fight or Team Rumble.
You need 55 challenges over the course of Season 8 in order to unlock the Ruin skin. Some of these weeks have been a little rougher for putting up numbers, but you shouldn't have too much trouble completing this week. We'll have two more weeks of challenges before the Season is up, so that makes for 70 challenges in total: enough wiggle room to skip two weeks.
I expect something big to get going in this game next week: we haven't had much in the way of events this season save the rune and the digsites, but the developers have been teasing fire and fury since before the season even started. We're running out of time in which to do it, so stay tuned."
"Uber Gone Wonka? It's Not A Golden Ticket, But Some Cars Have Random Candy Prizes This Easter",www.forbes.com,Julie Walmsley,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliewalmsley/2019/04/21/uber-gone-wonka-its-not-a-golden-ticket-but-some-cars-have-random-candy-prizes-this-easter/,"This Easter, adults can return to childhood and get free candy by hunting for it. But you won’t carry a basket around a backyard or playground to gather your eggs and your chocolate, or your eggs made of chocolate. In the ride-hail cross-promotion version, you get the candy by swiping up enough Ubers. See, you don’t know when you order your ride whether it will have a Cargo box strapped to the center console. The mini-vending machine , with its translucent lid inviting you to your next impulse purchase, also holds complimentary Easter-themed Cadbury Eggs and Reese’s Peanut Butter Eggs. It makes the purchase (of a ride) in the hopes of a prize more like the Golden Ticket giveaway in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory than the classic Easter egg hunt.
The chocolate eggs are available for free while supplies last in all U.S. markets where Cargo is available to Uber drivers. Those are San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago and more. Uber drivers already have Cargo’s boxes in their cars because it’s an opportunity to boost earnings and average ratings, as explained in Cargo’s video:
It is, of course, good for Uber as it IPOs and continues to battle Lyft -- the public might hunt for sweets rather than solid valuation -- but it’s really Cargo’s initiative. Cargo’s contracted drivers get to delight passengers with free candy and Cadbury and Reese’s get experiential marketing around Easter, one of their best sales seasons of the year.
Experiential marketing is on the rise in many consumer spaces, including the ride-hail backseat. Cargo’s latest is very Ivee -esque, as that startup also engages the senses to get new buyers hooked on some form of consumer packaged goods .
Meanwhile, trivia game Joyride has plans to integrate experiential marketing into the games one plays to earn free Uber rides .
In a phone interview, Cargo founder and chief executive Jeff Cripe said he’d only just heard of Ivee last week and the overlap is coincidental, but Cargo does have more event-oriented and experiential marketing planned. This year’s Superbowl, with Cargo boxes stocked with team-themed products, spurred four record sales day in a row.
“It was just massive for us and it really opened our eyes to the fact that when you have a relationship between something culturally relevant that’s happening and the product being relevant with people coming to and from events, it’s a super effective way to create a great passenger experience,” Cripe said.
Beyond the power of timing and cultural relevance to move specific products, Cripe believes broader retail trends are on his side. Fixed-location brick-and-mortar stores are fading from the landscape, creating more monetization potential in what he and company strategizers call the “third space,” which is the buying zone beyond home and work. According to Cargo’s research, shared mobility is the fastest growing third space, followed by Airbnb.
Because more transportation today is shared and electrified (and will eventually be autonomous), gas station stores won’t present as much opportunity for impulse purchases.
Even groceries are bought differently, which changes the stores’ layout. “Pretty soon there aren’t going to be checkout lines in our grocery stores because things like Amazon Go and competitive technology will exist that allow us to just go in [to the store and] grab what you need,” Cripe said. “Fixed location retail is changing.”"
The 'Fortnite' Floating Rune Is Now Taking Aim At Tilted Towers,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/21/the-fortnite-floating-rune-is-now-taking-aim-at-tilted-towers/,"Fortnite used to have a giant purple Cube rolling around the map, now it has a less-giant floating rune platform floating around the map in a similar fashion. This time, however, things are different. Players are tasked with damaging the rune however they can to “motivate” it to move after hacking through 500 million HP across every game server. It used to be 100 million, but that was too fast, so Epic changed it. Then it was 1.5 billion, and that was too slow, so here we are. Everyone has assumed that the rune is heading toward the weird device/ship/whatever it is that has been unearthed at Loot Lake . The rune on the platform matches the rune that is currently active at the lake, and so it stands to reason the device will make its way over there and slide into a slot meant for it, before this happens five more times with other symbols.
But the rune might cause a little mayhem first.
One of the problems with the rune is that it’s hard to track, at least harder than the giant purple Cube, so I’ve been waking up and looking on Twitter to see where it currently is. The path it’s taking to Loot Lake is a winding, not a terribly direct one. Originally people thought it was following the Cube path, but that isn’t true, and it’s been in the frozen part of the map for a few days now, which didn’t even exist in the Cube era.
Fortnite
Epic But it is getting closer to Loot Lake, and now, this morning, it’s actually taken aim at Tilted Towers, and you know what that means.
Every season, there is some sort of calamity that befalls one specific building in Tilted Towers, so much so that it’s a meme at this point. Earthquakes, the Cube, meteors, this building has the worst luck on earth, so everyone believes that the rune will be heading straight for it and crash through it, taking it down for the fourth or fifth time at this point.
The building is currently an insurance office, which is ironic. One catch to this theory however is that so far, unlike the Cube, I don’t think we’ve actually seen the rune destroy anything. It floats around and stays to open areas, not smashing its way through structures. So it would actually be pretty out of character (can runes have character?) to smash through the Tilted building. I would say that Epic might have it brush by the building without actually hitting it, and have that be a fake-out so it can be destroyed in some other way later.
Fortnite
Epic I don’t know if I’m a fan of this new mystery. The rune is going real slow and taking a really long time to get where it has to obviously be going, Loot Lake. And now we have to do this four more times? While I do want to see what happens when all five runes get there, it seems weird to have players damage these things to move them for weeks when we clearly know where they are all going in the end, which is no great mystery. And “contributing” to this is annoying because it can be hard to find if you’re not paying attention. Someone may have built a tracking website for it, but I haven’t found one yet.
Just sort of a weird activity if you ask me, and too similar to the Cube era where we had the Cube rolling and then the shards moving toward Loot Lake after that. But I do want to know what happens at the end of all this, of course.
Update : I was right, the rune is trolling. It went straight at the building and then OVER it, because this thing does not actually run into stuff. I still bet this will be destroyed later, but this was funny.
Fortnite
Epic Update 2 : The rune is back down to 100 million HP and moving quick toward its final resting place at Loot Lake. Maybe, 20 more minutes at this pace? I did see it take down a tree, so it can crush stuff. That may have been an accident.
Update 3: The rune went inside the matching symbol part of the device and turned on this glowing...engine thing. One other rune already seems to be in place next to it, as it's sticking up, but inactive.
Fortnite
Epic Update 4 : There was a shake as this happened, and apparently the volcano is now smoking. So this may indeed be linked to the volcano/Ruin after all.

The Division 2's Specialization Signature Weapons Are Both Broken And Badly In Need Of Buffs,www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/21/the-division-2s-specialization-signature-weapons-are-both-broken-and-badly-in-need-of-buffs/,"This week, it was revealed that The Division 2 ’s newest exotic weapon was so strong that it easily outclassed the .50 cal sniper superweapon that is the key part of the Sharpshooter class. But what that really has done is open up a conversation about something that has seemed obvious since launch, signature weapons are bad and possibly bugged and broken, depending on your session. Massive made a big fuss about the specialization system and these signature weapons, the grenade launcher, the sniper and the explosive crossbow. And future ones are coming with additional weapons like a minigun.
And yet the weapon has been one of the least important parts of the entire system. You may run Survivalist for its fire grenades or Sharpshooter for its insane recoil reduction and reload speed, but never for the actual signature weapon, which should, in theory, be the crown jewel of the class.
There are three main problems with signature weapons
The Division 2
Massive 1. Ammo is almost non-existent for them
Signature ammo only drops in a scarce handful of ways. There’s a chance to get it on headshot kills for Sharpshooter, killing enemies under status effects for Survivalist, and with explosive damage for Demolitionist. And occasionally from things like signature weapon kills by your teammates. But the problem is this ammo is often ridiculously scarce depending on what you’re running. I got a halfway decent amount of crossbow ammo sometimes, but a “decent amount” might be like, 4-6 shots per 30 minute mission. Now I’ve switch to Sharpshooter and there’s so little ammo for my sniper I genuinely think that it’s bugged. I’ve gotten plenty of headshot kills, and yet just today I ran an entire Challenging difficultly Stronghold which took me an hour and I did not get one, not one bullet for my signature sniper. That is insane.
2. Engagements are not built well for these weapons
With such limited ammo, more problems emerge. Most players will simply save all their ammo for named bosses and literally nothing else, meaning signature weapons are used pretty much 0.001% of the time in any given mission by most people. Trying to use say, the sniper or the crossbow in most “normal” engagements with rooms full of enemies feels like a waste both because of the limited ammo, but because it’s easy to miss shots with single-shot weapons when enemies can hit you across the room a microsecond after you leave cover, throwing off your aim. And when you have only 1-3 rounds total, that’s a problem. Using a normal sniper, sure, I hit headshots, I hit bodyshots, I miss shots. But give me this 15x zoom monstrosity and tell me I have exactly two or three chances to hit a shot in an entire mission, and that sucks.
The Division 2
Massive 3. These weapons are just not good enough to be worth all this fuss.
Between exotics and ammo availability and stacking bonuses for certain builds, these signature weapons may be strong, but they’re simply not good enough for being essentially like a super or ultimate move in the world of The Division . It is almost always often more logical and effective to just unload a bunch of AR clips into an enemy than trying to line up a single crossbow shot that will bite off a blip or armor using a round that took you 15 minutes to locate.
So, how to fix all this? I’m not sure, as I’m half-convinced signature weapons might be a lost cause.
For starters:
Check to make sure ammo drops aren’t genuinely bugged, because they sure feel like it. Whether they are or are not bugged, dramatically increase the rate signature ammo drops. Buff the damage on all of these weapons (in PvE at least) so they feel worth the trouble and aren’t being outclassed by high-end or exotic gear. There may be a way to make this work, and the trees themselves are a great idea I’d love to see expanded, but so far the weapons themselves are a rare miss from an otherwise great game.

Mother's Day Gift Guide: The Best Floral Jewelry,www.forbes.com,Beth Bernstein,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethbernstein/2019/04/21/mothers-day-gift-guide-the-best-floral-jewelry/,"Why not say it ‘with flowers’ for Mother’s Day. But instead of giving live bouquets which are beautiful but might last only five days to a week, invest in the enduring beauty of floral jewelry. Whether you are purchasing for your mom, wife, daughter, grandmother, sister, aunt or BFF—these women that have had an impact on your life, guided you, offered wisdom, support and comfort as well as laughter and humor—deserve meaningful jewels that bespeak sentiment and your love for them. For centuries designers have been capturing the essence of garden variety and exotic botanicals in a variety of different classifications of jewelry, bringing these flowers to life in precious metals and gemstones. Sometimes they appear in abstract forms while others are rendered in literal three-dimensional silhouettes and in every stage of growth from bud to full blossom.
Here we have picked antique and modern pieces that represent different blooms in gemstones and gold in a wide range of price points.

The Coming Web Crack-Up,www.forbes.com,Peter Slatin,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterslatin/2019/04/21/the-coming-web-crack-up/,"Getty This post is the first in a series on web accessibility.
Remember the bumper stickers that read, If You Can Read This, You’re Too Close? Yeah, danger ahead. Well, as America races down the cyber-highway, we should be on the lookout for a pile-up, because despite warning signs (as in a blizzard of web-accessibility lawsuits, up almost 200% last year from 2017) everywhere, people with disabilities just aren’t going to be able to move past the many obstacles heedless developers and designers are putting in their way.
This is not about bandwidth, or pipelines, or net neutrality, or even reaching rural America. It’s not even about privacy. Those are all incredibly important. But they all mean nothing to those of us who find big obstacles to fully accessing many web sites and functions.
Yes, the web frustrates everyone – no one escapes unscathed – but for people with disabilities trying to navigate the internet to perform anything from essential life functions to elective pursuits, these frustrations meaningfully and negatively impact lives.
For someone using a screen-reading or text-to-speech program, it can be as simple as this: a link to specific content, instead of having a tag or label that identifies where it points to, gets read as the word “link.” Or when trying to fill out a form of any type and the screen-reading program announces that there is a box to type in but finds no description of what to type – your name? Your address? Birth date? Now imagine this kind of experience spread across millions of webpages, pages that are crucial for everything from managing money and paying bills to making travel plans to reading textbooks and applying for a job.
Webpages with flaws like these are the equivalent of many buildings built before the 1990 passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Then architecture reflected the perspective of a society that placed no value on the inclusion of the disabled. As the web has evolved, it too has often failed to live up to the promise of the ADA. Even so, advocates with the right know-how or just the right drive have worked hard to guide developers and other professionals on how to plan for and create accessible webpages. Just as it’s more expensive and difficult to retrofit a physical structure for accessibility than it is to build one that takes access as a starting point from the commencement of planning, the same is true when designing for the web.
That’s why it is mind-numbingly aggravating to encounter sites that simply ignore accessibility and appear to have done so from the get-go. Or they have been forced by advocates threatening lawsuits or by actual lawsuits to scurry backwards and attempt to retrofit, almost always with less than ideal outcomes.
Words like “aggravating” and “frustrating” are neat enough to describe the feelings that arise when encountering impassable web sites. But more appropriate words are deprivation and discrimination when recognizing this for what it is: denial of service. If the means to addressing this weren’t readily available, then we could begin the work to develop those means. But they are. The information is out there, and impossible to avoid for a conscientious and engaged designer or developer. The web advocacy group known as W3C, or the Worldwide Web Consortium came out last year with WCAG2.1 – the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines – an up-to-date detailed blueprint for a thoroughly accessible web design. There are large conferences every year devoted to discussion of web accessibility. And there are lots of tech companies devoted to creating apps, software and devices that promote and enable web access. So in point of fact, there is simply no excuse for launching a website that is not fully accessible, that has not been tested and guided into meeting the needs of as many people as possible. That, of course, means everybody. To do otherwise is thoughtless, and we have enough of that. It’s also bad business."
"Marijuana Users Gain Less Weight Than Non-Users Despite Munchies, Study Suggests",www.forbes.com,David DiSalvo,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2019/04/21/marijuana-users-gain-less-weight-than-non-users-despite-the-munchies-study-suggests/?ss=healthcare,"Among the most well-known effects of marijuana is the irresistible hunger that kicks in for many people after using, referred to as ""the munchies."" No bag of chips, package of Oreos, or anything else sweet, salty or fatty is safe when the munchies start. So you might think all of that munching would result in users gaining more weight, but a new study suggests that’s not the case – in fact, just the opposite may be true. Researchers analyzed Body Mass Index (BMI) data for 33,000 participants from the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions , comparing BMI of marijuana users and non-users 18 and older over a three-year period.
They found a small average weight variance between users and non-users (around two pounds), but that modest difference held true across nearly the entire study group.
""An average two-pound difference doesn't seem like much, but we found it in more than 30,000 people with all different kinds of behaviors and still got this result,"" said lead study author Omayma Alshaarawy, assistant professor of family medicine at Michigan State University.
The study also found that marijuana users seemed to gain less weight over time than non-users.
""Over a three-year period, all participants showed a weight increase, but interestingly, those who used marijuana had less of an increase compared to those that never used,"" said Alshaarawy. ""Our study builds on mounting evidence that this opposite effect occurs.""
Other studies have found a similar correlation between marijuana use and lower rates of weight gain and obesity, but the likely cause is still in question. It may be that certain cannabinoid compounds in marijuana alter metabolism in the opposite way popularly assumed, or it could be that users adapt behavior to counter-balance the extra calories.
""It could be more behavioral, like someone becoming more conscious of their food intake as they worry about the munchies after cannabis use,"" said Alshaarawy. ""Or it could be the cannabis use itself, which can modify how certain cells, or receptors, respond in the body and can ultimately affect weight gain.”
Whichever is true (and it could very well be a combination of metabolic and behavioral changes), the researchers stressed that marijuana use should not be considered a diet booster.
""People shouldn't consider it as a way to maintain or even lose weight,” added Alshaarawy. “There's too many health concerns around cannabis that far outweigh the potential positive, yet modest, effects it has on weight gain.""
Along with that caveat, we should also add that this was an observational study looking for correlations, not causation. This research does not prove that using marijuana assists in weight loss – only that across a three-year period the researchers observed a steady correlation. More research will have to fill in the gaps to understand why this correlation exists.
In case you're wondering why marijuana triggers the munchies – the latest research suggests that THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, sets off a cascade of brain activity in neural networks underlying our sense of smell and taste. When that activity reaches a certain threshold, the brain responds as if we're starving, and the hunt for snacks is on. That's a finding based only on experiments with mice , however, so the precise munchies mechanism in humans is still not entirely clear.
The study was published in the International Journal of Epidemiology .

"Why Sen. Walsh Said Nurses ""Play Cards For A Considerable Amount Of The Day""",www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/21/why-sen-walsh-said-nurses-play-cards-for-a-considerable-amount-of-the-day/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin A statement by Maureen Walsh, R-Walla Walla, (pictured here hugging a colleague) didn't quite come up aces with the nursing profession. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) A hospital is not a casino or a cruise ship. Nonetheless, Washington State Senator Maureen Walsh said the following when discussing a proposed state bill SHB 1155 that would mandate uninterrupted meal and rest periods for nurses:
I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost. And by putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of hospitals. I would submit to you that those (small hospital) nurses probably do get breaks. They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day.
Walsh was pushing for an amendment that would exempt smaller, rural hospitals from this mandate, an amendment that was subsequently adopted. Here is a tweet with a video of Walsh's statement: Trust me, nurses haven’t earned the title ""most trusted profession"" for seventeen years running by ""playing cards"" on our shifts. WA Sen. Maureen Walsh should be ashamed to use #nurses to score cheap political points like this. #1U #nurseslife pic.twitter.com/ucm89ezpDj
— Bonnie Castillo (@NNUBonnie) April 19, 2019
Walsh, a Republican from Walla Walla, Washington, may wanna wanna reconsider her statement about nurses playing cards. If you thought that her statement would come up aces with the nursing profession, you'd be wrong. Not surprisingly, Walsh's statement has already received quite a negative reaction from nurses and those who support the well-being of nurses, which basically should be anyone with a human body.
Her comments spawned the creation of a new hashtag #nursesplayingcards. Using this hashtag, @LuckyLizzie tweeted out a picture of a bloody hospital floor with the label ""Last night's card game."" Some ( like @BruceWatusi ) have asked people to send Walsh decks of playing cards along with stories of nurses being overworked, dealing with high patient-to-nurse ratios and stressful environments. Also with the hashtag, @Lauren_CBee tweeted: "" If I had a dollar for every time I had time to play cards at work... I would have zero dollars .""
Then there's the nurse from West Virginia who posted the following reaction on YouTube while armed with some playing cards:
It isn't clear how Walsh may have gotten the idea that nurses play cards for ""a considerable amount of the day."" Many nurses work in card iology, take electro card iograms, or carry around ID cards . But play cards for a ""considerable amount of the day""? Is this the perspective of some of her constituents? What does she think happens in a hospital? Does she picture a poker scene from Cassius Marcellus Coolidge's 1894 painting with nurses instead of dogs? Does she think that the television show Poker After Dark was broadcast from a hospital at night?
Having worked in a number of hospitals and healthcare settings, I can say that I have never seen nurses play cards at work, even for a moment. I have seen nurses not eat or go to the toilet all day because they were so busy. I have seen nurses stay well beyond their shift times because they were actively caring for very ill patients. I have seen nurses regularly do extra work to compensate for and cope with considerable deficiencies in hospitals and clinics. I have seen nurses covered in blood, urine, and feces because they were trying to help save someone's life. And blood, feces, and urine are not part of any card game as far as I can tell.
There are certainly many jobs that make you wonder, ""what is that person doing all day?"" Like the person who is ""out of office"" so often that he or she should set a ""I am actually in the office"" automated email response. Or the person who claims that it is his or her job to help the people who are supposed to help the people who help the people who actually do the work. Or the person whose job it is to generate more paperwork. Or anyone resembling Bill Lumbergh from the movie Office Space .
Nursing certainly does not fall into this category. The value and impact of nurses and their skills are clear. Every day nurses help improve and save countless lives. If you don't already, someday you will really need and depend on nurses.
It would be great if nurses actually had the time to play cards. This way they could go to the toilet and eat regularly as well. You want anyone flying your plane, preparing your food, putting out the fire in your house, or taking care of your health to be, in general, well-rested and happy.
However, the nursing profession is facing the exact opposite situation: a burnout crisis. As a publication in the American Journal of Critical Care summarized, studies have found that ""burnout scores are significantly higher for hospital nurses than for other professionals"" and that ""every fifth nurse reported plans to leave his or her position within 1 year."" A survey of 3,312 registered nurses conducted by the Vickie Milazzo Institute revealed that 64% ""rarely get 7-8 hours of sleep in a night, with 33% specifying that they 'hardly ever' get this much sleep in a night. 77% ""do not regularly eat properly"" while 31% ""rarely eat at least two balanced meals per day."" 82% ""feel that it’s difficult to strike a work-life balance, while 28% 'always' have work on their mind."" 57% say ""it can be difficult to receive the help of others at their workplace.""
The survey did not ask about playing cards.
Is there any indication that nurses in smaller, rural hospitals have more card-playing opportunities? Well, reports suggest that the opposite may actually be the case. Kate Rogers has written for CNBC about how the nation has been facing a nursing shortage and how this shortage may be worse among rural hospitals.
The question is whether Walsh actually expected to make her statement about nurses playing cards without getting a backlash. Or whether she felt that the opinion of others who opposed the bill was much more important than the opinion of nurses.
This wouldn't be the first time that someone made a public statement without anticipating how health professionals would respond. For example, as I covered previously for Forbes , Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) tweeted about introducing legislation that would limit the ability of doctors to prescribe opioid medications even when needed and subsequently received push back over social media.
Then, there was the NRA (National Rifle Association) telling doctors to ""stay in their lane"" when it comes to gun violence. I wrote for Forbes about how many doctors did not take too kindly to this ill-advised order from the NRA. All of these do suggest a disturbing trend of health professionals not being properly consulted when major decisions are being made about health and health care. Health and health care are complex. If you want to make the right choices, nothing can replace the real experience and expertise that health care professionals bring.
Instead of claiming that nurses are playing cards, legislators should work with health professionals to find ways to fix our broken health care system that is leading to the burn out of many different health professionals. After all, your health will eventually be dealt a bad hand. When that happens, you don't want your care to depend on the luck of the draw of whether your nurse is burnt out or not. Bruce Y.

"Amazon Primed: Cryptocurrency May Arrive Faster, EU Clamp Down, Alexa Developers Get Schooled",www.forbes.com,Paul Armstrong,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2019/04/21/amazon-primed-cryptocurrency-may-arrive-faster-eu-clamp-down-alexa-developers-get-schooled/,"'Amazon Primed' is a short recap of the larger stories that dominated the headlines this week surrounding everyone's favourite cardboard abuser, Amazon. If you want the full, deep look at what Amazon is doing every week, subscribe to ' What Did Amazon Do This Week ' newsletter (called 'Obsessive...in the very best way.""). Ending it with 'weak' Q1 Earnings guidance, Amazon had a mixed week. Starting with opening it's third Amazon Go store in San Francisco (now more than ten stores across the world), announcing Hollywood directors for content announcements on Amazon Prime Video, the week quickly spiralled into investigations. Italy's competition watchdog announced multiple investigations into Amazon for alleged anti-competition practices. Amazon isn't the only company to pull criticism and adulation from different corners of the world but it is becoming more frequent for doing so.
In a move that will hopefully sort the fart apps builders from the health ones, Amazon announced its AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder for Developers - Specialty certification building. This move means that Developers who go through this course will be somewhat validated by Amazon;
The goal, says Amazon, is to open up “more opportunities to build engaging voice experiences” that can reach customers across the more than 100 million Alexa-enabled devices on the market today.
In other words, Amazon wants those Alexa developers dabbling with skill building to learn not only the basics, but also the industry best practices — then use this knowledge to create more skills that will actually resonate with customers.
The certification program arrives at a time when smart speakers have hit critical mass in the U.S., but the ecosystem of third-party skills has not had its “app store moment” with a breakout hit, as Bloomberg recently noted.
TechCrunch has the story .
Rakuten (aka the Amazon of Japan) launched 'Rakuten Wallet', a cryptocurrency offering, this week which left many pontificating about the future moves of Amazon in the cryptocurrency space - a move many believed was years away despite Amazon being bullish on crypto (the company has two blockchain products; Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) and Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) and domains registered) . Thanks to this move by Rakuten, Amazon may have to consider launching plans publicly in the space much earlier according to Forbes ;
Some big names in bitcoin and cryptocurrency have cheered the announcement, with the chief executive of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, repeating a past statement that this signals eventually ""everyone will be in crypto."" So far, Amazon has resisted calls for it to begin accepting bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao, often known simply as CZ, previously saying he expects Amazon adoption to trigger the next bitcoin bull run.
Rakuten Wallet, previously known as Everybody’s Bitcoin, was acquired by Rakuten for $2.4 million last August before being rebranded and ""closed for refurbishment"" in March.
Aimed directly at companies like Amazon, the European Parliament has passed online platform rules that stop what the EU sees as 'unfair practices'. While not perfect, the new rules push for greater transparency and rebalancing the power to the consumer. The push for transparency that will likely be met with obfuscation by all parties and cause some strategic changes to avoid disclosure but the rules are a step in the right direction for consumers and lawmakers to start penalising mega-businesses like Amazon for being anti-competitive;
The idea is to curb what the EU sees as unfair practices by app stores, search engines, ecommerce sites, and even hotel booking services. While the EU says the rules target about 7,000 online platforms, those most likely to be impacted are Amazon, eBay, Apple’s App Store, Google Play, Facebook, and Booking.com.
One of the goals is to give small businesses, which are increasingly dependent on such platforms, more leverage when they have grievances. For instance, the platforms will now be required to provide detailed explanations if they suspend an account, offer clearer terms of service, improve dispute resolution programs, and maintain greater transparency.
That last part is likely to cause the biggest rift between Europe and the tech giants. The EU expects disclosure of such information as how goods and services are ranked, the kind of insights companies typically insist must remain secret to avoid manipulation.

OnePlus 7 Pro Can Beat OnePlus 7 With Two Features,www.forbes.com,Jay McGregor,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/04/21/oneplus-7-pro-can-beat-oneplus-7-with-two-features/,"OnePlus is likely to announce a new ‘pro’ device to its flagship smartphone range when it launches the OnePlus 7 next month. But a new, beefed up, pro device probably means a significantly higher price tag. So what can OnePlus, a company that has defined itself around affordability, do to convince consumers to spend that extra cash on a pricier device over its standard OnePlus 7?
All of the features
‘Pro’ or ‘plus’ models typically mean bigger but technically similar devices. OnePlus - and other manufacturers - should flip this recent tradition on its head. Additional variants should mean clear differences between devices, and an opportunity to experiment (and test) with future features and design changes.
The rumours suggest OnePlus might actually do this by replacing the tear drop notch that houses the selfie camera with a pop-out module that, well, pops out of the top of the device. This kind of experimental attitude is great, but there’s so much more the Chinese company could do.
Reverse charging, additional camera sensors, flexible displays, huge batteries, improved biometrics and lots of other features are on the table. If you’re going to charge more - significantly more - for a top-tier smartphone, then give people more. Give them a reason to buy the Pro over the standard and pack it with every feature under the sun.
Presumably, this would give OnePlus a wealth of data about what is and isn’t popular, and help inform future design choices. Considering OnePlus’ position as the people’s manufacturer, it seems like an on-brand thing to do.
Why not use the Pro device to bring back some fan favourite features like the headphone jack and expandable storage (I’m happy to sacrifice the marginal gains in speed for more memory) too?
Perhaps, even, replaceable batteries (yes, I can hear your gasps) or, better yet, the freedom to replace your phone’s battery..
I’ll fix it
If Samsung’s impending flexgate isn’t a sign of why it’s important to make devices easier to repair, then I don’t know what is.
As I said, OnePlus positions itself as a community-led, underdog brand that challenges the big players with innovative design. How fixable a device is should be a big part of that equation.
Replacement parts for the 6T are roughly in-line with its competitors, and iFixit gave the 6T a decent repairability review (noting that the screen is particularly awkward to replace) - so OnePlus has a lot of ground to make up here.
Making a phone more repairable means building homebrew fixing into the design process, but also providing (or making available) tools, guides and building a repair community. All of this is entirely possible, the issue is how it affects the bottom line. People fixing, instead of upgrading , is a trend that threatens phone makers that rely on people buying new devices every 12 months.
But consumers holding on to their phones for longer is a trend, and I doubt that will change as smartphones soar past the $1000 mark. OnePlus could be the first to take the leap and become known for making a big consumer friendly decision: letting people fix their own phones with ease.
There’s also a chance that there’s an additional revenue stream here with kits, tools and modular upgrades. Repairing devices doesn’t have to mean the end of upgrades, rather finding a new way to sell to a group who are unlikely to upgrade.

'The Curse Of La Llorona' Tops Box Office With $26.5 Million Weekend,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/21/box-office-curse-of-la-llorona-conjuring-annabelle-breakthrough-penguins-disney-fox-easter/,"Warner Bros. and New Line's The Curse of La Llorona scared up a solid $26.5 million over Easter weekend. That's a touch higher than their last big ""not a Conjuring movie"" horror flick, David Sandberg's Lights Out which opened with $21.6 million in July of 2016. That well-received/well-reviewed horror hit went on to earn $67.2 million domestic and $148.9 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. The Curse of La Llorona may not be as leggy (it isn't nearly as good and Avengers: Endgame is on the way), but it also has the familiarity of existing within the Conjuring template as well as obvious appeal to religious minded and/or Hispanic horror fans. The decision to keep it apart from the ongoing Conjuring franchise is an amusing, if understandable, one. As someone who rolled my eyes as folks debated whether Life might be a Venom prequel (it was not) or whether A Quiet Place should’ve been a Cloverfield movie (it earned more than every Cloverfield movie combined), I can respect New Line’s insistence that The Curse of La Llorona does not “count” as a Conjuring film. However, having seen the film, it’s a “walks like a duck/quacks like a duck” scenario.
Never mind that it has the same producers, the same 1970’s period-piece settings, the same “R-rated but not gore-drenched” mentality and the same “Catholic dogma is accepted as outright fact” mentality. Never mind that it 104% takes place in the world of the Conjuring movies, including a cameo from Tony Amendola as Father Perez shown briefly with Annabelle. Never mind that it contains at least one new character (a Raymond Cruz’s drolly cynical freelance ghostbuster) who I would love to see in another movie.
I can theorize that had the reviews out of its SXSW premiere been more positive WB and friends might have been more willing to “count it,” although I will argue that (by default) it’s better than The Nun and Annabelle . Okay, so it’s not as gothically stylish as The Nun , but it is more narratively and visually coherent and it has a semblance of a human interest story that the first Conjuring prequel and the most recent Conjuring prequel lacked. Oh, and because the movie is mostly set within a Hispanic American community which generally believes in ghosts and goblins, we don’t get a bunch of “Egad, nobody believes me!” scenes.
It’s not a “good” movie, but Michael Chaves directs the hell out of it and in that sense, this works as a resume flick for his next gig, directing The Conjuring 3 . Anyway, I guess you can sell it as “If you loved The Conjuring , then you’ll tolerate The Curse of La Llorona !” All that being said, if it merely legs out like Annabelle ($84 million from a $237 million opening) and has a similar domestic/overseas split ($256 million global on a $6 million budget), then Curse of La Llorona could still be looking at a $60 million domestic and $180 million worldwide cume. That would still be a big win for the $9 million-budgeted Atomic Monster flick.
Despite (all due respect) a white leading actress (a game Linda Cardellini), white writers and a white guy directing, this chiller, based on a famous Mexican folk tale, is going to play as intended to the demographic in question. It earned another $31 million overseas for a $56.5 million worldwide opening weekend. Now bring on Annabelle Comes Home , which is essentially being sold as an Avengers -level (or at least Civil War -ish) crossover event for the cinematic universe. Place your bets.
In a weird coincidence, Walt Disney and 20th Century Fox (now part of Disney) released new movies on the same day. Fox 2000’s faith-based drama Breakthrough opened on Wednesday alongside Disneynature’s Penguins . Breakthrough , about a young boy who makes a miraculous recovery after falling into an icy lake, earned $11.5 million over the weekend for a $14.6million Wed-Sun debut.
The film received an A from CinemaScore and will hopefully be about as leggy as Miracles from Heaven . That Sony/Affirm release (which also opened on the Wednesday of Easter weekend) earned $61.705 million in 2016 from an $18.369 million five-day debut. A similar run would give the $14 million-budgeted DeVon Franklin-produced melodrama a perfectly-okay $49 million finish. This is oddly Fox's first faith-based biggie since Son of God (a$25 million opening/a $59 million finish) unofficially kicked off the trend of wholly mainstream faith-based dramas in 2014, as the rest have mostly come from Lionsgate, Sony and PureFlix.
Disneynature’s Penguins opened on Wednesday but hasn’t really gained traction, even by the dwindling standards of Disney’s nature documentary brand. The Ed Helms-narrated documentary earned $2.35 million over the Fri-Sun frame for a $3.3 million Wed-Sun debut in 1,815 theaters. At this rate, the film, admittedly a ""for the love of the game"" theatrical offering as opposed to a genuine money maker, will end up somewhere between $6 million and $9 million domestic.
This will play well on Disney+ alongside the deluge of acquired National Geographic content. This remains an “everybody can come” family tradition for us, even if my oldest has grown out of it and my youngest is now old enough to see other kid-friendly stuff in theaters."
"Why Sen. Walsh Said Nurses ""Play Cards For A Considerable Amount Of The Day""",www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/21/why-sen-walsh-said-nurses-play-cards-for-a-considerable-amount-of-the-day/?ss=healthcare,"A hospital is not a casino or a cruise ship. Nonetheless, Washington State Senator Maureen Walsh said the following when discussing a proposed state bill SHB 1155 that would mandate uninterrupted meal and rest periods for nurses: I understand helping with employees and making sure that we have rest breaks and things like that. But I also understand that we need to care for patients first and foremost. And by putting these types of mandates on a critical access hospital that literally serves a handful of hospitals. I would submit to you that those (small hospital) nurses probably do get breaks. They probably play cards for a considerable amount of the day.
Walsh was pushing for an amendment that would exempt smaller, rural hospitals from this mandate, an amendment that was subsequently adopted. Here is a tweet with a video of Walsh's statement:
Trust me, nurses haven’t earned the title ""most trusted profession"" for seventeen years running by ""playing cards"" on our shifts. WA Sen. Maureen Walsh should be ashamed to use #nurses to score cheap political points like this. #1U #nurseslife pic.twitter.com/ucm89ezpDj
— Bonnie Castillo (@NNUBonnie) April 19, 2019
Walsh, a Republican from Walla Walla, Washington, may wanna wanna reconsider her statement about nurses playing cards. If you thought that her statement would come up aces with the nursing profession, you'd be wrong. Not surprisingly, Walsh's statement has already received quite a negative reaction from nurses and those who support the well-being of nurses, which basically should be anyone with a human body.
Her comments spawned the creation of a new hashtag #nursesplayingcards. Using this hashtag, @LuckyLizzie tweeted out a picture of a bloody hospital floor with the label ""Last night's card game."" Some ( like @BruceWatusi ) have asked people to send Walsh decks of playing cards along with stories of nurses being overworked, dealing with high patient-to-nurse ratios and stressful environments. Also with the hashtag, @Lauren_CBee tweeted: "" If I had a dollar for every time I had time to play cards at work... I would have zero dollars .""
Then there's the nurse from West Virginia who posted the following reaction on YouTube while armed with some playing cards:
It isn't clear how Walsh may have gotten the idea that nurses play cards for ""a considerable amount of the day."" Many nurses work in card iology, take electro card iograms, or carry around ID cards . But play cards for a ""considerable amount of the day""? Is this the perspective of some of her constituents? What does she think happens in a hospital? Does she picture a poker scene from Cassius Marcellus Coolidge's 1894 painting with nurses instead of dogs? Does she think that the television show Poker After Dark was broadcast from a hospital at night?
Having worked in a number of hospitals and healthcare settings, I can say that I have never seen nurses play cards at work, even for a moment. I have seen nurses not eat or go to the toilet all day because they were so busy. I have seen nurses stay well beyond their shift times because they were actively caring for very ill patients. I have seen nurses regularly do extra work to compensate for and cope with considerable deficiencies in hospitals and clinics. I have seen nurses covered in blood, urine, and feces because they were trying to help save someone's life. And blood, feces, and urine are not part of any card game as far as I can tell.
There are certainly many jobs that make you wonder, ""what is that person doing all day?"" Like the person who is ""out of office"" so often that he or she should set a ""I am actually in the office"" automated email response. Or the person who claims that it is his or her job to help the people who are supposed to help the people who help the people who actually do the work. Or the person whose job it is to generate more paperwork. Or anyone resembling Bill Lumbergh from the movie Office Space .
Nursing certainly does not fall into this category. The value and impact of nurses and their skills are clear. Every day nurses help improve and save countless lives. If you don't already, someday you will really need and depend on nurses.
It would be great if nurses actually had the time to play cards. This way they could go to the toilet and eat regularly as well. You want anyone flying your plane, preparing your food, putting out the fire in your house, or taking care of your health to be, in general, well-rested and happy.
However, the nursing profession is facing the exact opposite situation: a burnout crisis. As a publication in the American Journal of Critical Care summarized, studies have found that ""burnout scores are significantly higher for hospital nurses than for other professionals"" and that ""every fifth nurse reported plans to leave his or her position within 1 year."" A survey of 3,312 registered nurses conducted by the Vickie Milazzo Institute revealed that
64% ""rarely get 7-8 hours of sleep in a night, with 33% specifying that they 'hardly ever' get this much sleep in a night. 77% ""do not regularly eat properly"" while 31% ""rarely eat at least two balanced meals per day."" 82% ""feel that it’s difficult to strike a work-life balance, while 28% 'always' have work on their mind."" 57% say ""it can be difficult to receive the help of others at their workplace."" The survey did not ask about playing cards.
Is there any indication that nurses in smaller, rural hospitals have more card-playing opportunities? Well, reports suggest that the opposite may actually be the case. Kate Rogers has written for CNBC about how the nation has been facing a nursing shortage and how this shortage may be worse among rural hospitals.
The question is whether Walsh actually expected to make her statement about nurses playing cards without getting a backlash. Or whether she felt that the opinion of others who opposed the bill was much more important than the opinion of nurses.
This wouldn't be the first time that someone made a public statement without anticipating how health professionals would respond. For example, as I covered previously for Forbes , Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) tweeted about introducing legislation that would limit the ability of doctors to prescribe opioid medications even when needed and subsequently received push back over social media.
Then, there was the NRA (National Rifle Association) telling doctors to ""stay in their lane"" when it comes to gun violence. I wrote for Forbes about how many doctors did not take too kindly to this ill-advised order from the NRA. All of these do suggest a disturbing trend of health professionals not being properly consulted when major decisions are being made about health and health care. Health and health care are complex. If you want to make the right choices, nothing can replace the real experience and expertise that health care professionals bring.
Instead of claiming that nurses are playing cards, legislators should work with health professionals to find ways to fix our broken health care system that is leading to the burn out of many different health professionals. After all, your health will eventually be dealt a bad hand. When that happens, you don't want your care to depend on the luck of the draw of whether your nurse is burnt out or not."
Week Ahead: An Indecisive Market,www.forbes.com,Tom Aspray,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspray/2019/04/21/the-week-ahead-an-indecisive-market/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin

Getty The health care sector did its best to disappoint investors last week. Even though United Health Care (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported better-than-expected earnings last week, both stocks are down so far this month. UNH has been hit the hardest, down over 10% while JNJ is showing just a slight loss.
www.advisorperspectives.com Those who ventured into the IPO market late in the week were rewarded: Zoom Video Communications rose 72%, while Pinterest was up a respectable 28%. The above hourly chart of the S&P 500 from Advisor Perspectives shows some decent swings during the day, but based on closing data, there was little net change. In my view, the lack of real upward progress and the fact that the S&P 500 could not hold its early gains on Tuesday are both signs of a tired market.
Tom Aspray - ViperReport.com The Spyder Trust (SPY) closed down 0.05% for the week, while the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) gained 0.84% and made a new all-time high. It is also noteworthy that the SPY closed the week very close to where it opened, and has thus formed a doji. The formation was discussed earlier this year in my article “ One Chart Formation You Shouldn't Ignore ”.
In addition to my analysis in February's article, another way to assess the formation is that the buying and selling pressure were basically equal, as neither was able to dominate the other. A negative or sell signal would be generated Friday by a close below the doji low of $288.66. The SPY has next strong support at $276.58 and the 20-week EMA, which is 4.9% below Thursday’s close.
Tom Aspray - ViperReport.com The market-leading Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is up 21.7% YTD, versus just a 16.6% YTD gain in the SPY. The daily chart shows a strong rally in April, up 8.9% as it made a new all-time high last week. It continues to trade well-above the rising 20-day EMA at $183.43. There is further chart support at $178.06 (line a).
The Nasdaq 100 A/D Line moved above its WMA on January 4, and then overcame month long resistance (line b) on the January 9. The A/D line made a new high on Tuesday and has been above its WMA since March 12. There is now more important support for the A/D line at the uptrend (line c).
According to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII), the Bullish% has been moving slightly above and below the long term average of 38.5%, dropping 2.7 points last week to 37.8%. The Bearish% rose 1.4 points last week to 21.8%, and is well below the long term average of 30.5%.
The sentiment of the institutional investors is a bit more interesting as the monthly Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager survey of 187 large money managers revealed they are not expecting a recession until the second half of 2020. They do have a “low growth, low inflation” outlook for the economy, but their “allocation to global equities rose 14 percentage points from March to a net 17% overweight, the largest increase since December 2016.” This outlook seems somewhat contradictory, and so while this survey data is interesting, I don't find their outlook actionable at the current moment..
Tom Aspray - ViperReport.com Another measure of investor sentiment that is more actionable is the NAAIM Exposure Index , which reports the average exposure to equity markets of their members. Even though their website states that “It is important to recognize that the NAAIM Exposure Index is not predictive in nature and is of little value in attempting to determine what the stock market will do in the future”, I find their action to often be quite illuminating.
For example, the index moved well above 100 in early December 2017 (point 1), but then at the end of January, it dropped to 52, a week before the sharp market decline in early 2018. At the end of March 2018, it dropped below 50 (point 2), and the Index was still low at the end of the month.
The index rose to a very high level in June and August of 2018 (point 3), but as the market started to correct, it dropped below 70 by the October 1 reading. On November 19, the index was at 27 and rose to 43 in early December it finally made a low on December 17 at 32 (point 4). It moved above its 13-week MA at the end of December. The April 17 reading was 93.37, and if the index tops out and then drops below its MA it may be a warning sign. The March low reading was 60.57.
It is too early to make a clear reading on the earnings season, as there are many more S&P 500 companies that report in the next few weeks. Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) report after the close next Wednesday, while Amazon.com (AMZN) reports after the close on Thursday. These three stocks make up over 25% of the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). Weakness in AMZN could also cause a pullback in the very strong Consumer Discretionary Select (XLY) which I reviewed a few weeks ago.
As I mentioned last week , the stock market is bullish but is getting stretched or overextended. Therefore, I recommend caution regarding any new positions, and to not buy any market that is too far above its rising 20-day EMA.
In my Viper ETF Report and the Viper Hot Stocks Report , I provide my market analysis twice each week with specific buy and sell recommendations for ETFs and stocks. Only $34.95 per month for each service.

This Scandinavian Wants America To Fall In Love With Licorice,www.forbes.com,David Nikel,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2019/04/21/this-scandinavian-wants-america-to-fall-in-love-with-licorice/,"Johan Bülow, founder of Lakrids by Bülow Lakrids by Bülow The Nordic region’s love affair with licorice shows no sign of slowing. I recently called out the black, salty variety as one of Scandinavia’s weirdest foods , but one Danish entrepreneur believes there’s much more to licorice than first meets the eye.
After achieving success back home, Johan Bülow with his brand Lakrids by Bülow (lakrids simply means licorice in Danish) has now signed a distribution deal in the United States with New York's Chelsea Market Baskets . But is America and the rest of the world really ready to fall in love with real licorice?
What we’re talking about here isn’t the mass-produced artificially-red strings of candy popular in the USA. Kelila Jaffe, Food Program Coordinator for the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University explained the difference to the Huffington Post :
""Black licorice candy is flavored with the extract of the licorice plant. Red licorice, or other colors, are usually fruit flavored by artificial or natural means, and do not contain licorice flavoring.""
A love for real licorice
As a Scandinavian, Bülow had been brought up on licorice yet wasn’t happy with the products on the market. He compares the licorice root, from which the end product is made, to the chocolate or coffee bean.
“The licorice we know comes from the root of a plant. It’s 100 per cent natural and sourced primarily from the Middle East, South Italy, and China. People understand the differences in the coffee or chocolate depending on growing conditions, but few people have looked into the same differences for the licorice root,” he says.
After several years of trial and error, he opened his first store in 2007. The initial product proved popular, but the real breakthrough came two years later. Together with his production manager, Bülow developed the idea to coat the licorice with chocolate. They were told that it couldn’t be done.
From Denmark to the world
Fast-forward to 2019, and Lakrids by Bülow has brand recognition of up to 60 per cent in the Danish capital Copenhagen. That’s quite an achievement for a product that Bülow freely admits is premium priced and aimed squarely at the luxury buyer. But despite this success, he wants to approach the American market differently. Johan Bülow has opened stores in trendy locations such as Berlin's Bikini Lakrids by Bülow
On what’s in store for the American market, Bülow says he would love to make a premium quality, organic version of the popular red licorice candy: “We are already making an organic product today where we slow cook the licorice for up to four hours. I would like to do a premium version by sourcing organic strawberries and going from there. Simple works best.""
A versatile product
Aside from the limited edition and country-specific products, Lakrids by Bülow has a signature numeric collection and a signature alphabetical collection. The former features the classic salty and sweet variety, while the latter includes various chocolate-coated lines.
Bülow is also keen to demonstrate the versatility of the true licorice flavor by taking the licorice root extract and spray-drying it into powder or juicing it. He invites experts from other areas to come up with their own creations. “We are the experts in the raw product, but we’ve worked with everyone from Michelin star chefs and leading bartenders to chocolate and ice-cream makers,” he says.
Recipes featured on the company blog include raspberry mousse cake with peach and licorice, meringue nests with licorice cream, and roasted almonds with licorice.
Those sceptical of Bülow’s chances of conquering America may want to cast their eyes to the Middle East, where his concept of adapting the core product to the market has worked wonders. Dubai is Bülow’s biggest export market and the treats are even served on board in the first class cabin of selected Emirates flights.
“One of our popular products in the region is made from dehydrated rose leaves. It’s not a typical Scandinavian flavor but it works there,"" he explains, adding, ""this is how we’re going to make the world fall in love with licorice!”

Photo courtesy of Grand Hyatt Manila It looked like a burger—smelled like one, even tasted the same. “What you just tasted are plant based burgers,’ revealed Grand Hyatt Manila’s Executive Chef Mark Hagan during the launch of Green Mondays. The concept was simple, but impactful.
At the Hyatt's Grand Kitchen , a full section will be devoted to tasty, filling, high-frequency vegan dishes. That includes a mouthwatering BBQ cheeseburger topped with coleslaw, cheese, onion rings, jalapenos made using Beyond Meat . Other sinful, yet healthy options include a chili cheese dog served with aioli, chili con carne, grated cheese and jalapenos. There are Asian-inspired dishes also offer that include dimsum using OmniPork. Desserts are tasty, making it almost impossible to believe that it is actually guilt-free. The healthy spread highlights ingredients and dishes that are free of antibiotics and hormones, gluten, GMO and cholesterol.

Green Monday is the brainchild of plant-based natural food distributor, Green Commo n. The company has innovated healthy dishes with the introduction of Beyond Meat and Beyond Sausage. “Making healthier choices easier for our guests is one thing, but add to that actually serving up choices that took into consideration your health, environmental impact and sustainability is really going beyond just enjoying good food and enjoying food that is actually good for you,” explained Chef Mark Hagan. The initiative, according to Hyatt’s Executive Chef, is prelude to larger efforts for advocating better dining options. “We are rolling out Green Mondays first and then gradually introducing more plant-based choices and expanding into our six other restaurants.” Soon, other food outlets--No. 8 China House, The Cellar, The Lounge, Pool House, Florentine and The Peak--at the Grand Hyatt will offer a wider vegan menu that will add to the joy of eating clean.

UFC Lightweight Champ Khabib Nurmagomedov Has A Message For Dustin Poirier: Prepare To Be Mauled,www.forbes.com,Trent Reinsmith,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2019/04/21/ufc-lightweight-champ-khabib-nurmagomedov-has-a-message-for-dustin-poirier-prepare-to-be-mauled/,"Khabib Nurmagomedov did not think Dustin Poirier would beat Max Holloway at UFC 236, but he did, and now it looks as if Nurmagomedov and Poirier could meet as early as September. “I think it was very good performance from Dustin Poirier,” Nurmagomedov said on the UFC on ESPN+ 7 post-fight show. “Honestly, before fight I think Holloway going to beat him. This is my prediction when you talk with friends, with father, with team, but he impressed me. Dustin has impressed me. I think he has very good boxing, much better than before. Every fight he becomes stronger, better in boxing on his feet. I think he deserve title shot. He already interim UFC lightweight champion, I am real lightweight champion. We have to fight. Now we’re working on this.”
With the unanimous decision win over Holloway, who is the UFC featherweight champion, Poirier claimed the interim lightweight title. The UFC opted to award an interim strap because Nurmagomedov, who holds the 155-pound title, is serving a nine-month suspension related to the post-fight brawl that broke out after he submitted Conor McGregor at UFC 229 in October.
Poirier, a member of the UFC roster since 2011, had never fought for a UFC title before facing Holloway at UFC 236. The way Nurmagomedov sees it, Poirier’s time as a UFC champion will not be lengthy.
“He have very good background, he have good ground game – not bad – he have good striking game,” Nurmagomedov said. “I follow him long time and versus me – I think I have to maul him like I do with everybody. This is what I have to do. I respect him like fighter, like human, but when we go to the cage, I have to maul this guy. This is what I want, and right now I am focused on September. Five months before fight, and I think it’s going to be really good fight with him.”"
What You Need To Know About Chatbots,www.forbes.com,Tom Taulli,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2019/04/21/what-you-need-to-know-about-chatbots/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
Zoho website
Zoho According to BI Intelligence, about 80% of businesses will use chatbots -- which are applications that engage in interactive conversation using natural voice or text – by 2020. Juniper Research also forecasts that this technology will save businesses about $8 billion annually by 2022.
“Due to advancements in AI technology, natural language processing and speech recognition, the cost of developing chatbots has come down drastically, which is fueling the explosive growth of this market,” said Jeri John Deva George, who is the Head of Zoho’s SalesIQ and Cliq .
Yet it’s customer service that chatbots will likely see much of the traction, at least in the next few years. “With chatbots able to engage customers seamlessly around the clock, this is poised to completely change the online customer experience game, while saving time and money,” said Patrick Welch, who is the president and CMO of Bigtincan . “The main goal of these chatbots is to assist customers with getting to their end goal as quickly as possible, whether it is finding out more information, or making a sale. In the end, it’s ideally to replicate the success of top performing customer agents.”
So then, what are the ways to implement chatbots in your organization? What are the best practices and, well, the gotchas? Here are some things to keep in mind:
Set Expectations : Chatbots are not silver bullets. In fact, there are many ways they can go wrong!
“For a great customer experience it is crucial to not try and ‘trick’ customers into thinking the AI chatbot is a real person – and make it clear when they have switched from a bot to a person,” said Chris Bauserman, who is the VP of Product and Segment Marketing at NICE inContact . “Start with a focused pilot covering topics that you already successfully provide self-service options for, test and learn quickly, then iterate and expand from there.”
Understand The Customer Process : Look at ways to better personalize the experience. Otherwise, a chatbot may ultimately be worse than using a traditional approach.
“Customers may get annoyed if they have to repeat all their details to a human agent after having painstakingly typed it into a chatbot interface,” said Michael D. Mills, who is the Senior Vice President of Global Sales at the Contact Center division of CGS . “Failure to centralize customer service information can lead to negative experiences.”
Focus On Data : In other words, there should be ongoing data analytics to understand trends. “This will help a brand build profiles on its customers which will then personalize the experience even more,” said Jonathan Taylor, who is the CTO of zoovu . “Collecting this insight will also help brands understand how the navigation of their site works.”
Think Different With Design : Your experience with designing websites or mobile apps may lead you down the wrong path. Consider that chatbots have their own unique requirements.
“How should your company sound?” said Gillian McCann, who is the Head of Cloud Engineering & at Workgrid Software . “Think carefully about brand and personality and what it says about your company. Also be prepared for users to say the most unexpected things and build in conversation flows that can handle going off topic. There should also be an awareness of local or cultural differences in language.”
The Future of Chatbots
Chatbots certainly have some powerful underlying technology. According to David Karandish, who is the founder and CEO of Jane.ai : ""Natural language processing is used to understand what the user meant. Within NLP, companies use neural networks to make inferences around matching, as well as create the right ensemble of algorithms that use a combination of classical techniques and modern neural networks to 'vote' on the best matching response.""
Yes, it's enough to make your head spin. But for the most part, chatbots allow for effective interactions at scale.
More importantly, the technology is still in the early phases. “I must emphasize that chatbots augment humans, not replace them entirely,” said Antonio Cangiano, who is the AI Evangelist at IBM and teaches a course on chatbots . “As a result, it would be a mistake to expect so-called strong AI a la Sci-Fi movies, at this stage.”
This is critical to keep in mind. But the future does look very promising as chatbots are likely to be impactful for your business. “There will be a shift away from chatbots being simply reactive,” said Stefan Ritter, who is the co-founder and Head of Product at Ruum by SAP . “As AI becomes more advanced and chatbots collect more data, bots will start to develop the ability to predict what a user’s next move might be, or what problem they may be experiencing, and act on it in real time.""

Facebook Demands Email Passwords Then Quietly Uploads Contact Lists But Once Again We Don't Care,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/21/facebook-demands-email-passwords-then-quietly-uploads-contact-lists-but-once-again-we-dont-care/,"Just weeks after Facebook acknowledged it had been secretly storing its users’ passwords in cleartext on its servers where they had been accessed more than 9 million times by its employees, the Daily Beast reported earlier this month that the company had quietly begun requiring some users to verify their accounts by handing over the password to the email account they had used to create their Facebook profile. At the time, the outlet noted that “the company has recently been criticized for repurposing information it originally acquired for ‘security’ reasons.” It turns out this was exactly what happened, as Facebook logged into users’ outside email accounts and “ unintentionally ” silently uploaded a copy of their address book to its servers without their knowledge or consent, making off with more than 1.5 million people’s contact lists. The company has promised to delete the data but did not respond when asked to commit to a specific date by which it would agree to delete the illicitly obtained lists. How did we reach a point where a major company felt it acceptable to demand users hand over to it the passwords to their email accounts and then quietly harvested their contact lists? Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Facebook’s latest privacy scandal is not that it happened at all, but rather that it generated so little outrage and that none of us will actually leave the platform.
Looking globally, the story was barely a blip on the tech media radar. Certainly, it garnered a few headlines, but it was far from the kind of all-encompassing week-long deluge of outrage that was once associated with such massive privacy and security breaches.
It is almost unheard of in today’s cyber-conscious digital world for an online service to demand that its users hand over their passwords to outside services as sensitive as their email just for the right and privilege to use their product.
There are plenty of products that offer value-add to email and social media services and thus require permission to access those accounts on behalf of a user, but in those cases there is an explicit need for the access and the user understands why access is needed and explicitly grants that access.
More to the point, there is no major service today that requires users hand over their passwords to facilitate its access. In fact, with two-factor hardware authentication, password-based logins from one service into another are increasingly impossible.
Instead, services use streamlined authentication processes that never require outside services to ever access a user’s password and explicitly grant what privileges that service is granted to the user's data.
Facebook never actually needed access to a user’s email account for the purposes of authenticating them. Since the dawn of the modern web, services have authenticated users’ email accounts simply by sending them an email with a link to click or a code to copy-paste back into an authentication form to verify that they have access to the account in question.
Requiring users to fork over their password to verify that they have access to an email account is simply unheard of and an unprecedented breach of modern security practices.
Beyond confirming that the password request was indeed an officially sanctioned product and not the work of a rogue coder or an internal error, Facebook has remained silent on why it believed it was acceptable security practice to request users hand over their email passwords. The company unsurprisingly did not respond to a request for comment.
It turns out one of the reasons for needing this password is that Facebook was quietly logging into users’ email accounts and silently harvesting their contact lists, which it was uploading to its own servers.
When confronted with its activities, the company has remained largely silent about its actions other than to claim that the harvesting was “unintentional” and that it would be deleting the harvested lists at some point.
Yet, the company has declined to commit to a specific date by which it would delete the illicitly acquired data and it did not respond to a request for comment on why.
In fact, since users legally, if not willingly, consented to the harvesting, it is unclear whether the company actually faces any legal obligation to delete the data it acquired. It did not respond when asked whether there were any GDPR implications of the harvesting.
It is especially notable that for such a serious and consequential breach, the company did not offer a more forcible apology, coupled with a top-down external review of its security practices and did not promise to delete all of the acquired data within 24 hours.
To date, the company has either declined to comment or simply not responded at all to every request for comment as to whether it would commit to permitting an external independent third-party review of its entire security infrastructure and stance.
With breach after breach, it seems we know why: the company is too afraid of what such an audit would reveal.
Putting this all together, it is truly extraordinary that in 2019 Facebook would consider it acceptable security practice to demand that users hand over their passwords and permitted more than 1.5 million users’ address books to be harvested and has resisted requests to offer a timeline by which the illicitly acquired data would be deleted.
Facebook’s actions remind us just how cavalier of an approach it takes to safety and security.
In the end, however, it really doesn’t matter because Facebook has successfully convinced the public and policymakers not to care about their safety, security or privacy online.
Once again, we will just sit back and wait for the next revelation of another massive Facebook security breach but none of us will ever leave the platform no matter what it does to us."
Headlights Are Safer In Europe; Changes To U.S. Standard Proposed,www.forbes.com,Tanya Mohn,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tanyamohn/2019/04/21/headlights-are-safer-in-europe-changes-to-u-s-standard-proposed/,"Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin
The dangers of headlights on U.S. vehicles and the benefits of a new technology: adaptive driving beam headlights (ADB) are highlighted in a new report.
(photo courtesy of the AAA) Nighttime crashes have the highest death rate for both drivers and pedestrians, but headlights currently in use in the United States often do not provide adequate lighting to illuminate roads. Headlight technology already in vehicles in Europe and Canada, however, has the potential to improve visibility and safety if widely employed in this country.
Those are the main findings of new research by the AAA released on Tuesday that examined the limitations of some headlights and showed the importance of allowing adaptive driving beam headlights (ADB) on U.S. roads, currently not possible by federal standards.
“Driving at night doesn’t have to be such a risky undertaking for Americans,” John Nielsen, AAA’s managing director of automotive engineering and repair, said in a statement. “The technology not only exists but is being used in other parts of the world to effectively provide the amount of light needed to keep drivers and pedestrians safer.”
The AAA research found that European vehicles equipped with the advanced headlight technology, a system that continuously adjusts high beams to adapt their beam patterns to improve illumination without causing glare, increase roadway lighting by as much as 86% when compared to U.S.
With ADB systems, the high beams are always on and when another vehicle is detected, that area is shaded to prevent glare that would interfere with the other driver’s field of vision, according to the study, which evaluated and compared the performance of U.S. and European headlights.
Previous AAA research found that two-thirds of Americans (64%) said they do not regularly use their high beams at night, so when driving at moderate speeds like 40 mph with low beams on, motorists will not have enough time to appropriately react to something or someone. High beam headlights, the group said, provide an average of 28% more forward illumination than low beams, and are more effective at providing the proper amount of light when traveling at higher speeds.
The report also indicated that some newer U.S. vehicles are equipped with a similar technology that automatically switches between high and low beams, which helps to increase visibility, but only when other vehicles aren’t present. Once an oncoming or preceding vehicle is detected, the car will switch from high to low beams, which results in losing the benefit of the additional light.
The AAA said it supports federal changes to the law, noting that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed an amendment last fall to allow manufacturers the option of equipping vehicles with ADB systems. But until standards change, the group recommends that drivers take the following precautions when driving after dark on unlit roads:
· Use high beams whenever possible, as there is a difference between seeing the roadway markings, signs, and other vehicles, versus being able to perceive a non‐reflective object in the driver's path.
· Monitor and adjust driving speeds to allow enough time to detect, react and stop the vehicle in order to avoid striking a person, animal or object.
· If your car’s headlamp lenses are not crystal clear, have them restored or replaced to improve light output.
Inexpensive replacement and restoration services are available at most repair shops, but only one-in-five Americans reported performing a headlight restoration service, the AAA said. Previous research by the group found that deteriorated headlamps produce only 22 % of the light output (low beam) that new, original headlights provide. Original equipment manufacturer headlight replacement parts restore headlights to like new condition;.professional and DIY restorations returned light output by up to 70 %.

Chef Carla Hall's Guide To Embracing Your Authenticity,www.forbes.com,Micheline Maynard,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2019/04/21/chef-carla-halls-guide-to-being-authentic/,"Carla Hall, the effervescent chef and television host, has gone through some big changes in the past couple of years. While she built her brand on comfort food, served with love, her latest cookbook, Carla Hall's Soul Food , marks her enthusiastc embrace of her African-American heritage.
The former model also led her social media fans through her journey to letting her hair, one of her most distinctive features, go gray.
On the down side, Hall lost her co-host spot on ABC-TV's The Chew last year after seven years on the air. The show was canceled in the wake of a sexual harassment scandal involving another co-host, celebrity chef Mario Batali.
Meanwhile, Hall's fried chicken-focused restaurant in the uber competitive Brooklyn market stayed open barely a year.
Still, her optimism is as strong as ever, fueled by her unexpected turn in March as an interviewer for former first lady Michelle Obama's highly publicized book tour.
Hall, 54, who has been called ""the most visible person in black food right now,"" shared advice on embracing your authentic self, and letting the world know that you are shifting your approach.
Why she is focusing on African-American cuisine: In her earlier cookbooks, Hall focused on comfort food, stressing that she cooked with love. But two developments changed her approach.
First, Hall explored her African roots through a DNA test. It showed that she was descended from the Yoruba in Nigeria and the Bubi from Bioko Island, which is off the coast of western Africa.
(You can hear her discussing the findings on African Ancestry Radio.)
""That had such an impact on me, but I didn’t know what to do with that information,"" Hall says.
Then, she began working with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African-American History and Culture, which opened in 2016.
Hall became the ambassador for its Sweet Home Cafe, which serves dishes from across the country. The cafe is considered one of the best museum restaurants in the country, and Hall's cookbook is prominently featured in its impressive gift shop.
""It all came into focus, and I wanted to do a book that meant something to me,"" Hall says. ""And I didn’t want a book that was homogenized...So it was really about, 'I do a book that means something to me and is about my food and my culture, or I don’t do a cookbook at all.'""
Adopting a new identity: ""The realization is the most important thing,"" Hall says. ""Once somebody decides they are a thing, everything changes. Their perspective about themselves changes.""
She recommends talking to family and close friends first, and enlisting their support. ""Because they know you, they can see you as a 'buy in' of the thing you want to embrace. Then, you can go outside your circle.""
Her hair is an example. ""I decided to go gray and not color my hair. I began by talking to my hair stylist, talking to my mom, my husband, the people I worked with. After that, was smooth sailing.""
Adds Hall, ""It’s so important to be yourself. If you can’t own who you are, no one else is going to own it. No one else is going to accept you for who you are.""
But, she cautions against simply laying out a new direction and telling people to deal with it. That, she says, seems too ""harsh.""
""If you just become that person, and allow people to sort of get to know you and who you are, that’s a gentler and more loving way for that transition to happen,"" Hall says.
""Might you lose friends? Yes. Might you stop talking to your family? Absolutely. But the gentle approach is to allow people to have their feelings. You want to be gentle with yourself.""
The lessons she learned from failure: Despite its cancellation, Hall considers The Chew ""very successful. It lasted for seven seasons and 1,500 episodes so that was consistently successful.""
The closing of her restaurant was not out of the ordinary, since most new restaurants close within five years, according to data from the Small Business Association.
""Even though I cooked, it was not something I had done as in opening a restaurant. That was a huge learning curve,"" Hall says.
""I learned about location, about hiring and who I wanted to hire, what values I wanted to share when people were working with me. Everything I learned about myself with The Chew and the restaurant, I would do it again in a heart beat.""
On the TV show, Hall says she got to work with ""incredible people"" including her co-hosts Batali, fashion expert Clinton Kelly and chef Michael Symon.
""A lot of people want to focus outwardly on the success and failures, where everything is a learning curve. I don’t push away my lessons. If you go the easy route, you will never get where you are supposed to be.""
So, says Hall, ""bring it on. My six word novel is Say Yes, Adventure Follows, Then Growth. I’m ready to grow because I’m ready to go to the next level.""
Interviewing Michelle Obama: ""That experience is not something I would have dared to put on a bucket list,"" Hall says of her March interview with Obama . ""I don’t set goals. I set intentions. One of my big ones is to always be happy and to be growing and doing that interview said, 'I am ready to do this thing.'""
Hall says she learned an enormous amount watching Kelly, who has been a co-host of What Not To Wear as well as part of The Chew panel, and used his lessons as she talked with the former First Lady.
""It was incredible,"" she says of the Obama interview. ""I was able to be present and listen to Michelle and be in the moment for the interview."" While she had questions ready, Hall says she set some of them aside and simply listened to where the interview should go.
Why growth is so hard: Hall is a mentor to her 31-year-old niece, who often complains of the difficulties she has encountered as she experiences new things.
""The thing I tell her: if you want to be the person that is in your head, that awesome, confident, great person, you are going to have to go through the hard things,"" Hall says.
She compares it to comfortable, but well-worn clothing. ""You’re never going to get to that new pair (of shoes or that new leather smell or that feeling of going to the next level by staying comfortable,"" Hall says.
""I truly believe you will never, ever get there by being safe. If you don’t feel some form of uncomfortable and growing out of the old, you will never get there. If you’re still challenged by a kindergarten test in 12 th grade, you haven’t grown, and I think you can look at your life like that.""
How Hall looks at aging: ""One thing I can say about myself as I get older is that I have this confidence I never had. When people say to me, 'Oh, do you want to be 30 again or in your 20s again,' I say, never!""
Says Hall, ""I feel the most attractive (she ever has) even though maybe I’m getting bigger, maybe I’m going through menopause and getting wrinkles on my neck. When I see a woman walking down the street and she’s confident, that is the most attractive thing.
""Now,"" Hall says, ""I’m looking forward to 60."""
'Captain Marvel' And 'Shazam' Both Just Hit Big Box Office Milestones,www.forbes.com,Scott Mendelson,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/21/captain-marvel-shazam-avengers-endgame-hellboy-dc-films-mcu-box-office-wonder-woman-batman/,"We are just days away from Avengers: Endgame , and it seems that excitement over the MCU season finale is bleeding over into the other big superhero movies. Okay, not to Hellboy (-59% for a $3.88 million second weekend and $19.676 million ten-day cume), but I digress. Both Captain Marvel (+9%) and Shazam! (-29%) had ridiculously good holds this weekend, and both hit box office milestones. Captain Marvel is now past $400 million domestic while Shazam! hit $300 million global. That may be good news for both holdovers as they face a movie that may crush any and all short term box office records next weekend. First off, Shazam! earned $17.34 million in its third weekend of domestic release, bringing its 17-day cume to $121.342 million. That's a stunning 29% drop, which is lower than the 29.5% third-weekend drop for Wonder Woman back in 2017. Yes, that's partially because of Good Friday and Easter Sunday, but that's still a hell of a hold for the DC Films flick. Heck, it's the seventh -smallest third-weekend-drop for any big comic book and/or superhero movie over the last 32 years.
For reference (and I'm being generous with the ""superhero"" designation), it's behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (+15% in 2018), The Matrix (-20% in 1999), Blade (whose third weekend was Labor Day in 1998), The Crow (whose third weekend was Memorial Day in 1994), Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (-28% in 1991), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (-25% in 1990) and Robocop (-26% in 1987). That may not mean anything in the long run, but it took me too long to look that up (even Batman dipped 36% in weekend three and Wonder Woman dipped 29.5% in weekend three) for me not to share it.
Anyway, with $121 million in 17 days, the film is now positioned to soar past the $150 million mark in North America, which is a perfectly strong figure for a $90 million comic book flick. If Rampage was able to earn 30% of its domestic total ($30 million out of $101 million) after Avengers: Infinity War opened, then Shazam! should be able to survive the second ""Avengers v. Thanos"" smackdown. If anything, WB's own Detective Pikachu is probably a bigger threat to Shazam! than Avengers: Endgame . While a $400 million-plus finish will be a close call (mostly thanks to relative disinterest in China), it still crossed $300 million worldwide this weekend for a $322 million cume.
'Shazam!'
Warner Bros. Barring flukes in either direction, it should end up with around $395 million global, about on par with (the far more expensive) Alita: Battle Angel ($405 million), Mad Max: Fury Road ($370 million), Edge of Tomorrow ($371 million). Is that a super-huge number? No, but it's about on par with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse ($375 million on a $90 million budget) and The Nun ($366 million global on a $22 million budget). There's a reason WB and New Line didn't spend Aquaman money on a Shazam movie. When you spend less money, you can celebrate a smaller overall global gross. Maybe the sequel will breakout due to the quality/goodwill from this one. But as long as the budget is kept in check, it doesn't have to.
On the other hand, Captain Marvel 2 (or whatever it's eventually called) can cost a lot more than the first film's $150 million budget. The Brie Larson flick earned $9.4 million (+9%) in its seventh weekend to sail past the $400 million mark in North America. Yes, it's getting an Avengers; Endgame boost, one even bigger (relatively speaking) than did Black Panther (-14% on this weekend last year) just before Avengers: Infinity War . So, yes, the boost in weekday grosses, partially due to folks taking in one last viewing as part of their pre- Endgame MCU marathons, continued over the holiday weekend. The Chadwick Boseman drama went on to earn an additional $16.4 million after Avengers: Infinity War opened last summer.
Black Panther dropped just 4% on the weekend that Avengers 3 snagged a $258 million Fri-Sun domestic debut. Black Panther earned 2.3% of its money after Avengers: Infinity War opened in theaters. Should Captain Marvel play likewise (and that number may be higher), then we’re probably looking at a final domestic total of $417 million, just above Wonder Woman ($412.5 million in 2017) and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom ($416 million last summer). Educated speculation aside, next year's MCU schedule is still a mystery, as they have kept mum thus far about plans after Spider-Man: Far From Home . But they may want to consider having a pre-summer MCU flick opening right before the big summer kick-off flick as a matter of course."
How To Create Unique Passwords For Every Account That Are Hard To Guess And Easy To Remember,www.forbes.com,Kevin Murnane,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2019/04/21/how-to-create-unique-passwords-for-every-account-that-are-hard-to-guess-and-easy-to-remember/,"12,597 views Apr 21, 2019, 11:55am How To Create Unique Passwords For Every Account That Are Hard To Guess And Easy To Remember Create a good password Credit: JanBaby/Pixabay Passwords are a problem. Every account should have a unique password that’s hard to guess. But how do you remember all those unique passwords when you have a lot of accounts? The problem gets worse if you try to make passwords that are difficult for others to guess because they're usually difficult for you to guess as well. Many people don't bother and use a single password for all their accounts that's easy to remember like 123456. A solution like this may be convenient, but it makes it very easy for hackers to access all your accounts.
Think nobody is foolish enough to use a password like 123456? The National Cyber Security Centre in the UK analyzed passwords found in public databases of breached accounts and discovered that 123456 was the password used by more than 23 million people . Yikes!
There’s a better way. Consider this password, Koma 3443 NF#$$# . It looks like a complicated mishmash but it's based on a template that's designed to make unique passwords easy to generate and easy to remember. The template has four components: an alphabetic sequence (Koma), a numeric sequence (3443), an identifier (NF) and a symbol sequence (#$$#). The components are designed to be easy to remember and easy to type, and the only component that changes from one password to the next is the identifier. Here’s how the system works. Create a password that's hard to guess. Credit: The Digital Artist/Pixabay
Alphabetic sequence
The alphabetic sequence (Koma) personalizes your passwords. It should be at least four letters long and include both upper- and lower-case letters. Personalize it by choosing a word that’s meaningful to you and then make it harder to guess by only using part of the word. For example, if you were born in Takoma Washington you might shorten Takoma to Koma. Don’t use full names like Takoma because they’re too easy to guess. You can place upper-and lower-case letters wherever you wish (koMa) as long as you use at least one of each. The password will also be easier for you to use if you make it easy to type.
Numeric sequence
The numeric sequence (3443) should be a simple pattern of at least four numbers. Patterns made from adjacent numbers (34 or 12) or numbers separated by one digit (35 or 13) are easy to type. The pattern is more important than the numbers because remembering a simple pattern is easier than remembering a sequence of digits. Patterns like 3434 or 4343 work just as well as 3443.
Remembering the pattern also lets you change the number sequence without having to memorize a different string of numbers. Just start with a different number and repeat the same pattern. All you have to remember is the first number in the sequence. For example, 3443 becomes 8998 when you start with 8 rather than 3. If you wish, you can easily categorize passwords by using a different first number for different categories such as starting with 1 (1221) for shopping accounts and 6 (6776) for financial accounts. Create a password that's easy to remember. Credit: Absolut Vision/Pixabay
Identifier
The identifier (NF) is the one component of the template that differs for every password. It should be an acronym for the password’s account. For example, NF is an acronym for Netflix. The identifier is the only unique thing you’ll have to remember or guess when asked to enter a password. Don’t try and get clever with it; choose an acronym that’s the first thing that comes to mind when you need the password to log in. If NX works better for you than NF as an acronym for Netflix, use it.
The key feature of the identifier is that it's the first thing that comes to mind when you see the name of the account. It doesn’t matter how long it is. NF may be right for Netflix while CHITRI may work best for the Chicago Tribune.
Any combination of upper- and lower-case letters is okay as long as the pattern remains the same for all your identifiers. Acronyms that use only one case are both easier to remember and easier to type. An alternative is to capitalize only the first letter of each word in the acronym such as Nf or ChiTri. Don’t use different patterns for different passwords because you'll have to remember both the acronym and the pattern which is harder to do.
Symbol sequence
Many websites now require passwords that include symbols as well as alphanumeric characters and upper- and lower-case letters. The problem is that symbols are harder to remember than letters or numbers. Fortunately, there’s an easy solution because symbols are paired with numbers on the qwerty keyboard. You can use the same sequence for symbols that you did for numbers by just holding down the shift key when entering the symbols. Thus 3443 becomes #$$#.
A simple variant of this scheme is to move the number pattern up or down one digit for the symbol pattern. For example, if your number pattern is 3443, use 4554 which is $%%$ with the shift key held down. Note that this solution doesn't work as well for some cell phone keyboards that don't map symbols to digits like the qwerty keyboard. Create a good password that's easy for you to unlock. Credit: JanBaby/Pixabay
Putting it all together
The example password (Koma 3443 NF#$$#) follows a numerical, alphabetic, identifier, symbol sequence. You can order the components of the sequence any way you like, for example 3443KomaNF#$$# or #$$#NFKoma3443. Just make sure you use the same order for all of your passwords. You can also modify the template however you please as long as you always use the same template.
A template like this works best if you use it to create passwords that are easy to remember and easy to guess when you can't remember. Your passwords will be easy to remember if the only thing that differs from one password to the next is the identifier. They will be easy for you to guess if the identifier is the first acronym that comes to mind. The rest of the password looks complicated but learning it is easy. The alphabetic sequence is a word that is meaningful to you, and you only have to remember a key-press pattern and the first digit for the numeric and symbol sequences. The alphabetic, numeric and symbol segments of each password will quickly become automatic because they’re the same for all your passwords.
A password that's easy for you to guess isn't as easy for a hacker to guess because the hacker doesn't know your template, how the components are ordered or the sequences you used for each component. She could figure this out but she'd need at least two of your passwords and she'd need to know that both passwords are used by the same person.
Is this template the best type of password protection you can have? Not at all. Using two-factor authentication or the random strings generated by password protection apps is better than relying on a password you create. But when you’re creating your own passwords, the template is much better than using the same password for more than one account or using an easy to guess password like 123456.

The Main Obstacle To Success: What If Someone Find Out Who Really I am?,www.forbes.com,Paloma Cantero-Gomez,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/palomacanterogomez/2019/04/21/the-main-obstacle-to-success-what-if-someone-find-out-who-really-i-am/,"Fight the fear photo credit: Getty Getty Many times, fear is exposed in the shape of our anxiety response to easily locatable perceived threats, such as the simple idea of us speaking in public or taking a long intercontinental flight. While not always easy at least, the efficient and proper expected response to our exposed terrors is clear and unmistaken. However, our path to success is many other times hampered by the subconscious and unveiled fears that attack positive results without us even realizing it or spotting how these fears may eventually look like. Those fears that when uncovered find us muttering astonished 'I can't believe this has been impacting on my accomplishments!' Do you know what we are talking about? Well.
Have you ever been afraid of saying or showing how you really are? What would you like to do? What and why are your priorities in life? What do you care the most about? What are your values and your dreams? Yes. More or less, it is quite easy and comfy to hide our true selves fleeing from the fear of other people non-approval. And yes. This is a sometimes unclear but absolutely devasting obstacle towards achievement. Because if you can't be honest about the fact that you don't like animals, you prefer to backpack, you have children that make your life messy but enlightened, or you have a life-long health problem, how could you eventually be honest as to pursue the life that you actually want to live? How are you going to be able to keep all those desired things or situations that you have conquered?
Think about it. We many times try to make it look like we are preserving our private sphere, but very much in the deep, we are just afraid of being judged or pointed out. Right? So how to move forward? Well, only by understanding the reasons for our fears and speaking them out we will start setting the grounds for going successfully through it. When coming to the dismay of men or the fear of what other people will say, there are three main reasons that we need to start digging in with.
1. We are not convinced of our values and beliefs
Values in a narrow sense is that which is good, desirable, or worthwhile. As such, values are universal and transcend contexts because they are based on the common good and the common reason. Values are the motive behind purposeful action and the end to which we act. Beliefs otherwise are assumptions we hold to be true. When we use our beliefs to make decisions, we are assuming the causal relationships of the past, which led to the belief, will also apply in the future. Beliefs are contextual. They arise from learned experiences, resulting from the cultural and environmental situations we have faced.
It is quite often that we take contextual beliefs and assume them as universal values. This usually happens when we do not give second thoughts to the world the way is presented to us preassuming as truthful what we have been taught without questioning. We often behave based on beliefs that we have not made ours, that we haven't processed, understood and chosen as those beliefs we want our lives to be informed by. Consequently, we sometimes find ourselves doubting about the way forward, our motivations and aspirations.
Have you ever invested time in defining your beliefs? Do you have values that you have interiorized as yours? Until we are not proactively convinced about the values and beliefs that inspired our lives, we will clearly feel unsecured easily prone to be just what others expect us to be.
2. We are afraid of being different and non- accepted
To really power up your success, you can not lose energy fighting the person you really are. Get to know and accept yourself. Identify which way fits you better and accept yourself accordingly. Love yourself. There is no one way better than others. There is just one successful way for each person. Stop hiding behind your conform zone and fostering what you think others need you to be. If you don't find comfortable with the person, you are you will find yourself investing all your energy on doing things that you don't want to do, saying things you don't want to say and pursuing dreams that are not your dreams. Just by feeling confident and internally empowered about the person we are and what matters to us in life, we will be able to live in a way that makes us happy.
3. We crave for the wrong things
Since we wake up till we close our eyes again, we are bombarded with information. We have the whole world on our feet in just one click. Is through this constant and uncountable information that we can easily experience someone's breakfast in Bali while drinking our morning coffee. That we can taste people beautiful houses, cars, trips around the worlds, families, and experiences...All! As consumers, we are also constantly manipulated to purchase, believe, desire and crave. No wonder it can be tough to find what we really want in life, who we really are and what is really making us happy. Success is the result of both a clear destination and a well-working compass. Defined with precision and pursue with unmistaken determination

Box Office: 'Hellboy' Plunges 68% As 'Dumbo' Tops $300 Million,www.forbes.com,"Scott Mendelson, Contributor",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/04/21/box-office-shazam-captain-marvel-hellboy-dumbo-after-us-pet-semetary-little-missing-link/,"In holdover news that isn’t Shazam! ($17 million weekend/$121 million 17-day total) and Captain Marvel ($9 million weekend/$400 million domestic total), Universal/Comcast’s Little earned $8.451 million (-45%) in its second weekend. That gives the Will Packer-produced comedy a $29.38 million ten-day total. Barring a fluke, Tina Gordon’s Marsai Martin/Regina Hall/Issa Rae comedy will earn around $47 million by the time it leaves theaters or about 2.35x its $20 million budget. Unless it does absolutely nothing overseas, it should be in break-even territory by the time it arrives in post-theatrical. Walt Disney’s Dumbo earned $7.05 million (-25%) in its fourth weekend for a $101.5 million 24-day domestic cume. This one is still a big miss (even as it tops $300 million global) thanks to a $170 million budget, and now there’s more pressure on Aladdin than there otherwise would have been even as Avengers: Endgame prepares to crush all comers. Paramount/Viacom’s Pet Semetary earned $4.65 million (-50%) in its third weekend for a $49.583 million domestic and $95 million global cume. It’s doing fine, as it’s a $21 million-budgeted, R-rated horror flick about dead kids and dead animals, but it’s certainly no breakout smash.
Jordan Peele’s Us is absolutely a breakout smash, even if it may not catch up to A Quiet Place ’s $189 million domestic finish (#CanThisFranchiseBeSaved?). The $20 million, R-rated original earned $4.264 million (-37%) in its fifth weekend for a $170.445 million domestic cume. It should be past the $176 million cume of Get Out within the next two weeks and has earned $245 million worldwide. Barring a miracle elsewhere, it will probably be the year’s biggest wholly original live-action flick (from Hollywood, natch). That will make said distinction a horror movie for the third year in a row.
Laika’s Missing Link earned $4.37 million (-26%) this weekend for a $12.976 million ten-day total. This is still a massive disappointment for the Annapurna/UA release and for the Laika brand in general. Let’s hope Travis Knight funnels his Six Billion Dollar Man paycheck into the next Laika flick. Millennium and Lionsgate’s Hellboy reboot earned a miserable $3.88 million (-67.8%) second weekend and $19.676 million ten-day total. If that holds, it’ll be the tenth-biggest second-weekend drop ever for a “big” comic book superhero flick, behind Man of Steel , Fantastic Four, Wolverine, Elektra, Batman v Superman, Jonah Hex, Hulk, Hellboy II (huh...) and Steel.
After grossed around $2.604 million (-57%) in weekend two to give the YA romantic drama a meh $10.54 million ten-day cume. Doing better in that department is CBS Films and Lionsgate’s Five Feet Apart , which grossed around $758,000 (-51%) in its sixth weekend for a $45.21 million domestic cume. Unplanned will have $17.3 million after 24 days while The Best of Enemies will have just $9.545 million after its third weekend. It’s no Green Book , which will now sit with $85 million domestic after 23 weekends in theaters. How to Train Your Dragon 3 will have $159 million domestic and $514 million worldwide by tonight."

"The Permian-Driven Shale Boom Slowing, And That's OK",www.forbes.com,David Blackmon,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2019/04/21/the-permian-driven-shale-boom-slowing-and-thats-ok/,"Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard told analysts and investors last week that his company is seeing a slowing-down of activity in the U.S. shale plays over the first four months of 2019. “North America land activity is set for lower investments with a likely downward adjustment to the current production growth outlook,” Kibsgaard said, “the higher cost of capital, lower borrowing capacity and investors looking for increased returns suggest that future E&P investments will likely be at levels dictated by free cash flow. We, therefore, see land E&P investment in North America down 10% in 2019. ” Kibsgaard's comments follow five months of a steadily-declining U.S. rig count. The DrillingInfo Daily Rig Count sat at 1042 on April 20, 129 below its November 8, 2018 peak of 1171, a decline of 10.7%. Thus, Kibsgaard's comments should come as no surprise.
But here's the other key part of what he had to say:
...we continue to expect oil market sentiments to steadily improve over the course of 2019. Our view is backed by a solid demand outlook, the full effects of the OPEC and Russian production cuts, the slowing shale oil production growth in North America and the further weakening of the international production base as the impact of four years of underinvestment becomes increasingly evident.
The recent strength in the price of crude oil, with Brent again breaking through the $70 per barrel level, is supporting this outlook. We also see clear signs that E&P investment sentiments are starting to normalize as the industry heads towards a more sustainable financial stewardship of the global resource base.
In other words, the falling rig count and commensurate slowing of U.S. production growth is now one of several major factors creating momentum for strengthening crude prices, and, equally importantly, the refocusing by E&P companies from debt-driven financing of drilling to paying for it through free cash flow will serve to stabilize the domestic industry's financial position.
That's all very positive news for the U.S. industry, and it really should come as no surprise. The recent U.S. shale boom has been mainly driven by the prolific Permian Basin, which is, in its current shale iteration, a fairly new play area, one that had already gone through a previous boom and bust cycle.
But the Permian's initial boom cycle was cut short starting in late 2014 with the bust in crude prices that was driven by Saudi Arabia's decision to flood the market with oil. The boom started to pick up again in mid-2017, when prices began to firm up again in advance of the initial production limitation agreement between the OPEC countries and non-OPEC nations like Russia and Mexico.
Those two and a half down years had created a lot of pent-up desire within all of the big E&P firms to get out and drill wells as rapidly as possible once prices started coming back. That fever to drill encouraged companies to take on new debt to fund new projects as they all tried to keep up with the competition. That fever gave way in mid-2018 to demands from investors and analysts that these companies refocus their strategies on increasing returns to investors.
So, basically, the Permian has now gone through not one, but two ""exploration"" phases that are common to any new oil and gas boom region: The first from 2010 through 2014, and now a second from mid-2017 through 2018. This ""exploration"" phase involves competition to acquire leases and production, test-drilling to delineate the extent of the play area, and the drilling of initial leasehold obligations, all of which the Permian has now gone through. This phase pretty much always involves the taking on of debt as companies compete to gain a major foothold in a booming play area.
The next phase of the boom is ""exploitation."" The extent of the resource is now pretty much known, companies have established their positions in the play area, they have drilled their initial leasehold obligations: Now, the initial frenzy of the boom turns into a more efficient and organized effort to exploit the known resources for maximum financial impact.
So what we are seeing here - and what Mr. Kibsgaard described in his investor call - is nothing unusual. It is in fact the natural progression of any oil and gas boom. The only truly unusual thing here is that this is actually the second time we've seen this progression take place in the world's busiest play area in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico.
So, this ""slowdown"" we are seeing is actually a sign of a healthy industry doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing. That's not the best news from Schlumberger's perspective, but it is good news indeed for the upstream segment of the domestic industry."

Six of Scandinavia's Weirdest Foods,www.forbes.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidnikel/2019/03/20/six-of-scandinavias-weirdest-foods/,"Close up of herring fillet, out of a surstromming can Getty New Nordic cuisine has taken the world by storm, but set foot into a real Scandinavian home and you might be surprised at what’s served up. Traditional Scandinavian food harks back to the days before refrigeration when drastic measures were required to keep feeding people through the long winters in agricultural communities.
Surströmming
Herring is a food that splits opinion at the best of times, but the Swedes take things a step further with this canned variety of lightly salted, fermented herring. Known universally as the ‘world’s smelliest food’, there’s no doubt when someone in the same building as you has opened a can. As such, it is usually opened and eaten outside, often accompanied by a party atmosphere.
The fermenting process causes the can to bulge over time, so stand well back when opening. If you survive the opening ceremony, surströmming is often eaten as a sandwich or wrap along with waxy potatoes, red onion and dill.
Smalahove
Against all odds, this peculiar classic of the Norwegian fjord region has enjoyed something of a comeback in recent years. Entrepreneurs in and around Voss promote the salted, smoked sheep’s head dish to international visitors. Unlike many of the world’s strange foods there’s no doubting what you’ve got to look forward to as it’s literally half a sheep’s head on a plate. The boiled potatoes and rutabaga to the side are your only confirmation that yes, this is indeed a meal. The highlights for a local include the tongue and the eyeball.
Lutefisk
Eaten in Norway and Sweden, the gelatinous substance known as lutefisk originally started out its life as cod or another white fish. After being dried and treated with lye, the fish is soaked in cold water for days on end. Although lufefisk can be boiled, the jelly-like consistency means it can easily fall apart, so steaming or baking is preferred. In Norway lutefisk is eaten in the run-up to Christmas and often served with boiled potatoes, mashed peas and fried bacon bits. A white sauce is added in Sweden and parts of Finland. Lutefisk is made from dried ling cod brought in from Norway, at Olsen Fish Co., in Minneapolis. ASSOCIATED PRESS
The dish is also eaten in Scandinavian American communities in the Midwest. Whereas Norwegians tuck into a plate of lutefisk before Christmas, descendants of Norwegian immigrants to the USA enjoy the dish to mark May 17, Norway's national day.
Salty licorice
Common across the Nordic region, these typically black diamond-shaped pastilles can easily be mistaken for a chewy fruit candy by unsuspecting foreigners. It’s the kind of mistake you don’t make twice. Annica Tryberg co-authored a book on the savory treat and told Lost in Stockholm that licorice falls into the Swedish palette: salty and sweet. “Many Swedish dishes like gravad lax and types of sill are salty. Salty licorice brings out comforting, homely flavors that we love”.
Brown cheese
Most weird food is only occasionally seen or eaten on special occasions. Not so with brown cheese, or brunost as it’s known in Norway, which is eaten pretty much every day by locals. What trips up visitors, however, is the name. Many a tourist has tucked in to a slice of bread topped with brunost only to end up thoroughly confused. That’s because despite its name, the main ingredient in brown cheese is whey, a by-product of the cheese-making process. Norwegian brunost on white table. Traditional Scandinavian brown cheese. Getty
The most common variety in Norway is Gudbrandsdalsost, which is made from a combination of whey, cow’s milk, goat’s milk, and cream. Although it is named, sold, and consumed in the same way as cheese, it tastes very different. Its tangy sweet flavor is more reminiscent of caramel than cheese.
Fish paste in tubes
Supermarkets throughout Scandinavia have sections dedicated to food in tubes. All the products are designed to be used as spreads, most commonly on crisp breads, but their contents can vary wildly. I’ve seen cheese products, mayonnaise, mustards, and vegetarian pastes, but perhaps the weirdest of them all in known as ‘kaviar’, under no circumstances to be confused with fine Russian caviar.
The best-known in Sweden is Kalles Kaviar, a slightly sweetened mix of creamed cod roe and potato flakes, often eaten alongside hard boiled eggs. It’s such a Swedish classic that you’ll probably find the bright blue and yellow tube in the food section of your local IKEA store.

Alfa Romeo And The Stelvio; A Long Way To Go To Fulfil Ambitions,www.forbes.com,Neil Winton,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2019/04/21/alfa-romeo-and-the-stelvio-a-long-way-to-go-to-fulfil-ambitions/,"The Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV was supposed to accelerate the storied Italian sports-car maker’s long-term revival plan globally and in the U.S. but so far higher gear has yet to be engaged. You can’t fault Alfa Romeo for ambition. In 2010 Alfa said it would sell 500,000 cars a year globally by 2014. It sold 68,000. In 2014 it was going to spend $5.8 billion and sell 400,000 cars around the world with 150,000 in the U.S. by 2018. According to carsalesbase.com , Alfa Romeo sold about 83,000 vehicles in Europe last year, and 23,800 in the U.S. with roughly half accounted for by the Giulia sedan and the rest the Stelvio, with a little help from 238 4C supercars.
The Giulia sedan was the lead dog in the campaign but sales haven’t been huge. Globally, after the Stelvio there should be a bigger SUV, a full-sized sedan, a coupe Giulia and a new small Giulietta, but Alfa surprised everybody when it unveiled the Tonale compact SUV at the Geneva auto show in March.

Alfa Romeo returned to the U.S. market in 2014 after pulling out in 1995. Sales started with a trickle but gained a bit of pace in 2017 by doubling. Nevertheless, analysts regard Alfa Romeo as a “challenger” brand.

© 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP “Alfa Romeo is a “challenger” brand in the U.S., meaning that it is not an established brand and must do battle with very time-tested names like BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and Lexus. That’s a real challenge especially as the Alfa Romeo products out now in the U.S. are good but flawed. The others have comparatively few flaws and are a known quantity to American luxury customers,” said Ed Kim, vice-president, industry analysis at Auto Pacific in an e-mail exchange.
“How are Alfas flawed? They are very engaging and fun to drive, but they lack the overall finesse of the best luxury vehicles, and the infotainment system, which is very important now that this has become a major differentiator among brands, is quite rudimentary. Other than driving dynamics, Alfa Romeos have little to make them be noticed in the crowd,” Kim said.
IHS Markit analyst Tim Urquhart agrees that Alfa Romeo isn’t getting much action in the U.S.
“That’s a pity because the Giulia and Stelvio SUV are really good cars. It’s very competitive at that end of the market and buyers can be quite conservative. They don’t want to take risks with players that aren’t established.” Urquhart said.
“Where do they go from here. They need a smaller SUV which is coming up (the Tonale). They are lagging behind the competition with electrification and it’s going to be very difficult for them in the medium to long-term,” Urquhart said..
Despite Alfa Romeo’s efforts to re-establish itself, rumors persist that its owner Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) might seek to sell Alfa in a bundle with its upmarket wannabe stable-mate Maserati. There was a persistent long-term report during the reign of Ferdinand Piech at Volkswagen that the German giant would takeover the company, but that long ago died on the vine.

© 2016 Bloomberg Finance LP Auto Pacific’s Kim doesn’t expect FCA to sell Alfa or Maserati soon.
“I cannot see FCA unloading Alfa Romeo anytime soon though. It is FCA’s only attainable and mainstream luxury brand. Maserati is more upscale and more expensive. Besides, so much of FCA’s future product portfolio is dependent on Alfa Romeo-developed hardware, especially the “Giorgio” platform that will soon proliferate throughout the automaker’s brands. But I do believe FCA’s expectations for the brand’s global volumes must be tempered,” Kim said.
“Keep in mind that in 2014, Alfa Romeo hadn’t yet launched in the U.S., and ultimately the brand’s launch was delayed until the 2017 model year. So, it should be expected that their U.S. sales are not living up to FCA’s 2014 forecast for the brand. However, the brand remains a universe away from 150,000 annual sales. The new Tonale will help as it resides in a growing segment, and it will likely be Alfa’s top seller in the U.S. not long after it goes on sale. Still, 150,000 annual units will not be attainable for quite some time,” Kim said.
Alfa Romeo 4C.
Getty The Stelvio, named after a mountain pass in the Italian Alps with an epic 12 mile driving route with more than 75 hairpins, the Alfa Romeo Stelvio looks handsome and serious. I recently drove a 280 hp 4-cylinder 2.0 liter version, and it was fast and responsive. The eight-speed automatic felt very effective and kickdown was pretty much instantaneous. The cockpit was attractive and practical when it wasn’t fiddly. For some reason Alfa Romeo insists on using a little wheel on a stalk to activate the windscreen wipers. I suppose if you owned a Stelvio you’d soon get used to it, but why bother to do something different that doesn’t at least have an advantage.
In the U.S. there is this gasoline version, with prices starting at $40,295 and a more well equipped TI version starting at $44,495. The top of the range is a 505 hp 3-liter V6 starting at $79,995.
Still, latest sales figures from Europe can’t be reassuring for FCA management. In 2018, Alfa Romeo's Western European sales slid 3.9% to 80,017."
This Women-Led Company Gives New Moms the Things They Actually Need,www.forbes.com,Jo Piazza,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jopiazza/2019/04/21/this-woman-led-company-gives-new-moms-the-things-they-actually-need/,"Like many new moms Kiki Burger and Amelia Makin thought they had everything they needed for the arrival of their babies. They'd read all the books, took the classes and outfitted their nurseries. But after their kids were born they realized that no one had told them what they would actually need—a way to heal their bodies after the trauma of giving birth. ""After our babies were born we were frantically texting each other trying to figure out which products to get to help with the immediate pain and care and we both kept saying, 'Why didn’t anyone tell us we would feel like this?' But unlike with everything else for the baby that was usually solved with a single click on Amazon or a stop at a local CVS, we couldn’t find the products in one place, or available without buying in large bulk amount,"" Makin said. ""Given that 4,000 women give birth a day, it seemed crazy to us that these products just weren’t readily available.""
For the past two years the two women have been working to launch another baby, Mor For Moms, a self care kit for new mothers that tries to address all of the issues Burger and Makin discovered right after they gave birth. The package contains maternity pads, mesh underwear, cooling pads, ice packs, cleansing bottle, overnight pads, nipple pads and nipple cream. It may not seem like a sexy gift registry addition, but the Mor for Moms package is an innovative and desperately needed addition to the baby industrial complex. In the moment, it might be nice to open yet another fuzzy blanket or Sophie the giraffe, but a fully stocked cabinet of maternity pads is actually what a new mom wants and needs during the blur of newborn days.
Makin and Burger assembled their early boxes in their living rooms and started sending early versions of the kits to their new mom-friends as gifts.
""All of the new moms kept telling us how helpful the kits were and how they felt less alone as they sat in the bathroom trying to figure things out,"" Makin said. ""Pretty soon, people started requesting to purchase them for their friends. W e also knew we needed to create something that was purpose driven, so we established a partnership with Mary’s Center, a Washington D.C. based community health center so that for every purchase it contributes to matching kits for under-resourced moms . This is often a painful, lonely and confusing time for new moms, with 77% saying pain interfered with their routine actives in the first two months after giving birth. ""
Burger noted that ""millennials are currently the largest growing segment of new moms, spending an average of $10,000 from when they learn they're pregnant until their child is one year old, for a total of $16 billion in annual spending power."" But the women's research found that very little of that money was actually spent by the mother on self-care.
""We think that’s largely because no one has wanted to talk about what really happens to your body after birth!"" Makin said.
""In our culture, this has always been taboo because so much of what we’re exposed when we’re pregnant is either all the cuteness of it all: the soft, fluffy blankets, tiny clothes, pastel colors, squishy faces. Or it jumps right to the bouncing back--the new cute moms we see and strive to be on Instagram. There’s very little realistic portrayal out there of what happens between that in those first few weeks. You see a new mom on Instagram out for a walk, but there’s no mention that the walk was really just one block because they had a big pad in and could barely move or go up the stairs in their house.""
The Mor founders underwent two years of feedback and testing to learn how new moms acquire the often embarrassing things they need in the immediate postpartum period. They found that most of the supplies were gifted by a fellow new mother who gave birth not long before and happened to have leftovers. ""But those were rarely enough for what the women actually needed and then their husbands ended up going to the drug store to try to buy the largest pads they could find,"" Makin explained.
Earlier this year Snap Inc., the parent company of Snap Chat signed Mor for Moms up as a new employee benefit to try to support the new mothers on their teams.
""It's the kind of benefit all companies should offer in addition to maternity leave and benefits,"" Makin said, adding that they hope to expand their offerings in the near future which will allow them to scale and be innovative around their social impact programming. "" Ultimately we want to make Mor for Moms into a full ecosystem for all aspects of postpartum healing and recovery, especially for all the stuff people need, but don’t want to talk about."""

Pascal Siakam Will Help Toronto Survive Potential Loss Of Kawhi Leonard,www.forbes.com,Morten Jensen,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mortenjensen/2019/04/21/pascal-siakam-will-help-toronto-survive-potential-loss-of-kawhi-leonard/,"Pascal Siakam of the Toronto Raptors on March 14. (Photo by Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images) Getty When the trade for Kawhi Leonard was made last year, understandable expectations for immediate Raptors success followed suit. Leonard has been as great as advertised, providing Toronto with powerful two-way production and a go-to guy who, unlike DeMar DeRozan before him, can hit shots from every angle on the court, thus making him a crucial element to end-of-game scenarios. Anything but an Eastern Conference Finals appearance will be a disappointment for GM Masai Ujiri and his team.
However, Uriji made the trade fully knowing Leonard can leave the Raptors in the summer of 2019, now just two months and change away. Leonard is an unrestricted free agent, meaning the Raptors will have no opportunity of matching contract offers from other teams, that automatically dictates Leonard to remain with the Raptors, as would be the case under restricted free agency. Toronto will be able to offer him approximately $190 million over a period of five seasons, whereas Leonard will be maxed out at roughly $140 million over four years signing elsewhere, pending where the cap number hits going into free agency. So there is an advantage to be had for Toronto's front office, assuming Leonard is interested in returning.
Assuming Leonard is interested in going elsewhere, which shouldn't be ruled out, Ujiri and his team understood what that meant prior to trading for him. If Leonard were to leave, that would allow the Raptors to go into a rebuilding process, should they decided to do so, that would help set the team up for the future, by moving a ton of players and bottoming out for the purpose of draft picks.
Over the course of this season, however, something happened that will force Toronto to drastically change course of that option, should Leonard walk. Pascal Siakam, Toronto's third-year forward, emerged as one of the most intriguing players in the NBA and is currently spearheading the list of candidates for the Most Improved Player award for this season. Siakam's numbers (16.9 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists), while greatly improved from prior seasons, don't tell the whole story about his impact in Toronto.
The 25-year old is a highly energetic, multi-versatile hybrid player who can function in a wide variety of ways. His defense is undoubtedly a tremendous asset moving forward, being able to guard not just the post, but the perimeter with equal efficiency. Siakam forced opponents to shoot 3.9% worse than their average on three-pointers, and 5.6% worse on two-pointers, while posting a defensive rating of 103.4 and a net rating of 10.7, all elite numbers. He also improved his three-point shooting from 22% on 1.6 attempts last year to 36.9% on 2.7 attempts this year, and finished with a highly effective TS% of 62.8% which made him one of the most efficient forwards in the league.
That type of player doesn't do ""rebuilding processes"". Siakam is simply too good and too influential for the Raptors to find themselves in a position where they're playing for more ping-pong balls with him on the roster. This isn't bad news for Toronto - quite the opposite in fact - as not a single organization actively wants to go through a long process of building their team up from scratch. Siakam's evolution has effectively given the Raptors a tremendous new foundation to build something new on, assuming Leonard leaves in a couple of months. There will still be a need for re-shuffling, sure, and Ujiri may ultimately regret the decision to trade away Jonas Valanciunas, who age-wise (26) fits well with Siakam, but in the grand scheme of things, re-tooling the Raptors shouldn't last more than a year or two, to get them back on track.
Kyle Lowry, Serge Ibaka, and Marc Gasol, 33, 29, and 34 respectively, have just one more year left on their deals, with Gasol even having the opportunity to opt out this summer if he wishes to go elsewhere, which provides Toronto with some advantageous financial flexibility by 2020 at the latest. Should Gasol pick up his option, the trio would collectively earn over $82.1 million next season. Should Siakam improve further, and there's no reason to believe otherwise, the Raptors could find themselves going into 2020 with one of the most versatile stars in today's game (who'll have a cap hold of just $7 million that summer) and armed to the teeth with cap space. There are worse situations to be in.
Now, granted, the ideal scenario for Toronto here is hanging onto Leonard and pairing him with Siakam long-term as one of the league's best two-way forward combos, and then try to land an impactful perimeter player by 2020 when Gasol, Ibaka, and Lowry's deals expire. But should that option be taken off the table via Leonard going elsewhere, the Raptors are by no means stuck, and they have Siakam to thank for that.

Does Facebook Survive Because Of Its Size Or Because We Gave Up On Privacy And Security?,www.forbes.com,"Kalev Leetaru, Contributor",04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/21/does-facebook-survive-because-of-its-size-or-because-we-gave-up-on-privacy-and-security/,"Reflecting on the shear egregiousness of Facebook’s latest security breach , from demanding users hand over their email passwords to silently harvesting their contact lists without their permission to declining to offer a specific date by which it might delete that “unintentionally” collected data, it is worth stepping back to ask whether if this story had been about any other company, would it still be in business? As Facebook has weathered a never-ending deluge of privacy and security-related scandals over the past year, the only constant has been the lack of consequences for the company.
To date it has suffered no massive fines, no major troublesome new legislation and most importantly, no mass defections of its users or advertisers.
In fact, the company actually set new profit and growth records amidst all the scandals.
Would a smaller company have faced greater ramifications for such egregious violations of the safety, security and privacy of its users?
Perhaps the most existential question raised by Facebook’s lack of consequences over the past year is whether it has escaped harm because it is simply so big and intrinsic to modern life that we cannot live without it or whether we as a society have become so numb to privacy violations that we simply no longer care about our digital safety, security or privacy?
Facebook has become such a critical part of modern life that it is almost impossible to imagine a world without it.
Our governments communicate policy proposals and new laws via its pages and use it to listen to their constituents. Elections are increasingly allegedly decided by which candidate has the better social media strategy to leverage its communicative power.
Media outlets rely on Facebook to drive traffic to their sites, while businesses increasingly use it to communicate, turning their once-dynamic websites into static shrines.
Could it be that Facebook is now so powerful that we don’t dare leave?
Like the company we love to hate but cannot live without, Facebook’s abusive relationship with its two billion users grows worse by the day because the company increasingly realizes that its users simply have no choice but to accept whatever harm it wishes to bestow upon them.
Alternatively, could it be that we are simply so numb to privacy and security violations today that we simply no longer care?
What would happen if a small startup of a few hundred thousand users turned out to be demanding users’ email passwords and mass harvesting and sharing their personal data?
Would that startup survive the ensuing scandal or would its users defect in droves to its competitors?
The depressing answer is that in 2019, it is entirely conceivable to picture a startup weathering such a scandal without losing any of its customers.
In fact, the “network effect” means that once a site reaches a certain number of users, it is hard to move on, especially as sites move to address the limitations that allowed predecessors like MySpace to collapse.
Even the discretion-first social network Ashley Madison appears to have fully recovered from its infamous 2015 breach, touting impressive growth in the years since. In fact, the company notes that all of the media coverage of its breach was actually a huge boon to growing its business.
Putting this together, Facebook’s lack of consequences for its breaches leaves us with only two uncomfortable possibilities: either the company has become simply too big to regulate or else the public simply no longer cares about its online security or privacy.
All evidence points to the latter.
In the end, the fact that other social networks that have experienced breaches have also managed to grow considerably in the aftermath points to the same sad conclusion: we really don’t care about our online safety, security or privacy anymore."

5 Huge Mistakes WWE Made In The Superstar Shakeup,www.forbes.com,Blake Oestriecher,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2019/04/21/5-huge-mistakes-wwe-made-in-the-superstar-shakeup/,"WWE didn't play around with this year's Superstar Shakeup, making a number of bold moves, like moving both Roman Reigns and AJ Styles, that should work out wonderfully for the company in the long run. It's hard not to be excited about Reigns, Styles, Finn Balor, The Miz, Bayley and other popular stars switching shows, but at the same time, it's also difficult to be too optimistic about some of the changes WWE made this past week. Right off the bat, it can't be overlooked that Raw viewership was down big yet again for the Superstar Shakeup edition, which isn't exactly an encouraging sign given some of the other moves the red brand made. Reigns is now on SmackDown, and overcoming the loss of ""The Big Dog,"" arguably WWE's biggest full-time star, is one of many challenges Raw will face moving forward.
Likewise, SmackDown will have to rebound from the loss of Styles and The Miz, two cornerstones of the blue brand, and though the additions of Reigns and Balor will certainly help, WWE will also have to move past a number of booking decisions made during the Superstar Shakeup that, at least as of right now, could come back to bite the company.
Here are five big mistakes WWE made during the Superstar Shakeup.
Keeping Raw's Core Of Top Heels Together
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com One of the biggest reasons why Raw has been so boring and monotonous over the past year has been that it has largely revolved around a trio of heels in Baron Corbin, Bobby Lashley and Drew McIntyre, who have been loosely associated with one another for the last six months or so.
On their own, McIntyre and Lashley are fine when booked well, but there is evidence that Corbin, despite being a hated heel, is a turnoff to WWE viewers and a villain with the notorious ""X-Pac"" or ""go-away"" heat rather than the type of heat that makes fans want to tune in on a consistent basis. That's why WWE really dropped the ball by not splitting up this unofficial trio during the Superstar Shakeup and sending at least one of them to SmackDown. Let's be honest: Fans have had to sit through so many different variations of mundane feuds and matches involving these three stars that the sheer thought of them even being on the same brand for another year is an extremely disappointing one.
At best, it means they'll just be on the same show. At worst, it means they will continue their loose association and will be pushed as top stars who consistently rotate in and out of feuds with Braun Strowman and Seth Rollins. That possibility is one that won't sit well with fans and could continue the further descent of the red brand if those fans realize that Raw's top feuds will continue to revolve around those three stars (particularly Lashley and Corbin) for the foreseeable future.
Not Moving Braun Strowman And Other Stale Stars
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com There are a ton of other stale stars who really would have benefited from a move during the Superstar Shakeup, none more so than Braun Strowman. Yet, many of those stars stayed put.
Strowman was booked downright terribly over the past year and should have made the move to SmackDown, but he wasn't the only misused star who remains stuck in midcard purgatory. Over on SmackDown, Rusev and Shinsuke Nakamura, two of the most overlooked and poorly used stars in all of WWE, stayed on SmackDown in a move that virtually ensures they won't be pushed well at any point in the near future. With SmackDown having an influx of big names like Balor, Reigns and Elias, and also adding Lars Sullivan to the mix, it's likely that ""The Bulgarian Brute"" and ""The Artist"" will be pushed even further down the card.
Of course, WWE can't move every star in the Superstar Shakeup, or else it will simply be right back where it started. But while the creative team made some moves that likely won't impact WWE all that much in the long run, such as splitting up Sanity and The Riott Squad, failing to provide stars like Strowman, Rusev and Nakamura with a fresh start on a new brand could have a huge impact on the company in the near future.
Just not a good one.
Putting Elias On SmackDown
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com The good news is that Elias appears to finally be getting an actual feud on SmackDown, which is a rarity for the man formerly known as ""The Drifter."" The bad news, however, is that he was tailor made for Raw.
Elias became one of WWE's most popular and entertaining acts (not to mention WWE's top merchandise mover for a brief stretch) on the red brand because he was given a boatload of TV time on the three-hour show, which really needed to utilize him as a ""time filler"" of sorts who could go out there and entertain the audience for 20 minutes on his own in a way that no one else could. What's unfortunate for Elias is that on SmackDown everything is more concise, straightforward and to the point, and many high-profile stars on the blue brand receive either a limited amount of TV time or don't appear on the show at all.
That problem has plagued a number of different SmackDown stars in the past, including the aforementioned Nakamura, and now, the wildly entertaining Elias could fall victim to being on a two-hour show with a stacked roster and limited TV Time. Elias' entire shtick as a faux musician was consistently one of the highlights of Raw, but there is reason to be concerned about how much exposure he will get on SmackDown, which is disappointing for fans of his.
A Lack Of Top Heels On The Blue Brand
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com The Raw and SmackDown rosters both look strong overall, but if there is one noticeable weakness on the blue brand, it's the lack of top heels.
Daniel Bryan is currently dealing with a significant injury while Samoa Joe will apparently be headed to Raw . That leaves SmackDown pretty thin on the dark side, with Elias (who's never had a memorable feud), Buddy Murphy (who just came up from 205 Live and may not be pushed as well as he should be), Lars Sullivan (who is completely unproven at this point), Randy Orton (who is essentially now the show's No. 1 heel) as well as Rusev and Shinsuke Nakamura, two stars who are currently working as a tag team and ones who WWE has given no indication it has any intentions of pushing anytime soon.
While the seeds have been planted for a Kevin Owens heel turn, there's no guarantee of that, which means that SmackDown could be moving forward with only Bryan, assuming he's healthy, solidified as a main event caliber villain. Otherwise, there will be a lot of trial and error when it comes to pushing new heels, and WWE will have to hope that it hits it big with someone like Murphy or Sullivan, who appears to be the company's next pet project.
Over the past few years, SmackDown has had much better booking than Raw, so there is reason to be optimistic about the blue brand's ability to create WWE's next mega heel. But as of right now, SmackDown is rather weak as far as heels are concerned, which may hurt the new A-show in the ratings department.
Gutting The Raw Women's Division
Credit: WWE.com
Credit: WWE.com The Raw's women's division is suddenly paper thin.
The departure of Ronda Rousey and the uncertain status of Sasha Banks is really just the tip of the iceberg, too. In the Superstar Shakeup, WWE sent a few more pivotal pieces of Raw's women's division to SmackDown, moving Ember Moon, Bayley and Mickie James to the blue brand while also shipping out Liv Morgan, which effectively ended The Riott Squad. SmackDown also added arguably the best female wrestler from NXT in Kairi Sane while Becky Lynch is still listed as a member of the SmackDown roster.
In return, Raw only added Naomi, Lacey Evans and Zelina Vega, who is mostly a manager and rarely wrestles. In essence, Raw traded Bayley, Moon, James, Sane and Morgan for Naomi, Vega and the unproven Evans, which is even more lopsided than it sounds. Given that Nia Jax is currently out of action with a double knee injury as well, it remains a mystery how Raw will possibly be able to put on entertaining feuds in the women's singles division and tag team division over the course of the next 12 months.
And without a viable women's division on Raw, that is just one more reason why fans may not tune into the show on a consistent basis.

Global Warming Is Not Cosmic,www.forbes.com,Brian Brettschneider,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbrettschneider/2019/04/21/global-warming-is-not-cosmic/,"“I heard that sunspots are the main driver of temperature changes.” “What about the Grand Solar Minimum?” “We’re headed for a new ice age based on orbital parameters.” “Cosmic rays are causing the Earth to heat up!” There is no shortage of people in the online community who passionately advocate for cosmic explanations to account for the observed change in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution. Why is this? Is there a kernel of truth to their arguments? Let’s separate fact from fiction.
The Earth is a celestial body whose temperature is a result of remnant heat left over from the planet’s formation, radioactive decay, energy input from the sun, and greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. Over the course of human history, heat released from the interior of the planet and from radioactive decay are essentially unchanged. The remaining heat is therefore a function of solar (and extra-solar) inputs, and greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere.

Wikipedia user: Jessie Eastland
Sunspots: Solar energy waxes and wanes at several time scales due to internal changes in the Sun’s energy output. The most famous is the 11-year sunspot cycle. At the bottom of the cycle (we are currently near the bottom of the cycle), solar energy at the Earth’s surface drops by ~0.1% . One study noted a 0.1°C warming of the oceans for each 1 Wm -2 change in solar energy . The difference between the maximum and minimum of a solar cycle is about 1-2 Wm -2 . This difference is not nothing, but it is far from explaining much of the observed temperature increase in the last century. Over longer time scales, solar output changes at 100+ year intervals. These changes represent important inputs to pre-industrialization climate.
Zoomed-in photograph of sunspots.
Alan Friedman (NASA Goddard) Orbital variations: There is little doubt within the scientific community that orbital variations are the key variable that forced the Earth in and out of ice ages during the last 2 million years. Changes in the Earth’s orbital eccentricity, the tilt angle of the axis, and the orientation of the axis drive significant changes in solar energy received at the Earth’s surface. Milutin Milankovitch discovered this relationship over 100 years ago. The cycles of orbital and axial changes happen on time scales of tens of thousands to over one hundred thousand years – much longer than human, or civilization time scales.
What about cosmic rays? Speculation regarding the effect of cosmic rays on cloud formation received a fair amount of attention a decade ago. Since then, additional studies have poured cold water on the idea.
What about magnetic pole reversals? This is when the north and south magnetic poles flip polarity on time scales of hundreds of thousands of years. Besides there being no theoretical connection to climate, the recurrence interval is far to long to explain any observed variation.
What about supernovae? LOL.
The majority of warming is a result of greenhouse gasses emitted by human activity . Period. There is overwhelming consensus on this point within the scientific community.
There is an appeal to attributing our warming climate to forces complete outside of our control. It a) absolves us of any responsibility for causing the observed warming, and b) provides some sort of assurance that eventually we will fall back to an equilibrium state. For several hundred years, a philosophical debate has raged on whether science and religion are compatible or mutually exclusive – or somewhere in-between. Ironically, those that place global warming attribution outside of the bounds of Earth are using the same arguments that creationists and other religion-based prognosticators use; namely, the causes lie in the heavens and we are at the mercy of forces beyond our control."
Governments Can't Regulate Social Media Because They Are Too Dependent On It,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/21/governments-cant-regulate-social-media-because-they-are-too-dependent-on-it/,"Perhaps the most striking aspect of the strange spectacle that was Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony last year was the degree to which members of the US Congress kept acknowledging Facebook’s immense sway over the democratic process and how important the site was to each of their reelection efforts. Congressperson after congressperson repeated how critical Facebook was to getting themselves elected and maintaining contact with their constituents. This was not a CEO being given a public dressing down. It was almost a fan convention of children eager to tell their hero how much they admire him in the hopes of earning an autograph. Together with Twitter and Instagram, the three sites have become almost indispensable staples of the modern state, used by elected officials all the way up to world leaders to communicate with their domestic citizenry and audiences abroad. Has social become so powerful that governments simply cannot risk regulating it? There is a great irony in governments around the world lambasting social platforms and threatening to regulate them, while simultaneously being utterly dependent on those very platforms to secure their reelections and listen to their citizenry.
Politicians the world over are acutely aware that it would take just a mouse click by a Facebook engineer to hand the next election to their competitor.
This creates a severe conflict of interest in which politicians seek to mollify public outrage over the increasing gulf between platforms’ conduct and societal demands, while at the same time treading carefully so as to not upset what many see as the single most important element of their reelection campaigns.
Social platforms today are increasingly the primary mechanism through which governments communicate with their citizenry. Even at the national level, government agencies have pushed ever-greater amounts of their news releases off of their cumbersome websites and onto their social accounts.
Today it is almost impossible to interact with government agencies without at some point having to visit the walled gardens of Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
Banishment from Twitter in today’s world doesn’t just mean not being able to broadcast one’s thoughts to the world.
It means no longer being granted the right to speak directly to the President of the United States.
It is hard to underestimate the significance of Twitter’s control over the modern democratic process in the United States.
A private company quite literally now determines who has the right to speak directly to the president of an entire country and can revoke that right for any reason.
Even more dangerously, social platforms are increasingly becoming a primary conduit through which citizens communicate with their elected officials. In fact, some members of Congress have even instructed their constituents that the best way to reach them is via the private platforms of social media.
For the governments that would like to regulate social media, this presents a unique conundrum: addressing public concern over the growing disregard of social platforms for societal norms risks killing the Golden Goose that many believe helped get them elected.
For elected officials in competitive districts who won their seats through relatively slim margins, there is even less incentive to risk alienating the behemoth they may view as having given them sufficient edge to win.
Most governments prohibit elected officials from serving on the boards of companies their agencies oversee. A Pentagon official with oversight of weapons purchases, for example, cannot serve on the board of a major weapons manufacturer that sells to the Department of Defense.
Similarly, ethics policies often require a “cool down” period before a former senior official can join the board of a company they formerly regulated.
These rules exist because of a widespread recognition that having a government official regulating a business that benefits them directly would create the perception of a conflict of interest, no matter how carefully they managed that conflict.
When it comes to regulating social media platforms, however, there are no such rules.
Social platforms are viewed as such an intrinsic part of modern life that it is simply viewed as a forgone conclusion that elected officials will have social media accounts critical to their reelections, meaning their future employment and thus monetary income is entirely dependent on maintaining a positive relationship with social media companies.
At the same time, as elected officials, their duty is to regulate those very same companies, potentially harming social platforms in ways that might affect those politicians' ability to help those politicians win reelection.
Putting this all together, we live in a strange world in which the very governments tasked with regulating social media are simultaneously entirely dependent on those very platforms. Elected officials in democratic states are faced with a particularly difficult conflict of interest in needing to potentially harm the very companies they often credit with helping get themselves elected.
In many ways, those officials are confronted with the reality that their continued employment as an elected official is dependent on their social media success, which means any monetary or legal harm they dole out to those companies may impact their own financial success.
In the end, we must ask: are our governments now so dependent on the major social media platforms that it is simply too late for them to faithfully regulate them?"
It's A Family Affair at New York's JW Marriott Essex House,www.forbes.com,Debbi Kickham,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/debbikickham/2019/04/21/its-a-family-affair-at-new-yorks-jw-marriott-essex-house/,"Traveling with mom and grandma, and the kids? It’s the hot new trend. According to many travel experts nowadays, people want to share experiences with their families, especially on special occasions such as birthdays, graduations and anniversaries. Forget gifts. Book a week – or just a weekend -- of fun – at a fabulous destination, and make sure to stay at a wonderful hotel. That’s really the family gift that keeps on giving.
The warm and inviting JW Marriott Essex House lobby harkens back to the 1930s, when the hotel first opened.
JW Marriott If your goal is New York, I’ve got the place for you and your family – the JW Marriott Essex House . As has been said about the property for years (especially in the TV commercials that aired on Saturday Night Live in the Seventies), it’s a breath of fresh air right next to Central Park.
The hotel has something for everyone. Indeed, I just visited the property with my 101-year-old very-able-bodied, well-manicured Mom, my sister, my niece, and myself. (More on that in a minute.)
That the JW Marriott Essex House is so family-oriented will be underscored this coming May, when the hotel debuts a new Family by JW Package featuring a wealth of goodies for kids. As of this writing, that includes a special (and adorable) Adventures in Architecture Explorers Diary (with the Family by JW mascots, Billy and Allie). In partnership with the Guggenheim Museum, the Explorers Diary encourages young travelers to learn about the world of architecture around them. There’s also a GET UP piece led by Allie to show children how to exercise like Joffrey Ballet dancers.
In addition, the hotel always has family fun up its sleeve – for instance, as part of the Family by JW Package, a custom kiddie tent can be installed in your guest room, to delight the little ones. Bring on the ‘smores! And don’t forget – the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade passes right in front of the JW Marriott Essex House – which, at that time, offers a private viewing area just outside the hotel’s front doors for hotel guests (when you book a table at Southgate restaurant). What child wouldn’t love that?
Making Memories Happen
What also makes the Essex House unique, as General Manager John Rieman told me, is that the hotel as a corporation empowers its employees to make decisions that will impact guests and make memories for them. Nothing could be more true, and I speak from experience. For example, one morning we were warmly greeted in the Executive Lounge, at breakfast, by staffer Julette Johnson, whose bright Jamaican personality shone like sunshine. We had a lovely conversation in which I told her that my adorable and energetic mom is 101-years-young. Before you could say, “Happy Birthday,” she entered the kitchen and exited with three boxes of chocolate for all of us. To say it was special was an understatement. Then one of the charming hotel security guards graciously offered to show Mom all around Manhattan (well, she did have her walker in tow), and for this, Mom was extremely flattered. Then, one night at dinner in Southgate Restaurant at the hotel, as we celebrated Mom’s birthday, our server took it upon herself to gift Mom with a small plush teddy bear wearing a JW Marriott T-shirt. My mother was moved to tears. Is this an example of a hotel getting it right? You bet it is. Said Mom, and I Quote: : “When I turn 102, we’re coming back here to the Essex House and nowhere else.”
The Central Park Suites at the JW Marriott Essex House overlook you-know-what, where you can take a special Explorer walking tour curated by the hotel.
JW Marriott But the hotel offers more than that to keep you entertained. We all had spa treatments in the Primp Spa, although Mom lucked out and had a deluxe manicure in the privacy of her hotel room. We also really appreciated the Executive Lounge, where you could get a terrific morning breakfast, snacks and lunch, and hors d’oeuvres in the evening. The hotel also features a superb gym to help you get the job done right, and also, the ability to work out next door at the New York Athletic Club (as do many teams who come into town for events).
A Walk Down Memory Lane
To make things even more marvelous, the Essex House recently underwent a $38 Million transformation of its 426 guest rooms, 101 suites and corridors, which were dramatically redesigned to offer a new and modern aesthetic. The hotel’s structure and strong lines of its Art Deco heritage have been softened and expressed in a refined way. This is a design that celebrates the many decades of the Essex House, with a subtle nod to the 1930s, when the hotel first opened its doors.
Carpet patterns are geometric; and furniture finishes are simple and clean in dark oak, white lacquer, polished chrome and bronze. The entire feeling of the new rooms is that of a personal pied-a-terre. Comfort accents include bedside acrylic lamps with a pop of glamour, along with embroidered pillows that also capture the Art Deco motif. Plus all of the bathrooms have been freshly updated with glossy black vanities and fittings.
“For more than 80 years, guests have enjoyed the hotel’s unique and beautiful architecture, warm luxury and personal service,” Mr. Rieman told me. “Our newly designed guest rooms and suites reflect our long history on Central Park South, with a transformation to a fresh modern style.”
Let’s not forget – the hotel sits prominently on one of the world’s most famous streets, with incomparable views of Central Park’s lush greenery, lakes and historic stone bridges. Several suites – such as Suite 2411, the best room in the house – boast private outdoor furnished terraces, where the view is even more dramatic. “Our location is magical,” Mr. Rieman added, “And Central Park is our backyard.” (Indeed, all guests can take advantage of a special walking tour in Central Park curated by the hotel.
The landmark Essex House sign in New York, will always lead you back to the hotel.
JW Marriott Many people choose to actually live at the hotel. “We have some 180 residents,” said Mr. Rieman. “David Bowie also kept a condo here.”
And let’s not also forget – the hotel is a five-minute walk to Bergdorf Goodman, when you feel like seeking out some of the best luxuries life can offer.
Live It Up Like A Local
The hotel’s Southgate is a happening place, a bustling restaurant with great food that we truly appreciated. Just the salmon on the lunch menu was exquisite, with a tasty salsa verde sauce that totally pleased our palates. There’s also a beautiful bar (and an entire wall outfitted with wine), where you can delight in craft cocktails on tap. You heard that right – delicious cocktails where you simply pull the tap and out comes a Big Iron, for example, made with Mr. Katz Rock & Rye (made in Brooklyn), with Angostura bitters, and orange. Walk on in, and you just may come upon a celebrity imbibing something enjoyable. Don’t forget – the Essex House is said to have the BEST Manhattan in Manhattan. What makes it so special? The cocktail is made with Woodford Reserve Bourbon and Antica Carpano Sweet vermouth, mixed with a special house blend of bitters and held in charred casks that were treated and swelled with Armagnac. “It’s our Number One selling cocktail,” says Michael Laudenslager, the director of the restaurant.
At the JW Marriott Essex House, you can imbibe on craft cocktails that are actually on tap and aged in Armagnac-soaked barrels. Cheers!
JW Marriott Adds Mr. Rieman: “We offer luxury, but it needs to appeal to all members of the family.” When all is said and done, said Mr. Rieman, with a big smile, “The hotel has a tremendous repeat business.”"
What ESPN Has To Do With Improving Health,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/21/what-espn-has-to-do-with-improving-health/,"Share to twitter Share to linkedin You may know ESPN for SportsCenter. Here the show's anchors Hannah Storm (C) and Jay Crawford (R) interview musician Lenny Kravitz. But ESPN is involved in many other things. (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for ESPN) Getty If you are wondering what ESPN stands for, it's not ""extrasensory perception and noshing."" Literally, ESPN stands for Entertainment and Sports Programming Network. But philosophically, based on their 2018 Corporate Citizenship Report , one of the things that ESPN is standing for is ""Using the power of sports to create social change.""
ESPN has evolved substantially since its founding in 1979 when its early broadcasts featured sportscasters wearing jackets with enormous lapels. Since then many of the lapels have shrunk but ESPN's reach and range of activities have grown. ESPN now includes multiple television channels, a radio network, podcasts, digital content, a magazine, and ESPN+, an on-demand platform.
This puts ESPN in a unique position to help sports create social change. ESPN is involved in a number of such areas, ranging from supporting the V Foundation for Cancer Research to participating in campaigns to reduce food waste to tackling one of the biggest health problems in the U.S. today: declining physical activity, especially among kids.
A major contributor to this last problem has been decreasing sports participation among youth. As detailed by the Aspen Institute’s 2018 State of Play report , there's been a drop in the percentage of youth who play regularly play team sports from 41.5% in 2011 to 37% in 2017. The numbers are even worse for kids from lower-income households: in 2017, only 34% of kids from households with annual incomes of less than $25,000 played a team sport for at least a day. That is just one day in the entire year. These numbers don't bode well for the future as lower physical activity can significantly raise the risk of obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and a number of other health problems. Our computer modeling study published in Health Affairs showed that lack of physical activity among children is a multi-multi-billion dollar problem with costs arising from increased health care needs and lost productivity. As former New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra once said, ""The future ain't what it used to be."" Tom Farrey, Executive Director of Aspen Institute Sports and Society Program and the visionary behind Project Play, was also a longtime, award-winning reporter for ESPN. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images for Laureus) Getty
Finding ways to improve sports participation among youth is well-aligned with ESPN's core business. After all, people are probably more likely watch or watch commentary about a sport that they themselves have played. That's probably why Ga-ga ball (which has nothing to do with Lady Gaga), cheese rolling, and underwater hockey are not getting much airtime. Moreover, ESPN has first-hand knowledge of what is needed to increase sports participation and the many benefits that such participation may have. Kevin Martinez, Vice President, ESPN Corporate Citizenship, said in the 2018 C orporate C itizenship R eport that ""We believe that sports plays an enormous role in helping youth and adults reach their fullest human potential both on and off the field.""
That report laid out four problems that are hindering youth sports participation and the ways that ESPN is trying to tackle these problems: The majority of volunteer coaches go untrained: Coaches can really determine whether a kid continues to participate in a sport. For example, I stopped playing little league baseball when a coach seemed more interested in getting his son to play every key position than teaching me or others how to play the game. As a result, baseball is now one of my worst sports, although I haven't tried cheese rolling. The problem is that many youth coaches aren't qualified or properly trained to assume such important roles that will end up shaping the lives of many children. The Project Play report indicates that only four out of every ten youth coaches surveyed had received any coaching training in 2017. ESPN has been making investments to improve the availability and quality of such training. This has included funding USA Football’s Guide to a Better, Safer Game , distributed to 21,000 youth coaches last year, teaming up with Up2Us Sports in Operation Coach to train returning military veterans to become youth sports coaches, and supporting online training for Special Olympics Unified coaches. Not enough places to play: Many locations don't have enough playing fields, courts, pitches, or other venues to play sports. This is especially true in low income neighborhoods. ESPN has been working with Under Armour and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) to transform vacant spaces into safe sports-playing venues high-poverty neighborhoods. The RePlay program resulted in 12 community organizations getting funding to revitalize potential play spaces. ESPN has also been working through Disney’s Meet Me at the Park program with the National Recreation and Park Association , to help refurbish 27 play spaces at local parks. There is also the Built to Play initiative with love.futbol, A Ganar and Magic Bus that has built seven courts in very low income locations of South and Central America and India over 3 years. Rising costs are pricing kids out: Playing sports isn't free. Heck, even cheese rolling requires purchasing the cheese. But the costs of playing sports have gone up and up over the past couple decades. When you factor in the costs of equipment, training, participation fees, and everything else involved, kids from lower income families (or even middle class families) are at distinct disadvantages. That's why ESPN has been assisting Good Sports to provide over 40,000 pieces of equipment to economically disadvantaged youth and DonorsChoose.org to help provide 138,000 kids with equipment by matching donations on the crowd-funding site. Parents are concerned about safety: All sports have injury risk, some more than others. Plus, whenever you bring people together, there is the risk that some may behave badly, very badly. Unfortunately, bullying, hazing, discrimination, and sexual misconduct are often risks of participating in youth sports. It is sad when such despicable behavior prevents a child from reaping the lifelong benefits of playing sports. Therefore, ESPN has requested that its non-profit partners take training from SafeSport, an organization working to end abuse in sports. ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro said in Impact: the 2018 Corporate Citizenship Report that ""Over the past four years, ESPN has invested its charitable resources to enable 1.4 million children access to youth sports.""

These four problems certainly aren't the only obstacles to improving youth sports participation. But they are definitely four problems worth addressing. ESPN has also joined Project Play 2020 , a consortium that aims to increase youth sports participation nationwide and for which the Global Obesity Prevention Center (GOPC) that I lead is a founding partner.

What ESPN Has To Do With Improving Health,www.forbes.com,Bruce Y. Lee,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/04/21/what-espn-has-to-do-with-improving-health/?ss=healthcare,"If you are wondering what ESPN stands for, it's not ""extrasensory perception and noshing."" Literally, ESPN stands for Entertainment and Sports Programming Network. But philosophically, based on their 2018 Corporate Citizenship Report , one of the things that ESPN is standing for is ""Using the power of sports to create social change."" ESPN has evolved substantially since its founding in 1979 when its early broadcasts featured sportscasters wearing jackets with enormous lapels. Since then many of the lapels have shrunk but ESPN's reach and range of activities have grown. ESPN now includes multiple television channels, a radio network, podcasts, digital content, a magazine, and ESPN+, an on-demand platform.
This puts ESPN in a unique position to help sports create social change. ESPN is involved in a number of such areas, ranging from supporting the V Foundation for Cancer Research to participating in campaigns to reduce food waste to tackling one of the biggest health problems in the U.S. today: declining physical activity, especially among kids.
A major contributor to this last problem has been decreasing sports participation among youth. As detailed by the Aspen Institute’s 2018 State of Play report , there's been a drop in the percentage of youth who play regularly play team sports from 41.5% in 2011 to 37% in 2017. The numbers are even worse for kids from lower-income households: in 2017, only 34% of kids from households with annual incomes of less than $25,000 played a team sport for at least a day. That is just one day in the entire year. These numbers don't bode well for the future as lower physical activity can significantly raise the risk of obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and a number of other health problems. Our computer modeling study published in Health Affairs showed that lack of physical activity among children is a multi-multi-billion dollar problem with costs arising from increased health care needs and lost productivity. As former New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra once said, ""The future ain't what it used to be.""

Getty Finding ways to improve sports participation among youth is well-aligned with ESPN's core business. After all, people are probably more likely watch or watch commentary about a sport that they themselves have played. That's probably why Ga-ga ball (which has nothing to do with Lady Gaga), cheese rolling, and underwater hockey are not getting much airtime.

"Proving It In The Playoffs: Jokic Is A Legit Max Contract Superstar, And The Nuggets Are Not Frauds",www.forbes.com,Joel Rush,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelrush/2019/04/21/proving-it-in-the-playoffs-jokic-is-a-legit-max-contract-superstar-and-the-nuggets-are-not-frauds/,"The Denver Nuggets are “frauds.” Or so many armchair NBA analysts would have you believe in their posts on Twitter and other social media. The team that finished second in the Western Conference is a “fake” two seed, a “phony” 54-win squad of overachievers that is not yet ready for prime time, the story goes. And their leader, first-time All-Star center Nikola Jokic, who Denver extended last summer with a five-year, $148 million maximum contract, is not built for success in the more physical, ball-dominant and defense-oriented postseason.
That the young, inexperienced Nuggets would collapse under the weight and duress of playoff pressure has been a trendy narrative du jour in the days leading up to and into the playoffs, and the tweets calling out Denver have come fast and furious. Among them (with names redacted):
We saw this coming with the Nuggets, right? The fraud stench was all over them.
And:
I’ve been telling you guys all season long that the Nuggets are frauds. They’re going to lose to the 7th seed in the first round.
And:
Flipped on this Nuggets game to watch fraud Jokic get exposed on defense by a gritty Spurs team. Anybody who had him on their MVP ballot needs to realize there’s nothing “fun” about getting torched for 50% of your job as a player.
And the Nuggets-as-fraud take has not been limited to fans. Sean Pendergast of Houston station Sports Radio 610, for instance, following Denver’s March 28 loss to the Rockets quipped that he felt “like the Nuggets are a bit of a phony 50-win team, … not a scary team.”
It’s not that the Nuggets don’t have their flaws, or that those have not been exposed at various points throughout both the regular season and the four playoff games Denver has played so far against the San Antonio Spurs. In a series which is now split two games to two, Spurs coaching mastermind Gregg Popovich has found effective ways to exploit weaknesses such as the Nuggets’ inconsistent shooting by persistently sending double teams at Jokic and daring Denver to make their perimeter shots. And sophomore Spurs guard Derrick White mounted a career-high 36-point scoring outburst in Game Three on Nuggets point guard Jamal Murray’s seeming inability to prevent dribble penetration. White’s dominance in that game, along with the Nuggets losing the series opener in Denver and relinquishing home court advantage to San Antonio, only fueled the fire of alleged fraudulence.
With the majority of their roster in the playoffs for the first time, and forward Paul Millsap as their only player with substantive playoff experience, as the Nuggets go up against a team anchored by three seasoned veterans in LaMarcus Aldridge, DeMar DeRozan and Rudy Gay, and helmed by arguably the greatest coach in NBA history, they have indeed looked at times like exactly what they are: the youngest team in the playoffs this year, and the eighth youngest in NBA postseason history.
But when it has mattered most, in the two pivotal games where losing would have spelled almost certain disaster, Denver has looked like the scrappy, tough-minded team with no quit in their hearts, whose resiliency has defined their season, and carried them to get back up and exceed expectations after every punch they’ve taken. When starters Millsap, Will Barton and Gary Harris all missed extended time due to injury, the Nuggets found ways to win. Finding ways to win when they need it most is what lifted Denver to the West’s second seed, and it’s how they recaptured home court advantage with a rousing Game Four win that strongly tilts the odds of advancing to the second round – as a second seed should – in their favor.
Various players have stepped up at different moments to help propel the Nuggets to their two wins. Harris and Millsap have provided a solid foundation of reliable and efficient play. Murray essentially won Game Two for Denver with his 21-point fourth quarter scoring explosion. Torrey Craig was a major contributor in his first start, draining five of seven three-pointers in addition to excellent defensive and hustle play. And Malik Beasley and Monte Morris have made valuable contributions off the bench. They may not have been able to execute at their peak level of performance to the degree which they had hoped, but the talent is legitimately present on the current Nuggets roster to at least reach the Western Conference Finals if they play at or near their ceiling.
Throughout it everything Denver does, their big, unconventional Serbian center is their foundational rock and their touchstone. Jokic is among the best players of this postseason, leading the NBA in win shares and value over replacement player (VORP), is top-four in rebounds and assists per game, and is less than one assist shy of a 20-point triple-double with an average of 20.5 points, 11.8 boards and 9.3 dimes, per Basketball-Reference.com. In fact, if his stat line holds, Jokic will become only the fourth player in NBA history to average over 20/11/9 in the playoffs, the others being Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson (twice) and Russell Westbrook.
It is worth stopping and considering for a moment. While many fans and pundits – especially those critical of Denver and eager to knock them off their pedestal in hopes of confirming their “fake” takes – may primarily focus on the admittedly real struggles the Nuggets have faced in this series, how many have acknowledged, or are even aware of the fact that Nikola Jokic in on his way to putting in a historically great NBA postseason performance ? And how might that lead to misevaluating the team as a whole?
The aspect of Jokic’s game which was most often called into question was his defense, but there, too, he has risen to the occasion. Aldridge, on 120 total possessions Jokic has guarded him, has shot a 42.4% field goal percentage including 0% on three-pointers (as compared with his 51.9% field goal percentage in the regular season), and has a -4.1 player point differential w/ Jokic, per NBA.com.
Just like his young players, head coach Michael Malone is also showing signs of growing into his own in the playoffs. His biggest chess move of the series so far, the difficult decision to bring regular starter Barton off the bench, replacing him with Craig in the starting lineup, bolstered the Nuggets’ play on both ends of the court. And making the adjustment to have Harris guard White had the desired effect of throwing a wet blanket on San Antonio’s offense.
It is no guarantee that the Nuggets will proceed to the second round. With the home court advantage back in pocket in what now is essentially a best of three series, Denver appears poised to advance, and if they do it should go a long way toward quelling the “pretender” buzz.
But even if they were to fall to the more veteran, more experienced, more battle-tested Spurs, it should not lend credence to the “fraud” narrative. The fact that Denver is ahead of schedule on their development curve, and that the bar for their expectations has been moved upward due to the surprising degree of success they’ve achieved this season does not mean that the progress they have made is not authentic. The Nuggets really are better than most projected them to be by this point. And they also remain really young, with the inconsistencies and nerves and excitement that accompany their first-time playoff experience.
Jokic and the Nuggets have built one of the best seasons in franchise history on repeatedly proving the doubters wrong. Chances are, all the chatter from the fraud squad only fuels and reinforces their resolve to push those externally-imposed limits even further. And the good news for Denver is that, as Jokic blooms toward veritable superstardom and the team as a whole gets more experienced and playoff-tested with each passing game, it is not only their resilient character they have to fall back on, but the fact that they really are, or at least really are in the process of becoming, the real deal."
"'Game of Thrones' Season 8, Episode 2 Has Leaked Online Early Thanks To Amazon Prime",www.forbes.com,Paul Tassi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/04/21/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-2-has-leaked-online-early-thanks-to-amazon-prime/,"Last week, it happened an hour early, this week, it was just over six hours early. The second episode of the final season of Game of Thrones has leaked online in its entirety, not because of crafty pirates (though now there’s plenty of piracy happening after the fact), but thanks to none other than Amazon Prime. For some reason, the episode was greenlit to go live about an hour ago in Germany on Amazon Prime . Though it’s been taken down (feel free to try and see if there's for you), many people were able to watch the entire thing before that, and now as such, the episode has been uploaded to a zillion different torrent sites and spoilers for what happens are already leaking online. I will not be posting any spoilers here because A) I am not a sociopath and B) I do not want to read about them either.
HBO has gone to painful lengths to avoid leaks of plot points, dodging spy drones when filming, only letting the cast read chunks of the script at a time, to eliminating the fairly standard practice of offering screeners to press ahead of time for timely reviews. Even as a member of the press, I don’t mind that they killed that, because all it took was a single person with a screener to go rogue and the episode was pirated endlessly before it aired. This used to happen all the time.
Game of Thrones
HBO But in the no-screener era, there’s a new problem. HBO still has to manage not only cable in thousands of markets, its own global apps, and streaming services like Hulu and Amazon Prime that offer access to HBO content. All it takes is one wrong move and whoops, you have a situation like today's. We have seen this happen a few different times, usually with a different, very random culprit each time. I believe HBO itself in certain markets was even to blame at least once or twice when this happened before.
HBO has to be tearing their hair out that this keeps happening, but this show is so popular and there are so many of these markets to manage, it does almost seem inevitable that something will go wrong. At least we’re not dealing with people flat-out stealing episodes like we saw in a breach a few years ago, but this is not great either.
All fans (real fans, at least) can really do is pretend that these leaks don’t exist. Don’t watch leaked episodes, or if you do watch them, at least don’t talk about them publicly (or privately, your friends and family will kill you) until the actual episode airs. The problem with the internet and social media is that any rando can show up with spoilers to troll and all it takes is one glance to ruin something. Just…don’t be that guy.
See you tonight after we’ve all seen what happens.

Why Young Italians Are Leaving Cities To Start A New Life As Farmers In The Countryside,www.forbes.com,Annalisa Girardi,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annalisagirardi/2019/04/21/why-young-italians-are-leaving-cities-to-start-a-new-life-as-farmers-in-the-countryside/,"Migration is usually going from rural to urban areas, pushing people out of the countryside towards cities where they can find an economic universe which is more dynamic and that can offer better job opportunities. This tendency has shown itself worldwide throughout history. People fled the countryside because of the association of the area with the absence of prospects of receiving an education, unemployment, harsher financial conditions and generally lower quality of life. Cities offered a social and economic environment where it was possible to build a wealthier lifestyle. The counterflow: back to the countryside
However, in the past few years, Italy has witnessed an important counterflow that has brought young, educated and metropolitan folks back to the countryside. Many Italians under 35 years old have decided to return to rural areas to take up both a business and a lifestyle in agriculture-related fields. Soon the Mediterranean country has become the one with the highest number of youths employed in this sector in Europe. According to ISMEA, the National Institute for Agricultural and Food Market Services), the number of young people moving to the countryside and starting a career around farming has been growing incessantly through the last decade.
Data collected from the Ministry of Agriculture show that every year the number of agribusinesses is growing , and many of these enterprises are managed by people under 30 years old. At the same time, younger generations are investing their education in the agriculture sector, choosing a university degree that gives access to the field. This element is fundamental to understand the new face and the different approach to agriculture and the farming business. The protagonists of this phenomenon are young, usually over-qualified, graduates who have been experiencing outside the countryside before establishing in the area. Through their education and lifestyle, they have acquired skills and knowledge which was not usual to possess for farmers only decades ago. They have now brought those competencies and attitude in agriculture, and the sector is benefitting from it.
But what are the reasons that have pushed this generation back to the land?
Of course, this circumstance cannot be explained only through the bucolic desire of young metropolitans to be reconnected to Mother Earth. Italy has been undergoing an economic stagnation for over a decade now, which has resulted in the frustration of the younger generations that cannot find good future prospects for their careers and social well-being. Lethargic productivity and high rates of unemployment forced many to migrate to other countries. At the same time, a growing number of young people decided to move to the countryside where at least they could rely on the stability of the land, that other than being a precious real estate, can also grant its owner subsistence and self-sufficiency.
Moreover, it has always been relatively easy to get a hold of lands in Italy. The government has always given off financial incentives and other kinds of state aid to entrepreneurs in the field. Agriculture has long been one of the most subsidized economic sectors, benefiting from fiscal relief and supporting funds. The most talked about reform that the government included in the 2019 Budget Law was the one granting free land to those families who will have a third child in the next three years. The previous administration also allocated funds to assist young people who wanted to create agribusinesses, a measure that seemed to work since now 1 out of 10 entrepreneurs in Italy is occupied in agriculture.
Slow food: an added market value
The government strategy is not the only thing looking in the sector’s favor. The slow food trend and the consumers’ preference for organic, bio, at zero km and artisanal food, is enhancing the small agribusinesses that the younger generations have engaged into. The field has been granting stability and turnover while the ones requiring higher skills could not do the same, and it is now making a profit out of the renewed attention to the idea of growing, trading and eating food locally. Buying directly from the farmer entails an added value to the product, which is why local markets have become crowded commercial areas that prove the benefits of a truly circular economy."
"Sarah Sanders, Flying Monkeys and Loyalty to Gaslighters",www.forbes.com,Stephanie Sarkis,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniesarkis/2019/04/21/sarah-sanders-and-loyalty-to-gaslighters/,"Gaslighters/narcissists get others to do their dirty work. People that carry messages for gaslighters are referred to as “flying monkeys,” after the characters in the movie version of The Wizard of Oz. In the movie, flying monkeys followed the Wicked Witch’s commands unquestioningly. In the workplace, gaslighting employers will transmit messages through another employee or their support staff. Gaslighters believe firmly in “kill the messenger,” even if it means they do the metaphorical killing. Using flying monkeys is a classic gaslighting strategy. The gaslighter doesn’t care who speaks for him as long as the person gives their undying loyalty. As Michael Cohen learned, undying loyalty to a gaslighter does not mean one receives loyalty in return. Regarding President Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey, Sarah Sanders said during a press briefing, ""I've heard from countless members of the FBI that are grateful and thankful for the president's decision."" When a reporter asked Sanders , ""You personally have talked to countless FBI officials, employees, since this happened. I mean, really?"" Sanders answered, ""Between like email, text messages, absolutely.""
Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report states, ""Sanders acknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything."" In other words, Sanders lied. Sanders is now on a damage control media tour and was interviewed on ""Good Morning America"" by George Stephanopoulos. After airing the clip of Sanders, Stephanopoulos says to Sanders, ""That's a deliberate false statement."" Sanders responded by referring to her previous comments as a ""slip of the tongue."" She then doubles down and continues, ""it's no secret that a number of FBI, both current and former, agreed with the President's decision."" Stephanopoulos asked Sanders , ""Why can't you acknowledge that what you said then is not true?"" Sanders says, in part, ""I'm sorry that I wasn't a robot."" Does Sanders really believe what she says? The answer to that doesn't really matter to those that support Trump, as Sanders is still in the media spouting Trump's lines and rhetoric—and reinforcing her original lies. A gaslighter's flying monkeys will lie with impunity. Eventually, Sanders will likely find out what happens when you defy a gaslighter. You are fired, criticized, and/or attacked. Ask anyone who has crossed Trump or wouldn’t follow his directives. There is a long list of invectives Trump has used against people with whom he was formerly associated . Why will Sanders find this out eventually? Because gaslighters almost always destroy their relationships.
Gaslighter’s supporters can be so blindingly loyal that they forget their original ambitions or sense of morals. Michael Cohen said, ""Time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds rather than to listen to my own inner voice and my moral compass."" In the workplace, a boss will have a “flying monkey” that sends his gaslighting directives out to employees. If anyone dares confront the gaslighter, he will blame his messenger. Common responses are, “Oh, John gets carried away,” or, ""I never told Sally to say that. I would never do that to you."" Both are blatant lies. If you are the flying monkey of a gaslighter, know that the gaslighter has no qualms about throwing you under the bus. It is just a matter of time. Keep that in mind when you are knowingly lying to others and going against your core beliefs, you may be punished in the legal system even more than the gaslighter. The gaslighter will lie and tell you that he never directed you to do anything. If you have identified your core beliefs as those of the gaslighter’s, it is time to do a deep analysis of how you got to this place. Only in confronting it can you be free of it. When you see these types of ""messengers"" of gaslighters in your workplace, keep documentation of date, time, and use direct Quote: s. Do not save this information on an employer-owned device. When you see flying monkeys in society, call it out for what it is - blatant lying. More media outlets now use the word ""lying"" or ""lies"" in their headlines. Call it what it is. Also, when news anchors thank a guest at the end of an interview, the interview stops. A gaslighter's flying monkeys will continue to talk and get the last word in. Cut off the interview. To the messengers of gaslighters—the gaslighter has no qualms about throwing you under the bus. Keep that in mind when you are knowingly lying to people and going against your core beliefs. If you have identified your core beliefs as those of the gaslighter’s, it is time to do a deep analysis of how you got to this place. Only in confronting it can you be free of it."

Consumer Tech I write about lifestyle tech Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin The success of Apple Watch is not just measured in sales of the hardware itself. There's also a roaring “after-market” in accessories, including cases, wireless charging stands and – most of all – replacement Watch bands. Some of Apple's Spring Watch bands. David Phelan
After all, this is a personal device, so you want to personalize it, right? Lots of companies make elegant bands for Apple Watch but Apple itself, arguably, still makes the best ones.
The Spring release of new bands is upon us, announced alongside the new iPad mini and second-generation AirPods , among other products, and these sultry new accessories are now on sale in stores as well as online.
Here’s all you need to know. Three of Apple's Spring Apple Watch Sport Bands. Apple
Spring colors
Papaya and Spearmint are among the newly arrived colors and they look as mouth-watering as they sound. Less appealing-sounding, because it’s just a little confusing, is Hype Grape, though that turns out to look good, too.
My very favorite is Sunset, which is a feisty orange, just the right side of unmissable. It’s a spiffy color with a price to match as it’s only available in the Modern Buckle (40mm, $149) and Leather Loop (44mm, also $149). If you’re looking for a dressy, classy look, it’s the real standout in the current crop, I’d say. The sultry Sunset Leather Loop. David Phelan
If there’s anything wrong with it, it’s the fact that the edges on the Leather Loop are colored in a darker orange which, at a glance looks a little dirty. Oh, and with the Leather Loop, don’t make the mistake I made and attach it to the Watch the wrong way up, which left me complaining that the magnetic closure was too weak to hold it in place.
If I had followed Apple’s unsurprisingly meticulous instructions in the box, I’d have got it right and would have found the strap holds perfectly.
As for other colors, Apple is careful to spread the love between the different styles of band, though not all colors are available in every single variant.
The new bands are available in 40mm and 44mm sizes. These are the same as the two Apple Watch Series 4 sizes, but if you have any previous version of Watch, measuring 38mm and 40mm respectively, then the new straps will still fit. The miracle of precision from the Watch designers means that the 40mm straps fit 38mm Watches and 44mm bands are a perfect fit for 42mm timepieces. The older straps fit the appropriate new Watches, too. The new Spearmint Sport Strap for Apple Watch. David Phelan
Sport Band
The Sport Band, that solid workman of the band range, good for all situations and ideal for sportier activities, comes in three new colors, Spearmint, Papaya and Delft Blue.
Papaya is a gentler version of Sunset but very lip-smacking none the less. Delft Blue is the biggest statement of the three, a powerful and solid shade that means business but still, like you, has depth. The price for the Sport Band is $49 (£49 in the U.K.). Apple Watch with Nike Sport Band in Black/Hyper Grape. Apple
Nike Sport Band
The Sport Band designed for the Nike+ versions of the Watch – though they fit every Watch whether you’re active or not – has three new colors, too. Choose from Spruce Fog and Vintage Lichen, Black and Hyper Grape, and Teal Tint and Tropical Twist. In each instance, the first color is the main part of the strap, the second one is the edges of the sporty perforations.
The Black is the subtlest with its purple-ish Hyper Grape holes, though the Teal Tint is certainly fetching.
Unlike some brands, Apple doesn’t impose a price hike for the Nike model, so these Nike Sport Bands also cost $49 (£49 in the U.K.). Apple Watch with Lilac Sport Loop. David Phelan
Sport Loop
The best band for swimming is the Sport Loop, not only because it’s waterproof, but because it’s reversible: you can turn it inside out so that the Velcro attachment is facing inwards, ensuring it doesn’t catch and come open in a particularly intense butterfly stroke. There are four new shades for Spring: Spearmint, Papaya, Cerulean and Lilac. You can guess at each of these from their names, apart from the Cerulean, perhaps. This is principally blue but has a clever weave which looks different in different lighting conditions. The Lilac Sport Loop changes its visual identity in the light. David Phelan
That’s similar to the Lilac which, depending on how much sunshine is falling on it varies from almost purple to pale mauve. Apple Watch with Lilac Sport Loop in brighter light. David Phelan
Both, not to mention all the variations in, between look good, though I’d say this color has a lighter, gentler feel to it than Cerulean. Prices match the Sport Loop, $49 (£49 in the U.K.). The Nike Sport Loop in Cerulean. David Phelan
Nike Sport Loop
Another chameleon effect is the Hype Grape Nike Sport Loop which gleams purple in some lights, pale blue, almost green in others. The green-blue threads in the Nike Hyoe Grape Sport Loop. David Phelan
Turn the clasp over to see just how azure-green the blue threads are. Nike Sport Loop in Hyper Grape. David Phelan
It’s the best of the five new shades here, which also include Teal Tint, Black, Summit White and Spruce Fog. Actually, Summit White is also pretty snazzy. $49 each (£49 in the U.K.).
Modern Buckle and Leather Loop Oh my, but the Sunset Leather Loop is gorgeous. David Phelan
There are two colors here, Sunset as mentioned above and Lilac in the Modern Buckle (40mm) and Cornflower in Leather Loop (44mm). The speckled finish on the Leather Loop is particularly attractive in both colors, though the smooth Modern Buckle leather also looks classy. The stylish Modern Buckle in Lilac. Apple
Modern Buckle comes in three sizes, Leather Loop in two, so measure your wrist first. The price for each is $149 (£149 in the U.K.). The Indigo/Craie/Orange Hermès Apple Watch band. Apple
Hermès Leather
If you want the most upscale bands of all, then Hermès may have something to tempt you. Be warned, these admittedly gorgeous straps come at a price: $489 (£489 in the U.K.) for the Double Tour, 40mm width and $339 for the Single Tour, which comes in 44mm width.
The new colors are Hermès Bleu Lin/Craie/Bleu du Nord, which is a creamy trio of pastels and Etoupe Swift which is meaty and earthy. Then there’s Rose Sakura/Craie/Argile which includes a pink shade which is possibly the most lickable of all, resembling an irresistible strawberry ice cream.
My favorite though is the Indigo/Craie/Orange band which is elegant and punchy in equal measure. Though by now you’ll have noticed I’m a bit of a sucker for orange. Apple Watch Sport Strap in Spearmint. David Phelan
Do Watch bands have to be released every season? Really, no, but Apple’s skill is pick up on the emotions of the Spring. And here’s my top tip: if you like any of the new colors, don’t hesitate. When the Summer arrives, the Spring bands will be gone. Like Spring, I suppose. "
What Is Now The Prime Method Of TV Delivery And Do Viewers Actually Know Or Care?,www.forbes.com,Anna Tobin,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annatobin/2019/04/21/what-is-now-the-prime-method-of-tv-delivery-and-do-viewers-actually-know-or-care/,"377 views Apr 21, 2019, 04:59pm Satellite, Cable, Terrestrial, OTT, What Is Now The Prime Method Of TV Delivery And Do Viewers Care? Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Media Anna Tobin is a media, technology and lifestyle journalist Tweet This (Photo by Fairfax Media via Getty Images) Getty The method of TV content delivery was once the hot topic of conversation amongst viewers too. TV content has been delivered via many routes over the years - analog terrestrial, satellite and cable, then moving on to digital terrestrial, satellite and cable. Each of these delivery methods competed to be the sole provider of multi-channel TV services into the home and they were bundled up with phone and internet services in a bid to dominate the subscription landscape. Fast forward a couple of decades and TV content arrives into multiple screens in the home and on the move and the viewers neither know nor care how it got there.
Services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube are streamed into homes through what is known as over-the-top (OTT) delivery and they sit on smart TV screens' electronic program guides alongside the traditional linear channels that are still arriving via digital terrestrial, cable or satellite. They are presented in such a way that the viewer is unaware of how they are transmitted. Most consumers no longer rely on a single method of TV delivery. Hybrid TV delivery has become the norm.
This new way of consuming TV has fuelled the growth of streaming services, but the traditional linear broadcasters have felt threatened by it. As part of their fight back, broadcasters across the world have launched their own OTT services and/or made their content available to existing streaming services.
OTT hasn't had the last laugh, however. There is still one area where the traditional broadcasters hold the upper hand: live content. Streaming services are not yet capable of delivering perfect quality live programming to audiences on mass. OTT services do stream live content, but it is often beset by buffering, poor sound and picture quality or a slight delay. And, the technology to deliver perfect live content at scale via OTT is a long way off. So, TV content will continue to be delivered via a mix of routes and the viewers will increasingly subscribe to a combination of these services in order to see what they want when they want it. How that content arrives on the screen will remain of little concern to viewers.

London's Culture Of Beauty Technology Today,www.forbes.com,Julian Vigo,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianvigo/2019/04/21/londons-culture-of-beauty-technology-today/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Social Media I cover the anthropological intersections of tech, politics & culture. Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin 15 December 2017. A lifestyle barber shop in High Holborn, central London, England, United Kingdom. The barber shop provides a traditional, therapy-haircut service, hot towel, steam massage, razor shaves and grooming products. A service for the more noble, lifestyle gentleman. Photo credit: Getty Getty After reading about the roughly two million London ers living in parts of the city that have dangerously high—not to mention illegal—levels of air pollution , I recalled a woman in a London hair salon who turned to me one day and exclaimed, “Getting my hair and nails done is the only way I can cope with the economic and ecological disaster out there.” Since hearing this, I have wondered if cosmetic treatments are how many Londoners react to the toxicity of their environment and the economic downturn. With Brexit weighing upon the nation and the bulk of the country’s economic capital based in London, it is unsurprising that London’s beauty culture is a major center for both economic growth ( £6.2 billion nationally) and body therapy. Of the country’s 35 thousand plus hair salons, over 13.4% of them are in London. This above figure doesn’t even include the country’s 13,107 beauty salons and 1,512 nail bars in addition to the hundreds of cosmetic medical clinics and esthetic dental services. I spoke with Shaz Memon, a dental marketing expert based in London, who elaborates how the marketing of esthetics clinics and the increase of botox training courses is just part of the city’s changing cultural panorama. He states, “It used to be that Londoners defined themselves through their professional and personal lives alone. Today, it is more the case that we also define ourselves through an awareness of health and beauty which is integral to our cultural identity and communities.” Walking around London there is no shortage of nail salons and hairdressers with many specifically tailored to men . Along with the boom of aesthetic dental clinics in London and Weybridge , a suburban town within Greater London, the beauty industry is not showing any signs of the economic slowdown in Britain’s capital. Compared to what other industries have suffered in recent years , it is clear that the pervasive use of esthetic technologies by Londoners is part of a larger story about how the beauty industry is hooking into local cultural dialogues and social networks. While the UK has been in a political stalemate as to its future relationship with the EU, the one sector that has not suffered the economic down-spin in the pre-Brexit era has been the beauty sector where consumer expenditures on in-salon hair services increased by 3% in 2017 to £7.4bn, and consumer expenditure on spa, salon and in-store beauty treatments reached £7.57bn in 2017. Still, it’s well known that in an era of economic uncertainty the beauty business remains as strong as ever, just as it did during the 2009 global financial crisis. Evidence of this is manifest as you walk around various parts of London—from Angel to the City of London and Seven Dials. There is no shortage of spas, hairdressers, and various esthetic treatment spots for the skin, face and teeth. Where bookstores and pubs are failing, these sorts of businesses are popping up as they sell new technology of the body as the end-all to one’s self-perception. What is it that drives an industry whose workforce is 89.3% female and whose client base is overwhelmingly female when logic would suggest that in economically precarious times , these sorts of luxuries would be the first to go? The answer lies in how this industry is changing its relationship to clients and addressing their concerns about the greater world, for starters. Aside from the technology of beauty merging with the culture of self-exploration and the discovery of local and natural brands , many facets of the beauty industry are an in-parallel search for ecological health and emotional well being. Beauty startups are also invested in growing their business much in the way that we nurture a social community. Hence, this industry today often avoids older forms of marketing while relying on personalizing services and events that make their venue a social occasion even for hen (bachelorette) parties. The media also feeds into the various trends that create niche markets, such as vegan hair salons (yup, it’s a thing) and facials that involve—wait for it— slapping, electrocution and a skin IV . It’s almost as if newer gimmicks are created to keep the beauty sector vibrant. But then these technologies are also mirroring much of the navel-gazing that is already in full sight within our cultures. Another factor in how this industry is ingraining itself within social networks is how it relies on social media while changing the ways this industry is communicating with clients. The beauty industry is also moving away from the traditional business to consumer model while slowly shifting to what resembles friendships instead of austere business relationships. One such client Traci, tells me, “I think a lot of businesses want customers to see them as friends because it helps (or because they think it helps) customer loyalty.” This is evident in how businesses in recent years have moved away from traditional advertising instead using social media influencers. Also, there is the familiarity of business owners with their clients through social media and the renaming of certain key roles. For instance, Porters Barbers in Brixton, uses social media in precisely this way, touting how the barber “ becomes a friend .” Londoners will even follow their hairdresser when she moves to a new salon, even if across town as these relationships can be more than simply professional. Ruth recounts having been with the same hairdresser for 30 years, “I follow her everywhere and now have my hair cut in her basement kitchen.” And Nickie explains to me how crucial it is to retain a good hairdresser, “My entire day can depend on whether my hair looks good. (Yes, yes patriarchy I know.) Tracking down a decent colorist is a life's work. Once you find a good one you can never let them go.” Many women add that this kind of relationship is not limited to their hairdressers. Other women make a social occasion of getting a beauty treatment as it allows them to get away from work, a partner and/or children, while focussing upon themselves for x number of minutes. Penelope Cruz once stated that “women in a salon always share their deepest secrets.” It is this factor of the personal where the beauty industry finds its market as women often frequent these services for a combination of reasons with the social factor being key for most. Kate tells me, “I have gone to the same hairdresser for 15 years. I suppose there is something about trust and intimacy.” And Tracy discusses her relationship to her hairdresser, “It can sometimes be easier talking to someone who is potentially someone you're going to see on a regular basis, but who is not part of your social circle. They don't know your friends/family, so if you moan about a friend, it's unlikely to get back to them.” Conversely, some women use this time for a beauty treatment to have a complete “disconnect.” Pam recites, “I get my hair cut in the Latin American market across the road because the people in there speak little English, so I don't have to chat about my holiday plans or my husband. It's very relaxing. The haircut for £15 is just fine. It does involve some interesting mime.” Clearly, no amount of advertising can buy this sort of loyalty. The cultural space of esthetic treatments is where new beauty technologies are creating and expanding their market where real social relationships are the target market strengthened by word of mouth, tweet or text message recommendations. The downside to this industry, however, is that the beauty industry is that new technologies are inordinately targeting women who are still caught within the social discourse of having to improve their bodies in order to remain professionally and personally viable. For women even today, the incentives available to them which are affordable are still necessarily linked to their looks. Emma tells me “I think people reach for a ‘small treat’ during these times as we limp from one inadequate pay check to the next.”

Awash In Praise: Kanye West's Sunday Service at Coachella,www.forbes.com,Chris Lambert,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrislambert/2019/04/21/awash-in-praise-kanye-wests-sunday-service-at-coachella/,"Kanye West and The Samples finally performed their Sunday Service for the public, on one of the grandest non-stages Coachella has ever seen. The artist and his choir performed atop a mini-mountain that had been manufactured over the last week. But if you hadn't seen the before pictures , you'd maybe never guess it wasn't a natural part of the landscape. The green expanse and surrounding hills and trees, combined with the clear sky and full sun, added a sense of the ancient to the event. As well as the performers in robes, clapping, stomping, dancing in circles, singing as one. Though this age-old imagery was mixed with very modern synths and drum kits and guitarists and a brass section, mics, wires, immense speakers, and water bottles galore. One of the seemingly odd aspects of Sunday Service was only apparent to those viewing the livestream. The whole stream was shown through a narrowed frame, as if through a pinhole . Similar to something Porky Pig might jump through to say, ""That's all folks!"" While no reason was given, there was a circular motif to the day. The merch had ""Sunday Service at the mountain"" laid out in a circle on the back of every shirt. And the performers assembled on the mountain were, when shown from he aerial cam , arranged in two rings, a smaller within a larger. If there was a deeper meaning to this, it was never defined. It may just have been a unifying aesthetic, conceived by Kanye and long-time collaborator Vanessa Beecroft .
For most of the two hours, the choir and The World Famous Tony Williams dominated, with Kanye (his hair dyed purple), like a director, observing the show he had put together. The set-list ran about 25 songs and bounced from well-known Kanye tracks to various covers, all focused on one thing: gospel.""Power"" from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was re-made—a track about society crumbling and burgeoning madness become one praising God's capacity. A powerful rendition of ""Satan, We're Gonna Tear Your Kingdom Down"" by Pastor Shirley Caesar preceded Kanye's infamous troll song , ""Lift Yourself,"" that was elevated to legitimate beauty. A moment of levity broke through the solemnity when Kim Kardashian West and North West ran up the hill for North to deliver the iconic, ""Poop-ity scoop."" DMX even delivered a prayer after Chance the Rapper performed his verse from "" Ultralight Beam.""
Kanye's participation built. At first he was manning a keyboard and chopping samples. Eventually he took to the mic and delivered verses from ""All Falls Down"" and ""Jesus Walks."" Mixed into the largeness of the show was the announcement of a ""new joint"" called ""Water."" A song reminiscent of ""Cudi Montage"" from the Kid Cudi collaborative album Kids See Ghosts . The mantra from of ""Lord shine your light on me, save me please,"" has evolved to,
Let your light reflect on me
Take the chlorine, not our conversation
Let your light reflect on me
I promise I'm not hiding anything
It's water
As Sunday Service neared it's climax, Kanye was visibly emotional, crying openly , while Kid Cudi and others around him provided comfort. It made me think of his speech during his 2011 Coachella headlining show.
And I always said when I was working on the last album, I couldn't wait to perform 'Power' at Coachella. So this is the most important show to me since my mom passed. And to be able to close the festival and to see all of you who still love me, after everything I read on TV said the opposite...To have this moment is so unbelievable. There's many times I thought about not being here, and you all make it all worth it.
West was speaking about, of course, the fallout from the Taylor Swift debacle at the VMAs in 2009 and the public banishment that followed. The social rejection, compounded by the death of his mom, made the success of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and the crowd at Coachella 2011 crucial moments of validation. Today wasn't so different. After the intensity of Kanye's 2018, where scrutiny and backlash ebbed and surged from April through October , where Kanye was announced, for the second time in his career, ""cancelled,"" it isn't hard to imagine the relief he might have felt at the thousands who were there to share in the spirit of the day.
On ""Water,"" Kanye sings, ""The storm may come, but we'll,"" and the choir joins him, ""but we'll get through it, because of your love. Either way we crash like water. We are water."" Awash in praise, surrender, and community, Sunday Service at Coachella had the feel of a new chapter for Kanye, clean of sediment, debris, and dregs of the year past.

Why Gasoline Pump Prices Are Spiking,www.forbes.com,Robert Rapier,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2019/04/21/why-gasoline-pump-prices-are-spiking/,"According to data from the Energy Information Administration, during the first week of January this year the average retail price of gasoline was $2.24/gal. By mid-April, the price had risen to $2.83/gal -- an increase of 26%. Although gasoline prices usually rise between January and April -- for reasons I explain below -- this year's rise has been particularly steep. There are three primary factors behind this.
Transition to Summer Gasoline
Every spring, gasoline must transition from winter to summer blends. Winter blends are cheaper to produce. The difference is related to the evaporation rates of the gasoline.
Gasoline vapors contribute to smog, so the EPA seasonally regulates gasoline blends. They do so by placing seasonal limits on the Reid vapor pressure (RVP). The RVP specification is based on a test that measures vapor pressure of the gasoline blend at 100 degrees F.
Vapor pressure is a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid rises. Thus, in summer it is important to keep the RVP of gasoline at a lower level than in winter.
In September, leading up to winter, the RVP specifications can rise as high as 15 pounds per square inch (psi) in some locations. This has a big effect on the cost of producing gasoline. Butane blending is the key.
Butane can be blended into gasoline, but it causes the blend to evaporate at a faster rate in summer. When the RVP limit increases for the winter, it becomes feasible to blend larger volumes of butane. Butane supplies are plentiful, and it generally trades at a significant discount to gasoline. Thus, winter gasoline blends are cheaper, and the ingredients are in greater supply.
This dynamic reverses in the spring when the RVP limit goes back down. By the start of summer driving season the RVP is back to summertime limits. Thus, the butane volumes have to be curtailed. Gasoline becomes more expensive to produce just when demand becomes highest. That almost always leads to rising gasoline prices in the spring.
In addition, this is all taking place during spring maintenance season for the refineries. Every spring, some refineries shut down units to do standard maintenance. This has the effect of reducing nationwide gasoline output for several weeks in the spring.
But this year, there are two other factors putting upward pressure on gasoline prices.
Midwestern Flooding
This year's devastating Midwestern floods have also impacted gasoline prices. One of these recently affected me personally.
A couple of weeks ago, multiple gas stations in Phoenix ran completely out of several grades of gasoline. When I inquired about the reason, I learned that it was because the floods had disrupted ethanol deliveries. Ethanol is mandated in the fuel supply, but it is also used to boost the octane. The higher octane grades were the ones in short supply.
But the temporary ethanol shortage also boosted ethanol prices. The overall impact was far less than the surge in oil prices (see below), but should the floods impact this year's corn supplies, we may not have seen the last of the impact of the floods.
Rising Oil Prices
In addition to the RVP transition, oil prices have risen significantly since the start of the year. In fact, oil prices rose between the beginning of January and mid-April by 37%. That, alone, is more than enough to explain this year's surge in gasoline prices.
Given the combination of factors that have taken place since the beginning of the year, it's actually surprising that gasoline prices have only risen by 26%. With a 37% rise in the price of oil, the transition to summer gasoline, and the floods in the Midwest, we could have easily seen a 50% rise in gasoline prices this year.
But, we are still a month or so away from the traditional annual peak in gasoline prices. We could be in for more sharp increases in the weeks ahead."
"Social Media Roundup: Instagram Hidden Likes Count Test, Facebook AI Assistant Coming, Pinterest IPO",www.forbes.com,Amit Chowdhry,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2019/04/21/social-media-roundup-instagram-hidden-likes-count-test-facebook-ai-assistant-coming-pinterest-ipo/,"Facebook is testing to turn News Feed into Story Feed pic.twitter.com/83H7VWcgmD
— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) April 15, 2019
This user interface is currently being tested in a beta version of Facebook for Android.
Currently, Facebook places Stories posts at the top of the mobile versions of Facebook and Instagram. And tapping on the Stories essentially plays a slideshow created by the user.
“We are not currently testing this publicly,” said a Facebook spokesperson via The Verge .
AI Voice Assistant Being Developed
Facebook has confirmed with The Verge that it is building a digital voice assistant — which would be potentially used for its Portal and Oculus devices following a report about the upcoming product by CNBC . The voice assistant would function similarly to Apple Siri and Google Assistant.
""We are working to develop voice and AI assistant technologies that may work across our family of AR/VR [augmented reality/virtual reality] products including Portal, Oculus and future products,"" said a Facebook spokesperson via The Verge.
Facebook’s director of AR/VR and Facebook Assistant Ira Snyder is reportedly overseeing the development of the digital assistant with a team in Redmond, Washington.
1.5 Million Email Addresses Uploaded Unintentionally Are Now Being Deleted
Facebook’s reputation has taken another hit after it was discovered that the company “unintentionally uploaded” the email contacts of 1.5 million users without their permission after signing up for new accounts since May 2016. The contacts were not shared and it is being deleted.
""We’ve fixed the underlying issue and are notifying people whose contacts were imported. People can also review and manage contacts they share with Facebook in their settings,” said a Facebook spokesperson via NBC following a report by Business Insider .
The reason Facebook implemented this system is that it used to have a step in the account verification where users had the option to confirm their email address and import their email contacts to find out which of their contacts are using Facebook in order to add them as friends. And it was also used for improving ads.
Facebook Watch Design Format Getting Pulled Back
Facebook has decided to pull back the design of Facebook Watch pages so that all of the video pages will be using the standard Facebook Page format. And this essentially makes all video creators equal on Facebook when it comes to the design of Pages.
Facebook Watch video creators were notified about the changes recently. As a result, their pages are going to be reverted back to the original Facebook Page design. Social media industry commentator Matt Navarra originally discovered the changes back in February .
“We can confirm that we’re merging the Show Page template and Video Page template on Facebook; we believe this move will help simplify the publishing process for our partners,” said a Facebook spokesperson via Digiday .
Dark Mode On Messenger
Dark mode on Messenger
Facebook The dark mode feature on Facebook’s Messenger app is now globally rolling out for all users on iOS and Android. The dark mode feature can be turned on from the Settings section of the app. Dark mode switches the chat aesthetic from white to black and provides lower brightness while maintaining contrast. And it cuts down the glare from your device while using it in low light conditions.
Instagram
Hidden Like Counts Test
Instagram is testing a user interface where the number of “Likes” that posts get are hidden. As there have been tests proving that the number of likes people receive could affect mental health, social media companies have been testing interfaces where the number of followers and the number of likes users have are hidden.
The user who posts the image would still be able to see how many likes a post receives, other users would not be able to see the exact count. Jane Manchun Wong also found this unreleased feature in a beta version of Instagram:

“We want your followers to focus on what you share, not how many likes your posts get. During this test, only the person who share a post will see the total number of likes it gets,” says Instagram in a pop-up message about the feature test.
Millions Of Unencrypted Instagram Passwords Were Exposed
This past week, Forbes cybersecurity contributor Davey Winder reported that Instagram has disclosed password insecurity issues. So Winder is recommending users to change their passwords.
What happened? Essentially, Facebook admitted that some user passwords were stored in plain text and this included millions of Instagram users. Facebook had confirmed this information in an updated statement .
""Since this post was published, we discovered additional logs of Instagram passwords being stored in a readable format. We now estimate that this issue impacted millions of Instagram users. We will be notifying these users as we did the others. Our investigation has determined that these stored passwords were not internally abused or improperly accessed),"" wrote Facebook's VP of engineering, security and privacy Pedro Canahuati in the updated statement.
Pinterest
Shares Soar In IPO
Image-based social network Pinterest went public this past week and the price of its shares soared on the first day of trading. The stock priced closed at more than $24 — which was up nearly 30% from the $19 offering price. Through the IPO, Pinterest raised more than $1.4 billion and hit a market valuation of over $15 billion.
In its prospectus, Pinterest points out that it is in the “early stages” of building an advertising strategy that aligns users and brands. What distinguishes Pinterest from other social media platforms is that its users tend to embrace brand advertising rather than actively trying to avoid it. Some of the most popular categories on Pinterest include fashion and home decorations.
However, Pinterest is not yet profitable. Pinterest saw a net loss of $63 million on revenue of $756 million.
Twitter
Creating A Healthier Service
Twitter recently provided an update about how it is reducing abuse, spam and other malicious content. One of the biggest changes that Twitter made is that tweets were only reviewed if abuse was reported in the past and now they are taking a more proactive approach by surfacing abusive content for teams to review. Here are some of the bullet points that Vice President of Twitter Service Donald Hicks and Senior Director of Product Management of Twitter Health David Gasca published about the changes :
38% of abusive content that’s enforced is surfaced proactively to our teams for review instead of relying on reports from people on Twitter.
16% fewer abuse reports after an interaction from an account the reporter doesn’t follow.
100,000 accounts suspended for creating new accounts after a suspension during January-March 2019 –– a 45% increase from the same time last year.
60% faster response to appeals requests with our new in-app appeal process.
3 times more abusive accounts suspended within 24 hours after a report compared to the same time last year.
2.5 times more private information removed with a new, easier reporting process.
Highly Team Hired
Twitter has hired the team behind the content highlight sharing app Highly. According to TechCrunch , this deal was considered an “acqui-hire” — which means that Twitter was interested in on-boarding the staff rather than buying and integrating its products.
Highly’s content sharing tool include a browser plugin and iOS app. The tool allowed users to highlight quotes from articles and quickly share it over email and social media. Highly will shut down the Slack and iOS app on April 26, but it will continue to archive reader highlights. And the browser plugin for Chrome, Safari and Firefox will still be available.
Vimeo
Magisto Acquisition
Vimeo has announced that it has acquired video editing service Magisto. According to several sources, the deal is reportedly valued at about $200 million.
Magisto reportedly has more than 100 million users and utilizes artificial intelligence to make the video editing process faster. Going forward Vimeo, will use Magisto to create new short-form video creation offerings.
“Social media has sparked an insatiable demand for video – audiences today expect high-quality video content from every business, regardless of size or budget. But we’ve found that most small businesses don’t have the tools, resources or expertise to meet this increased demand,” said Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud in a statement. “Magisto’s proprietary technology enables cutting edge mobile apps and AI-powered editing tools which, combined with Vimeo’s scale and unmatched creator community, will empower more people to tell compelling stories through video.”"
AES: A Smart Diversification From Leading Sectors,www.forbes.com,Ken Kam,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/04/21/aes-a-smart-diversification-from-leading-sectors/,"With the market slowing down in April from the torrid pace set in the first quarter, Marketocracy's managers have been discussing how to intelligently reduce risk. To that end, Wayne Himelsein, my top quant manager, recommends AES Corporation , a company that looks ready to make new highs but is outside of the sectors that have performed the best this year. Ken Kam : It’s nice to see you moving the discussion away from technology and consumer discretionary which have performed so well this year. I suspect you’re doing so because you have found a particularly strong stock outside of the sectors that now look overbought?
Wayne Himelsein : I have no doubt that most investors when hearing about a company in a wholly different corner of the market, will straight away appreciate, or at least understand, that the driver for that tangent is diversification.
We all grow up being taught, and believing, that diversification is better. I would like to, at first, agree with that broader statement, and then, just after demonstrating how amenable I am to its value add, spin around and say that diversification is not always the right answer, and sometimes, not at all.
Kam : Diversification is the most common sense understanding of lowering risk, so I am quite curious to hear where you are going to go with this. Please elaborate, and of course, don’t forget to share your pick!
Himelsein : My pick for today is AES Corporation, with the glaringly obvious ticker: AES. I like AES for the usual reasons, including where it has been, where it is, and where it appears to be going. All of which I intend to elaborate on.
But before I get into that, I want to jump back into the “yes” and “no” of diversification. The yes is easy, we all know the list of reasons and assumed benefits. But the “no” is more complex. The downside of diversification is a lowering of the signal quality. Diversifying for the sake of diversifying is, necessarily, moving away from conviction.
Someone might say “I love this stock, and for a ton of reasons” but then shortly after admit “but I have these others for diversification.” That word is used to justify taking money out of the stocks we believe in the most, and putting it in a second or third tier stock -- just in case.
Kam : That’s an incredibly interesting perspective. So by diversifying, one is often accepting lower quality. But isn’t it worth some lower quality to reduce risk, which is the whole point of diversification?
Himelsein : Again, yes and no. It depends if the risk is really reduced. If one “diversifies” a tech name with another tech name, but of lower quality, they are still deeply entrenched in 1) market risk, 2) sector risk, and 3) industry risk.
The distinction of sector and industry, by the way, differentiates between say, broader technology, and actually owning two very similar companies within the wider sector, like buying two chipmakers, AMD and Intel.
If one loved one chipmaker for a variety of good reasons, and just for diversification, bought a second inferior one, they may be literally creating a lower risk-adjusted return for the portfolio. What many do not realize is that a purchase for the sake of diversification is, necessarily, a purchase that is lowering the net quality of your portfolio.
Think of this broad analogy; by definition, not every stock can outperform, and also, the more stocks one owns, the closer they get to being the index; thus, the more stocks, the lower the probability of being able to outperform.
In fact, if one already has above average performers in their portfolio already, when adding lots more stocks, they are actually adding below average performers, as the whole set must, by definition, equal the average.
Kam : That makes perfect sense. So why this time did you move to an energy stock?
Himelsein : Well, that’s an easy answer. The answer is precisely the reason to always diversify, which is when you find a high-quality stock.
In other words, given the benefit of diversification -- the “yes” side of things -- if one already has a portfolio within certain sectors or industries, and then comes across two great new stocks, of similar signal quality, but one is in the same industry or sector as an existing position, and one is from left field, always go left field!
In the land of benefiting from conviction, and avoiding diversification for the sake of diversification, there is nothing better than when the new shining star you happen to identify is far out in industry or sector from anything you have.
That is essentially the best new buy you can make, given that it hits risk and reward from both sides; upping the portfolio reward potential while distinctly lowering the portfolio risk stance.
Kam : That’s a terrific explanation. Diversifying by buying second and third rate stocks doesn't make sense, but when you see strong stocks in different industries, diversification results in a better risk-adjusted return. With that in mind, please tell us the true benefit of AES?
Himelsein : Sure thing. For AES, I will start with where it’s been, and in doing so, use the widest angle lens that I own. In going back over a decade, we see a stock that was in a nice uptrend from 2003-2007, at which point it fell with the rest of the world in 2008, establishing the same bottom, and same rebound point, as most other stocks did in early 2009. But what’s different about AES, is that its vigorous recovery was short-lived, stopping in September 2009.
From September 2009 until the end of 2018, the stock has effectively done nothing. It just moved sideways in giant oscillations to end up, on 12-31-18, at the very same $15 level it stopped at its September 2009 peak, a level it also touched along the way, in June 2014, amidst its giant oscillations.
But then, after sleeping for an entire decade, in late 2018, it stood up, took in a deep breath, and arose from the ashes, outperforming the rest of the market during the Q4 correction, and coming out of it with, pun intended, unparalleled energy. While the market has strived to recover to old highs, AES not only fully recovered its Q4, but also broke out to new highs in January of 2019.
And when I say new highs, I’m referring to the very same $15 level that shared a decade of attempted tries. And as such, from that moment forward, it has just plowed ahead; “I’m free” it is screaming, perhaps, never to look back again. It’s a new stock now, with new energy for the energy sector.
My Take : As impressed as I am with the market's performance in the first quarter, I worry that the market is vulnerable. The technology and consumer discretionary sectors have led the market up so finding strong stocks in other sectors is a good way to reduce exposure to the sectors that might be hit hardest in a downturn.
Wayne's argument in favor or AES is exactly the kind of judgment call that is behind Wayne's excellent long-term track record.
Wayne Himelsein's Logica Focus Fund (LFF) has an 18+ year track record that extends through 2 market crashes, numerous corrections, and sector rotations. Over that period, Wayne's model averaged 12.07% a year which compares well to the S&P 500's 5.93% return for the same period.

BTS Score Their Third No. 1 Album In The U.S. With 'Map Of The Soul: Persona',www.forbes.com,Hugh McIntyre,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/04/21/bts-score-their-third-no-1-album-in-the-u-s-with-map-of-the-soul-persona/,"BTS, easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world, is back at No. 1 in the U.S. after less than a year away with their latest album, proving once again that they can do things no other name in their genre can. The septet’s new release Map of the Soul: Persona debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 230,000 equivalent units shifted. Of that sum, 196,000 are actual sales, while the songs featured on the project were streamed 37.4 million times in the U.S. alone in just the first seven days they were available.
Map of the Soul: Persona is BTS’ third No. 1 album in the United States, following the immediate success of both Love Yourself: Tear and Love Yourself: Answer , which started at the top of the Billboard 200 last year. They scored their first top 10 appearance (and their only title to break into the uppermost region but not make it to the highest position) with 2017’s Love Yourself: Her , which peaked at No. 7.
BTS’ newest release is powered, at least in part, by lead single “Boy With Luv,” which features American pop singer Halsey. The song and its accompanying video were released at the same time as the album, so while it hasn’t charted yet, the catchy cut will likely enjoy an impressive debut on the Hot 100 when that chart refreshes very soon.
BTS made history last year when they became the first K-pop act to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200. They then repeated the feat a few months later with the last title in their Love Yourself series, and now they’ve become the first K-pop act with three chart-toppers. While Korean music is rising quickly in popularity all around the world, it might be a while before any other act in the field can also rise to No. 1 in the U.S., or even enter the top 10 with a collection.

Ventriloquist Terry Fator On Why 'Overnight Success' Is A Myth,www.forbes.com,Darrah Brustein,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrahbrustein/2019/04/21/ventriloquist-terry-fator-on-why-overnight-success-is-a-myth/,"Fator and his castmates. Credit: Terry Fator He’s likely the only ventriloquist whose name you know. Perhaps you saw him win season two of America’s Got Talent, or at a show during his ten years (and still going) as headliner at The Mirage in Las Vegas.
What I find inspiring is the story behind someone’s success: the 30 years of diligent work it took Fator to become the household name we’ll now pay to see.
More importantly, what can we learn from his journey? How do we uncover our own inner talents, as he did, especially if we don’t see them modeled for us or they aren’t considered worthwhile to pursue?
Fator and I sat down to discuss this and more. He shares about the pinnacle moment when he discovered this path, what it took to ‘succeed’, how he used a challenge like ADHD to his advantage, and what we can learn about using comedy to break the ice and build rapport in everyday situations.
Darrah Brustein: When you were a child and got into ventriloquism (which I’d venture to bet wasn’t the ‘coolest’ choice), how did you discover it and what motivated you to keep at it?
Terry Fator: I was ten years old and had a book report due, so I went into the school library and there was a book by the legendary Paul Winchell called Ventriloquism for Fun and Profit. I read it and was hooked. I bought a very inexpensive puppet and began to practice every day for hours. Soon I was performing in front of church groups and at talent shows, and I haven’t stopped since. Plus, as we all know, ventriloquists are considered as hip and cool as rappers, and women flock to men with puppets. Credit: Tom Donoghue Credit: Tom Donoghue
Brustein: So many people mistake someone’s success as being achieved overnight. You honed your craft for nearly 30 years before you got your shot on America’s Got Talent, and with that preparation, you’re now celebrating your 10+ year residency in Vegas. What advice do you have for others who are in a similar situation and might be growing weary?
Fator: Never stop working. Always work. When you stop working the dream dies. And if you love what you’re doing, if you love to perform, it doesn't matter if you’re in front of an elementary school group of 20 kids, or 20 million people on America’s Got Talent.
Brustein: You’ve been called the “only person who does ventriloquism, impressions, and sings, all at the same time”. In a world where we’re often advised to “stick to one thing”, what has your journey been like to carve out your own niche in this way?
Fator: I think the fact I have ADHD helps, but the truth is it wasn’t until I was forty that it all came together. I was on the road, doing 300 dates a year, and was basically broke. I saved up some money and saw Danny Gans. I saw that show and had an epiphany. I knew I could sing…and I did ventriloquism…and I could do impressions. Since none of these things was working great on its own, why not combine them? So I had my Walter T. Airdale puppet do a Garth Brooks singing impression without moving my lips. And it worked!
Brustein: Some might be surprised to know that you’re dubbed the “most successful person to come out of America’s Got Talent”. Why did you decide to audition, and what reflections do you have on it now?
Fator: I decided to audition because I thought if I could get noticed by enough people, I could raise my price at small town and county fairs from $250 a day to $350 a day. But I never imagined that it would lead me to realizing my lifelong dream of becoming a Las Vegas headliner.
Brustein: Comedy can be a great tool to connect. What tips do you have for us non-professionally funny people on how to break the ice?
Fator: Listen and react in real time. Don't go on a date or into a meeting with a prepared joke (unless it’s a speech). Be with whomever you are with, listen to them and comment on where you are or on a common thing in real time as a followup to their last remark. Or, as I sometimes say, the minute there is something stupid in the room you can agree on, comment on it.
Brustein: What do you do to build a sense of rapport with an audience, no matter the size?
Fator: There are three things. The first is always to make them know how important they are to you, that you are onstage for them, not for yourself. The second is to interact with someone in the audience so that all of you are united in having fun, not in a mean way ever. The third way is to let them know how much fun you’re having being with them; if you’re having fun, they’re having fun.
Brustein: You do over 200 celebrity impressions. Have any of them ever reached out, and what’s happened when they have?
Fator: A number of people have reached out, always favorably, but my favorite was after Winston the Impersonating Turtle and I (yes we are a team) did “Crying” on the finale of America’s Got Talent. Roy Orbison’s widow emailed me to say how grateful she was and thrilled to be able, through me, to hear her husband’s voice come alive again.

Why Do We Blame Social Media For Being Addictive Instead Of Ourselves?,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/21/why-do-we-blame-social-media-for-being-addictive-instead-of-ourselves/,"There has been a growing backlash over the last few years against the addictiveness of social media. Commentators and policymakers have lamented the “behavioral engineering” and “psychological manipulation” used by social platforms to maximize the amount of time their users spend within their walled gardens, contributing content and racking up monetizable ad views. Yet, at the end of the day, we make a conscious choice to spend all of that time on social media. Do the social platforms really deserve our criticism or should we look within ourselves? It is certainly true that social media platforms have invested considerable efforts in maximizing the psychological appeal of their products. Design features like individual-level personalization keep us enticed with a never-ending stream of irresistible content, endless scrolling ensures we never have to break our attention, gamification encourages us to contribute our own content and a societal shift towards realtime information produces a constant fear of missing out if we don't stay on top of every social update.
Most importantly, social platforms do not charge a monetary entrance fee, instead collecting their revenue from the silent manipulation and monetization of our behaviors and interests. The lack of pay-per-view fee means there is no financial incentive to minimize the amount of time we spend on social platforms. The societal pressures of appearing engaged and informed do precisely the opposite, pushing us to spend as much time as possible consuming and contributing.
At the same time, behavioral engineering can only explain so much of our social media addiction.
Grocery stores place fast food items at the front of their stores to grab shoppers as they come in, while bombarding them in the checkout line with endless impulse items. Yet, while we may criticize grocery stores for these actions, we don’t label this placement a public health crisis in immediate need of legislation.
Similarly, the rise of almost infinite television selections in the late 1990’s prompted economic and cultural debate regarding oversaturation, but there were few real efforts to reign in the spread of television.
Today, few are endorsing an end to the music and movie streaming services that similarly provide us endless entertainment selections with the same kind of personalized customization and interfaces designed to encourage us to spend as much time as possible consuming their content. We view these services as fantastic advances in reducing the friction of consuming entertainment.
When media outlets began wholeheartedly embracing clickbait headlines, we were disappointed but there were few calls by policymakers for new legislation banning the practice. In fact, it was Facebook that helped discourage the practice by penalizing such articles in users’ news feeds.
Why then do we view social media’s addictiveness as bad?
Why do we attack Facebook in particular for its design decisions that entice us to spend ever more time on the platform?
Most importantly, what is it that we find so addictive about social media?
Is it our ability to follow our favorite celebrities’ every movement? The perennial popularity of celebrity gossip magazines would suggest that alone would hold considerable appeal.
Could it be the connectedness that social makes us feel to our friends and family? The ability that social gives us to follow along with their daily lives and major announcements all in one place?
If social’s addictiveness comes from the connectedness it offers us to friends, family and the objects of our fanhood, then is it really the platforms themselves that are to blame or is the real object of our concern the idea of being more connected? The internet’s breakdown of geographic barriers was long viewed as something positive, but could its darker side be what we truly despise about social media?
If it is connectedness that we view as the root of all internet evil, then blaming platforms is of little use. Even if Facebook, Instagram and Twitter were to change their interfaces or cease to exist, some other platform would merely rise from their interface ashes to feed our addictions.
If it is not content that addicts us to social media, what is it?
Could it truly be that social platform engineers have succeeded implementing in code what centuries of the world’s greatest scholarship has failed to uncover: the great elixir of ultimate attention? Much of the world’s great communications researchers and psychologists were employed during the two world wars in the search for technologies and processes that could grab and hold the attention of the public, yet they instead merely debunked and discredited existing scholarship that claimed the existence of such tools, rather than construct the ultimate attentional weapon.
Could it really be that a few small teams of engineers in Silicon Valley have succeeded where the rest of history has failed?
Or is it that, like all else Silicon Valley, the reality distortion field has led us to ascribe magical superhuman abilities to very unmagical and severely limited tools that accomplish very little?
Is it really the case that Facebook has discovered a secret formula that makes a webpage so irresistible that once accessed it can never be put down? Or does it just tell its investors that to make itself seem worthy of ever-greater valuations?
Could the real answer be that social media companies have succeeded in reversing human evolution, reverting society from responsible adults back to malleable children with absolutely no impulse control, placing the blame squarely at our own feet?
Putting this all together, when it comes to the great question of just how addictive social media really is, the real question we must answer is what about social media makes it so addictive?
If it is the ability to be ever-more connected to our friends, family and our objects of fandom, then we must ask whether the march of telecommunications technology makes this progression inevitable.
If it is the interfaces of our social platforms that have broken the secret psychological code of the human mind, then all is lost as our wartime fears of a century ago will find fulfillment as companies and governments are able to place any thought they wish into our minds.
Or could all this talk of behavioral engineering and magically manipulative user interfaces merely be just another part of the Silicon Valley hype machine? Hyperbole not rooted in the slightest shred of truth?
In the end, the real question is how we’ve allowed society to revert from responsible adults back to mindless children in just two decades.
When we finally have the answer to that question, perhaps we will understand a whole lot more about just what the coming future of the web might look like."
iPhone Molds Reinforce Apple's Shocking New Design,www.forbes.com,Gordon Kelly,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/04/21/apple-iphone-11-xi-release-date-iphone-xs-max-xr-upgrade/,"We may now understand why Apple is making a genuinely shocking design change with the iPhone 11 and photography fans will be happy . But for many users, the result is an aesthetic nightmare and now new leaks reveal Apple’s controversial decision looks set in steel…
iPhone 11 render based on leaked schematics showing the large, bulbous new rear camera
EverythingApplePro Increasingly influential insider site Slashleaks has attained iPhone 11 and 11 Max (aka iPhone XI and XI Max) official molds which it states are for the production of third-party cases. And yes, it’s not good news for purists.

The molds show both new iPhone models have a huge, protruding, camera module for the new triple lens array while the increasingly outdated large front notch is no smaller, despite Face ID 2.0 components widely understood to be launching in the range. With notch-free designs now popular and triple ( and even quadruple ) camera designs more subtly integrated by rivals . This is not a good look for 2019.
Should you remain sceptical and pray for a last minute Apple U-turn? I’d say not. Slashleaks is now co-owned by Steve Hemmerstoffer, aka OnLeaks, who has arguably the most reliable track record of any industry insider. In short: his projects tend to be on the money.

Slashleaks Needless to say, reactions have been understandably hostile ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , etc) and it does seem baffling that a company of Apple’s design prowess cannot come up with something sleeker and more stylish. But Apple hasn’t wavered since this design first leaked in January and, unsurprisingly, Hemmerstoffer was again the source.
My one big hope: Apple is focusing its design inspiration elsewhere because the company appears ready to fold the iPhone in 2020 .

Concept Creator Fusing everything together for the first time is Concept Creator , arguably technology’s finest graphic designer. The result is a device which shows exactly why I have been telling potential Galaxy S10 upgraders to put their money away .
The render highlights multiple elements that have leaked about the Galaxy Note 10, including its quad camera and cutout Infinity-O display , as well as the Note’s characteristic angular design and S Pen. Even Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipset is name-checked inside along with the expected 5G variant at launch .
To finish the design, Concept Creator does take liberties where information is not yet known, such as the position of the cutout (it may be in a corner like the S10 range) and exact curvature of the Edge display. Consequently, he notes “This is based on a combination of leaks and my freedom of designing it”, but this is as close to the vision of the Galaxy Note 10 as we have seen so far.
Moreover, we know of several additional highlights in the Galaxy Note 10 which Concept Creator doesn’t show such as next-gen RAM and much faster storage which doubles performance and reduces battery drain.
If you’re a fan of tech design, Concept Creator is well worth subscribing to and if you want Samsung’s best phone of 2019, the Galaxy Note 10 is well worth waiting for.

Understanding Mueller,www.forbes.com,Steve Denning,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2019/04/21/understanding-mueller/,"It’s long. It’s dense. It’s complex. It’s detailed. It’s full of footnotes. Once you get into it, it’s gripping. But life is short. For most of us, reading the entire Mueller Report is just too much.
Mueller Report(AP Photo/Cliff Owen)
So, let’s dive in at the end, not the beginning. Specifically, on page 248, where the report discusses the role of White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, in the firing of FBI Director, James Comey.
In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the President about his decision to fire Comey and then spoke to reporters in a televised press conference. Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, [a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position.
In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided ""on his own"" to review Comey's performance and that Rosenstein decided ""on his own"" to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter indicated that the ""vast majority"" of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said, ""Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.
Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments. Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from ""countless members of the FBI"" was a ""slip of the tongue ."" She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made “in the heat of the moment” that was ""not founded on anything.""

Thus, Sanders was forced under threat of committing perjury to admit that her statements that were deliberately false. Comments made on consecutive days cannot be a “slip of the tongue” or remarks made in the “heat of the moment.” These were lies, pure and simple. Sanders is thus revealed as someone who says things “not founded on anything.”
Yet far from acknowledging that she had misspoken, the next day, as Jonathan Chait notes, Sanders unsurprisingly doubled down on her lie and defended her lie with another lie.
Appearing on CBS This Morning , Sanders was asked, If the lie was a slip of the tongue, what did she mean to say? Sanders refused to answer, instead dissembling: “Look, I’ve acknowledged that the word ‘countless’ was a slip of the tongue. But it’s no secret that a number of FBI, both current and former, agreed with the president’s decision.”
Then Sanders bizarrely—yet predictably— blamed her lie on another lie about Democrats.
I’m sorry I wasn’t a robot like the Democratic Party that went out for two-and-a-half years and stated time and time again that there was definitely Russian collusion between the president and his campaign, that they had evidence to show it, and that the president and his team deserved to be in jail. That he shouldn’t be in office, when really they were the ones that were creating the greatest scandal in the history of our country.”
An Ecosystem Of Lying And Divisiveness
This incident captures the essence of the Trump presidency. It’s not just a culture of lying. It’s become an ecosystem of lying, in which survival in it depends on an ability and a willingness to go on lying and defend lies with even more lies, while also sincerely believing in the ever-changing lies with brazen audacity.
Sanders personifies this ecosystem in precisely the way that her predecessor, Sean Spicer, didn’t. Spicer lied about such matters as crowd size at the Trump Inauguration, but he couldn’t bring himself to believe in the lies he was telling and his disbelief showed.
The incident also shows how the ecology requires blithe indifference to the collateral institutional damage that may be caused by lying. The announcement from the White House that the FBI was in revolt against Comey, was not only untrue. It risked aggravating any pre-existing tensions within the FBI and bringing the FBI into disrepute with the population at large.
Yet the mendacity and the unconcern for its consequences are combined with arrogant self-pity . Trump and Sanders resent being called to account for their lies. As Attorney General Barr explained in his press conference on April 18 in relation to Trump:
As the Special Counsel’s report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks… this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.""
Trump As A Tragic Figure
Thus, as in Shakespeare’s King Lear , Barr presents Trump as someone who not only appears to regard himself as “ more sinned against than sinning ” but also regards the sins against him as a psychological justification for acting the way he does. Like Lear, Trump may also have within him “undivulged crimes”: the Mueller Report includes twelve ongoing criminal investigations that remain redacted.

Getty “Trump,” says Kathleen Parker in the Washington Pos t, “is a villain but also a tragic figure. For him, there is never enough of anything — riches, possessions, attention, and adulation. … he has invited the wrath of millions, and it can’t be easy to shoulder so much disapproval. … a person without empathy — the ability to feel what others do — walks a lonely path. Driven by a lust for the material, such a person doesn’t know the company of what ancient philosophers called the transcendentals—truth, goodness, and beauty, which correspond sequentially to the mind, the will and the heart.”
Whether or not we feel sympathy for Trump, his personal suffering is bereft of merit as a legal or political defense. It’s as if a robber defends his theft by reference to his being in a bad mood. It is startling to see the apparent unwillingness of both Trump and Sanders to admit that the criticisms they receive have something to do with their own trashing of established values and principles, like honesty and the rule of law, as well as Trump’s own oath of office to uphold the Constitution.
Trump: His Own Worst Enemy
Thus, Trump’s almost 10,000 false or misleading statements since taking office, his scant regard for the rule of law and his systematic attacks on the judiciary and the press (“the enemy of the people”) constitute the “sins” that cause Trump to be “sinned against.”
Trump’s inability to satisfy his own need for admiration and respect leads on to a spirit of vindictiveness toward those like the press who have a constitutional duty to examine his actions dispassionately and to point to flaws as and when they see them. Devoid of any hint of generosity or nobility of soul, or any seeming interest in inspiring and uplifting, Trump flails away at his perceived enemies, threatening retribution for their supposed temerity to raise obvious questions.
In a world in which every problem is someone else’s fault, where there is charity for none and malice for all , Trump unsurprisingly encounters pushback and finds himself covered with rhetorical mud, which makes him seethe with even greater fury . He has thus gone a long way to recreating the world of Senator Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn, rather than the inspired ambiance of the Founding Fathers and those presidents who went before him.
Should we be surprised that Trump’s opponents see him as a quintessential con man, who distracts and entertains his ‘marks’—his political base—and so convinces them that he is on their side and fighting for their interests, like some folk tale hero , who shows that he is ready, at least rhetorically, to stick it to the elite with insults, even as his actions in tax law and health care appear to do the opposite?

Getty Saved From Himself By His Staff
Ironically, given his frequent fulminations against the “deep state”, Trump has, throughout the two-year period of his presidency, been saved from himself time and again by his own staff, who have declined to carry out his orders. Otherwise, he would have been more deeply involved in illegal actions than he already is.
Harry Sandick , a former assistant US attorney in the southern district of New York, said that just because the mutiny of subordinates apparently foiled the president’s efforts to obstruct justice, that does not mean Trump was not guilty of a crime.
With obstruction charges, an attempt is as good as the crime. You don’t have to succeed in obstructing, you just have to try to obstruct, to endeavor to obstruct. And it’s pretty clear from the report that Mueller thinks that Trump did in fact try to obstruct.”
Yet more worrying is the fact that many of the staff who acted as guardrails have gone. Those who are left just let things be. Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has abandoned any attempt to act as a guardrail, and instead declares that he is ""letting Trump be Trump."" These are indications that there is rough weather ahead.
The Subject Of The Mueller Report Isn't Russia
The scope of the Mueller probe Report in its origin was Russia and Russia’s effort to disrupt the U.S. election. Yet the picture that emerges from the Mueller Report reveals a larger subject. The real subject of the report is Trump’s systematic effort to demolish truth and to undermine the rule of law.
Thus it wouldn't have mattered whether the subject of the Mueller probe was immigration, or climate change, or trade negotiations, or NATO, or health care, the report would have been similar in tone and content. The names of the key players and the dates would be different, but the underlying themes would be the same: habitual mendacity and in-your-face aggressiveness, a lack of concern for the rule of law, an assault on institutions, such as the press and the judiciary, and vendettas against enemies. When laws are not respected and metastasizing dishonesty becomes the coin of the realm, then the integrity of the government as a whole is threatened.
The Republican Call To 'Move On'
In this dispiriting context, some Republicans are calling for Democrats to “move on.”
“Special counsel Robert Mueller’s thorough, two-year investigation included more than 500 search warrants, 2,800 subpoenas, 40 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and 500 witnesses,” U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said in a statement. “Since no credible evidence supports charges of collusion or conspiracy with the Kremlin, I am ready to move on from this drawn-out attack on the president.”
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, also of Idaho, is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said , “It’s time for our nation to come together and move forward as one. With the conclusion of this investigation, I hope the Democrats will join us in doing so.”
Yet the threats to America haven’t gone away with the publication of the Mueller Report. Russia continues to try to interfere in America's affairs. Trump continues to make nice with Russia and do things that appear to obstruct justice .
Why It Is Premature To Move On From Russia
In effect, the call to “move on from Russia” is premature. Mueller may have been unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia, but he did unearth considerable evidence of wrongdoing and malpractice by the Trump campaign.
And Russia’s interference was not a one-time interference. Russia is still running interference for Trump , and there is no reason to believe that this will end before the next presidential elections.
Mueller’s failure to prove a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Putin is leading some to draw the wrong conclusion that collusion with Russia is acceptable. Just today, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said on CNN that “There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.""
Rather than “moving on” and accepting Trump collaboration with Russia as acceptable behavior going forward. Congressional action is urgently needed. Thus:
Are sufficient resources and effort being deployed to thwart further intrusions by hostile powers such as Russia and China in future elections? If not, further resources and effort should be deployed. Election regulations need to be strengthened so that Trump’s behavior doesn’t become the norm. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a presidential candidate to publicly request help from a hostile foreign power to hack into an opponent’s emails (as Trump did in 2016), then it should become one. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a presidential campaign to share polling data and discuss election campaign strategy with a hostile foreign power (as the Trump campaign did in 2016), then it should be made clear. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime to hold meetings with representatives of a hostile foreign power and welcome negative or stolen information about other candidates (as the Trump campaign did in 2016), then it should be made clear. Why It Is Premature To Move On From Obstruction
Similarly, with the ecosystem of lying that has been established in the White House and that is now spreading to the Department of Justice and throughout the rest of the US government, legislation is needed:
If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a president to direct staff to commit a crime. it should become so. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a president to get involved in the details of the administration of criminal justice if the matter concerns the president himself, it should be made clear. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a president to attempt to limit the scope of an investigation in the president’s own administration, it should be made clear. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a president to dangle pardons in front of those under investigation or witnesses, in return for loyalty, or as an incentive to commit crimes, it should be made clear. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime to engage in direct or indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony, it should be made clear. If if is not currently clear that it is a crime to coordinate testimony of witnesses in an investigation into the president’s administration, it should be made clear. Many of the concerns related to the Trump presidency concern the possibility of conflicts of interest with Trump’s business dealings. These concerns have been aggravated by the fact Trump is the first president in half a century not to disclose his tax returns.
If it is not currently a legal obligation of the president to reveal recent tax returns, the legal obligation should be created. If it is not currently a crime for the president to fail to disclose financial conflicts of interest, it should become so. If it is not currently clear that it is a crime for a president to conduct vendettas against those civil servants who give evidence against the president, it should be made clear. In years prior to Trump, it was generally acknowledged that these behaviors were wrong, if not illegal. Any remaining ambiguity needs to be removed so that the abuses do not continue.
Why The Mueller Report Is Not A Cop Out
Although there was widespread disappointment among Democrats that Robert Mueller did not deliver Donald Trump’s head on a platter à la John the Baptist, the Mueller Report is not a cop-out.
Mueller was pursuing a subtler and longer-term game plan of strengthening the Constitution, not just criminalizing Trump or eliminating him from office. Mueller adhered to the Department of Justice rules of engagement and declined to recommend criminal prosecution of Trump. Instead, Mueller was more intent on laying the basis for institutional change that will prevent these outrages from occurring again.
Should Trump Be Impeached?
Trump is not a singular aberration. Removing him from the body politic will not make us whole again. As the leading Republican, George Conway, wrote last week in the Washington Post , Trump is “a cancer on the presidency,” which requires not only surgery but also structural and behavioral change to restore the country to normalcy.
“The ultimate issue shouldn’t be — and isn’t — whether the president committed a criminal act…The Constitution commands it.... by taking the presidential oath of office, a president assumes the duty not simply to obey the laws, civil and criminal, that all citizens must obey, but also to be subjected to higher duties — what some excellent recent legal scholarship has termed the “fiduciary obligations of the president.”
Fiduciaries are people who hold legal obligations of trust, like a trustee of a trust. A trustee must act in the beneficiary’s best interests and not his own. If the trustee fails to do that, the trustee can be removed, even if what the trustee has done is not a crime.""
According to Conway, “Congress now bears the solemn constitutional duty to excise that cancer and start healing the body politic without delay.”
Focusing On Practical Remedies That Protect America
There are risks in Congress spending precious time and publicity on protracted legal battles, partisan fights about releasing documents and struggles to lay the basis for an impeachment proceeding. Focusing attention on such obscure matters related to the past risks communicating that Congress itself has become part of the problem.
As a practical matter, even the redacted version of the Mueller Report gives Congress plenty to move ahead with. In particular, the second volume that deals with obstruction has very few redactions. It provides a cornucopia of information on the Trump White House. Instead of focusing public attention on trying to extract getting the last few bits of redacted information, Congress should be using its air time and its energy to focus on mainly on generating remedies to protect against the kind of wrongdoing that the Mueller Report has now meticulously exposed.
Instead of debates about whether to “investigate or impeach”, Congress should be focused on moving forward with legislative actions that will protect America against future wrongdoing.
Drafting remedial legislation is more important than impeachment because an alternative and simpler remedy to impeachment is near at hand: the ballot box in November 2020. Unless a strong bipartisan majority emerges to impeach and convict the president, Congress should focus its attention on ensuring that the remedy of the ballot box is properly exercised.
If Congress is seen to be focused on backward-looking legal battles or partisan fights over legal details, it runs the risk of helping Trump be re-elected.
It is time for Congress to rise above the partisan fray and present itself as part of the solution, not a continuation of political party bickering.

Microsoft's Massive Improvement To Its Windows 10 Surface Hardware,www.forbes.com,Ewan Spence,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/04/21/microsoft-surface-hub-2s-new-release-launch-price-specifications-expensive/,"Microsoft updated its Surface device family this week, with the introduction of the Microsoft Surface Hub 2S . It’s so big it needs wheels, you really don’’t want to ask how much the external battery costs, but it snaps into focus the efforts Microsoft’s hardware team is making with enterprise customers.
Microsoft Surface Hub 2S (image: Microsoft.com)
Microsoft.com In terms of specifications, the Surface Hub 2S has a lot going for it. The 50-inch screen has a resolution of 3840x2560 pixels, it’s slimmer and lighter (by sixty percent and forty percent respectively), and inside is powered by Intel’s eighth generation Core i5 backed up by 8GB of RAM, 128 GB of storage, and the UHD 620 graphics chipset. …and pricing starts at $9,000.
I think it’s safe to presume that many of the features added to the Surface Hub in this iteration will have come from user feedback. It’s notable that the biggest change in the Hub 2S is its portability. Through a partnership with Steelcase a mobile easel is available to wheel the touchable slab around the office, and for even more options you can add a battery pack from APC to keep everything running while you whizz around the office.
You shouldn’t think that the goal here is to sell ridiculous numbers of the Hub 2S - although I doubt Microsoft would turn down sales. As I see it, the goal is to use this as a central (sic) Hub in a business and ensure that Microsoft’s local- and cloud-based software is the connective digital tissue.
The Hub isn’t specifically a stand-alone (or even a wheel-alone) machine. Although it runs Windows 10, it is a customised version of Windows 10 Enterprise called Windows 10 Team . While it can run regular Windows 10 apps (including Microsoft’s extensive range of cloud-based apps including Office, Teams, and One Note), the three key focus points of the Hub family are collaboration, a meetings platform, and a digital whiteboard; all of which will integrate alongside other Windows 10 powered devices.
Microsoft would like your corporate buyer to integrate other Surface products into the mix. If your office has a single Surface Hub, then there will likely be a cascade effect to provide designers with Surface Studios’, and a mix of Surface Book, Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and Surface Go machines throughout the rest of the organisation.
But unlike the on-ramp that the Surface Go offers the shop floor or the Surface Laptop offers in education markets, the Surface Hub 2S offers a top-down path into Microsoft’s world. All the disparate Windows 10 devices may have had connections through Microsoft Teams or collaborative document sharing, but it’s the Hub that can bring them together in an enterprise environment.
The clue really is in the name.

7 Oil & Gas Problems That Mexico Must Solve,www.forbes.com,Jude Clemente,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2019/04/21/7-oil-gas-problems-that-mexico-must-solve/,"1. Since peaking in 2004, Mexico's oil production has been sliced in half to below 2 million b/d Although nearly 45% back then, oil revenues still account for 20-25% of the federal budget. Amid plummeting production, the country has actually been very lucky that domestic demand has remained surprisingly flat, thanks to a successful gas displacing fuel oil program in the power sector. Mexico's proven oil reserves have collapsed from 50 billion barrels 20 years ago to just 7 billion barrels today. Exports to primary customer the U.S. have plummeted 60% since 2006 to 700,000 b/d in 2018, exacerbated by the American oil boom that has soared U.S. production 140% since 2008. 2. With upside domestic demand for gasoline and diesel fuel very strong, new President AMLO (who only gets to serve one six-year term) wants to focus on more refineries, to reverse the highly expensive and non-sensical requirement to export domestic crude to the U.S. for refining and then imported back into Mexico again. These refineries, however, can cost at least $8 billion. Last reported at $107 billion , state-owned Pemex is the most indebted oil and gas company in the world, where profits that should be used for more E&P investment get taken by the government.
3. With half of Mexico poor, leadership must satisfy the largest incremental energy needs of any member of the OECD. To illustrate, per capita, Mexicans consume just a third of the electricity and the oil of their OECD counterparts. This ""absolutely sure to soar"" domestic demand must be affordably met, or leadership confronts de Tocqueville's "" Revolution of Rising Expectations ."" Huge amounts of domestic oil and gas are required because increasingly turning to foreign suppliers is sure to up costs.
4. Mexico does not have the money or the experts needed to exploit its huge deepwater crude reserves (60 billion barrels or more) and the substantial shale oil and gas resources in the northeast of the country (550 Tcf of gas). Although the 2013 Energy Reforms were meant to bring in outside investment, technologies, competition, and expertise, President AMLO's reversion to resource nationalism gives potential partners obvious pause for concern.
For gas and oil, Pemex will surely be favored, while state-owned CFE will be favored for power and gas. Other than that, non-state energy companies and third-party buyers in Mexico have no assurances of what the future will hold. AMLO must understand that he has helped make non-state players more hesitant and afraid of an overbearing federal government that might not even respect already signed contracts. Oil, gas, and power auctions are getting canceled for no explained reason. In short, deregulation efforts to modernize Mexico's energy sector could collapse.
Mexico's ability to export oil has continued to decline and is crushing federal revenues.
Data source: BP;JTC 5. Every year, narco traffickers siphon billions of dollars worth of oil products from Mexico's pipeline system. Drug gangs continue to create massive security problems in the country that are also scaring away companies from working to develop Mexico's shale oil and gas resources. "" How AMLO Is Taking on Mexico’s Billion-Dollar Gasoline Thieves. ""
Corruption within governments, Pemex, and CFE helping the drug trade continues to run rampant stealing the resources that belong to Mexico's 135 million people. Construction plans are way too slow: only 3,000 miles in gas pipelines, for instance, have been built since 2012. Over a third of households suffer "" energy poverty "" from a lack of access.
6. Mexico must also produce increasing amounts of natural gas, as the country continues to shift more to gas for electricity and industrial usage. Mexico currently gets 60% of its power from gas, and 65% of the country's total gas usage is supplied by the U.S. In Mexico, this overreliance on the U.S. is becoming more of a concern since the U.S. seeks to export huge amounts of gas (via LNG) to countries all over the world.
The U.S. currently has a whopping 55 Bcf/d of LNG under consideration (which equates to ~63% of current U.S. gas production) and will double LNG export facilities to six by the end of the summer. For Mexico, associated gas accounts for 75% of domestic supply, so its geology has proven that more crude output is essential to expanding the domestic stockpile of gas. Making all of this worse, Mexico has no national strategy or underground storage for natural gas, quickly becoming its ""go-to"" fuel
7. Mexico's pipeline system is woefully short, and new builds have faced unexpected pushback from environmental and Indigenous peoples rights groups. Slowing delivery and increasing costs, a pipeline dearth forces Mexico to import huge amounts of LNG from the U.S., which is some 50% more expensive than piped imports. This more costly supply is a big problem for a population that simply cannot afford higher cost energy and a country pushing a manufacturing boom based on low cost energy.
And never forget that Mexico's 2013 deregulation was based on extending self-sufficiency, not on increasing reliance on supply from the U.S. Pipeline constraints mean power outages and supply curtailments. CFE is now seeking to renegotiate the take-or-pay clauses of contracts that could mean wasting tens of billions of dollars for gas that is not even being delivered.

Mexico's rising need to import natural gas is the opposite of the self-sufficency goals of Mexico's 2013 Energy Reforms.

Is Walgreens CEO Pessina Opening Up To A Big Merger? | jeunesse founder,www.forbes.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2019/04/04/is-walgreens-ceo-pessina-opening-up-to-a-big-merger/?ss=healthcare/,"(Last Updated On: April 22, 2019) Moira Forbes and Stefano Pessina discuss Walgreens Boots Alliance partnership strategy at Forbes Healthcare Summit 2018
Victoria Engblom photo
After what he called “the most difficult quarter” since Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed, Stefano Pessina may be leaning toward more than just executing partnerships as a way to grow the global drugstore chain and boost its battered stock price.
The Italian billionaire, who is Walgreens CEO and biggest individual shareholder, has long said he prefers partnerships rather than a large transformative acquisition. There’s been speculation dating back two years that Walgreens will buy the rest of giant distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. that it doesn’t own or might acquire a health insurer like Humana, which already has a joint venture with the drugstore giant to develop senior health clinics.
But Walgreens hasn’t made a sizable acquisition since its $4.4 billion purchase of more than 1,900 Rite Aids and Wall Street appears to be getting restless. By comparison, CVS Health spent $70 billion to buy Aetna, the nation’s third-largest health insurer.
After being pressed on Walgreens quarterly earnings call by the noted J.P. Morgan analyst Lisa Gill, Pessina revealed the drugstore chain was reviewing some targets.
“We are constantly reviewing a certain number of companies,” Pessina said on a longer-than-usual 90-minute call Tuesday to discuss earnings. “Don’t ask me the names, I cannot give you the names. But of course, until now, we have not found the right numbers to do a combination with these companies.”
Wall Street is looking for results from Walgreens partnership strategy after the drugstore chain in the last three years has signed deals with Microsoft, the grocer Kroger, Humana and UnitedHealth Group’s urgent care business. For much of the last two years, such deals have been testing concepts and piloting healthcare services and technology to develop what executives have called the “drugstore of the future.”
But the partnerships won’t churn out profits for awhile.
“On the partnership front, for the first time (Walgreens) highlighted the multiple partnerships formed over the past few years probably will not be accretive to earnings until 2022, which is likely later than street expectations,” Mizuho Securities USA analyst Ann Hynes wrote this week.
Meanwhile, Pessina has said repeatedly for the last two years that he’s not going to execute a big merger or acquisition for the sake of doing one even though he said this week “some acquisition could be done mainly financing them through cash.”
“I can just give the same answer that I have given in the past,” Pessina said, responding to JP Morgan’s Gill. “We are open to any kind of partnership which makes sense, which is compatible with what we are doing, provided that the price is correct and provided that the organization of the company that we buy or that we merge is compatible with us because the prices are important. But also if you don’t have a compatible teams at the end, the merger will not work and you will not be able to deliver synergies.”

Raheem Sterling And Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Invest Over A Million Pounds Each In STATSports - plugilo.blog,www.forbes.com,,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2019/04/21/raheem-sterling-and-alex-oxlade-chamberlain-invest-over-a-million-pounds-each-in-statsports/,"Premier League stars, Raheem Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have each invested more than £1M ($1.3M) in STATSports, considered to be the global leader in wearable tech and performance analysis tracking equipment and software. Both players are England internationals and both have also signed on as global ambassadors for STATSports.
I have chosen STATSports above all potential investments. It’s a brand and product I have known and trusted for the last 10 years of my footballing career. Working with STATSports at Southampton, Arsenal, Liverpool and with England, I know this is the best product on the market by far. Alex Oxlade -Chamberlain, Liverpool and England.
STATSports produces a device which is placed inside a player's vest during training and games. The device, called the Viper Pod, uses GPS information and transmits information relating to heart rate, distance, speed, fatigue and even if a player is favoring one foot while running.
The information from each player’s device is picked up by a pitchside antenna and fed to special software that is monitored and assessed by sports scientists and members of the fitness staff.
The end result is individualized information that helps a player achieve peak performance at the right time.
I use STATSports technology every single day for both City and England and have done for years, so I know how valuable it is for getting the best out of me for the team. STATSports has already made a big name for itself in the elite game but it’s clear to me that there is huge potential for the technology and that is why I’ve invested. Raheem Sterling, Manchester City and England
In March 2018, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) and STATSports announced a “milestone agreement” to provide performance monitoring units to players across the U.S. Men’s, Women’s, Youth, Paralympic, Futsal and Beach National Teams, Development Academy clubs and NWSL.
STATSports already provides monitoring systems to teams such as Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League as well as Juventus of Serie A and PSG of Ligue1. The company also provides systems to the national associations of Brazil, Germany, and England and is also involved in an array of other sports including Basketball, Rugby Union and Gridiron Football.
A report in the Irish Times suggests that the company founded in 2007 and based in Newry, Northern Ireland could be looking at an IPO within the next two years with a valuation of around £1B ($1.3B). The current valuation of the company is £200M ($260M).
Last year, STATSports introduced a consumer version of its Apex solution , which retails at around $300 in the US.
""STATSports’ Apex unit is the only one I’ve found that gives a perfect signal from 17 satellites at those stadiums. The other teams can’t get accurate data in those stadiums with the other units."" https://t.co/rqqzOVW0hK

Healthcare CEOs Get Collective $1 Billion While Minimum Wage Is Bad For Business,www.forbes.com,Erik Sherman,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2019/04/21/healthcare-ceos-get-collective-1-billion-while-minimum-wage-is-bad-for-business/,"Healthcare CEOs Get Collective $1 Billion While Minimum Wage Is Bad For Business Healthcare CEOs Get Collective $1 Billion While Minimum Wage Is Bad For Business Posted on by wLw Striking workers walk a picket line outside a Stop & Shop supermarket in Boston, Thursday, April 18, 2019. Thousands of workers remain on strike and rabbis in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island are advising their congregations not to cross the picket lines. Photo credit: Associated Press Photo/Michael Dwyer If you’ve paid attention to debates about minimum wages, you’ve likely heard the frequent arguments against the concept: An artificial floor will distort labor markets. Business owners and corporations will face artificial restrictions on profits. Low-wage jobs were really meant for young people entering the workforce and not for adults. No matter what the figure, it will discourage the creation of jobs and low-wage workers will always suffer.
More succinctly, opponents will claim that minimum wages are dangerous for the economy on principle, not practice. Could a government set a minimum wage so high that it would choke businesses right and left? Of course. Demand $100 an hour for every worker. Many businesses would immediately crumble.
If a company pays less than it takes for someone to live reasonably and the workers qualify for government safety-net subsidies, that is equally a distortion because the corporation has put some of the inherent cost of hiring people on the government, which means you and me. Creating a minimum wage high enough to force the full costs of employment back on the employer is removing distortion from the market.
Anyone who thinks that minimum wage jobs are supposed to be for people just starting out in the workforce. Minimum-wage workers do tend to be young, with half being age 25 or younger. But that says half of minimum-wage workers are older than 25 and beyond the first-job stage of their lives. That also refers to federal minimum wage. When you consider higher minimum wages in many states, the numbers could be significantly different and skew somewhat older.
And then there’s the argument that raising the minimum wage always, always, always reduces employment. Except that it doesn’t— always , that is, according to a study that finally looks across state boundaries and overall employment, a weakness of most previous analyses. The researchers looked at 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016. Taking five-year periods after each increase, the “number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged.”
Things may change somewhat, and perhaps a large increase all at once might be a problem, but the claim that minimum wage increases always result in reduced job opportunities seems questionable.
It is interesting how many people are sure that raising wages for the lowest-paid people in companies is a problem but increasing pay for top executives is always good. The argument is that companies do what makes the most sense for them and their shareholders. They don’t, by the way. There are too many studies of the lack of correlation between CEO pay and corporate performance and too much knowledge of how CEOs have influence over the choice of directors, who ultimately set executive pay.
The difference in public policy between how low-income and high-income, for example, is usually clear. As Heidi Shierholz , director of policy at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, noted, the Department of Labor has proposed a new way of calculating overtime pay. Bonuses and other additional income wouldn’t be included in the calculation. Here’s how the DoL under the current administration is portraying it:
Under current rules, employers are discouraged from offering more perks to their employees as it may be unclear whether those perks must be included in the calculation of an employees’ regular rate of pay.
In other words, the DoL is proposing an effective pay cut by changing a rule that has long been in place. For most hourly workers, overtime is far more common than bonuses and so has a larger impact.
On the other hand, look at healthcare CEO pay. Axios ran an analysis that showed 62 industry CEOs pulled in a combined total of $1.1 billion in 2018 cashed-out stock value, or an average $17.7 million each. That stock would have been awarded over time and the argument would be that the industry has done will, which it largely has. But tax law says that pay in stock awards can be treated as though it were cash, even though it isn’t. Perfectly legal, and one of the many strategies made possible by federal legislators, who enjoy the largess of campaign contributions.
So, according to many, there’s nothing wrong with paying executives who can influence and game how their incomes are set, even though there’s evidence that pushing ever more money at them does next to no good. But there is a problem with increasing the pay of low-income workers because that takes away from … whom? Even as the net worth of the bottom 90% of the country is shrinking, according to the Federal Reserve.
All while executives are frequently paid beyond the value the can demonstrate. From shareholders who have no direct say over things like executive pay or even political contributions because there is no requirement for companies to tell them what’s being done in their name.
Disparity on such a scale doesn’t go unnoticed. Workers at the New England grocery chain Stop & Shop have been on strike since April 11, a labor action that just ended with a negotiated settlement. Last year saw a large number of workers striking: 485,000 workers in 20 major strikes, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. There is only so far people are willing to bend and apparently they’ve done that. That is why many states and cities have sharply increased minimum wage. Corporations will eventually have to realize that they can’t be the only ones to profit."
The Shield's Final Chapter Results: News And Notes After Dean Ambrose Says Farewell To WWE,www.forbes.com,Alfred Konuwa,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/04/21/the-shields-final-chapter-results-news-and-notes-after-dean-ambrose-says-farewell-to-wwe/,"The Shield defeated the team of Baron Corbin, Bobby Lashley and Drew McIntyre at The Shield's Final Chapter live special on the WWE Network. Dean Ambrose presumably rides off into the sunset in a victory secured by a Seth Rollins pinfall. This caps off Dean Ambrose's unique, bizarre and drawn-out exit from WWE after the promotion peculiarly announced he would not be re-signing when his contract is up later this month.
Since then, Ambrose seemed to have been written off television every week with multiple decisive losses to Drew McIntyre and a Bobby Lashley brawl that ended in Ambrose going through a table.

Finn Balor def. Elias—WWE Intercontinental Championship
A part of me feels like this night is going to end with Dean Ambrose announcing he's re-signed with WWE.
Elias said the name of ""Moline"" Ill., twice. It's rare enough for WWE to acknowledge the name of a small city once.
When I say ""are you tired of Dean Ambrose's farewell tour?"" you say ""yes I am.""
Though the finish of the match seemed to be a rollup, the referee failed to count to three as Elias' shoulders were not fully on the mat. That man was not trying to get fined on Easter.
Ember Moon and Bayley def. The Riott Squad
With Liv Morgan headed to SmackDown Live, tonight also doubles as the Riott Squad's final riot.
If this is the last time we saw the Riott Squad together, it was a miserable sendoff.
Michael Cole acknowledged Bayley's rough reaction on Tuesday, which leads me to believe she's on the verge of turning heel.
Corey Graves noted that ""somebody very close to [Sarah Logan] forgot his name"" as a nod to the Viking Experience debacle.
There were faint ""let's go Bayley"" chants, which is still a huge upgrade for how Bayley was received in Montreal.
Ember Moon slapped hands with ringside fans by using her elbows meaning she's either a germophobe or a Moline-ophobe.
The Shield def. Baron Corbin, Drew McIntyre and Bobby Lashley
They've always done it their way, and tonight is no exception.

If WWE really felt The Shield was breaking up, would they really do it on a Network special in Moline? Only time will tell.
The pre-match heel promos featured what might have been the best WWE promo of Bobby Lashley's career. What a waste of a good promo.
Dean Ambrose dressed in all black riot gear with a bright red belt was a hilarious visual.
Renee Young's husband seemed to have an extra pep in his step throughout this one. Either he's happy to finally be leaving or he was offered Brock Lesnar Money to stay.
Bobby Lashley almost dropped Dean Ambrose on his neck, prompting a lot of fear and even more ""that could have been Ambrose's final chapter"" jokes.
Roman Reigns' approval rating with this house show crowd was predictably higher than recent levels, however he was slightly booed when tagged in for a final time.
Fans chanted ""please don't go!"" at Dean Ambrose. 20 years ago, WWE would have carefully engineered this situation so fans would chant ""you sold out !""
Dean Ambrose went out telling children to stick their middle fingers in the air and march forward as Moline witnessed his best career promo as well."
"If Sanctions Cut Iran's Oil Exports To Zero, Would Saudi Arabia Really Fill The Void?",www.forbes.com,Ellen R. Wald,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenrwald/2019/04/21/if-sanctions-cut-irans-oil-exports-to-zero-would-saudi-arabia-really-fill-the-void/,"Update: A Financial Times news article reports only that the U.S. was negotiating with Saudi Arabia and UAE to increase oil production, not that there was an agreement. According to an opinion piece in the Washington Post , U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may announce as early as Monday, April 22 that the United States will no longer grant exemptions to countries importing Iranian oil in contravention of the U.S. sanctions. According to the piece, the State Department expects that Saudi Arabia will play a key part in increasing production to offset the loss of Iranian exports and prevent oil prices from rising.
Iranian flags flutter during an inauguration ceremony for new equipment and infrastructure on February 25, 2019 at the Shahid Beheshti Port in the southeastern Iranian coastal city of Chabahar, on the Gulf of Oman. - With the web of US sanctions
AFP/Getty Images If this is true, Saudi Arabia would be negating its position of strength within OPEC and decreasing its negotiating power just as the June OPEC meeting approaches. Come June, Saudi Arabia wants to make sure that all of the 14 OPEC member nations plus the 10 participating non-OPEC member nations (most importantly Russia) hold to whatever agreement they make.
If Saudi Arabia comes into the June meeting in Vienna already having made a commitment to the United States that it will produce at a certain level, then it loses any leverage to compel other countries to control production. Even if Saudi Arabia does not have such an agreement with the United States, but the world believes that Saudi Arabia does, the kingdom's negotiating power in Vienna will be hampered.
For the current six month OPEC agreement, Saudi Arabia has actually claimed to be producing below its allocated 10.3 million barrels per day. Therefore, until the end of June, Saudi Arabia can overproduce because OPEC judges compliance based on a 6 month production average. However, the OPEC and non-OPEC countries meeting in Vienna in June care about Saudi Arabia's production for the next 6 months (July through December). If Saudi Arabia looks like it has committed to producing at a certain level in agreement with the United States, Saudi Arabia will lose leverage.

AFP/Getty Images Some people may wonder if Saudi Arabia or the world has the spare capacity to do this. According to information gleaned from the recent Saudi Aramco bond prospectus , the answer is yes. The Saudi government requires Aramco to be able to ramp up production to 12 million barrels per day within 3 months and hold that level for up to 1 year. This is called MSC and it is possible that the Saudi government may raise the MSC above 12 if it desires.
So, we know Saudi Arabia has the ability to come to an agreement with the U.S. to compensate for lost exports from Iran. However, this would harm Saudi Arabia's position of power within OPEC, at least for the time being. As traders look at this news, they will need to take into consideration whether the strategy, as laid out, makes sense for all the players involved."
Researchers At U.S. Universities Are Reportedly Helping China To Track Its Citizens,www.forbes.com,"Sam Shead, Contributor",04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/samshead/2019/04/21/researchers-at-us-universities-are-reportedly-helping-china-to-track-its-citizens/,"Western academics are helping the Chinese government to monitor the movements of its citizens with increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology that's underpinned by artificial intelligence, according to a report from The Financial Times published on Saturday. The report from the FT's Madhumita Murgia states that at least nine academic papers have been co-written by US academics alongside firms that either sell surveillance technology to the Chinese government, or alongside institutions with links to nation's military, such as China’s National University of Defense Technology (NUDT).
Chinese citizens are some of the most watched in the world. There are over 100 million CCTV cameras across the nation and the government uses them to track and control where people go and what they do.
Human rights campaigners have taken particular issue with how the Chinese government is using surveillance technology to target Uighurs in the region of Xinjiang, and t here are widespread concerns that Beijing has gone too far in terms of surveillance — references to a Big Brother state or George Orwell's ""1984"" are common.
The research partnerships identified by the FT leave the western academics complicit in China’s human rights abuses, possibly inadvertently.
The researchers in the US have links to organisations like Nokia Bell Labs, Princeton University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and University of Sydney in Australia. All of them declined to comment, according to the FT.
Interestingly, four of the US academics are affiliated with Google.
Thomas Funkhouser, a Google senior staff research scientist, worked with two visiting NUDT scientists when he was a visiting professor at Princeton University last year. The trio looked at how computer vision research can be used in unmanned drones and autonomous underwater vehicles. Their paper can be found here . Funkhouser declined to comment.
Google is reportedly distancing itself from studies where its staff teamed up with researchers and corporations in China.
""These were academic papers written by researchers at universities — Google is not involved with these projects and has no partnerships with the Chinese universities in question,” a Google spokesperson reportedly said.
The US and China are dominating the world's AI ""race"" but China is investing heavily in order to get an edge. It's also sending scientists to western universities in order to obtain overseas expertise in AI.
Alex Joske, a researcher studying the Chinese Communist party at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, reportedly said there are thousands of scientists with links to the Chinese army that have travelled to western universities in recent years.
""Scientists like. . .those who visited Princeton are among the thousands of [Chinese army] officers and cadres who have been sent abroad as PhD students or visiting scholars in the past decade.
""I think it’s really concerning because the universities have no way of ensuring the tech they’re helping these [entities] develop and improve are going to be used in ethical ways."

Increases in spending are driven by millennials that “won’t stop soon,” Bain said in a report in March.
Wu sees Shanghai as back at its historic place on the global fashion stage. “Shanghai is literally a world stage for everything,” he said. It has a colorful history, is able to attract and absorb international talent, and is quick to facilitate interactions among key players in the business. “All international fashion brands, fast-moving consumer brands and luxury brands have their China head offices, by choice -- not by government – located in Shanghai,” he said in a recent interview. “That's evidence of Shanghai's place in fashion.” Among the global brands with a China or regional headquarters in Shanghai are Coach, Tiffany, Prada, Hermes, Estee Lauder and L’Oréal.
“The companies aren’t here for show, either,” Wu said. “It’s the market growth that’s driven by a rising middle class and the rise of a locally defined trendy culture,” he said in a recent interview. “When we are talking about fashion, we're not talking about just the richest people. We're talking about a bigger population. We're talking about influence in general. We are talking about consumers. Shanghai's now returning to its historic place, and there's still a lot more to go further. It's not like Shanghai has reached its peak.”
China is helping business at LVMH, whose iconic brands include Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton. The company said on April 10 revenue rose by 16% year-on-year in the first three months of the year, giving to a boost to its Paris-traded shares that closed at a record high last week and to the fortune of Chairman Bernard Arnault and family, whose fortune has surpassed Warren Buffett’s to rank No. 3 in the world, according to Forbes estimates. LVMH’s headquarters in Shanghai spreads across the upper floors of Plaza 66 overlooking the city’s swank Nanjing Road West Road shopping district below.
Wu has witnessed Shanghai’s transformation first hand. The city native was born and raised amid its relative fashion decline in the period before the start of reforms in 1979. The son of famed Chinese stage actress Bi Chun-Fang, Wu moved to Canada in 1980, and later took a food-industry job that led him to occasionally travel back to the country. He accepted a position as brand director for Dior in Shanghai in 1993, and was back in his hometown in what he now calls “year zero” of the wave that has since shaken the global fashion industry.
“The year 1993 is the first year that international high-end consumer brands like Dior, cosmetics in particular, started to enter China officially. Before that there were some sort of representation in very minor form,” he said. “Minor” because before 1993, even China though had opened up, its growth was focused on more on export factories and cheap labor. For most of the 1980s, “nobody was talking about the consumer market at all. China was very backwards and in terms of fashion, despite the fact that Shanghai had a long past of -- if I may -- glorious days of being fashionable in the 1940s,” Wu said. “Even in the early 1990s, retail was underdeveloped to the point that any high-end goods were only tokenly distributed in government-owned ‘friendship stores’ and sold in hard currency. To access that, you needed to have relatives among overseas Chinese who give you hard currency; they weren’t for locals.” Rather than the mainland, it was Hong Kong that was the holy ground of Greater China fashion back in those days --“certainly not Shanghai,” he said. “In the whole of China, inclusive of Shanghai, people were looking up to Hong Kong in the 1980s,” he said.
After the opening to foreign retailers in 1993, China’s next big step forward in reform arrived in January 1994, when the country abolished foreign exchange certificates, allowing imports to be more easily be purchased with local currency. Businesses such as Pacific Department Store started opening in Shanghai. The next takeoff for retail distribution followed after China joined the World Trade Organization and international companies were allowed to obtain a direct subsidiary license to do retail. That opened to way to new growth and “the emergence of the real Chinese consumers in quantity,” Wu said.
Well-known Shanghai-born writer Han Han has summed up the new era. “Before 2000, we didn’t have the word ‘fashion,’” Han said wrote a blog post several years ago. When Wu first heard of Han’s observation, he recalled, “I was quite taken.” “It’s a reflection of how Chinese consumers related to fashion. That means the work that was being done in the 1990s was preliminary and educational; the feeling of fashion really came about after the turn of the century, and it was represented by people born in the 1980s after they were in their 20s.”
The rise of China’s home-made stars in music and film has since has helped to give locals more clout in the fashion world over the years. Does that mean Beijing – the film and music hub of China – will challenge Shanghai’s status in fashion? At least not for now, said Wu. “In the U.S., maybe the celebrities are living in L.A, but it does not mean that New York is not a fashionable center,” he said. When it comes to the business of fashion in China, “There’s no doubt – it’s in Shanghai,” he said.
How can Shanghai go further? The answer lies in the interactions among businesses and consumers, along with the help of the government, Wu said. “All three are very important. It includes investors and the brands. Shanghai has a natural sort of advantage of becoming better and better. This is already evident in with what has happened. And this is something that is not pushed but certainly promoted by all the participants that are in the game.”
The city’s businesses and talent also benefit from the presence of international fashion leaders, Wu said. “China is getting increased international attention from the whole world because of its importance, and that has started to attract local designers, local players and local participants. It's not just an international place. It rubs off. I always tell people that the fact that the international players are here actually reduces the cost of learning for locals, because you can see them and you interact with them. We recruit local people, and the local people who get trained in international companies sometimes go to local companies and sometimes set up all their own companies. After 15-20 years of this, you are beginning to see all this spreading out.”
Local governments are also exposed to leading industry trends and ideas, Wu said. “We can see the collective sort of improvement of the government regardless almost of who specifically is the head of this or that, right? I think this is very important.”
Shanghai’s development as a fashion hub is also benefitting from central government policies to further open China’s economy and domestic consumption, Wu said.
“China is celebrating 40 years of economic reform, and that the predominant thought is that China needs further reform, meaning the journey is not finished. And it needs to be more open. Since it needs to be more open, Shanghai is the perfect place to experiment. It’s almost like a ping-pong game. If you are living in a remote village you may also wish to experiment at being more open, but you don't have enough counterparts to play with. Shanghai has an absolute concentration of all the fashion (interests).”
Ultimately, he said, “when we are talking about moving forward, we are talking about a country with the emerged middle class. We are not talking about just a few billionaires. Shanghai has billionaires but Shanghai's advantage is not just having a handful of billionaires. It's really the concentration of middle class,” not only in the city but in the surrounding Yangtze River delta area that is also poised to benefit from policies that encourage consumption.
“So that is where Shanghai is,” Wu said. “Shanghai is representing mainland China first and foremost. And Shanghai rises with China’s rising.”

Why Are We Still Using Century-Old Discredited Theories To Explain The Power Of Social Media?,www.forbes.com,Kalev Leetaru,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/04/21/why-are-we-still-using-century-old-discredited-theories-to-explain-the-power-of-social-media/,"Social media is increasingly described as an all-powerful force shaping societal discourse, capable of toppling governments, swaying elections, promulgating propaganda, maximizing misinformation and undermining the very fabric of democracy. Yet, much of our understanding of the power of social media comes from the discredited propaganda theories of century ago that viewed media platforms as all-powerful tools for controlling populations and shaping societies. Looking beyond the false hype and hyperbole, we see that social media is a lot less powerful than we might think. For social platforms to lie at the root of every societal ill, from internet addiction to misinformation to foreign influence, would suggest that they have mastered the art of propaganda and behavioral engineering that has eluded humanity almost since the dawn of civilization.
In many ways our fixation on social media’s influence mirrors that of the great societal debate that arose at the dawn of the motion picture era a century ago.
With the rising popularity of movies in the 1920’s and 1930’s and with World War I still fresh on society’s mind, an emerging concern of considerable societal attention was the impact that movies could have on children, leading to the Payne Fund Studies to better understand just how influential movies were on the public.
One of the outcomes of these studies and the retrospective look at wartime propaganda was the conceptualization of media messages as a “magic bullet” that could be “fired” into the minds of the public to convert them to a particular point of view or focus them on a specific narrative, overriding an individual's existing beliefs and tendencies.
Much as Facebook is described today as having the power to shape the national discourse, flooding us with misinformation, swaying elections and addicting us beyond control, so too was the media once described as having almost limitless power to control the population, both domestically and abroad.
In fact, one of the driving forces behind the Payne Fund Studies was the idea that the novel medium of movies was so powerful that the decisions of a small number of filmmakers could fundamentally rewrite societal norms and tear apart the very fabric of our existence, much as we speak today of social media platforms having that same power.
Similar to today, this ""magic bullet"" theory arrived at a moment of great technological disruption in which unprecedented new communications technologies were upending the flow of information and the role of gatekeepers.
New technologies were the perfect scapegoats upon which to hang all of society's problems.
It is well worth returning to the scholarship of the era, in a time when the power of the media was viewed as so great that it could overwhelm a person’s most deeply held convictions.
As Lavine and Wechsler’s famous book “War Propaganda and the United States” offered in 1940, “we live in a propaganda age... public opinion no longer is formulated by the slow process of … shared experience … in our time public opinion is primarily a response to propaganda stimuli.”
Over time this absolute power to overwhelm all beliefs and convictions gave way to a far more nuanced and complex understanding of how societies produce and consume information.
Seminal studies like McComb and Shaw’s 1972 “The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media” clarified that media could exert considerable influence by drawing attention to issues, but that those effects were mediated by a complex interdependent web of backgrounds, beliefs and connections.
In an eerily prescient preview of today's fixation on misinformation, David Riesman observed in 1941 that ""[T]he fear of propaganda [has] created a large number of citizens who don't believe what they read in the papers, and who feel surrounded by conspiracies and lies."" The Librarian of Congress warned at the time that ""it is the very simple technique of repeating and repeating and repeating falsehoods, with the idea that by constant repetition and reiteration, with no contradiction, the misstatements will finally come to believed."" As one author summed up the information environment at the time, it was ""like a real combat zone, the war of words engendered a fog, a miasma that dazed and confused the otherwise rational participants in the democratic process and drove them paranoid.""
Much as FCC Chairman Newton Minow’s “ vast wasteland ” speech on the state of television half a century ago raised every one of the issues we today ascribe as novel issues unique to social media, so too did the communications scholars of just under a century ago grapple with the same issues we today see as the exclusive domain of social media.
Read contemporary publications and coverage of the Payne Fund Studies and propaganda theories of the age, replacing the words “mass media” and “propaganda” with “social media” and ""behavioral engineering"" and even century-old research papers and news articles read as if they were published today.
Study the works of Hadley Cantril, Harold Lasswell, Paul Lazarsfeld and other figures of the era and one will see that, like Minow’s 1961 television speech, the very concerns we claim today are unprecedented outcomes of social media are merely the age-old issues that arise every half century with the debut of a major new telecommunications technology.
The Magic Bullet theory emerged at a time of great upheaval in the informational landscape, as the new medium of motion pictures represented a technology that was viewed as having almost hypnotic powers to sway populations against their every conviction, in spite of all evidence to the contrary.
Minow’s 1961 “vast wasteland” speech marked yet another major transition point in which a new technology was upending the natural order of the communications landscape and raising a host of existential societal issues.
Today social media represents the latest technological inflection point and once again we are grappling with all of the same questions we have confronted roughly every 50 years.
It is particularly striking just how closely the current societal conversation about social media has hewed to the discredited theories of a century ago of all-powerful communications mediums and how quickly we’ve forgotten all of the quantitative knowledge we’ve gained in the decades since.
Putting this all together, we are describing the power of social media today in remarkably similar terms as those used a century ago in an era when the media was viewed as all-powerful, capable of everything from toppling governments to influencing elections to promulgating propaganda to maximizing misinformation to addicting us to undermining the very fabric of democracy to beginning and ending wars with a few words.
In the century since, we learned these fears were greatly exaggerated and we developed far more nuanced understandings of the interplay between the public and the communications mediums through which they interact and engage with the world.
Yet, much like the rise of television half a century ago, it seems each great technological revolution is accompanied by the same existential fears that these new tools will rip apart the very fabric of human existence, turning us all into mindless zombies controlled by the airwaves or internet signals.
In the end, perhaps instead of listening to yet another commentator proclaiming how Facebook will be the end of our world, we should spend that time reading works by scholars like Cantril, Lasswell and Lazarsfeld, the quantitative studies like McComb and Shaw’s and reread Minow’s “vast wasteland” speech.
Perhaps seeing that our modern world is not so different from those of the past and that these exact issues seem to resurface every half century or so with the latest communications technology revolution, might help all of us tone down the rhetoric just enough that we can have a rational and informed debate about our digital future."
It Pays To Be Green: Homes Near Electric-Vehicle Charging Stations Fetch Top Dollar,www.forbes.com,msn.com,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2019/04/21/it-pays-to-be-green-homes-near-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-fetch-top-dollar/,"Close proximity to electric-vehicle charging stations is becoming the new hardwood flooring when it comes to commanding a higher sale price. A new analysis by realtor.com finds that listings in electric vehicle-friendly housing markets sell at a premium. The top 20 housing markets fall within nine states, with a majority of the Zip codes in California. Zip code 92618 in Irvine, California has the most charging stations, 77, while the top 20 Zip codes have an average of about 30 charging stations each. The combined median listing price for the areas that are most accommodating to electric vehicles is $782,000, 1.5 times higher than their surrounding metro areas and 2.6 times higher than the rest of the country.
Realtor.com used data from OpenChargeMap to track 19,743 charging stations mapped across 6,980 Zip codes, and then analyzed the housing markets of the top 20 areas with the most electric-vehicle charging stations.
“Our data shows there’s definitely a link between the prevalence of electric-vehicle charging stations and higher home prices,” says Danielle Hale, chief economist at realtor.com. “But there’s a difference between correlation and causation. The trend we’re seeing in the data is most likely a result of the fact that wealthier homeowners are more likely to purchase expensive electric vehicles. But regardless of the cause, if you’re shopping for a home in a Zip with an abundance of electric-vehicle charging stations, you’ll likely pay a premium.”
Hale says electric-vehicle charging stations are more common in areas with higher-priced homes, which not only reflects the affluence of those who live in the areas but also a preference for making environmentally friendly decisions.
Research has shown a connection between the fact that California highways allow single-occupant electric vehicles to use HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) lanes and electric-vehicle adoption, but this benefit is not exclusive to California.
“Having an electric vehicle can sometimes come with great perks such as being able to use HOV lanes without having several occupants in the vehicle,” says Hale. Anyone hoping to take advantage of this or the other benefits of being an electric-vehicle owner, such as contributing to lower vehicle emissions, will have to be able to charge their car, and having stations in close proximity or having a station already in the home means a buyer wouldn't have to tackle this project after purchasing. This will definitely be noticed by current or aspiring electric-vehicle owners.”
It stands to reason that California leads the nation in charging stations, given that electric car sales make up 10 percent of all new cars sold in the Golden State, outpacing all other states . Policies that encourage electric-vehicle adoption also lead to more charging stations, which is why many California markets are on the list of top areas.
Beyond Tesla’s electric-car manufacturing presence in California, there are several contributing factors that have led to increased awareness of electric vehicles in the state, including its Zero-Emission Vehicle program, the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project , coastal political leanings such as pro-clean technology and pro-innovation, and higher-than-average wages.
Other housing markets that are accommodating for the growing electric-vehicle market include Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, New York, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Although these markets are significantly more affordable than California's electric vehicle-friendly Zip codes, the analysis found non-California Zip codes are seeing median listing prices that are still 1.5 times higher than their surrounding metro median and two times higher than the U.S. median listing price on average."
"Buy Denmark, Sell Greenland- Finding Value In Scandinavian Stamps",www.forbes.com,,04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardlehmann/2019/02/13/scandinavian-stamp-values/,"Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Richard Lehmann blogs on Income Investing and Philately Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin For stock investors, Europe has been an underwhelming region for the better part of a decade. Vanguard's FTSE Europe ETF, for example, has logged an average annual return of only 6% over the last decade. Alas, there are some low-risk European assets that have been logging strong returns. Postage Stamps. Danish stamps, used or mint, for example have appreciated some 30% during the last decade.
Scandinavian countries have been among the more responsible postal authorities issuing in volumes geared more for need than for profit, i.e. collectors. This makes them a better candidate for consideration by those collectors who have more than a passing interest in their collection’s residual value. Still, price appreciation by country has been mixed both by country and by time period. A close study of the accompanying table tells a variety of stories.
The table reflects the performance of stamps cataloging $25 or more and issued through 1950. (Note: The 1950 cutoff accounts for why Aland Islands and Faroe Islands are not included in this analysis.) The 5 and 10 year appreciation numbers reflect the changes in catalog values over the last 5 and 10 years. The appreciations are calculated for all items values up to $500 and those valued at over $500. This breakdown is done because the higher priced items unduly distort the numbers and, generally, appreciate at a faster rate. This is because they have a larger audience of buyers, i.e. investors, and sell mostly at auction where pricing information is more transparent.
The top appreciation performers were Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Greenland mint stamps showed the steepest declines which is odd since their average stamp price is the lowest . In fact, it is the only country where the average used price is higher than mint. Iceland shows one of the highest per stamp values and additionally, sports huge premiums for mint never hinged material. This appears due to the low per stamp issuance volume. I would caution collectors about paying such premiums given their greater vulnerability to market declines and to re-gumming. Finland is unusual in that its used stamps are close to the average mint stamps which also have the highest per stamp value of all countries. Norway has the lowest ratio of used to mint prices which, combined with their overall performance makes Norwegian used stamps the sweet spot for future appreciation.
We show dollar values for each country to give an idea of how much it would take to build a complete collection for each country, less the over $500 items of course. While the stamp selections for each country represent about eighty percent of the catalog value for all stamps of that country, we can expect to buy at well below full catalog for the listed items, so the remaining stamps should not increase the total cost for a fairly complete collection (less the +$500 items) above the values shown.
The steady decline in most retail stamp prices reflects the effect of the Internet which has become the principal engine today for stamp sales, an effect that will only grow. Technological changes on the horizon will only accelerate this process, changes that will make stamp dealing more efficient.
However, I also foresee changes which will make it possible for collectors to achieve higher recoveries for their collections and that should prove to be the element that gives confidence to collectors to buy.
If you have a serious interest in Scandinavia, you need to avail yourself of the Facit Norden 2018 or the Facit Special Classic 2018 catalogs. They are bilingual and offer the best guide on current pricing. These catalogs can be obtained through Sweden’s Postiljonen auction house and www.facit.se

"'Game Of Thrones' Season 8, Episode 2 Recap And Review: Things We Do For Love",www.forbes.com,Erik Kain,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/04/21/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-2-review-and-recap-the-calm-before-the-storm/,"Spoilers through Season 8 of 'Game of Thrones' follow.
'Game Of Thrones' offered up another excellent episode Sunday evening as our heroes prepare for the long night.
Credit: HBO Game of Thrones has found its feet once again, as Sunday night's episode offered up yet another great episode filled with lots of our favorite characters carousing, arguing and dropping truth bombs.
This week focused entirely on the Winterfell story line, with not even a moment spared for Cersei (Lena Headey) and King's Landing. And much like last week, the entire hour was devoted to character development and interaction rather than action. The only action was Gendry (Joe Dempsie) and Arya (Maisie Williams) finally getting it on, which is weird because I still think of Arya as a kid but Gendry is a full-grown man. I realize in the show Arya has grown up into a young lady, but it's still weird to see her strip naked and hop into bed with her old friend.
Giant's Milk and Lady Knights
The real star of tonight's episode was Tormund Giantsbane (Kristofer Hivju) who serves as much-needed comic relief. Every single thing he said cracked me up, but especially the story of how he got the name ""Giantsbane."" Apparently he killed a giant when he was ten years old, then hopped into bed with the giant's wife who suckled him at her breast for the next three months. ""That's how I got so strong,"" he says. ""Giant's milk.""
Tormund
Credit: HBO / Erik Kain Tormund is sitting around a fire with a motley crew of the show's surviving characters: Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) and Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) and Podrick (Daniel Portman), Davos Seaworth (Liam Cunningham) and Tormund Giantsbane.
Tyrion pours the wine and encourages everyone to partake. It's amusing to him that just about everyone in the room has fought against the Starks at one point and now they're all here defending the Stark castle (and the world of the living, of course).
The conversation turns to Brienne and how she's not a real knight. Ladies can't be knights, she tells Tormund. ""If I were a king, I'd knight you ten times over,"" he answers back, still very much trying to get her out of all that armor and into something more comfortable.
""You don't need a king to make a knight,"" Jaime replies. Then he tells Brienne to kneel and does something that quite a few people should have done long ago, especially Renly Baratheon. She kneels, embarrassed and flushed, and he recites the knighting words as he taps her shoulder with his blade. It's a wonderful moment. Jaime is solemn. What began as something of a joke quickly turns into one of the most powerful moments we've seen on Game of Thrones.
There were tears in Brienne's eyes as Jaime spoke the words, and there were tears in my eyes as well. When it's over, Brienne gives the biggest smile I've ever seen on her face. Death is on the march and in hours the Night King's army will be at Winterfell's gates, but Brienne is the happiest she's ever been in her entire life. What a beautiful scene.
Hard-Headed Women
Sansa Stark
Credit: HBO There were other meetings. Arya briefly speaks with the Hound (Rory McCann) before Beric Dondarrian (Richard Dormer) shows up. Both she and the Hound seem annoyed by him, which felt off to me. Beric's a cool character but they've turned him into the annoying guy who just preaches all the time. Arya gets up and walks off.
""Where are you going?"" Clegane asks. She tells them they may only have a few hours left to live and she's not spending it with ""two miserable old shits"" then proceeds to go shoot arrows until Gendry shows up with her new weapon, a Dragon Glass short spear of some sort. The rest is history.
Arya could work on her pillow talk, though. In fact, I'm not sure I love this new Arya all that much. She's constantly in pure badass mode. She's so tough, she's such a great fighter, she can throw daggers with deadly accuracy, she tells Gendry to take off his own bloody pants because . . . it's better to be tough than romantic or sexy? I'm not quite sure. It feels a little forced. I miss the old Arya. She was witty and quick-thinking but she wasn't so stuck-up all the time.
Speaking of stuck-up annoying characters, Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) is almost intolerable at this point. I hope she turns out to be a villain in the end, because only that will justify the way she's being written.
Lady Mormont is another strong female character I enjoy in this show.
Credit: HBO When she confronts Jaime she talks about how he killed her father and is incredibly threatening despite everyone, including her, knowing full well that her father was a murderous psychopath who needed to be put down. She doesn't trust Jaime, and that makes sense given his past. Sansa doesn't either, but Brienne vouches for him and she relents. Jon thinks they need every man they can get. And Tyrion says he believes him also. Jaime reveals that Cersei has no intention of helping them and has a massive army that can wipe them all out once the Night King is dealt with.
This upsets Daenerys, who then later takes out her frustration on Tyrion despite having gone along with his plan without question herself. It's only later, when Jorah (Iain Glen) draws her aside in private, that she's reminded that Tyrion is very clever even if he does make mistakes from time to time and maybe, just maybe, she should back off. He also urges her to make amends with Sansa (Sophie Turner), though that doesn't go quite as well as she hoped. When they're speaking the ice does begin to thaw, but then Sansa brings up the fate of the North, asking Dany what happens when she takes the Iron Throne.
The North, Sansa says, was taken from them and then they took it back and swore never to bend the knee again. And if there's one thing Dany hates, it's when people don't bend the knee. The temperature reaches freezing just when things were warming up, and you can almost see Dany imagining her dragons roasting Sansa. They're interrupted by the arrival of Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) who Sansa embraces with joy.
Of the three strong women currently moving and shaking things at Winterfell, my favorite has become . . . Sansa of all people. She's smart and practical, stubborn and eloquent. She's a good ruler, and would make an excellent Queen in the North. I also like the young Lady Mormont, who is always putting someone in their place--this time, her cousin (uncle?) Ser Jorah.
The Things We Do For Love
The Three-Eyed Raven
Credit: HBO The best bit during the grilling of Jaime Lannister came when he defends his actions to Sansa, including fighting with her father in the streets of King's Landing. I'd do it all again, he says. I was defending my House and my family.
""The things we do for love,"" Bran says. Point to Bran.
One of the scenes I was most anticipating came a bit later, when Jaime finds Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) in the Godswood. ""I'm sorry for what I did to you,"" he says, and he means it. ""I'm not that man anymore.""
""You'd still be that man if you hadn't pushed me out the window,"" Bran replies. ""And I'd still be Bran Stark.""
He has no hard feelings. He didn't reveal the truth about Jaime because he didn't want them to murder him before the battle. ""And after?"" Jaime asks.
""You assume there will be an after?"" Bran replies.
My Name Is Aegon Targeryen
Daenerys
Credit: HBO The other big scene came toward the very end of the episode. After Jon did his level best the entire episode to avoid Daenerys, she finds him down in the crypts (which are strangely empty given how everyone is supposed to be down there hiding).
He's standing in front of Lady Lyanna Stark, and Dany muses about her brother, Rhaegar, and how she can't reconcile the good man from the stories with someone who could rape Lyanna.
""He didn't,"" Jon says. ""He loved her."" And the truth comes spilling out. He tells her how Rhaegar and Lyanna were wed in secret, and how after Robert's rebellion was successful and Rhaegar slain, Lyanna made her brother Ned swear to raise their baby as his own bastard in order to protect him from Robert and the Lannisters.
""My name is Aegon Targaryen,"" he says.
Daenerys doesn't believe him. She finds the story a little too convenient. After all, it's his brother and best friend who came to him with this revelation. And worse still, worse than the fact that she's been boning her nephew, that would give him a claim to the throne.
It's honestly a little funny how much this bothers her. Her only claim to the throne is by blood. She was raised a Targaryen, but she wasn't raised in Westeros. She's a foreigner whose only interest in the Seven Kingdoms is to rule them after staring at them from afar her whole life. Her claim is simply by blood, and now Jon's claim is better than hers. She should be happy for him, happy to have her brother's son and heir alive and well. She should, for lack of a better phrase, bend the damn knee.
Varys, Dany and Jorah
Credit: HBO But Dany is not a very good person. All her worst instincts keep coming out and are only momentarily quelled by her advisers. In fact, the only really good thing she's ever done is surround herself with good advisers, but her first instinct with Tyrion is to fire him for his one screw-up (which she backed) and now her instinct with Jon is to disbelieve him and then get defensive over his superior claim to the Iron Throne. She's power-hungry and hardly ""just"" in any sense of the word. Jaime questions Tyrion on the matter, wondering aloud if she's really so different from other Targaryens. Tyrion seems to think so.
I'm not so sure.
Jon (or Aegon now) and Dany don't have time to get in a big heated fight about it, though. The horns blow and they race to the battlements. Off in the distance, in the dark and the snow, the army of the dead has arrived. Next week, be prepared for a very big, very intense battle for the very survival of humanity. Will the Night King destroy them all or will our heroes prevail? I'm hoping they actually stop the bastard and the final three episodes have to do with taking King's Landing and stopping Cersei, and then determining what exactly will happen with the Iron Throne.
I suppose Jon will ultimately prove that he's a Targaryen vis-a-vis the dragons, but I could be wrong about that.
I hope they melt it down to make utensils with, because I certainly don't think Daenerys should rule Westeros and I don't think Jon is interested in the job.

I suppose Jon will ultimately prove that he's a Targaryen vis-a-vis the dragons, but I could be wrong about that. Podrick Payne can sing! Who needs famous pop-star cameos when Pod has a pair of lungs like that! Tormund also stole the show when he downed his entire horn of Wildling grog in one very messy pull. I don't think Brienne likes him, though. She looked at him very disapprovingly. Poor guy. Missandei and Grey Worm's little conversation about moving off together after the war makes me very nervous that Grey Worm is going to die next week. Sam gave Jorah Mormont his family Valyrian steel blade. It's fitting in a way. After all, the Stark's blade was melted down by Tywin, and Jon got Jorah's father's Valyrian steel blade instead. Now Jorah gets to have one, too. He'll probably kill a White Walker with it. I liked the conversation with the last three Night's Watch brothers (or at least the last three from that little group) joking around with one another on the battlements. It's funny to remember that Sam was the first person to kill a White Walker, discovering the power of obsidian. Quite serendipitous. I'm very curious to see how Bran's plan works out. He's acting as bait for the Night King, waiting with Theon in the Godswood in the hopes that he'll go there to kill him and they'll have a chance to kill the Night King and destroy his army in one fell swoop. Of course, the Night King has a dragon which might complicate things. Will Jon ride a dragon in the battle? That would be very cool. What did you think of the episode? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook , and thanks for reading!

"Why Immigrants, Students And U.S. Companies Are Going To Canada",www.forbes.com,Stuart Anderson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2019/04/22/why-immigrants-students-and-u-s-companies-are-going-to-canada/,"“Oh, Canada” is a refrain more U.S. companies, high-skilled foreign nationals and international students are listening to in response to more restrictive immigration policies in the United States. The Trump administration has made it more difficul t for international students to stay or work in America and new international student enrollment at U.S. universities declined over 6% in the 2017/2018 academic year, while Canadian universities are attracting international students at record levels . The number of international students in Canada increased 16% in 2018, after rising 20% in 2017.
It’s not just international students choosing Canada. “Sixty-three percent of employers surveyed in the Envoy study are increasing their presence in Canada, either by sending more workers there or by hiring foreign nationals there,” reported the technology news outlet Recode . “More than half of those did both. Another 65% of hiring professionals said Canada’s immigration policies are more favorable to U.S. employers than U.S. policies. Of those surveyed, 38% are thinking about expanding to Canada, while 21% already have at least one office there.”
To better understand the Canadian immigration system and what may be attracting U.S. businesses, I interviewed Peter Rekai, founder of the Toronto-based immigration law firm Rekai LLP .
Stuart Anderson: Is it your experience that U.S. companies frustrated with current immigration policies are moving more people and resources to Canada?
Peter Rekai: Definitely. Canada is becoming a destination for high-skilled foreign workers who can’t get new or extended status in the United States. Sometimes U.S companies just “park” these workers in Canada, hoping to get them eventually into the United States. However, many other U.S. companies have opened affiliates in Canada to which they are transferring their foreign workers on a long-term basis.
While a number of such “tech refugees” regret that they cannot stay in Silicon Valley, those with families appreciate that in Canada their spouses can get “open” work permits, their children can go to public schools and the family will be covered by universal public healthcare. They also appreciate that a clear path to permanent residence (and ultimately citizenship) is available to them, likely after a year of working in Canada.
Anderson: H-1B visa cases filed without premium processing can take U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 6 to 12 months to complete. What’s processing like for the equivalent temporary visas in Canada?
Rekai: The federal government's new Global Skills Strategy has facilitated hiring and accelerated the processing of high-skilled workers. The goal is to get all high-skilled labour-market exempt workers to Canada and to their respective employers within 2 weeks (2 weeks longer if a labour market approval is required). Employers of low- to medium-skilled workers seeking labour market approvals face longer processing periods (currently between 3 to 9 months).
Anderson: Is it accurate to say Canada has made it easier for businesses in recent years?
Rekai: Yes. The government has expanded the number of categories of work permit categories that exempt employers from having to go through the cumbersome labour market approval process to obtain permission to hire a foreign worker. Some of this expanded mobility for professionals and business people has been due to the signing of new free trade agreements with nations in the Americas, the Pacific and the European Union.
Anderson: Can you explain how permanent residence, the equivalent of a U.S. green card, operates in Canada for business immigration?
Rekai: Economic immigrants account for 50% to 60% of all applicants for permanent residence in Canada. Their eligibility is largely determined by a “points system” based on a “human capital” model that rewards youth, education, skilled job experience and sophisticated English or French language skills.
Generous “points” are accorded to those with skilled work experience in Canada and to holders of Canadian post-secondary diplomas and degrees. This effectively establishes a path to permanent residence for currently employed skilled temporary foreign workers, ensuring that most of Canada’s new economic immigrants are already gainfully employed by the time they become permanent residents. This “path” to permanent residence also underlines the significant role played by Canadian employers, who initially choose the temporary foreign workers.
Anderson: You’ve noted before that it could be dangerous to import the Canadian points system wholesale into the United States because Canada’s system works because it’s flexible and responds to employer needs but that type of “flexibility” in the wrong hands could be disastrous for U.S. employers.
Rekai: Putting broad immigration decision-making into the hands of a strong executive can lead to “be careful what you wish for” outcomes. An ideologue in an empowered U.S. executive branch (e.g., White House aide Stephen Miller) could significantly change the focus of U.S. immigration through executive order or action.
As I’ve noted previously, if the United States adopted the same immigration system as Canada, then the president of the United States, via the Secretary of Homeland Secretary, could set the level of legal immigration in a given year at zero, 500,000 or 5 million, whichever level he prefers. In addition, the president through his designee could establish or eliminate entire categories of immigrants and decide on the number of immigrants in each category, or do the equivalent when deciding the overall point level or which characteristics get points at all.
Anderson: It seems to Americans that Canada has historically avoided the same level of political divisiveness over immigration that we have seen in the United States. Is that a correct perception?
Rekai: Not entirely. Being bounded by 3 large oceans and sharing our only land border with the most affluent nation in the world has allowed Canada to avoid the immigration stresses imposed by large movements of asylum seekers and economic refugees. This has permitted Canadian governments to pursue a more orderly immigration process within controlled borders.
Canada pursued a largely white European-based immigrant selection process until the advent of the “points system” in the mid-1960s, which democratised and globalised our immigrant selection.
Canadian governments, Conservative and Liberal, over the past few decades have all been keen supporters of steadily raising immigration levels as an economic tool, with an emphasis on attracting skilled immigrants. Currently, our annual immigrant intake represents 1% of our population and, on a per capita basis, is 3 times that of the United States. However, our governments have been cautious to avoid any sudden boost in numbers so as to preserve the positive but delicate Canadian pro-immigration consensus.
Anderson: What do you think is the biggest weakness for businesses or employment-based immigrants in the Canadian immigration system?
Rekai: On the high-skilled worker side, the current points system, which the Minister of Immigration has the power to adjust at will, tends to be too tough on mid-career applicants, who are likely to be more accomplished and experienced in their occupational fields than their younger counterparts. Applicants under the federal selection programme start losing “points” in the age category after the age of 30, making them less competitive.
The heavy emphasis of the Canadian points system on post-secondary education, as well as its emphasis on those with offers of long-term full-time employment, has made it difficult to attract trades that are considered valuable in the workplace, particularly construction workers, such as carpenters, bricklayers, electricians, etc. The more recent establishment of a designated “trades stream,” which de-emphasizes post-secondary degrees and acknowledges that employment in the construction industry is based on shorter-term projects, has served to create an opening for trade applicants, although it’s too early to determine its success.
The Canadian system also features a partial outsourcing of economic immigration selection to the provinces. Regional employers have input in selecting immigrants with particular skills that are needed locally, including allowing for the selection of certain low-skilled workers (e.g., meat cutters needed by food processing plants in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and long-haul truckers in Alberta).
Anderson: Why is Canada good for international students?
Rekai: International students who graduate from (at least) 2-year programmes at Canadian colleges and universities, in any field, are eligible for 3-year open work permits. Typically, graduates with a Canadian post-secondary credential will be young, communicate well in English or French and have gained one or more years of Canadian skilled work experience pursuant to their post-graduation work permits. This makes them competitive applicants under the points-based economic permanent resident selection process.
The knowledge that there is a clear “studies to work to permanent residence” path has significantly increased the number of international students coming to Canada, with many choosing Canada over attending U.S. schools for this reason.
Anderson: Do you think if U.S. policymakers don’t make it easier to hire and retain high-skilled foreign nationals in America that more U.S. companies, immigrants and international students will be coming to Canada?
Rekai: High-skilled foreign nationals will continue to find a reliable path to permanent residence in a relatively short period of time in Canada. Absent changes in U.S. immigration policies, I would expect companies, immigrants and international students to continue to see Canada as an attractive alternative to the United States."
The Philadelphia Eagles Are Addressing The Landfill Crisis With This Tech. Your Company Could Too.,www.forbes.com,Kate Harrison,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2019/04/22/the-philadelphia-eagles-are-addressing-the-landfill-crisis-with-this-tech-your-company-could-too/,"At the current pace, it is estimated that the US will run out of landfill capacity by the year 2036 , and even sooner in several regions. The situation is further impacted by an anticipated world population growth from 7.7 billion to 8.6 billion people by 2030 with its looming strain on resources and the environment. Fighting our trash crisis is a big business, and without a single solution at the forefront, there’s lots of room for innovative companies to get into the game. What Is Actually Filling up Our Landfills?
Landfills are the oldest form of waste treatment and historically the most common, with discarded household and industrial items and refuse delivered by the ton. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that food waste alone accounts for 22% of municipal solid waste — more than any other single material .
Contrary to common belief, half-eaten sandwiches, cases of aging lettuce, and packages of expired cheese do not break down quickly. In fact, food sealed in manufacturers’ packaging and tied-up in plastic bags is deprived of oxygen, the essential component of air that aids in decomposition. Therefore, this type of food waste decomposes at a significantly slower rate. In turn, the landfills experience increased levels of methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that is 23 times as potent as carbon dioxide in terms of its impact on global warming . In addition, carbon fuel emissions from long-haul trash collection vehicles further exacerbate environmental impacts.
Some more progressive areas, such as Berkeley, CA already have commercial composting options that companies can take advantage of while other areas don’t offer even the most basic recycling services, let alone a solution for food waste. For organizations in these communities that are connected to city sewage treatment plants through city sewer lines, aerobic digesters offer an interesting solution to the food waste conundrum.
Aerobic Digesters 101
I spoke with Michael Schmidt, an Executive Vice President at Gold Medal Environmental , a sustainable waste services provider based in New Jersey to get a sense of where things stand. “Today, leading companies like BioHiTech Global (Nasdaq BHTG), are providing businesses and institutions on-site aerobic digester solutions that have the capacity to process thousands of pounds of food waste per day, using oxygen, microorganisms, and warm water,” Schmidt explained.
Through the use of on-site aerobic digesters, food is broken down into a liquid that is safely discharged into the sanitary sewer system, completely eliminating the need for hauling, storing, and processing. “When paired with a smart data analytics platform, modifications in supply chain management can be easily identified, and waste diversion efforts can be amplified,” he added. “Aerobic digesters are a regulatory compliant solution in cities and states that have organics bans in place, as well as an environmentally-responsible alternative to traditional waste disposal methods.”
The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Delaware recently conducted an independent Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) comparing aerobic digester technology to composting and traditional disposal methods. The results of the LCA demonstrated that aerobic digestion technology, utilizing sewer lines, produced the most favorable outcomes regarding global warming impact. (Potential Impact was measured in carbon dioxide equivalents per 1,000 kilograms of food waste.) In contrast, trucking unprocessed food waste directly to landfills was the least environmentally friendly alternative, yielding 900% more carbon dioxide equivalents.
A Solution In Action
“On-site aerobic digestion helped the Philadelphia Eagles tackle food waste at Lincoln Financial Field, and played a significant role in their recent LEED Gold Certification,” Schmidt noted. “ The Eagles' Go Green program began when the stadium opened in 2003. Initially launching with just a few recycling bins, the program has grown to include operating on 100% clean energy, phasing out plastics at concession stands, stadium-wide composting, and the utilization of an on-site aerobic digester. These combined initiatives contribute to the diversion of 4,000 tons of waste each year, including over 50 tons of food waste to date.”
Similarly, Temple University recently adopted sustainable disposal services in an effort to divert waste from landfills. “The new fully integrated system provides Temple University with innovative disposal services in combination with on-site digesters and a supply chain data analytics platform to help reduce waste generation. Three digesters were installed as part of the initial phase with a capacity to divert more than 3,000 pounds of waste from landfills each day. In addition, their use eliminates the impact of collecting and transporting numerous small waste containers on a weekly basis,” Schmidt adds.
There is a linear correlation between increases in population and waste generation, resulting in alarming predictions about our landfills’ ability to accommodate ever-increasing trash. Technology-backed waste disposal and management methods offer a sustainable solution for generations to come. Aerobic digesters are one option that can help lead the way.
If your business wants to help keep food waste out of landfills, look into commercial composting and on-site food digester options in your area. Both are great ways to make a real difference. For all of us, while 2036 may seem like a long way off, it will be upon us faster than we think. The time to deal with our trash problem is now."
Golfer Greg Norman's Colorado Ranch Could Be Yours For $50 Million,www.forbes.com,Brenda Richardson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2019/04/22/golfer-greg-normans-colorado-ranch-could-be-yours-for-50-million/,"Hall of Fame golfer Greg Norman, whose success in business ventures rivals his golfing career, is selling his Seven Lakes Ranch in Meeker, Colorado. The sprawling homestead, undeniably a sportsman’s paradise, is back on the market for $50 million, $5 million less than its list price in 2017. Overlooking White River National Forest , the property features 11,600 acres of varied terrain with the majestic beauty of Northwest Colorado as the backdrop. Seven Lakes includes a 13,907-square-foot main lodge with nine bedrooms, seven guest cabins, staff housing, a historic dance hall, equestrian facilities and a fitness center with spa.

Max Kim-Bee Steven Shane, managing director and broker associate at Compass real estate brokerage in Aspen, Colorado, says Seven Lakes is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts.
“The natural resources of this property are what make it so valuable,” says Shane. “There are 100-mile views of the White River National Forest and the Flat Tops Wilderness Area . And it’s not only from the lodge. If you go to the clays course at a different station, the views will take your breath away.”
The rugged terrain, sweeping meadows, trails, fishing spots and abundance of wildlife are ideal for recreationists in search of opportunities to camp out in the wild, hunt, catch fish or go horseback riding and snowmobiling. Seeking something more low key? The area provides the perfect setting for stargazing.

Horseback riding is an ideal way to see the beauty of Seven Lakes Ranch.
Max Kim-Bee Shane pointed out that varied terrain distinguishes a Coloradan ranch from ranches in some other states. “If you would go to ranches in Texas, Wyoming or Montana, there would be a lot of acreage and very flat land,” he explains. “Here, there are significant changes in elevation and types of terrain.”
Norman assembled Seven Lakes from three land parcels. Pollard Ranch is 3,007 acres and includes two miles of White River frontage that is perfect for fly fishing. Pollard features a dance hall, barn and corrals for horseback riding in open pastures. A competitive clays course for skeet shooting is in the slope of a mountain. From Pollard, take a bridge over White River and you are in the 8,350-acre Dry Creek parcel, which Shane says offers the best elk hunting in North America. A four-bedroom hunting lodge is in Dry Creek. The remaining parcel of land is the 244-acre Seven Lakes.
Always the astute businessman, Norman has included farm and ranch equipment to sweeten the deal. Who, you might ask, would be the ideal owner of Norman’s ranch in this Colorado town? “It’s going to be for a person or a family that appreciates and understands that they want to own an authentic piece of America’s landscape,” says Shane. “A person or family who understands that this is a once-in-lifetime opportunity to enjoy everything the great outdoors has to offer.”
