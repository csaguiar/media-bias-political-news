CAIRO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Ex-Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will travel to Qatar or Switzerland in April to receive medical treatment, local media reported on Friday, citing sources.
The 82-year-old Bouteflika stepped down from his position on Tuesday by handing a resignation letter to the Constitutional Council, following months-long protests in Algeria demanding a change of power. Bouteflika cited Article 102 as cause for his resignation which states that a leader can step down if they are inhibited from performing their presidential duties due to medical reasons.
According to the Algerie-direct news outlet, the former Algerian president will travel to receive medical treatment in either an American clinic in Doha or a hospital in Geneva .
Bouteflika served four terms as president since assuming office in 1999. In February this year the leader announced his intention to seek a new presidential bid. The announcement quickly prompted large waves of anti-government protests, the largest in over a decade. Bouteflika finally surrendered to the demonstrators' demands and said he would not seek a new term. The Algerian government must now organize new elections to fill the presidential vacancy, with Abdelkader Bensalah, the head of the country's upper chamber , acting as interim president."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The European Commission filed on Friday a preliminary statement of objections to car manufacturing companies BMW , Daimler and VW, saying that the companies may have breached EU antitrust rules between 2006 to 2014 and colluded to restrict competition on the development of clean emissions technology for passenger cars.
""Companies can cooperate in many ways to improve the quality of their products. However, EU competition rules do not allow them to collude on exactly the opposite: not to improve their products, not to compete on quality. We are concerned that this is what happened in this case and that Daimler, VW and BMW may have broken EU competition rules. As a result , European consumers may have been denied the opportunity to buy cars with the best available technology . The three car manufacturers now have the opportunity to respond to our findings,"" Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner in charge of the competition policy, said, as quoted in a published statement.
According to the commission, the three manufacturers participated in a collusive scheme between 2006 to 2014 to limit the development and roll-out of emission cleaning technology for new diesel and gasoline passenger cars sold in the European Union .
In particular, the commission said that the companies had aimed at restricting competition on innovation for two emission cleaning technology systems � one that reduces harmful nitrogen oxides emissions from diesel cars and the other that reduces harmful emissions from gasoline cars � thereby denying consumers the opportunity to buy less polluting cars, despite the technology being available.
The commission opened an in-depth investigation into the possible collusion of the car manufacturers in September 2018 . The statement of objections is a formal step of the European Commission of presenting suspected violations of EU regulations to the companies involved in the case. The companies are given the opportunity to present their defense based on the preliminary findings. If, however, the commission finds the companies guilty of the accusations, it can adopt a decision prohibiting the conduct and imposing a fine of up to 10 percent of the company 's annual worldwide turnover."

In a message to the participants, the Moroccan King Mohammed VI commended ""the pioneering role"" played by the bank to promote economic and social development in Islamic countries.
He said that despite the achievements made by Islamic countries in terms of structural reforms in the financial and economic sectors, there is still a great deal to do in order to modernize their economies and achieve sustainable development goals as well as social justice and territorial cohesion.
In this respect, he called on the IDB Group to expand and strengthen its role, enhance its performance and develop programs to meet the growing demands of member countries as well as their peoples' aspirations.
The aim is to help member countries to adapt to global economic changes by relying more strongly on their own capacities, by harnessing their assets and by making the most of their geo-political location, be it in Asia , Africa or the Euro-Mediterranean region, said the king."

Munching on a child-sized bag of fruit snacks while crouching on the ground and affecting millennial “ uptalk ” — where every sentence sounds like an insecure question — it is hard to believe that the congresswoman’s monologue wasn’t a self-parody. However, Ocasio-Cortez was dead serious.
“For everyone who wants to make a joke about that, you may laugh but your grandkids will not,” she said.
Of course they won’t. Younger generations have been indoctrinated to treat climate change as an article of faith. AOC’s alarmist theories are accepted as indisputable fact, while any evidence pointing to a non-apocalyptic outcome for humankind is dismissed as propaganda.
Next, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that there are “a lot of people” who are ashamed of their grandparents’ past. She ‘splained:
You look back and you open history books on the civil rights movement and you see those folks who are protesting against the ability for African-Americans and black Americans to have the right to vote and they would hold up these bigoted signs. Just know that in the present day, there are a lot of people who hide the fact that their families and that their grandparents fought against principles of equal rights in the United States.

— Caleb Hull (@CalebJHull) April 4, 2019 Take a look, it’s in a book
Speaking of opening a history book, AOC would be wise to re-examine the 1964 Civil Rights Act before using it as a political device to shame her conservative critics. After all, it was Democrats who led a 74-day filibuster to avoid voting on the legislation, and when it finally came time to vote on the civil rights bill, 76 percent of the members of Congress to vote “no” were Democrats.
And to be clear, the parties did not magically “switch” in the aftermath of the Civil Rights Act. It wasn’t until 1994 that Republicans won a majority of congressional seats in the South, the region where most of the Democratic “no” votes originated. The end is near!
Finally, Ocasio-Cortez insisted that the grandchildren of “bigoted” climate change deniers will hold their ancestors in contempt for refusing to buy into global warming scare tactics. Because the internet.
“The internet documents everything and your grandchildren will not be able to hide the fact that you fought against acknowledging and taking bold action on climate change. And, people who are trying to mock and delay this moment. I mean, I just feel bad for you. I just pity you for your role in history right now,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
In fact, AOC’s frantic race against an imaginary climate change clock is worthy of mockery. Even the alarmist UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change disagrees with the 12-year deadline cited by the freshman congresswoman.
“For some reason, the media latched onto the 12 years, presumably because they thought that it helped to get across the message of how quickly we are approaching this and hence how urgently we need action. Unfortunately, this has led to a complete mischaracterization of what the report said,” said Andrea Dutton, a paleoclimate researcher at the University of Florida.
When confronted with the fact that AOC’s dire warnings are too extreme for even the extremists at the UN, Ocasio-Cortez spokesman Corbin Trent was patronizing and dismissive. “We can quibble about the phraseology, whether it’s existential or cataclysmic,” he said, adding, “We’re seeing lots of problems that are already impacting lives.”
The very essence of scientific inquiry requires that assumptions are challenged. This is precisely how a flat earth became round, and a geocentric model of the solar system became a heliocentric one. Yet, liberal politicians like AOC who masquerade as quasi-scientists take for granted that their millennial constituents will suspend disbelief and swallow their spurious climate predictions.
Besides, if climate deniers should be afraid of their internet legacy, pro-abortion activists should be downright terrified by the future. JOIN THE MOVEMENT. Add your best email address below to start receiving news alerts. Sign Up Privacy Policy Benjamin Baird

The Roscosmos chief, in his turn, informed Tokayev about the recent successful launch of the Progress MS-11 spacecraft from Baikonur to the International Space Station (ISS).
""We set a world record yesterday [on Thursday]. Previously, a transport ship or crew reached the ISS in a multi-turn scheme within two days. Yesterday the ship made two orbits around the Earth, and then it approached the station and docked within 3 hours and 21 minutes. It takes 3 hours to reach Baikonur from Moscow , and now it takes another 3 hours to reach the ISS from Baikonur. Now out task is to work out an even shorter scheme,"" Rogozin concluded.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) A decision on whether plants of US car giant Ford will be closed in Russia is expected to be made within one or two months, while South Korea 's Hyundai Motor Group is among the parties interested in launching production at the sites, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov told reporters on Friday.
""There are always interested parties for any product. There is need to work on this issue further, so as not to foreshadow the events. Let's give this time, let's say that our colleagues will agree within one or two months,"" the minister said.
Manturov positively answered a question on whether Hyundai was interested in the site of US-Russia Ford Sollers joint venture plant in the Russian town of Vsevolozhsk, at the same time noting that it was not the only site the company was interested in.
On March 27, Ford announced that it intended to halt production of passenger cars in Russia by July . The company said it planned to shut down plants in Naberezhnye Chelny, Vsevolozhsk and an engine plant in Elabuga. Russia 's automobile company Sollers will assume control of the joint venture if Ford leaves."

Paris, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : France has ruled out the repatriation of French jihadists and their families detained in Syria after the fall of the Islamic State group's ""caliphate"", Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Friday.
France and other European nations have been wrestling with how to handle the hundreds of foreign fighters, many of whom are being held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces which led the final push against IS.
French daily Liberation reported Friday that in early March the government had been ready to bring home around 250 men, women and children before abandoning the plan given public hostility to the repatriations.
The issue is extremely sensitive in France , where a deadly 2015 attack on the capital claimed by IS killed 130 people and set off a wave of other deadly assaults since then.
""It's logical that our services considered all hypotheses. This was one of the hypothesis they prepared,"" Castaner said at a press conference following a meeting of G7 interior ministers in Paris .
""No communal repatriation was under consideration to be carried out,"" he said, reiterating that France would nonetheless study bringing back children of jihadist fighters on a ""case-by-case basis"".
He denied Liberation's claim that France 's policy with regards to fighters in Syria was being dictated by public opinion.
Last month, French authorities for the first time brought home five orphaned children of French jihadists' from camps in northeast Syria .
According to the UN children's agency UNICEF, around 3,000 foreign children from 43 countries are housed at the Al-Hol camp in Syria alone, which has taken in most of the people fleeing IS's self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" in recent weeks.
Up to 1,700 French nationals are thought to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight with the jihadists between 2014 and 2018 , according to government figures. Around 300 are believed to have died in combat.
Kurdish officials have warned they do not have the resources to hold all the captured fighters indefinitely, and Washington is also urging its allies in the anti-IS coalition to take home their citizens.
But repatriation is a politically fraught issue, and governments fear they may not have enough evidence to convict IS members who claim they did not fight. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Despite the slump in production, however, the Anfavea said sales within the Brazilian domestic market increased 11.4 percent during the first three months of the year.
March statistics show, according to the employers of the Brazilian auto assemblers, the production of vehicles , vans, trucks, and buses reached only 240,500 units, representing a 10.1 percent decrease compared to the same month of last year, and a 6.4 percent drop compared to February .
Anfavea President Antonio Megale said at a press conference that lower production levels in March were due to the decrease in exports , the workers strike in the Ford factory and severe flooding in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Sao Paulo .
Additionally, Brazil exported 39,000 vehicles in March , representing a 3.7 percent drop compared to February , and a 42.2 percent drop compared to March of last year.
The decrease in vehicle production in the first quarter meant a loss of 987 jobs in March .
According to Anfavea, the Brazilian automotive sector employed 129,980 people at the end of March , 1,241 fewer than that of one year ago.
Between 2017 and 2018 , vehicle assemblers contributed a third of Brazil 's industrial growth and a quarter of the total growth of the gross domestic product, which showed the importance of the sector, Megale added."

At 11:13 a.m. local time (02:13 GMT), a Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) separated from the explorer around 500 meters (1,640 feet) above the asteroid's surface.
""The deployable camera, DCAM3, successfully photographed the ejector from when the SCI collided with Ryugu's surface. This is the world 's first collision experiment with an asteroid! In the future, we will examine the crater formed and how the ejector dispersed,"" the agency said via the official Twitter account of the JAXA Hayabusa2 asteroid explorer.
Hayabusa2 had evacuated from the area before the detonation was now operating normally, JAXA added.
The explorer is set to land on the asteroid in May to collect regolith samples from the crater that was supposed to form as a result of the explosion, which could potentially allow researchers to better understand the origins of life on Earth.
Hayabusa2, which is around 900 meters (half a mile) in diameter, was launched in 2014."

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 05th Apr, 2019) The UAE tops the list of countries in the middle East with the highest number of financial technology (fintech) start-ups to date , reveals Bloomberg Intelligence in its latest report.
The UAE with 67, was followed by Turkey at 44 and Jordan and Lebanon at 30 each.
Overall, the number of fintech start-ups in the region is forecast to expand from 96 in 2019 to 465 by 2020 . An Accenture analysis based on CBI Insights data, has predicted that investments in the fintech sector will jump to US$2.28 billion by 2022 from US$ 287 million in 2019 .
The figures were made public ahead of this year’s AIM Startup taking place in Dubai from 8th to 10th April in conjunction with the Annual Investment Meeting, AIM. This year’s theme of ""Harnessing Global Digitization to Empower Startups and SMEs"" will highlight the shift in consumer expectations against the backdrop of global adoption of digital technologies.
Dawood Al Shezawi, Chairman of the Organising Committee of AIM Startup, noted that the recent numbers supported other findings disclosing that not only start-ups have been flocking to the local and regional fintech sectors due to their promising growth prospects but that the UAE has remained a preferred destination for their operations as well regardless of their industries.

MANILA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The regional director for the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Western Pacific urged leaders in the region on Friday ""to take strong action and invest in Primary health care,"" saying it is ""the most affordable way"" to meet the health challenges facing the region.
""Robust primary health-care systems are the fairest, most affordable way to meet the health challenges we face today,"" Takeshi Kasai said in a statement ahead of the World Health Day, which falls on April 7 this year.
""On this World Health Day, let's get smart about health spending. I call on our region's leaders to take strong action and invest in primary health care. By doing so, we can create health for all ,"" Kasai said.
Kasai said that investment in primary health care is essential to provide access for the most vulnerable, build more equitable societies and help economies grow.
""Many people in WHO's Western Pacific region cannot access the health services they need,"" Kasai said. For some, he added services are too far away. ""Others do not know when or where to seek care. Others fear stigma and discrimination,"" he said.
Indeed, WHO said that many people simply do not have enough money . In some places in the region, WHO said one in five families spends more than 10 percent of its income on health care. Globally, the cost of health care pushes 100 million people a year into extreme poverty.
In the region's middle-income countries, nearly half of the cost of health care is paid out of pocket by patients, while health services in high-income countries are funded predominantly with public money .
While government spending on health is generally increasing, Kasai said funds are not always used in the most efficient way.
""Cost-effective services provided at the local level are key to controlling health spending,"" Kasai said. ""Those basic services - such as vaccinations, screenings and routine visits - often prevent pricey hospital visits or diseases that can lead to years of costly care or premature death,"" he said.
Kasai said committing health spending to primary health care not only saves money , it also helps countries develop. ""Healthier people miss work less and contribute more to national prosperity. They are also able to improve prospects for their families,"" he said.
""We need strong primary health care so we can detect, screen and treat people at the community level, as well as provide information and advice to communities to prevent and manage these diseases,"" Kasai said."

GENEVA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Researchers at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) said Thursday they have developed an infrared laser source that can detect pollution in the air or molecules in someone's breath which could be important for the environment and human health.
EPFL said in a press release that the compact system developed by its scientists is the size of a tiny suitcase and the research is detailed in an article published in Nature Communications.
The system has two parts that consist of a standard laser together with a photonic chip measuring a few millimeters across.
EPFL said the mid-infrared spectrum is especially useful for scientists because, at this wavelength range, light can detect particles that play an essential role in the environment and human health.
""This device sets a new benchmark for efficiency,"" says Davide Grassani, one of the authors of the published paper.
""This is the first time anyone has created a fully integrated spectroscopic laser source. It does away with the painstaking process of precisely aligning all the parts in a conventional laser system."" The scientists' breakthrough came after the team refined key aspects of the system's design, the waveguide geometry and material and the wavelength of the original laser source.
""Coming up with such a simple yet efficient and sturdy system involved a lot of design work,"" says Camille Bres, project coordinator and head of the Photonic Systems Laboratory, part of EPFL's school of Engineering.
The discovery paves the way for miniaturized mid-infrared technologies, she said.
""Once we've developed the system further, we could well see on-chip detectors that scientists can easily carry out into the field,"" said Bres."

DUBAI, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 05th Apr, 2019) The UAE Government’s new foreign direct investment, FDI, law passed in 2018 could accelerate FDI flows by up to 20 percent this year, from the eight percent average growth rate, as per the recent estimates of the Ministry of Economy.
The landmark law is predicted to further strengthen the already business-friendly climate in the country.
The law is going to take a prominent spot in the upcoming global FDI discussions at the Annual Investment Meeting 2019 in Dubai happening from 8th to 10th April , 2019 . High-level representatives from the country are expected to present the key provisions of the law before a global audience alongside other factors that make the Emirate a preferred FDI destination in the Arab region.
""Attracting international investments is critical to the sustainable development of any country, and in the case of the UAE , to its economic diversification strategy. Higher FDI results in more job opportunities and stronger international ties and can lead to the faster realisation of the objectives of both UAE Vision 2021 and UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030,"" Dawood Al Shezawi, CEO of Annual Investment Organising Committee, said.
Under the law, a powerful FDI unit will be established within the Ministry of Economy. It will propose FDI policies, identify priorities, formulate relevant programmes, and lead the implementation of the Cabinet-approved proposals. It will also oversee the establishment of a comprehensive database for UAE investments as well as assist in the registration and licensing of FDI projects, to name a few.
""As the country prepares for a post-oil future and continues to transition to a knowledge- and innovation-driven economy, the FDI law is going to be an influential factor that will drive the UAE’s socio-economic growth and development in the 21st century ,"" Al Shezawi said.
The outlook on the UAE’s development remains upbeat. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the country’s real gross domestic product, GDP, will experience a 3.7 percent increase this year compared with 2.9 percent in 2018 . Non-oil GDP is also forecasted by the Central Bank of the UAE to expand at 3.4 percent in 2019 compared to 2.6 percent in 2018 .
""At this year’s AIM, we are bringing the discussions deeper by looking into the impact of next-generation technologies such as Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain on investment and global trade. As such, the event’s theme, ‘Mapping the Future of FDI: Enriching World Economies through Digital Globalisation,’ will help direct our dialogues towards the adoption of a new way of thinking amidst these digital explosions. The enactment of the new FDI law comes at a time when disruptive technologies are being implemented left and right,"" he said in conclusion."

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The violators in the Federal capital have been mocking the ban imposed on angling in Rawal Dam where as the fisheries department claimed action taken against the people involved in the activity.
Talking to APP, Director Fisheries Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Ghoufran Shehzad said, ""Fishing is ban in Rawal Dam whereas the reservoir sprawls over a huge area which is not possible to monitor all around."" ""Our teams have been regularly taking action against the violators. We issue challan and confiscate the fishing roads, hooks, strings and fishing nets,"" he added.
He claimed that at present fishing contract was issued to a private contractor for three years to carry out fishing in the dam .
Asif, a professional fish hunter informed that currently fishing was carried out in the dam by a contractor without any permission while prior to this the former contractor won the contract through proper bidding for two years in Dec, 2016 which had expired in Dec, 2018 .
""At present, the anglers operating in the Rawal Dam have no authority to catch fish. It is incomprehensible to know that authorized contractor has not been renewed the contract to start fishing in the dam .

"Federal Reserve Board Pick Stephen Moore Found In Contempt Of Court Over $300,000 In Unpaid Child Support And… - Vox.com",www.vox.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/6/18298063/trump-fed-reserve-stephen-moore-contempt-ex-wife,"Flipboard CNN One of President Donald Trump’s new picks to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, Trumponomics author Stephen Moore, was found to be in contempt of court in 2012 for failing to pay more than $300,000 in alimony and child support. Court filings recently unearthed by The Guardian’s Jon Swain and David Smith show Moore repeatedly failed to make payments that were part of a 2011 divorce settlement with his ex-wife, Allison Moore. Not only was Moore found in contempt of court, but his failure to comply with the terms of his settlement even prompted a judge to order the sale of his house to satisfy his debts. According to court records, several police officers accompanied relators and a locksmith to to Moore’s home in May 2013 to change the locks and prepare the property for buyers. Only after the court-sanctioned break-in did Moore pay roughly two-thirds of what he owed his ex-wife, court filings show. Allison Moore told the court the $217,000 payment was enough, and stepped in to halt the house re-sale. Moore is one of two controversial presidential picks to fill open seats on the Federal Reserve Board (Trump’s other nominee is former Republican presidential candidate and pizza company executive, Herman Cain ). An avowed Trump loyalist, Moore is a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who frequently provides economic commentary to media outlets. Allison Moore tried last week to shield the court documents from public view under a court seal, but several news outlets appealed to have them released. In a statement released this week, Moore said he and his former wife settled their divorce “amicably many years ago and we remain on friendly terms to this day.” Moore’s nomination process isn’t going so smoothly It’s only been a little over two weeks since Trump first nominated Moore to the Federal Reserve Board, and already he’s seen several waves of unflattering headlines. Last week The Guardian broke news on Moore’s financial woes, finding that he still owes more than $75,000 in taxes and penalties to the Internal Revenue Service. The tax lien reportedly stems from a mistake in his 2014 tax filing. Moore said he has been working to resolve the issue with the IRS, in part by overpaying his taxes in recent years by “tens of thousands of dollars.” The unflattering news coverage has cast a shadow over Moore’s nomination, which some believe was an impulsive decision by Trump that gave little thought to Moore’s qualifications. As Vox’s Aaron Rupar explained last month, “Moore is better-known for his fierce loyalty to Trump than for his brilliant economic intellect.” Rupar has a rundown of the pundits more infamous moments: Moore, who was a CNN contributor from 2017 until news broke of his nomination by Trump, didn’t just go on TV to talk about economics. He also defended now-failed US Senate candidate Roy Moore when he was accused of molesting a teenage girl, arguing that the Democrat running against him (now-Sen. Doug Jones) was just as bad because he supported abortion rights. Moore also went viral for a cringeworthy interview on Don Lemon’s CNN show, in which he tried to slut-shame Stormy Daniels . In addition, he is a climate change denier who once said on CNN that scientists lie about climate science to get “ really, really, really rich .” It’s still unclear whether Moore’s history, controversial views and rocky vetting process will do anything to derail his nomination. Asked by CNBC whether he felt his divorce settlement would jeopardize his chances of claiming a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, Moore had a one-word answer: “No.”"

EPA’s participation enable the Emirati publishing houses to take part in regional and global cultural events, with aims to promote their titles and expand their strategic relations with international publishers.
Rashid Al Kous, Executive Director of EPA, said, ""At EPA, we are keen to elevate the publishing sector in general and particularly children’s books, which are instrumental in igniting imagination and building the capabilities of young people. These books contribute to raising children’s cultural awareness, and our dedication towards the cause gets reflected by our participation in the Bologna Children's Book Fair.""
He further said, ""Recent studies indicate that the majority of children in the UAE prefer to read Arabic books. However, there is a lack of variety in topics and online Arabic content, which drives children to read books in English and other foreign languages. Consequently, the growing consumption of content in foreign languages has a negative impact on their Arabic skills. This is the main reason that drives us to dedicate our efforts in supporting publishers of Arabic children’s books.""
During the Bologna Children's Book Fair, the EPA met with a host of international cultural experts, including Beijing International Book Fair representatives to discuss EPA’s participation in the forthcoming edition. Meetings with Italian, Brazilian and Spanish publishers were also held to explore mutual cooperation with EPA’s affiliate members.

May also told EU Council president Donald Tusk in a formal letter that Britain would start preparing for its participation in European Parliament elections in case it is still a member of the bloc when they begin on May 23.
- Race against clock - The embattled premier is racing against the clock in a desperate bid to get her deal approved in time for an EU leaders' summit in Brussels on Wednesday, when a formal decision on any extension will be made.
She is also holding a third day of talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a way to avert a messy no-deal divorce .
The Brexit current deadline is April 12, which has already been pushed back once from March 29.
""The idea of a longer delay was something of a relief to sterling, given that currently the UK is set to leave the EU next Friday,"" noted Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
In stock market deals, London and Paris each added 0.2 percent on value, while Frankfurt ran out of steam heading into the weekend.
Asian equity indices mostly rose in holiday-thinned trade on hopes that China and the United States will hammer out a trade deal after both sides sounded notes of optimism.
With top negotiators from the world 's top two economies huddled down in Washington for three days of talks, there has been a growing sense they are close to an agreement to end a stand-off that battered global equities last year.
- 'Looking good' for talks - US President Donald Trump added to the sense of hope on Thursday when he said the two sides were nearing a successful conclusion.
""We will probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that,"" he told reporters after a meeting with Beijing 's top trade envoy and Vice Premier Liu He.
""It's looking very good."" Later Liu said they had ""reached a new consensus on important issues"", according to China 's Xinhua. The news agency also reported that President Xi Jinping had called for the ""early conclusion of negotiations"".
Both camps have been cautiously optimistic for months, but the last mile is proving to be the hardest as they tussle over whether and when Washington should remove the painful tariffs it imposed on Chinese goods last year.
Dealers are meanwhile awaiting crucial US non-farm payrolls data for an idea about the state of the world 's top economy.

Paris, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : France considers it ""premature"" to discuss an additional delay to Britain's exit from the European Union , demanding that London present ""a clear plan"" that would justify pushing Brexit back again, a French presidency source said Friday.
France had ""taken note"" of Britain's formal request Friday for an extension to June 30, the source said, adding: ""We are waiting for a credible plan between now and the (EU) summit on April 10, when we will study the request."" ""A delay is a tool, but not a solution in itself,"" the source said.
In a letter, British Prime Minister Theresa May told EU Council president Donald Tusk that she wanted to ensure her country left the bloc in an ""orderly way"", as she fights to have the current exit deal approved by parliament .
The EU has already agreed to move back the original March 29 deadline to April 12 to give May more time to win backing from MPs for a deal. British lawmakers have already rejected the deal she negotiated with the EU three times.
Earlier Friday, an EU official said Tusk would suggest to member states that they offer Britain a flexible 12-month delay to Brexit , removing some of the pressure on May to ram through a deal by next Wednesday's summit meeting.
But a French diplomatic source appeared to pour cold water on that idea as well, calling ""the rumours about such an extension a clumsy trial balloon."""

TASHKENT, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Uzbekistan's economic outlook remains positive, with growth projected at 5.3 percent in 2019 and around 6 percent by 2021, according to the World Bank 's Economic Update for Europe and Central Asia , released Friday.
"" Market reforms are expected to address production bottlenecks and liberalize high-potential growth sectors of the (Uzbek) economy, such as horticulture, tourism, food processing, textile , and chemicals,"" the report said.
""These will be supported by a significant reduction in 2019 of the business tax burden,"" it said.
Inflationary pressures will persist in 2019-2020 due to further price reforms and wage increases, but the effects are expected to moderate by 2021, according to the report.
Steady economic growth and remittance income are expected to contribute to a modest pace of poverty reduction, the report said, adding that the changes in government policies may further expand support programs to the poor and vulnerable households and reduce poverty.
However, the bank warned of the Uzbek government 's reliance on a state-dominated economic model.
Uzbekistan has a population of over 33 million . Despite reforms carried out since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev came to power in 2016 , the country's economy still remains reliant on a state-dominated economic model and traditional trading partners, like Russia , facing heightened external risks over the medium term, World Bank experts said.
While market reforms have begun to address these issues, the next phase of reforms aims to tackle more complex issues, such as the state-owned enterprises and the financial sector, agricultural reforms, and the privatization of non-agricultural land, the report said.
Meanwhile, the bank said in the update report that economic growth in Europe and the Central Asia region slowed to 3.1 percent in 2018 , and is projected to decline to 2.1 percent in 2019 , amid slowing global growth and uncertain prospects."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Russia is ready to respond to the United States 's draft legislation on the former's alleged meddling in Venezuela 's affairs with similar measures, Russian Ambassador in Caracas Vladimir Zaemsky said on Friday.
In late March , the US House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill, dubbed the Russian-Venezuelan Threat Mitigation Act, that targeted Russia 's alleged influence in the Latin American nation. The document insisted that Russia had an ""increased presence in the Western Hemisphere,"" which constituted a major concern for the United States and its allies in the region. The bill still has to be approved by the Senate and then by President Donald Trump .
""If the United States intends to take some measures in accordance with the above-mentioned [draft] legislation, then [Russia], acting on the basis of reciprocity, will have to prepare a tit-for-tat response. These unilateral aggressive steps will not remain without consequences,"" Zaemsky told the Russian Izvestia newspaper.
The political crisis in Venezuela recently entered its third month. The turmoil began in January , when US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself Venezuela 's interim president. Maduro, supported by China and Russia , among others, accused Guaido of plotting to overthrow him with backing from Washington .
In March , a group of Russian military personnel arrived in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas to take part in talks on defense cooperation with officials. During the consultations, Russia repeatedly stressed that their presence was fully legitimate and in accordance with the defense agreement between Moscow and Caracas . Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov later said that their servicemen were helping to carry out maintenance on previously supplied Russian military equipment."

Nice, France, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Britain's richest man , Jim Ratcliffe, wants to further expand his sport network by buying French Ligue 1 club Nice after snapping up cycling 's Team Sky last month, his brother revealed to French media on Friday.
Robert Ratcliffe confirmed to the newspaper Nice-Matin that his sibling, the boss of petrochemical giant Ineos, wants to purchase the club following reports of negotiations on Thursday.
""We do not want to buy a club where we have to rebuild everything. There is a magnificent stadium and a brand new training centre,"" said Robert Ratcliffe.
He insisted that his brother, a Manchester United fan, ""wants to invest in football "" and ""Ligue 1 has great players like Mbappe and Neymar, some of the best in the world ."" However he said that after initially showing interest in the sale , Nice 's Chinese-American owner Chien Lee pulled away from the offer, reportedly in the region of 100 million Euros ($112.3 million ).
""He told me he was open to selling . .. but 24 hours later, we were informed that he did not want to receive any more offers,"" Robert Ratcliffe continued.
Brexit-backing billionaire Ratcliffe, 66, has assets worth an estimated 21 billion ($27.8 billion , 24.5 billion euros), placing him top of the 2018 Sunday Times rich list.
He founded Ineos in 1998 and the company went on to become an industrial juggernaut in a country increasingly dominated by the service sector.
The group now has annual sales of $60 billion and employs over 18,000 people in 24 countries.
As well as buying Team Sky last month, Ratcliffe's group also own Swiss football club Lausanne Sport. Last year they also established Ineos Team UK , which is taking part in the 2021 America's Cup.
Nice, coached by former France and Arsenal star Patrick Vieira, are currently eighth in Ligue 1 with eight games remaining this season.

Bucharest, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Eurozone finance ministers released long delayed debt relief to Greece on Friday, saying the government had implemented reforms promised during the massive bailout that ended last year.
Greece exited its third and final international bailout in August , a turning point in its progress out of the catastrophe that engulfed the country during the debt crisis.
But the Greek government had failed to complete politically sensitive reforms such as changes to housing foreclosure rules that spooked families struggling with mortgages on their homes.
"" All in all , Greece has done what was necessary to respect its commitments. The decision gives a new, very strong signal to the markets ,"" said EU Economics Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici after talks with ministers in Bucharest .
In a statement, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers accepted the view that "" Greece has taken the necessary actions to achieve all specific reform commitments. "" This meant that the ""conditions are in place"" to unlock debt relief measures worth 970 million euros, the statement said.
The debt relief measures are mainly profits made by the European Central Bank (ECB) and other EU central banks on Greek government bonds during the bailout period.
The decision comes as hopes rise that Greece has turned the economic corner. Last month Athens issued a 10-year bond , the first major borrowing effort since its debt crisis.
The country hopes to raise a total of around nine billion Euros in the markets this year to boost investor confidence in the Greek economy.
Growth is expected to reach 2.4 percent in 2019 after an estimated 2.1 percent in 2018 , according to the latest International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) projections."

Reema Khan took to Instagram to share her experience of the soulful journey.
She thanked Allah or the opportunity to visit Al-Aqsa Mosque last month and pray inside the Dome of the Rock –from where our last Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) ascended to heaven on Shab-e-Mairaj.
She said she also prayed at the place where before the ascension , Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) led the prayer which was followed by 124,000 prophets.
Narrating the incident of Miraj, Reema said we cannot but thank God-Almighty for this “Saadat”.
“Jerusalem is not only very holy to us – Muslims , but also is a very holy place for the monotheist religions of the world . Unlike, what we see in pictures and the calendars -the Golden Dome which is used as an emblem of whenever Jerusalem or Al Aqsa Mosque is mentioned, are in fact two separate structures standing across from each other and within the outer walls of the huge compound,” she wrote.
