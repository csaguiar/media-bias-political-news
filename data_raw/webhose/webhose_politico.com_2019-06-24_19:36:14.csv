"Beto O'Rourke proposes immigration overhaul, path to citizenship",www.politico.com,DAVID SIDERS,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/beto-orourke-immigration-overhaul-1346419,"Beto O’Rourke on Wednesday proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s immigration system, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants and a $5 billion investment in Central America.
In his proposal, O’Rourke said he would take executive action on his first day in office to end family separations at the border, rescind travel bans, reunite families and “remove the fear of deportation” for younger immigrants known as Dreamers and people with temporary protected status.
The plan formalizes and builds on proposals O’Rourke has made while campaigning — and in the months before he entered the presidential race, when the former Texas congressman placed immigration at the center of his political agenda. Early on, however, he was criticized for putting few specifics behind his immigration ideas.
If elected, O’Rourke pledged to halt work on the U.S.-Mexico border wall and require detention only for people with criminal backgrounds who “represent a danger to our communities.” He said he would increase immigration court staff and deploy as many as 2,000 lawyers to the border, while hiring and assigning additional U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees to land crossings along the border.
Like other Democrats, O’Rourke said he would work with Congress to enact legislation creating a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. He said he would make naturalization easier by making the process free for anyone who meets the requirements for citizenship. And he proposed raising visa caps and establishing a new visa category, allowing communities and congregations to sponsor visas.
A native of the border city of El Paso, Texas, O’Rourke has long called on the United States to shift its foreign policy focus to the Western Hemisphere.
He said Wednesday that he would invest $5 billion in Central America — primarily through nongovernmental organizations, community groups, congregations and public-private partnerships — “to fight violence and poverty while bolstering our shared security and prosperity.”
“This innovative plan overcomes a generation of inaction to finally rewrite our immigration laws in our own image — reflecting our values, the reality of the border, the best interests of our communities, and the longstanding traditions of a country comprised of families from the world over,” O’Rourke said in a prepared statement."

TopLine THE DEBATE STAGE — The DNC announced how candidates will qualify for the third and fourth round of presidential primary debates in September and October, representing a step up from the qualifications for the first and second debates in June and July.
The third debate will be hosted by ABC News and Univision on Sept. 12, with the potential for a second night on Sept. 13. To qualify, candidates must pass both polling and donor thresholds — as opposed to the early debates, where candidates only needed to pass one threshold to qualify (here’s more from Michael Calderone and me ).
Candidates now must receive 2 percent in four qualifying polls (for the first debates, they had to receive one percent in three polls). The list of organizations sponsoring the polls remains the same, minus the Las Vegas Review Journal (which hasn’t commissioned a poll in cycles) and Reuters (which ran several polls whose methodology vexed poll trackers, like yours truly). For the September ABC debate, polls must be released between June 28-August 28 (the deadline for October polls will be released later). In addition, there is a rule that explicitly rules out open-ended polling questions from counting towards qualifying.
The grassroots fundraising threshold has similarly increased. Candidates now must receive donations from 130,000 unique donors by 11:59 p.m. on August 28 (that’s up from 65,000 for the first and second debate) for the September debate, with at least 400 unique donors in at least 20 states. Donors are cumulative from the beginning of the year.
The polling increase is a modest one but will likely winnow the field. If these new qualifications were applied to early primary polling (to be clear, polls taken before the first Democratic debates won’t count), only eight candidates would cross that threshold: Joe Biden, Cory Booker , Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris , Amy Klobuchar , Beto O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren . And while campaigns have been fairly tight-lipped about the number of individual donors they have, four have already publicly said they’ve hit at least 130,000 donors: Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders and Warren (based off first-day hauls alone, O’Rourke and Biden are likely close, if they haven’t exceeded 130,000 already).
Presidential Big Board WHY I’M RUNNING — Harris is laying out her one-sentence rationale for wanting to be president. “Harris, who has now begun fleshing out her policy agenda, told POLITICO in an interview that she’s looking to offer something tangible to voters,” POLITICO’s Chris Cadelago reported. “She’s pitching herself as the kitchen-table realist of the field, the candidate who eschews lofty speeches and understands the day-to-day financial struggles of regular Americans and, bottom line, wants to put more money in their pockets.”
WEEKEND GETAWAY — Democratic presidential hopefuls will gather this weekend for the California Democratic Party’s annual convention in San Francisco. Fourteen candidates will attend the convention, NPR’s Scott Detrow reported, “the latest sign that California's days of bringing up the rear of the presidential primary calendar are long gone.”
POLICY TIME — Biden released a wide-ranging K-12 and early education plan, his first major policy proposal. POLITICO’s Nicole Gaudiano has all the details.
— Rep. Seth Moulton introduced a plan to expand military mental health services, while also detailing his own battle with PTSD. “Moulton said he hoped that opening up about his own experience would help ease the stigma that veterans and nonveterans alike feel when confronted with mental illness,” POLITICO’s Alex Thompson reported. “I just want people to know they’re not alone,” Moulton told Alex in an interview.
OLD ACQUAINTANCES — Biden had worked with and praised former Democratic Sen. John Stennis, who was a segregationist, in the 1980s, CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, Nathan McDermott and Paul LeBlanc wrote. Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesman, said “Joe Biden's record shows that advancing civil rights and uprooting systemic racism have been defining causes of his entire life,” in response to the story.
OUCH — Even some of the earliest supporters of New York City Bill de Blasio are not totally on board with his presidential run. The New York Times’ J. David Goodman talked to big donors to his federal PAC (set up before his presidential bid) and found that dozens of interviews “provided a snapshot of his lukewarm support for president — even from a self-selected group of people willing to spend thousands of dollars to help the New York City mayor in his federal efforts.”
PRESIDENTIAL POLLS — This week's update from Morning Consult's 2020 Democratic primary tracking poll (May 20-26, 16,368 Democratic voters, +/- 1 percentage point): Biden, 38 percent (-1 from last week); Sanders, 20 percent (+1); Warren, 9 percent (+1); Harris, 7 percent (-1); Buttigieg, 7 percent (+1); O'Rourke, 4 percent (-1); Booker, 3 percent (unchanged).
NEW
Down the Ballot PRIMARY PROBLEMS — Amash was greeted by a mostly-friendly audience in his first town hall since calling for President Donald Trump's impeachment. ""Attendees in the mostly-friendly audience gave Amash several standing ovations and heaps of praise for his solo rebellion against Trump,"" POLITICO's Melanie Zanona reported from the packed town hall in Grand Rapids, Mich. Amash already has two primary challengers, but he ""is swatting down concerns about the potential impacts on his political future, telling the crowd he 'has a duty to keep the president in check.'""
Several audience members did criticize Amash and one of his primary challengers, state Rep. Jim Lower, said his support of Trump will be central to his campaign: ""It will probably be the number one issue, whether I wanted it to or not.”
— Washington Gov. Jay Inslee endorsed Democrat Marie Newsman’s primary bid against Rep. Dan Lipinski in IL-03. “We need a new national law to codify Roe and protect it from Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court,” he tweeted . “That’s why I’m endorsing Marie Newman for Congress.”
THE HOUSE MAP — Nicole Rodden is the latest Republican to announce she’ll challenge Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath in GA-06, per The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Tamar Hallerman .
— Democrat Rob Apodaca, who formerly worked in the Obama administration, was the latest Democrat to announce a bid for the open-seat NM-03 race.
— Some potential challengers to freshman Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in VA-07, per The Washington Post’s Jenna Portnoy : state lawmakers Nick Freitas (whom the Club for Growth is trying to recruit), John McGuire and Bryce Reeves. Republican Tina Ramirez has already said she’s running.
FIRST IN SCORE — ENDORSEMENT CORNER — EMILY’s List is endorsing Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan in IL-13, who is running again against Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) after losing to him by less than a point in 2018. “Davis continuously puts his party’s dangerous agenda — from their bill to strip health care from millions of hardworking Americans to their movement to defund Planned Parenthood — ahead of the needs of the working families,” EMILY’s List president Stephanie Schriock said in a statement, previewing the likely line of attack against Davis.
— Americans for Prosperity Action is backing Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin. Andrew McNeill, the group’s senior adviser, wrote a (sponsored) op-ed for Insider Louisville praising Bevin’s record as governor.
PARTY INFIGHTING — New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who will head the Democratic Governors Association come January, wouldn’t say in an interview with the New Jersey Globe’s Nikita Biryukov if he’d support Democrats who either oppose abortion rights or gun control (Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards identifies as “pro-life”). “It’s a question that I’ve not gotten, and I’m the incoming chair but not yet the chair, and I think the DGA, like a lot of institutions, makes an institutional selection as opposed to a particular personal preference, but folks have no question where I am on this issue,” Murphy said.
MOORE PROBLEMS — Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne , who is running for Senate against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama, is sounding the alarm that Roy Moore could run again. “People who I believe know what they’re talking about say that Judge Moore intends to announce his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in June,” Byrne said in an interview with The Hill’s Scott Wong . In a warning shot from Trumpworld, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted “it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.”
RUN IT AGAIN — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is planning on running for a fourth term. “I plan to run for a fourth term,” he told WAMC’s Alan Chartock on Tuesday. “I would like to do it for as long as the people of the state of New York believe I am a positive.”
— Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) is “preparing to enter the 2020 race for governor,” MTN News’ Mark Thorsell reported.
STAFFING UP — ACRONYM, the progressive digital organization, hired Shannon Kowalczyk as chief marketing officer, Kyle Tharp as comms director and Brenna Parker as social media manager.
CODA — Quote: OF THE DAY: “It'll be a little like Hollywood Squares ... but I just feel like voters are going to watch this thing with fresh eyes.” — Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) on the upcoming Democratic presidential primary debates to NBC News .

Jeffries calls McConnell 'shameless' for saying he'd confirm a justice in 2020,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/jeffries-mcconnell-supreme-court-2020-1346418," ripped into Mitch McConnell after the Senate majority leader said he would fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court if a seat were to open up during next year’s presidential election.
Democrats have expressed outrage at McConnell’s statement because he prevented then-President Barack Obama’s pick for the high court from even receiving a confirmation hearing in 2016. Though McConnell has said in the past that his obstruction stemmed in part from the fact that the White House and Senate were controlled by opposite political parties — a fact that would not be the case if there were an open seat next year — his revelation has opened old wounds for Democrats.
In an interview on CNN’s “New Day” on Wednesday, Jeffries was asked whether the Supreme Court would be a strong enough motivator for the Democratic electorate next year, when the party faces an uphill climb to win back control of the Senate, and the Brooklyn Democrat laid into McConnell.
“I think Mitch McConnell is Exhibit A as to why what happens in November of 2020 with respect to the Senate matters,” he said. “He’s a shameless individual — and this does not just simply apply to his behavior as it relates to stealing a Supreme Court seat that Barack Obama had the right to present to the American people.”
The ideological makeup of the Supreme Court — which currently skews slightly to the right — has taken an outsize role in the Democratic presidential primary, with some hopefuls so incensed by McConnell’s 2016 “stealing” of a seat that some have backed expanding the court altogether. But the issue has really come to the forefront in recent weeks after a handful of states passed a flurry of laws placing restrictions on abortion, leading to concerns about whether the current court would uphold abortion rights enshrined under Roe v. Wade .
There have also long been rumors that conservative Justice Clarence Thomas could retire while there is a Republican president. Meanwhile, liberals have expressed worries about the health of 86-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Jeffries also accused McConnell, who has rejected almost every major piece of legislation sent over by the Democratic House, of overseeing a “legislative graveyard,” asserting that the majority leader “is negligent in doing the business of the American people.”
Given those factors, Jeffries concluded, he suggested Democrats liked their chances. “We think that the Supreme Court issue should be a voting issue in November of 2020, and his failure to act on the priorities of the American people that we have been working on as House Democrats should be a voting issue in 2020.”"
Jaime Harrison launches campaign against Lindsey Graham in South Carolina,www.politico.com,JAMES ARKIN,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/lindsey-graham-jaime-harrison-south-carolina-3330191,"Democrat Jaime Harrison launched his campaign for Senate in South Carolina Wednesday by targeting GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham for his shift to becoming a major supporter of President Donald Trump.
Harrison, the former chairman of the state party, faces a significant uphill battle in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat statewide since 2006. In a campaign launch video , Harrison attacked Graham by replaying old clips of him calling Trump ""crazy"" and a ""kook"" during the 2016 campaign, followed by clips of Graham praising Trump, including saying the president ""deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, and then some.""
Story Continued Below
""Here's a guy that will say anything to stay in office,"" Harrison said. ""Lindsey Graham can't lead us in any direction because he traded his moral compass for petty political gain. Lindsey Graham, he's forgotten about the people he represents: you.""
Harrison has been expected to challenge Graham since launching an exploratory campaign for the seat in February. He met with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that month, and Harrison told POLITICO at the time that Schumer told him, ""You're my guy."" As of March 31, Harrison had already banked $200,000 for the race, though it's only a small fraction of the $4.6 million Graham had on hand at the end of March.
Harrison is a member of the Democratic National Committee and ran for chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2017 before dropping out and endorsing the eventual winner, Tom Perez.
In the launch video, Harrison also told his own story about being raised by his grandparents, getting a scholarship to Yale and attending law school at Georgetown, before returning home to South Carolina.
""I remember a time when senators helped the people they represent. I want to bring the spirit of helping back,"" Harrison said.
Graham will be difficult to unseat. The state hasn’t elected a Democrat to the Senate in more than two decades. Graham beat back multiple primary challengers in 2014 before cruising to reelection by double digits in the general election. South Carolina voted for Trump by 14 percentage points.
Since his criticism of Trump in 2016 — both as a rival for the presidential nomination and after — Graham has become a close ally, backing the president on his emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border and saying the Mueller report showed no obstruction and is ""over."""
Soybean planting delays pile up,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2019/05/29/soybean-planting-delays-pile-up-635912,"Editor's Note: This edition of Morning Agriculture is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Agriculture subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here .

— Europe’s top trade official is warning EU countries to brace for U.S. tariffs on goods including cheese, wine and olive oil, expected as soon as late July.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY, MAY 29! Welcome to Morning Ag, where we never knew animals from ants to elephants were so involved in coffee production. Send tips to SOYBEAN PLANTING DELAYS ARE PILING UP: Wet weather has bogged down crop planting in the Midwest, leaving corn and soybean growers way behind their usual pace. Just 29 percent of the projected soybean crop has been planted in the top soy producing states, compared to 74 percent by this point last year, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service said Tuesday in its latest crop progress report .
Top soybean states: In Illinois, 14 percent of soybeans have been planted, down from 89 percent last year. Iowa has planted 32 percent of its crop, compared to 78 percent last year. Indiana, Missouri and Ohio are also significantly lagging last year’s soybean planting pace.
Corn planting is seriously delayed, too, though more than half the crop has now been planted in the top corn producing states. In Illinois, just 35 percent has been planted, compared to 99 percent planted last year. Indiana, Ohio and South Dakota are similarly behind schedule. Successful Farming has more details .
CANADA KICKING OFF USMCA RATIFICATION PROCESS: The Canadian government intends to introduce legislation this afternoon to implement the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, write our Pro Canada colleagues.
Trial run: The bill is virtually identical to a motion that the House of Commons easily passed on Tuesday. The motion, seen as a proxy for an eventual USMCA vote, garnered strong support from the chamber’s two largest parties, the Conservatives and the governing Liberal Party.
What’s next: Canadian officials say they’ll be watching what happens in Congress, where Democrats are still haggling with the Trump administration over provisions related to pharmaceuticals, labor and the environment.
— One option for Ottawa is to wait until the U.S. resolves those disputes and then amend the Canadian legislation to reflect any changes made in Washington.
— Canada’s parliament adjourns in a few weeks for federal elections in October, so any votes beyond June would require a rare emergency summer session.
Back in the Beltway: Agriculture wrote an op-ed this week defending the trade deal, in response to a recent University of Georgia study that found USMCA would pose a “high risk of substantial harm” to U.S. fruit and vegetable growers, which would not be protected from continued competition from Mexico.
“It’s important to note we didn’t get all the improvements we wanted for seasonal fruits and vegetables,” Perdue wrote in the Macon Telegraph and the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. But he said USMCA “isn’t a step backward.”
EUROPE BRACING FOR TRUMP’S TARIFFS: EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström warned trade ministers in Brussels this week that they should prepare for a wave of tariffs on European goods from Dutch cheeses to French wine and Spanish olive oil, POLITICO Europe reports .
Washington last month said it wants to slap tariffs on up to $21 billion in European goods, a move that would need to be confirmed by the WTO. An EU diplomat who attended the briefing with Malmström said those duties would likely come by the end of July or early August — though the WTO might force the U.S. to target a smaller range of exports than requested.
U.S.-EU trade relations are already tense, due to Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs and his threat to impose hefty auto duties. The two sides also can’t agree on whether agriculture should be part of bilateral trade talks.
HOW MEXICO’S RETALIATORY TARIFFS HIT AG: Pro DataPoint’s Taylor Miller Thomas details here the impact of Mexico’s retaliatory tariffs on exports of American farm goods. The Trump administration recently reached a deal with Mexico and Canada to lift those duties in exchange for removing Trump’s tariffs on their steel and aluminum.

Biden unveils K-12 education platform,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-education/2019/05/29/biden-unveils-k-12-education-platform-441502,"With help from Nicole Gaudiano Editor's
Quick Fix Joe Biden rolled out his K-12 and early childhood education plan. It calls for nearly tripling Title I funding to boost teacher salaries and pay for expanded access to preschool.
— The Education Department released Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’ latest financial disclosure. She and her husband reported at least $45 million of income last year.
— What the Education Department’s Work-Study experiment might mean for efforts to reform the program.
IT’S WEDNESDAY, MAY 29. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION. Drop me a line with your tips and feedback: mstratford@politico.com or @ mstratford
Driving the Day BIDEN OUTLINES K-12 EDUCATION GOALS: The Democratic presidential candidate on Tuesday unveiled a wide-ranging K-12 and early education plan , targeted to increasing teacher pay, providing universal pre-K and leveling the playing field between rich and poor school districts.
— The former vice president aims to close a massive funding gap between majority white and non-white school districts by spending $45 billion on federal grants to low-income districts under the Title I program — nearly triple the current level. The additional money would first be used to give teachers in low-income districts “competitive” pay, provide 3- and 4-year-olds with access to preschool and ensure districts put in place “rigorous coursework across all their schools, not just a few.”
— After those conditions are met, school districts would then be allowed to use the funds to meet other local priorities. The plan also says Biden would work with states to provide universal pre-kindergarten for all 3- and 4-year-olds.
— Biden, considered the Democratic field’s front-runner , rolled out his plan in Houston during a town hall meeting that’s part of an elaborate teachers union endorsement process led by the American Federation of Teachers. He was joined by his wife, Jill Biden, who has spent more than three decades in education.
Around the Agencies DEVOS REPORTS AT LEAST $45M OF INCOME FOR 2018: The education secretary and her husband received at least $45 million in income in 2018, according to annual financial disclosure forms filed with the Education Department.
— DeVos, one of the wealthiest members of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet, reported bringing in money from a wide range of investments that were outlined in a financial report that spans more than 70 pages. The Education Department provided a copy in response to a POLITICO request last week.
— DeVos filed the disclosure a day before the annual May 15 deadline for government officials to report on their finances. The report, which covers the 2018 calendar year, has not yet been certified by ethics officials from the Education Department or the Office of Government Ethics.
— Last year, it took several months for government ethics officials to certify DeVos’ financial report. DeVos and her husband, Dick DeVos, reported income of at least $59.4 million for 2017. During her Senate confirmation process, DeVos agreed to divest from more than 100 assets that were identified as possible conflicts of interest.
— DeVos told the Education Department’s ethics office in May 2017 that she had completed those divestments and fulfilled her ethics agreement, according to correspondence previously released under the Freedom of Information Act. More here .
COULD A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLAN HELP CONGRESS FIX WORK-STUDY? The Trump administration wants to let some colleges use more federal money to help students get jobs and internships that actually connect to their intended careers, instead of toiling away in the campus library or calling alumni, begging for donations.
— Experts and advocates say it's a laudable goal. But the administration's plan to inject more flexibility into the Federal Work-Study program is seen as tinkering around the edges of a popular, longstanding program that's widely believed to be fundamentally broken — and one that Congress will have to repair, potentially through a widely anticipated overhaul of the Higher Education Act.
— Because of decades-old models, much of the money for the program — meant to help students work their way through school — goes to wealthy private schools in the Northeast. More than 20 percent of private four-year students get work-study aid, compared with just 5 percent of students at public universities. An even smaller share of community college students qualify. Benjamin Wermund has more here .
On the Hill DEMOCRATS PLAN HEARING ON TRUMP ROLLBACK OF SCHOOL LUNCH STANDARDS: House Democrats are planning a hearing next week on the Trump administration’s rollback of nutritional standards in school lunches and its proposal to tighten work requirements on low-income Americans who use food stamps.
— The House Education and Labor civil rights subcommittee scheduled an oversight hearing at 10:15 a.m. on June 4 with Brandon Lipps, the administrator of USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service. More here .
In the Courts SCOTUS WIN FOR RIGHTS OF TRANSGENDER STUDENTS IN SCHOOLS: The Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear a case challenging a Pennsylvania school district’s policy allowing transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice. The conservative Alliance Defending Freedom represented a group of students in the case, Doe v. Boyertown Area School District , alleging the district’s policy violates student privacy. ADF has represented students and school districts in similar lawsuits across the country.
— The Supreme Court's decision leaves standing the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals unanimous ruling last year that the Pennsylvania school district can continue allowing transgender students to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The court later revised its ruling, toning down language that said federal law protects that right. More here .
TRACKING OBAMA-ERA RULES DELAYED BY DEVOS: A handful of education regulations enacted by the Obama administration were delayed by the Trump administration — only to now take effect after federal judges ruled that DeVos had improperly postponed them.

China gets another currency break,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/05/29/china-gets-another-currency-break-441506,"With help from Doug Palmer and Hans von der Burchard China once again avoided being labeled a currency manipulator by Treasury , which could provide some more breathing room for U.S.-China trade talks — if they ever start back up again.
— Canada will introduce legislation today to implement USMCA, but it’s unlikely to pressure House Democrats to move any faster toward resolving concerns they have with the trade pact.
— China warned it will fight back against the U.S. crackdown on Huawei at a World Trade Organization meeting this week, accusing Washington of violating global trade rules.
IT'S WEDNESDAY, MAY 29! Welcome to Morning Trade, where your host knew this was a thing way before the World Health Organization made it official. Got any news to share? CHINA GETS ANOTHER CURRENCY BREAK: The Trump administration again stopped short of declaring China a currency manipulator, avoiding an inflammatory move that could further derail trade talks with Beijing. The Treasury Department kept China on a special monitoring list with the release of its long overdue semiannual currency report on Tuesday.
Donald Trump, while on the 2016 campaign trail, declared he would label China a currency manipulator his first day in office but has yet to deliver on that promise. Still, Treasury pointed out that the Chinese renminbi depreciated by 3.8 percent against the dollar during the second half of 2018, although it said any direct intervention appeared limited.
Additions to the monitoring list: The latest report incorporated new criteria for determining whether a country is undervaluing its currency for an unfair trade advantage. Treasury also expanded the number of countries it examined to 21 countries, from 12 previously, by including any trading partner whose goods trade with the United States exceeds $40 billion annually.
That resulted in Italy, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam being added to the list alongside China, Japan, South Korea and Germany. India and Switzerland were taken off the monitoring list. No country was formally labeled a currency manipulator. Doug has the full story here .
Democratic pressure: “This is the fifth time in a row that the Trump administration has refused to label China a currency manipulator,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “I hope this does not portend the administration backing off on Huawei or trade.”
USMCA SEES SOME MOVEMENT IN CANADA: The Canadian government is expected to introduce legislation in its Parliament today to implement the new NAFTA, but all eyes in Ottawa are still on whether U.S. lawmakers will approve the pact.
Canadian lawmakers could tee up the bill and then amend it before a final vote to reflect changes made in the U.S. That could require a rare emergency summer session since Parliament adjourns in a few weeks for a federal election in October.
""We will definitely be watching closely what the United States, and Mexico, is doing,"" Bardish Chagger, the House Leader for the Trudeau Liberals, told the House of Commons.
Will Canada moving first on the trade deal have an impact on House Democrats? “Not one bit, but it probably should,” a House Democratic aide closely following the process told Morning Trade. There have been no breakthroughs between the Trump administration and Democrats, who have demanded changes to provisions on labor, environment and pharmaceuticals.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she would form working groups of lawmakers to address those issues but they have yet to be formed, the aide said.
“Those working groups need time to come to their conclusions — that is the bottom line,” the aide said.
U.S. GOVERNMENT URGES SCOTUS TO REJECT 232 CASE: Solicitor General Noel Francisco and other legal representatives of the U.S. government are urging the Supreme Court to reject a request to take up a case challenging the constitutionality of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The law, which allows the president to impose trade restrictions to protect national security, was used by the Trump administration to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Trump has also threatened to use Section 232 on auto imports. U.S. steel importers unsuccessfully challenged the law in the Court of International Trade, arguing it violated the Constitution’s separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch.
“Section 232 is consistent with more than a century of this Court’s precedents and more than two centuries of congressional practice,” Francisco wrote in a filing submitted Tuesday.
CHINA DEFENDS HUAWEI AT THE WTO: China warned Tuesday that it would use all available means to safeguard its interests after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and threatened to block Chinese telecommunications companies from accessing the U.S. market. The complaint arose at a meeting of the World Trade Organization’s market access committee where a Chinese official demanded that the U.S. lift “unilateral sanction measures” against Chinese companies, according to a Geneva trade official.
China said the U.S. actions related to Huawei violate the WTO’s most-favored nation commitment, which requires WTO members to provide equal treatment to each other on matters of trade. Beijing also reiterated its concerns with what it views to be an abuse of an exception that allows a country to deviate from trade rules for national security reasons. The administration has invoked the Article XXI exception in its defense of steel and aluminum tariffs.
Huawei’s day in court: The Chinese telecom, meanwhile, filed a motion in U.S. court asking for a summary judgment on its request to declare unconstitutional a previous U.S. ban on Huawei equipment for federal agencies and contractors. The South China Morning Post has the story here .
NO MOVEMENT IN APPELLATE BODY DEADLOCK: During the DSB meeting, the U.S. also refused to remove its block on the appointment of judges to the Appellate Body. The EU, China, Japan, Brazil, Russia and India took to the floor to “express concern over the impasse,” according to a Geneva-based trade official. Norway said it was “fascinated” that Washington continues claiming that the concerns remain unaddressed despite efforts by other members to do exactly that.
The EU’s alternative plan: U.S. stubbornness on the matter has driven Brussels to ramp up efforts to come up with an interim solution for the increasingly likely scenario that the WTO’s highest court ceases to function in December, when the number of judges will be down to two. The idea is to establish appeals tribunals under Article 25 of the organization’s dispute settlement understanding until a permanent solution is found. Following a summit on Monday, the bloc’s trade chief, Cecilia Malmström, told reporters that EU trade ministers are backing the idea and that it could either be established bilaterally or with a “bigger group” of countries.
ANALYSTS: DIRECT TARIFF IMPACT ‘MEANINGFUL BUT NOT HUGE’: Americans can expect higher prices and slower economic growth if Trump follows through on plans to hit the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods with a 25 percent tariff, analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics said Tuesday.
“The direct effects are meaningful but not huge,” Adam Posen, president of the institute, told reporters at a briefing Tuesday. “If we go full out on the tariffs, as currently proposed, you’re going to start seeing overall increases in inflation on the order of two- to three-tenths of a percent.” That would hit low-income U.S. households the hardest, he said.
Posen estimated the tariffs would reduce U.S. GDP by at least 0.25 percent and potentially by as much as 0.5 percent on an annualized basis “for a quarter or two.” The government could offset that by increasing fiscal or monetary stimulus, but it’s still short-sighted to throw away any growth, he said.
In the medium and the longer term, the tariffs would discourage companies from investing in China, hurting already-low U.S. productivity growth, Posen said. In addition, new U.S. restrictions to stop the flow of technology to China also are bad for growth, he said.
China could lose 1 percent of economic growth if Trump follows through on his tariff plan, said Nick Lardy, another Peterson senior fellow. But Beijing could offset some of that by increasing government stimulus programs, he said.
A ‘VISIBLE’ CHINA CRACKDOWN: Posen said Chinese government officials, academics and media representatives were much less willing to talk openly than in the past. “There really has been a visible crackdown,” he said. “There definitely is a major dampening down of what they’re willing to talk about, even off the record, in private, with people who they know well, like us.” At the same time, the Peterson team has heard increased interest within China in joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and in advancing reform efforts at the WTO, Posen said. Doug has the full rundown here on why the Peterson analysts, back from a recent visit to Beijing, say China has lost confidence in trade talks with the administration.

Navy stands by carrier design as Trump demands switch to steam,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2019/05/29/navy-stands-by-carrier-design-as-trump-demands-switch-to-steam-441448,"With Wesley Morgan
Quick Fix President Donald Trump’s call to put steam catapults back on aircraft carriers puts him at odds with Congress and even his own Navy commanders.
— The Joint Chiefs chairman talks national security today at Brookings.
— Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has a book deal, but don’t expect it to be juicy.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY
Navy TRUMP’S QUEST FOR STEAM: For two years now, Trump has been complaining that the Navy is wasting its money on new technology for launching aircraft from carrier decks, and instead should be going back to good ol’ reliable steam.
But on Monday, Trump cranked up the pressure by saying he plans to order the Navy to return to steam catapults, setting up a possible confrontation with Congress, our colleague Wesley Morgan writes .
Trump’s comments “seem much more interventionist than he has been on this issue in the past,” naval expert Bryan Clark said.
Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) says it’ll never happen.
“Overhauling the Ford-class carriers for steam catapults would require a complete redesign of the Ford and the reconstitution of the industrial base for steam catapults, creating significant delays and cost overruns,” he said in a statement.
Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, stood by the system when asked about it during an all-hands call in Hawaii, Stars and Stripes"
What's next for PJM,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/05/29/whats-next-for-pjm-441519,"With help from Gavin Bade, Annie Snider and Eric Wolff Editor's The head of the nation's largest wholesale power market is stepping down at the end of June, creating more uncertainty in PJM.
— A federal court in Texas ruled that the Obama-era Waters of the U.S. rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act.
— The Trump administration is appealing a court decision from earlier this year that Interior has pointed to in its delay of an offshore drilling plan.
WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY! Matt Smith of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce knew Leon Panetta, a former House Budget chairman, also served as Defense secretary, CIA director, White House chief of staff and OMB director. For today: Which former Supreme Court justice stepped down to serve in the Senate? WHAT'S NEXT FOR PJM: More uncertainty is in store for PJM, the nation's largest wholesale power market, after the surprise announcement Tuesday that CEO Andy Ott will step down from his post at the end of June. Ott has been CEO since 2015 and is slated to leave with many of his signature policy proposals unfinished, including a high-profile rewrite of PJM's capacity market rules that has been held up at FERC for seven months , as well as a nascent effort to design a carbon pricing mechanism.
PJM did not give a reason for Ott's departure, but his role was a difficult one — balancing the interests of states and market participants in a 13-state wholesale operation that spreads from Chicago to Washington.
States with large nuclear power sectors, like Illinois and New Jersey, have threatened to leave the market if PJM and FERC do not respect their policies to support money-losing reactors. Ott has often spoke out against Trump administration plans to prop up retiring coal and nuclear generators. On the flip side, critics say PJM has kowtowed to powerful owners of coal and nuclear plants by proposing market reforms that would raise market prices for their electricity.
Market participants told ME the enduring tension with the leadership meant that a change at the top was expected eventually, even if its abruptness caught many off guard. ""Eventually a change was coming,"" one PJM participant said Tuesday evening. ""Lots of animosity had been accumulated.""
Around the Agencies DISTRICT COURT OVERTURNS OBAMA WOTUS RULE: A federal judge in Galveston, Texas, struck down the Obama administration's Waters of the U.S. rule on procedural grounds late Tuesday. Judge George C. Hanks ruled that EPA violated the Administrative Procedures Act by adding distance limits in the final regulation that were not a ""logical outgrowth"" of the proposal, and closing the public comment period before EPA issued the final version of a key scientific report that undergirded the rule. However, he declined to rule on plaintiffs' substantive challenges to WOTUS, calling them ""premature.""
Hanks sent the rule back to EPA for further work — noting that the agency has already ""begun reviewing changes"" — but did not vacate it. That's the remedy that the three Republican state plaintiffs and industry groups requested, and it could bolster the Trump administration's own proposed definition. But it also means the Obama-era rule remains on the books in the roughly half the states that aren't covered by preliminary injunctions.
TRUMP APPEALS OFFSHORE DECISION: The Trump administration is appealing a March decision that declared President Donald Trump's move to open up the Arctic to oil and gas drilling unlawful, according to a new filing with the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska. The Justice Department is appealing the decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Recall: U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in late March threw out an April 2017 executive order, declaring it unlawful ""as it exceeded the president's authority,"" thus immediately reinstating an Obama-era drilling ban on large portions of the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic and dozens of underwater canyons off the East Coast.
Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, named as a defendant in the new filing, last week pointed to litigation when asked about the Trump administration's delayed offshore drilling plan. ""I saw the litigation playing out and saw the court decision, and I wanted to hold off to figure out exactly the best pathway forward,"" Bernhardt told the Senate Appropriations Committee.
DOE AUTHORIZES EXPANDED FREEPORT EXPORTS: The Energy Department announced the approval of additional exports of domestic natural gas from the Freeport LNG Terminal in Texas — allowing exports up to 0.72 billion cubic feet per day of gas from a fourth liquefaction train to be built at Freeport. FERC earlier this month approved the expansion of the LNG export facility. DOE made the announcement Tuesday at the Clean Energy Ministerial in Vancouver, which is being attended by Energy Undersecretary Mark Menezes and other senior officials.
Related: Eighty-three percent of U.S. oil production and 90 percent of its natural gas and natural gas liquids production come from independent oil and natural gas producers, according to a new study conducted by IHS Markit and commissioned by the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
Beyond the Beltway BUCKEYE BAILOUT: The Ohio House is slated to vote today on legislation that would subsidize two at-risk nuclear power plants and increase existing payments for two coal plants in the state, all while gutting clean energy programs. Ohio insiders tell ME House passage is likely on Tuesday, but the Senate could take longer to debate the measure. Any delays could cause issues for bankrupt FirstEnergy Solutions, which must decide next month whether to refuel the Perry nuclear plant.
House Bill 6 would create a $300 million program to support the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants and increase subsidies for two large coal plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corp. Unlike other states, which have boosted renewable energy in nuclear support packages, the Ohio bill would pay for the new programs by eliminating efficiency targets and a 12.5 percent-by-2027 renewable energy mandate. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine has been vocal in his support for the nuclear plants and is likely to sign the bill if it passes in its current form.
TEXAS READY TO SWEAT ITS RESERVES AGAIN: Texas faces tight summer power reserve margins this year, as new power supplies strain to catch up with what is expected to be another season of record demand. This summer's 8.5 percent power reserve margin is lower than even last year, when the industry held its breath for each heat wave forecast. But the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees the state's power market, sailed through last summer with few problems, and whatever happens in 2019, 2020 is expected to improve. The state expects wind, solar and battery storage projects to come online, and reserve margins will rebound to 10.5 percent next year and a robust 15.2 percent in 2021.
REPORT: PENNSYLVANIA MUST DO MORE IN CHESAPEAKE: Pennsylvania's plan to reduce pollution by 2025 in the Chesapeake Bay is ""woefully inadequate,"" according to a new analysis from the nonprofit Chesapeake Bay Foundation on Tuesday. EPA has called on states in the watershed to implement a so-called pollution diet by 2025.
While the other states that make up 90 percent of the bay's pollution — Maryland and Virginia — are on track to meet their goals, the report found the Keystone State never met its nitrogen reduction targets and has detailed just two-thirds of actions required to meet its 2025 pollution goal.
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation hinted that a lawsuit may be necessary to get EPA to act. ""Pennsylvania has failed to uphold its promise to reduce pollution to its surface and ground waters since the six state Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint was launched in 2009,"" CBF President William C. Baker said in a statement. ""If EPA does not hold Pennsylvania accountable, CBF and others must consider legal action.""
On the Hill WAIT TILL JUNE: The chances of House lawmakers clearing a bipartisan disaster relief package, H.R. 2157 (116) , this week remain slim, after another lone Republican lawmaker blocked an attempt to pass the measure Tuesday. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the chamber will hold a vote first thing after lawmakers return from recess, either Monday or Tuesday of next week.
Movers and Shakers — Earthjustice will announce today that Jill Tauber and Kim Smaczniak have been promoted to vice president of litigation for climate and energy, and managing attorney for the Clean Energy Program, respectively.

Driving the Day TECH OF THE TOWN: KAMALA’S TOWN HALL — 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who recently went on the record saying “we have to seriously take a look” at breaking up Facebook, took her tech talk in a different direction Tuesday night during an MSNBC town hall. In her discussion of jobs, Harris repeated a refrain — “trade policy by tweet” — to criticize the president’s use of Twitter to make major policy decisions (namely related to China) that she said are harming U.S. workers. “He made promises to workers in America — those promises he did not keep — and instead, he has been conducting ‘trade policy by tweet,’ which has resulted in farmers having to have bins full of soybeans sitting around rotting because they could not sell them to China where they had cultivated a market over decades,” she said.
— And on immigration: Harris also singled out Google as an emblem of the country’s big corporations that are run by immigrants. Silicon Valley has long been fueled by immigrant tech workers , and Google is no exception. CEO Sundar Pichai has publicly criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, including the bans that affected more than 100 company employees and their families, as detrimental to the business.
HUAWEI FIGHTS THE BAN — Huawei said Tuesday night that it had filed a motion asking the U.S. courts to rule in favor of its move to overturn a federal ban on Huawei gear, according to our colleagues at the South China Morning Post. The Chinese telecom giant is arguing that the U.S. ban on its network equipment for federal agencies and contractors, outlined in the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act for 2019, is unconstitutional. A hearing on the motion is set for September. Read the story here .
— Beijing also defended Huawei at a World Trade Organization meeting on Tuesday , warning that it would use all available means to safeguard its interests after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and threatened to block Chinese telecommunications companies from accessing the U.S. market.

AIRWAVES AUCTION RAISES $2B — The FCC’s second auction of 5G spectrum officially ended Tuesday and generated just over $2 billion in bids. Bidders won 2,904 of the 2,909 licenses offered in the 24 GHz spectrum band, the agency said. These particular airwaves have been the subject of an internal Trump administration feud , with the Commerce Department warning about potential commercial 5G interference with weather forecasting operations. The FCC has not yet identified the winners of the auction.
For Your Radar SWITZERLAND’S MEETING OF TECH MINDS — The AI for Good global summit in Geneva, organized by the U.N.’s agency for information and communication technology, continues through Friday.

2020 Watch HARRIS LAYS OUT PLAN TO PROTECT ABORTION RIGHTS — Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential contender, unveiled a broad platform to protect abortion rights that's modeled on the Voting Rights Act, arguing that strict new abortion bans passed in states demonstrate the need for more federal guardrails, reports Alice Miranda Ollstein.
What would the plan do? Harris would require states that have demonstrated a pattern of curbing abortion rights to seek approval from the Justice Department before enacting any new laws affecting access. Those laws would be legally unenforceable without DOJ sign-off.
How would it work? A series of federal court rulings against a state's abortion restrictions would land it in the pre-clearance category. Currently, the onus is on abortion rights advocates to sue to block state restrictions.

MOULTON DETAILS PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE VETS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT — Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), a Marine veteran who is running for president, introduced a plan to expand military mental health services as he disclosed publicly that he sought treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder after his combat deployments during the Iraq War, reports Alex Thompson.
“I had some particular experiences or regrets from the war that I just thought about every day, and occasionally I’d have bad dreams or wake up in a cold sweat,” Moulton said in an interview ahead of a Veterans Mental Health Tour through early-primary states. “But because these experiences weren’t debilitating — I didn’t feel suicidal or completely withdrawn, and I was doing fine in school — it took me a while to appreciate that I was dealing with post-traumatic stress and I was dealing with an experience that a lot of other veterans have.”
What’s in his plan? Moulton would require “mental health check-ups” in addition to annual physicals for active-duty military and veterans, plus mandate a counseling session for all troops within two weeks of their return home from a combat deployment.

Around the Nation TEXAS LAWMAKERS TAKE ON HEALTH CARE, BUT AVOID ABORTION RESTRICTIONS — Texas lawmakers tackled some major health care priorities — including tobacco and surprise bills — even as they avoided sweeping abortion curbs or coverage expansion during the 140-day, biennial legislative session that wrapped up on Memorial Day, reports Renuka Rayasam from Austin.
What passed? The Republican-dominated Legislature added funding for mental health services, raised the minimum age for purchasing tobacco to 21 and banned surprise billing.
What got dropped? Lawmakers failed to pass a measure seen as key to lowering maternal mortality — expanding postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to one year. Gov. Greg Abbott has until June 16 to act on legislation. More from Renu here .
TEXAS SITS OUT ABORTION FIGHT — Although the state for years has pushed the boundaries on anti-abortion legislation, it isn’t joining the raft of conservative states approving near-total bans on the procedure in a bid to topple Roe v. Wade . The Texas legislature this year pushed major abortion legislation to the background while lawmakers focused on issues that appeal more to moderate voters, like education and property taxes. Anti-abortion advocates and campaign strategists say the shift is a reaction to the 2018 election, when Republicans lost several seats to Democrats in formerly conservative strongholds.

UCSF-DIGNITY PARTNERSHIP SCRAPPED AFTER FIERCE OPPOSITION — The University of California-San Francisco ended plans to partner with Dignity Health due to concerns that affiliation with the Catholic system would compromise health care options for women and LGBTQ patients, reports Victoria Colliver. More than 1,500 UC students and staff members signed a petition opposing the plan, citing concerns about religious directives followed by Catholic institutions that prohibit a number of reproductive health services, including contraception, sterilization and abortion.
Why it matters: Catholic health care systems have grown through mergers and acquisitions in recent years. Concerns about the Dignity-UCSF partnership were heightened by the Trump administration’s rules bolstering conscience protections for health care workers.

In the Courts PROVIDERS SUE HHS OVER RELIGIOUS-REFUSAL RULE – The Trump administration is facing another lawsuit over this month’s conscience-rights rule , this time from doctors who say the sweeping rule puts patients at risk. The lawsuit was brought by Santa Clara County in California, the Whitman Walker Clinic and other providers that serve LGBTQ populations or offer abortion, reports Dan Diamond.
Why they’re suing : The rule “endangers patients’ health in the name of advancing the religious beliefs of those who are entrusted with caring for them—a result sharply at odds with the stated mission” of HHS, the plaintiffs allege.
What they’re arguing : That the rule is unconstitutional because it violates federal protections for patients’ free speech and against religious beliefs in rulemaking.
What the Trump administration maintains: That the rule, which strengthens health care workers’ ability to decline to provide care on religious or moral grounds, is necessary to protect those workers.
About two dozen cities and states are challenging the rule in multiple lawsuits filed earlier this month

Around the Agencies NEW DIABETES CASES DROPPED BY A THIRD OVER LAST DECADE — The number of Americans newly diagnosed with diabetes fell by more than one-third since 2009 after an almost two-decade-long steady increase in prevalence, according to new CDC data. Newly diagnosed patients fell to 6 per 1,000 adults in 2017 from 9.2 per 1,000 in 2009, according to a new report in the British Medical Journal's Open Diabetes Research and Care.
The decline appeared to be driven by non-Hispanic whites, though researchers said specific causes for the decrease can't be determined from the analyses. The intake of added sugar, sugary beverages, total calories and physical inactivity peaked in the mid-2000s and either plateaued or decreased after, they said.

HHS FINALIZES PLAN AIMED AT KEEPING SENIORS OUT OF NURSING HOMES — The Trump administration finalized a long-delayed rule aimed at keeping frail seniors out of nursing homes and other institutional settings, reports Rachel Roubein. HHS is updating the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, or PACE, which designates organizations across the country to provide social and medical services to seniors in their homes or community settings.
What’s in it: The new rule provides more administrative and regulatory flexibilities, such as letting one member of the care team serve in multiple roles. The rule was first proposed by the Obama administration nearly three years ago.
What’s the response: The National PACE Association applauded the rule, saying it will allow the programs to “grow faster, operate more efficiently and enhance care delivery.”

WHAT BURNOUT REALLY COSTS — Physician burnout costs about $4.6 billion in the United States from lost clinical hours and physician turnover, according to a new study in the Annals of Internal Medicine.
...That pegs a dollar figure to a phenomenon researchers have recently tried to highlight. A Harvard study earlier this year found that 78 percent of physicians said they felt at least somewhat burned out, and that documentation demands could contribute to those feelings of exhaustion.
Around the time of publication, lead author Ashish Jha told Morning eHealth that technology could also ease burnout if developers built more intuitive scheduling or documentation systems, or if health systems used telemedicine more. That way doctors could spend more time face-to-face with the patients who really need the attention, he said. ""That stuff adds joy back into people’s work,"" Jha said.
...Burnout isn't just for doctors. The World Health Organization now recognizes it as an official medical diagnosis, CNN reports . It's now in the International Classification of Diseases , known as the ICD-11. Symptoms include exhaustion and cynicism about one's job.
POLITICO's
TELEMEDICINE IN A POST-ROE WORLD — The recent spate of early abortion bans could push more women to seek medication abortions through a process that allows them to video chat with clinicians, instead of driving what might be more than a 100 miles to the nearest abortion provider.
Some clinics already let patients come into their facilities to video chat with clinicians located at other sites, and then dispense the drugs after the virtual consultation. One research group, called Gynuity Health Projects, is conducting a study that mails the drugs directly to a woman's home after she consults the clinician virtually. That's part of an FDA-reviewed trial that exempts participating clinics from a law requiring that abortion medication be dispensed only at certain medical facilities.
Gynuity plans to publish data in a scientific journal and share results with the FDA, an effort to get the agency to ease restrictions on the dispensation of abortion medication. Even just allowing pharmacies to distribute the medication could ""dramatically improve access"" to pregnancy-ending drugs, University of California-San Francisco professor Daniel Grossman said in an interview.
...In some cases, access to telemedicine could determine whether women can access abortion at all, says Melissa Grant of Carafem, a clinic participating in the Gynuity trial. Pros can read the rest of the story here .
PACE UPDATES ARE HERE, FINALLY — The Trump administration has finalized a long-delayed rule meant to connect the elderly with social and medical services in homes and certain health centers, our colleague Rachel Roubein reports.
...Also on elder care, IBM is embarking on a study using LiDAR — a sensor system used in self-driving cars — to observe elderly patients in their homes, Business Insider reports .
WHAT HIPAA MEANS FOR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES — HHS' Office for Civil Rights has a new fact sheet describing when business associates — the groups that might, through contracts with health groups, access patient information for operational purposes — are directly liable.
...Deven McGraw, former OCR deputy director for health information privacy, said an addendum explaining that OCR doesn't have the authority to hold business associates accountable for data access fee limitations was ""somewhat surprising to me,"" she told Morning eHealth. If business associates can be held accountable for the time, manner and format of the health data to comply with patients' access rights, ""I'm not sure why [fee limitations] are not directly enforceable by HHS (and attorneys general) against business associates.""
PRIVACY ROUNDUP — Facebook took flak at an international hearing, and tech companies continue to offer up their versions of privacy bills. Privacy news of note:
International ire for Facebook: Lawmakers from several countries slammed Facebook after executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg snubbed their invitation to a technology hearing in Canada and sent two other executives instead, our POLITICO colleagues report. Canada's House of Commons approved an open-ended summons for Zuckerberg and Sandberg so that next time they enter the country, they'll have to discuss tech issues with lawmakers. If they don't, lawmakers can vote to hold them in contempt of Parliament. ""I am sick to death of sitting through hours of platitudes from Facebook and avoidance tactics,"" United Kingdom MP Jo Stevens , one of the lawmakers at the hearing, said. ""I want the boss here to take responsibility.""
...The execs who did show up defended the company. ""We actually do go over and above the law,"" Kevin Chan, head of public policy at Facebook Canada, said during one heated exchange.
Another stab at a privacy bill: Tech companies are eager to make an imprint on federal privacy legislation as lawmakers flesh out various versions. On the first anniversary of Europe's sweeping privacy law, known as GDPR, Intel published the third draft of its own suggested bill .
...Speaking of GDPR, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon, in charge of regulating European operations for tech companies including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, has been appointed for another five-year term.
On Tap COMMENT DEADLINE APPROACHING — Feedback on ONC and CMS' proposed information blocking and interoperability rules is due June 3. (Submit comments here)
...In a summary of its upcoming comments, the Electronic Health Record Association took affront at what it saw as ONC's implication that ""established EHR developers are incapable of innovation.""
""That is an inaccurate characterization that trivializes the work"" that member vendors do, the group wrote in a blog post.
ONC's rulemaking outlines exceptions to the 21st Century Cures Act's ban on information blocking, and taken together with a proposal from CMS, encourages health IT developers to make patient data accessible not only to patients but to other developers through APIs. Officials have argued that making data more accessible would allow independent developers to whip up useful applications for patients. Restrictions on fees for data sharing, or provisions that might require them to share intellectual property, could hinder innovation, EHRA added.
... UCSF's Center for Digital Health Innovation argued that the information blocking provisions should apply to any health IT developers, not just the ones who are angling for ONC certification. ""Left uncorrected, it could become the exception that swallows the rule and create perverse incentives where health IT developers avoid certified health IT and escape the information blocking prohibitions altogether,"" the center wrote .

Trump losing public opinion battle on trade,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2019/05/29/trump-losing-public-opinion-battle-on-trade-440855," Trump not winning opinion battle on trade — The latest Monmouth University national poll has more bad news for President Trump on the trade front. Public opinion is somewhat split on whether tariffs on imports are good for the U.S. (32%) or bad (37%). But it’s moving the wrong way for Trump from last year when the public was evenly split. Americans saying free trade deals are good is up to 51% from 24% in 2015.
Story Continued Below
And 47% say that Trump’s specific tariffs hurt the U.S. while just 25% say they help. And 62% percent say they are either very or somewhat concerned about the impact of a trade war on their local economy. The public also believes (62%) that Americans will bear the cost of the China tariffs, contrary to Trump’s assertions.
These are just the latest numbers in a broad swath of polling suggesting Trump is not convincing anyone beyond his hard-core base that his approach to trade is a smart one. And it underlines the risks to his re-election chances if he doesn’t make a deal with China and/or enters into bruising tariff battles with Japan and the E.U.
Speaking of bad numbers — Per our Brian Faler , the non-partisan Congressional Research Services found that the GOP tax cut bill “had little impact during its first year on either growth, wages or business investment.
“‘On the whole, the growth effects tend to show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy.’”

Driving the Day President Trump at 12:15 p.m. participates in the ceremonial swearing-in of the President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank … Redbook Chain Store Sales at 9:00 a.m. not expected to change much from last week’s 5.2 percent … Richmond Fed Survey at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise 6 from 3 … Wholesale inventories at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise 0.1 percent
MAYBE IT’S NOT THE ECONOMY, STUPID — CNN’s Ron Brownstein: “Even amid record-low unemployment, robust economic growth and a roaring stock market, … Trump has shown no signs of expanding his support beyond the roughly 46% of the vote that he carried in 2016.
“National surveys now routinely find a huge falloff between the share of Americans satisfied with the economy and the percentage that approve of Trump's performance as President. And new academic research has concluded that attitudes about the economy were much less powerful in driving voters' decisions in 2016 and 2018 than their views about fundamental cultural and social changes, particularly race relations and shifting gender roles.” Read more.
DISASTER AID THWARTED AGAIN — Our Sarah Ferris and Jennifer Scholtes: “Another House Republican on Tuesday thwarted attempts to pass a bipartisan disaster aid package, further delaying $19 billion in emergency relief and frustrating lawmakers whose states were hit by devastating hurricanes, wildfires and flooding.
“Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who objected to the bill's passage during a voice vote, demanded that the vote be held after the House returns from recess next week — making it unlikely that President Donald Trump can sign the package before early June. … Massie's objection is now the sole hurdle to clearing the $19 billion package, which had been stalled for nearly six months until an 11th hour deal in the Senate last Thursday.” Read more .

Bond yields, which fall as prices rise, have slid in recent weeks in response to a host of factors, including tepid economic data, geopolitical tensions and signs of caution from the Federal Reserve.
“While few see an imminent recession, many investors worry that economic growth could falter as the effects of Trump administration tax cuts fade, companies cut back on spending and higher tariffs restrict global trade."" Read more.

TRADE WAR'S NEXT BATTLE? CHINA'S ACCESS TO WALL STREET — NYT's Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson: ""President Trump’s trade war with China has prompted a broad rethinking of how the two economies have become so intertwined, leading some manufacturers to trim supply chains in China and American authorities to start cutting off crucial technology for Chinese companies. Now another important area is getting a close look: financial markets.

“In addition, the Trump administration's new 25% tariffs on Chinese goods are already making it more expensive for Western companies with Chinese factories, including Silicon Valley's Cisco Systems Inc., to send products to the U.S. Together, this pair of actions could make it more expensive for U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to buy the cellular-tower hardware, switches and routers needed for 5G.” Read more .

GOP LAWMAKER DERAILS DISASTER VOTE — McConnell would now confirm SCOTUS pick in election year — AMASH GETS HERO’S WELCOME — Moderate Dems resist progressive push back home,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2019/05/29/gop-lawmaker-derails-disaster-vote-mcconnell-would-now-confirm-scotus-pick-in-election-year-amash-gets-heros-welcome-moderate-dems-resist-progressive-push-back-home-441435,"With help from Melanie Zanona DISASTER AID DENIED : As soon as Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) walked into the House chamber, Democrats knew it was over. A trio of House Democrats — including Hoyer — returned to the Capitol on Tuesday in an attempt to expedite a $19 billion disaster relief bill to President Trump’s desk. They even had the blessing from House GOP leaders, who’d agreed to the unusual move of voice-voting a massive funding package.
Story Continued Below
Until Massie appeared around 2 p.m. , only a handful of people knew for sure that House conservatives were indeed plotting to halt the massive disaster package for the second time. Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) had booked a flight from Georgia to D.C. with hopes of sending the bill to Trump that day. But opposition from Massie, along with Rep. Alex Mooney (R-W.V.), affirms that the House will likely have to wait until lawmakers return next Monday to clear the bill. Hoyer said he does plan to try again in a pro forma on Thursday afternoon, but conservatives plan to make sure another Republican is waiting in the chamber to dissent.
Massie’s stance drew fierce ire from fellow Republicans, including Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.), whose district was pummeled by Hurricane Michael last year. “It’s not even a principled stand. They’re not trying to accomplish anything,” Scott told us by phone later. “They’re not trying to negotiate a resolution. They’re just acting up.” More from Sarah and Jennifer Scholtes: https://politi.co/2XcrNj3
THE SENATE'S NEXT SCOTUS BATTLE?: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell affirmed Tuesday that he would indeed move to fill a potential vacancy on the Supreme Court in 2020 — after he stonewalled President Obama’s pick during the last presidential cycle. McConnell’s comments have inflamed Democrats, whose last nominee, Merrick Garland, couldn’t even get a hearing in the eight months ahead of the 2016 contest.
McConnell said in 2016 that he was ""following a long standing tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year."" But his defenders will argue that the big difference, of course, is that the White House and Senate are now controlled by the same party. More from CNN’s Ted Barrett. https://cnn.it/2JNI1fA.

THANK GOSH FOR AMASH: Rep. Justin Amash has found few defenders in Congress since he became the lone Republican to call for Trump’s impeachment earlier this month. But back home in Michigan, the independent-minded lawmaker received a hero’s welcome for his solo rebellion against Trump. During a town hall on Tuesday night — his first public appearance since declaring Trump obstructed justice and committed impeachable offenses — a packed auditorium showered him with praise, gave him multiple standing ovations and even snapped selfies with Amash before the event.
But it wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Several former Amash supporters ripped into the five-term congressman for abandoning the district and betraying Trump, reflecting the broader anger with Amash in the GOP. And his pro-impeachment stance – a remarkable act of defiance, even for a longtime Trump critic — could put Amash’s congressional career in jeopardy. He has already drawn two primary challengers, including from a pro-Trump candidate who is vowing to make support for Trump a top issue in the campaign.

GOP SILENT ON ABORTION LAW: Top Republicans in Congress are sending mixed messages on Alabama’s abortion law — that is, if they’re willing to talk about it at all. Alabama’s strict policy, which bans abortion even in cases of rape and incest, has muddled the GOP’s strategy of using the issue of abortion to rally their base ahead of 2020.
It’s even divided the House GOP : Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has attempted to distance national Republicans from the law, while Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) embraces it, report Laura Barrón-López and Melanie: https://politi.co/2WeYFvl .
‘NASCAR DIPLOMACY’: Only six months after first-time candidates like Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) helped deliver Democrats the majority, they’re back in campaign mode. And for freshmen who flipped red seats, that means striking a careful balance between Democratic party loyalty and the kind of progressive zeal that turns off Trump voters.
That push-pull was on Spanberger’s mind in January, when the former CIA officer stood up at a closed-door meeting and warned that Democratic leaders were “losing the messaging” fight on the border wall, the Washington Post’s Jenna Portnoy reports from Richmond: https://wapo.st/30T4zko
AL FRANKEN’S RISE AND FALL... AND RISE? Former Sen. Al Franken has slowly begun to reenter the fray, and a political comeback isn’t out of the question. In private, Franken has continued to insist that he “did nothing significantly wrong,” according to one of his closest friends, Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute. But some Democrats believe that Franken will need to fully acknowledge his actions — even if he still believes it shouldn’t have led to his resignation — before any next step, the Washington Post’s Ben Terris reports. https://wapo.st/2wsF2Ra
MORE COURTROOMS, FEWER GREENROOMS: President Trump has reshaped his legal team as he shifts his attention to House Democrats’ ever-mounting legal probes, rather than focused squarely on the Mueller investigation. Trump has brought on more lawyers with litigation skills — instead of TV talking points — as the administration braces for a prolonged fight with Democrats that could ultimately wind up in the Supreme Court.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for being here. Two years ago, the acting attorney general asked me to serve as special counsel and he created the special counsel's office. The appointment order directed the office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.
Story Continued Below
Now, I have not spoken publicly during our investigation. I am speaking out today because our investigation is complete. The attorney general has made the report on our investigation largely public. And we are formally closing the special counsel's office and as well, I'm resigning from the Department of Justice to return to private life.
I'll make a few remarks about the results of our work. But beyond these few remarks, it is important that the office's written work speak for itself.
Let me begin where the appointment order begins, and that is interference in the 2016 presidential election. As alleged by the grand jury in an indictment, Russian intelligence officers who are part of the Russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system.
The indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber-techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign. They stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization WikiLeaks. The releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate. And at the same time as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment, a private Russian entity engaged in a social media operation where Russian citizens posed as Americans in order to influence an election.
These indictments contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or the innocence of any specific defendant. Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The indictments allege and the other activities in our report describe efforts to interfere in our political system. They needed to be investigated and understood. And that is among the reasons why the Department of Justice established our office.
More Coverage: Mueller says he doesn't want to testify before Congress | VIDEO: Robert Mueller's full statement on the Russia investigation | MAGAZINE: I Watched 20 Hours of Robert Mueller Testifying. Here's What Congress Would Be In For.
That is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation. The matters we investigated were of paramount importance. It was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned. When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government's effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable.
Let me say a word about the report. The report has two parts, addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate.
The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election. This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.
And in the second volume, the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president. The order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation. We conducted that investigation and we kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of the progress of our work.
And as set forth in the report, after that investigation, if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.
The introduction to the Volume 2 of our report explains that decision. It explains that under long-standing department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited.
A special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider. The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation. Those points are summarized in our report and I will describe two of them for you.
First, the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents available. Among other things, that evidence could be used if there were co-conspirators who could be charged now.
And second, the opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.
And beyond department policy, we were guided by principles of fairness. It would be unfair to potentially — it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge.
So that was Justice Department policy. Those were the principles under which we operated. And from them, we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime. That is the office's final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president.
We conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general, as required by department regulations. The attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to Congress and to the American people. At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released and the attorney general preferred to make — preferred to make the entire report public all at once and we appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public. And I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.
Now, I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.
There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.
In addition, access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office.
So, beyond what I've said here today and what is contained in our written work, I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress. And it's for that reason I will not be taking questions today, as well.
Now, before I step away, I want to thank the attorneys, the FBI agents, the analysts, the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner.
These individuals who spent nearly two years with the special counsel's office were of the highest integrity. And I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments, that there were multiple systemic efforts to interfere in our election.
And that allegation deserves the attention of every American. Thank you. Thank you for being here today."
Former Trump refugee director to depart HHS,www.politico.com,DAN DIAMOND,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/scott-lloyd-leaves-hhs-1346421,"Scott Lloyd, whose nearly two-year tenure leading the Department of Health and Human Services refugee office sparked lawsuits and congressional inquiries, will leave the Trump administration next week, HHS announced Wednesday.
Lloyd ran the refugee office for most of 2017 and 2018 as HHS was taking custody of thousands of migrant children separated from their families under the administration's zero-tolerance border enforcement policy. The administration struggled to reunite those families after a federal court order, and House Democrats this year have probed Lloyd’s role in the separations and whether his testimony before Congress was truthful.
Story Continued Below
Lloyd testified in February that he failed to alert HHS leaders about the health risks of separating migrant children. HHS leaders previously concluded that Lloyd mismanaged efforts to reunite families, POLITICO reported last year.
Democrats and reproductive health groups also criticized Lloyd for his efforts to block unaccompanied teenage girls in government custody from obtaining abortions, prompting an ACLU-led legal battle that reached the Supreme Court.
Lloyd was transferred in November 2018 to the HHS office for faith-based initiatives, where he has served as a liaison between the Trump administration and the religious community.
Lloyd also attracted scrutiny for his work outside the administration. He published a fictionalized memoir this year that detailed his anti-abortion beliefs."
Trump warns Roy Moore to back off Alabama Senate bid,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/roy-moore-alabama-senate-1346293,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned of “devastating” consequences if Republican Roy Moore again runs for Senate in Alabama, predicting the seat he failed to capture in 2017 would remain in Democratic hands if the former Alabama Supreme Court judge mounts another bid.
“Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,” he tweeted, pointing out that if Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) were to win reelection next year, “this time it will be for Six Years, not just Two.”
Story Continued Below
Jones, a former civil rights attorney, upset Moore in a 2017 special election to win the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, who became Trump's first attorney general. Moore’s already controversial candidacy — he had been twice removed from the bench for defying federal courts — was hounded by allegations of decades-old inappropriate sexual interactions with young girls. Though Trump endorsed and campaigned for Moore, Jones prevailed.
Jones' victory, the first by a Democrat running for Senate in Alabama since 1992, was considered a major upset in the deep-red state. His seat is among the GOP's top targets in 2020.
Moore has openly flirted with another run for Senate and on Tuesday taunted Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), who is in the race, by promising, ""I will beat Doug Jones.""
If Moore were to run again and win the GOP nomination, he could imperil Republicans’ chances of wresting the Senate seat from Jones and could affect the GOP's bid to maintain control of the chamber. The former judge's potential run has drawn immediate pushback from Republicans, including Donald Trump, Jr.
“You are literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,” Trump Jr. tweeted at Moore on Tuesday. “Running for office should never become a business model. If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.”
The president on Wednesday argued that the stakes were far too high for Moore to mount a second Senate bid — even as he continued to embrace Moore — and took a shot at establishment Republicans who condemned Moore during his 2017 run.
“I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn’t, and probably won’t,” he wrote online. “If Alabama does not elect a Republican to the Senate in 2020, many of the incredible gains that we have made during my Presidency may be lost, including our Pro-Life victories. Roy Moore cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating....Judges and Supreme Court Justices!”"
Booker calls for impeaching Trump after Mueller's statement,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/2020-democrats-impeachment-mueller-1346504,"Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand on Wednesday called for Congress to launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump, becoming the latest 2020 Democratic White House contenders to endorse the president’s removal from office.
Booker, of New Jersey, had previously demanded further probes by lawmakers into Trump’s conduct and Russian interference in the 2016 election, pressing for members of Congress to receive special counsel Robert Mueller’s underlying investigatory materials and public testimony.
And Gillibrand, of New York, had urged Democrats to hold more oversight hearings to win over voters not yet sold on the prospect of impeachment.
But Mueller’s remarks during an appearance at the Justice Department on Wednesday triggered the change in the candidates' stances, they tweeted.
“Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately,” Booker wrote online, adding : “This Administration has continued to stonewall Congress’s oversight. Beginning impeachment proceedings is the only path forward.”
""It's time for Congress to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts,"" Gillibrand wrote online three hours later. ""Robert Mueller clearly expects Congress to exercise its constitutional authority and take steps that he could not. We can't let the president defy basic accountability measures built into our Constitution.""
Mueller said Wednesday he would prefer not to appear before Congress to discuss the findings of his investigation, and he reiterated the principal conclusions of his report — which uncovered insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin but did not absolve the president on claims that he obstructed justice.
“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
Several Democrats vying to take on Trump in 2020 interpreted Mueller’s prepared statement as essentially an impeachment referral to Congress.
“What is clear is that I think it's a fair inference from what we heard in that press conference that Bob Mueller was essentially referring impeachment to the United States Congress,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters while campaigning in South Carolina.
Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) tweeted after Mueller’s remarks that impeachment hearings “should begin tomorrow,” writing online that “Mueller did his job. Now it’s time to do ours.""
Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and secretary of Housing and Urban Development, tweeted that lawmakers “should begin an impeachment inquiry” because Mueller “made clear this morning that his investigation now lays at the feet of Congress.”
Former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke wrote online that “[t]here must be consequences, accountability, and justice” as a result of Mueller’s probe and “[t]he only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted that if the House Judiciary Committee ""deems it necessary,"" he ""will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry.""
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) called on Mueller to testify before Congress, saying in a statement that the special counsel ""is essentially referring his findings to the House for expanded investigation or impeachment hearings."" Klobuchar added that impeachment proceedings ""are one way to investigate and hold this administration accountable if the White House keeps stonewalling.""
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., told NBC News that Mueller’s remarks were “as close to an impeachment referral as you could get under the circumstances,” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — the first of the leading 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment — tweeted : “Mueller’s statement makes clear what those who have read his report know: It is an impeachment referral, and it’s up to Congress to act. They should.”
A campaign spokesperson for former Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement that Congress should ""continue to investigate"" Trump, but warned that impeachment ""may be unavoidable if this Administration continues on its path."""
Mueller statement emboldens some Dems on impeachment,www.politico.com,ANDREW DESIDERIO,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/mueller-statement-emboldens-dems-on-impeachment-1346513,"Special counsel Robert Mueller handed Democrats a new weapon on Wednesday that they hoped would convince Speaker Nancy Pelosi to open an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
But Pelosi remains unmoved, reiterating her view that House Democrats must continue to investigate Trump’s conduct to evaluate whether impeachment is warranted.
“Where they will lead us, we shall see. Nothing is off the table,” Pelosi said at an event in San Francisco. “But we do want to make such a compelling case, such an ironclad case, that even the Republican Senate — which at the time seems to be not an objective jury — will be convinced of the path that we have to take as a country.”
But cracks in her leadership team continue to lay bare. A week after House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), a longtime impeachment advocate, contradicted Pelosi in front of the entire Democratic caucus, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and House Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) also endorsed an impeachment inquiry on Wednesday.
Other committee chairs overseeing aspects of the House's investigations into Trump and his campaign remained united behind Pelosi.
Pelosi’s refusal to embrace what Democratic leaders say remains a minority position in the House Democratic caucus came after Mueller made his only public statement since the start of his two-year investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether Trump obstructed the probe.
The special counsel explicitly said that he could not have charged Trump with obstruction of justice because of the Justice Department’s long-standing policy that prohibits the indictment of a sitting president.
Rather, Mueller said, the Justice Department policy indicates that the Constitution allows for other ways to hold a president accountable. “The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” he said.
To Democrats who are already eager to impeach Trump, those words — given voice by Mueller for the first time — represented a call to action, one that demands their leaders reverse their long-standing reluctance to launch an impeachment inquiry.
During his 10-minute statement, Mueller all but said Congress’ only recourse to hold Trump accountable is impeachment. And Democrats Wednesday responded with an wide array of options that included impeachment, investigation, censure and demands that Mueller testify, despite his reluctance to do so.
“The next step is for the House Judiciary Committee to open an impeachment inquiry to formally begin consideration of whether or not articles of impeachment should be filed,” said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of the Judiciary panel and Democratic leadership, who has previously backed impeachment proceedings. “The opening of this inquiry will allow the committee to collect evidence, compel the attendance of witnesses, and decide how to proceed.”
Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees, said on Twitter that Mueller’s statement “adds new urgency, putting it front & center before Congress & the American people. He's asking us to do what he wasn't allowed to — hold the president accountable.”
Mueller’s statement prompted at least one more House Democrat to call for an impeachment inquiry. New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell said Mueller delivered “nothing short of an alarm bell above the door of our republic.”
But Pelosi has repeatedly said she doesn’t think impeaching Trump is a worthwhile effort, barring dramatic new evidence or the president’s continued efforts to stonewall their investigations. Though she and her allies have sharpened their rhetoric toward Trump — accusing him of a “cover-up” by refusing to cooperate with congressional investigations — Pelosi on Wednesday held firm on her impeachment stance.
“The Congress will continue to investigate and legislate to protect our elections and secure our democracy,” she said in a statement . “The American people must have the truth.”
Though Mueller didn’t explicitly reference impeachment, his allusion to the Justice Department policy of an alternative path for holding a president accountable is an indirect reference to removing the president.
“[A] sitting president is immune from indictment as well as from further criminal process. Only the House of Representatives has the authority to bring charges of criminal misconduct through the constitutionally sanctioned process of impeachment,” the Justice Department policy reads.
Across the aisle, Rep. Justin Amash, the Michigan Republican who earlier this month became the only member of his party in Congress to call for Trump’s impeachment, wrote on Twitter : “The ball is in our court, Congress.”
The rest of the Republican Party, however, said Mueller’s statement proved it was time to move on from the investigation.
“Relitigating the 2016 election and reinvestigating the special counsel’s findings will only further divide our country,” said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.
In a statement Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) reiterated his vow to investigate the obstruction of justice allegations against Trump but stopped short of calling for impeachment proceedings.
“Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the president, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump — and we will do so,” Nadler said. “No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law.”
At a press conference in New York, Nadler said Trump’s conduct is “immoral” and “unlawful,” but he said of impeachment: “All options are on the table and nothing should be ruled out.”
One Democrat on Wednesday revived talk of censuring the president — a rarely used legislative mechanism that essentially condemns the president’s conduct but doesn’t carry any repercussions.
“I believe we should immediately take decisive action to censure him and keep all our options on the table. What President Trump did is wrong and violates the rule of law and our ethical norms,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Pelosi ally, said in a statement.

Joint Chiefs chairman dodges on funding for border wall,www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/dunford-military-funds-border-wall-1346539,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday defended the military’s deployment of troops to the U.S.-Mexico border but wouldn't say whether it was right to divert military funds toward a border barrier construction.
“I’m not going to comment on the appropriateness of taking money from the Department of Defense and moving it to the border,” Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford told an audience at the Brookings Institution.
That was in contrast to how Dunford described the deployment of 3,200 troops to help civilian law enforcement at the border. He called that “fundamentally a legal and appropriate mission.”
At the White House’s direction, the Pentagon has been channeling money from various military accounts to construction of a border barrier. That money has allowed the Pentagon to award $6 billion in construction contracts.
This month, acting Shanahan told Fox News he was following the president's orders.
""We have a crisis at the border, a national emergency declared by the president,"" Shanahan said. ""The commander in chief has given me a direct legal order to secure the border. I'm securing the border.""
Last week, a U.S. District Court judge in California barred some of the military funds from being used to construct a border wall in specific areas. An initial $1 billion was committed using a tactic that Judge Haywood Gilliam deemed unconstitutional because the military counterdrug fund the money was channeled through could be used only for “unforeseen” needs."
How Seth Moulton would expand mental health services for active-duty military and veterans,www.politico.com,ARTHUR ALLEN,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/seth-moulton-mental-health-2020-1483051,"Rep. Seth Moulton, a Marine veteran running for president, introduced a plan Tuesday to expand mental health services for the military, veterans and high school students. Moulton disclosed that he sought treatment in 2009 for post-traumatic stress disorder after deployments during the Iraq War, and said he hoped sharing his experiences would reduce stigma and induce other veterans to get help.
What would Moulton’s plan do? It would require a counseling session for returning combat veterans and annual mental health check-ups for active-duty military and veterans. It would fill all mental health vacancies at the VA and adopt a more holistic approach to treatment, including alternative therapies like mindfulness, exercise and cannabis.
Story Continued Below
In addition, Moulton would fund yearly mental health screenings for every high schooler in America and establish 511 as a national mental health crisis hotline.
How would it work? The plan could be implemented through executive action or legislation, Moulton’s campaign office says. The plan would double the number of DoD mental health professionals. Annual mental health screening of teenagers is already recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which makes it reimbursable for everyone over the age of 11.
It would be feasible to screen veterans for PTSD, but treating everyone who needed help would require the VA to train more certified peer specialists, experts say.
What are the weaknesses in the proposal? There is no legislative text for the proposal, which makes it difficult to know how much it would cost or how it would be funded.
However, mental health advocates applauded Moulton for speaking openly about his PTSD. “Highly respected men who talk openly and honestly about mental health help change the way people think about mental health and mental illnesses,” said Paul Gionfriddo, CEO of Mental Health America. “These are honest and good proposals.”
How much would it cost? Moulton put the cost of the program at roughly $3 billion. He says he would increase the DoD mental health budget by $500 million, and the VA budget by a similar amount, with $2 billion to increase screening and therapy for high school kids. He would pay for some of it by closing loopholes in the corporate tax code.
What are other candidates saying about mental health? Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar earlier in May presented a plan to prevent and treat addiction. It commits to improving access to care and mental health facilities, including in-patient programs, as well as funding more research. The $100 billion plan doesn’t include specifics about expanding access to treatment for people addicted to opioids.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren last year proposed a $100 billion plan to address the opioid crisis that would provide that funding over 10 years for states, territories, tribal communities and cities hit hard by addiction.
Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland has released a less detailed plan to increase access to mental health services.
Roughly 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. have a mental illness, according to the National Institute on Mental Health."
Roger Stone aide ends challenge to Mueller,www.politico.com,NATASHA BERTRAND,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/andrew-miller-roger-stone-mueller-investigation-1346688,"A former aide to political operative Roger Stone appears to have given up a yearlong quest to challenge special counsel Robert Mueller’s authority by resisting a grand jury subpoena.
The aide, Andrew Miller, threw in the towel Wednesday just as Mueller made a brief but keenly watched public statement a few blocks away marking the end of his investigation.
Story Continued Below
Miller’s arguments against Mueller came up short with a federal district court judge and an appeals court panel in Washington. The former Stone aide faced a stark choice in recent days: testify or take the battle to the Supreme Court and accept the near certainty of being sent to the D.C. jail for contempt of court.
Miller’s pro bono attorney, Paul Kamenar of the National Legal Policy Center, said Miller agreed to appear later this week before a grand jury that was previously attached to Mueller’s probe but is now being handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia.
“We decided to come to the grand jury on Friday,” Kamenar said. “I don’t know what they want him to testify about.”
Kamenar said he received an email earlier this week from Aaron Zelinsky, a former attorney on Mueller’s team who now works for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C., saying prosecutors want Miller to testify about his dealings with Stone from 2016 to the present.
Stone was indicted in January on charges of lying to Congress and the FBI about his dealings with WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a trial, set for November.
Under Justice Department policy and court rulings, grand juries are not supposed to be used to investigate a criminal case that’s already been filed, although they can be used to add new charges or to charge new defendants.
“If they’re investigating other crimes then I don’t know what else they’re looking at,” Kamenar said.
Kamenar argued before Chief U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell and the appeals court that Mueller’s appointment was invalid because he was wielding so much authority that he required a nomination by the president and confirmation by the Senate. The conservative attorney also contended that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal did not give former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the power to name Mueller as special counsel.
Howell rejected the arguments last year, but she wasn’t entirely dismissive, saying Kamenar raised “legitimate questions.”
In February, a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel turned aside Miller’s appeal.
During a hearing Wednesday, Howell denied Miller’s motion to set aside previous rulings in the case and she ordered him to appear before the grand jury Friday at 9:30 a.m. She stayed her earlier contempt order until that time and ordered prosecutors to report to her by next week whether Miller was in compliance with the grand jury’s requests."

This was not a game changer. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo MUELLER TO THE WORLD: READ THE REPORT! … ROBERT MUELLER is done. The special counsel made abundantly clear this morning that he has no interest in testifying in front of Congress, and if made to do so, he would stick to the confines of his 448-page report.
“I HOPE AND EXPECT this to be the only time I will speak in this manner,” Mueller said, noting that giving today’s statement was his decision, not anyone else’s. “THE REPORT is my testimony.”

THE TAKEAWAYS: Mueller basically repeated what was in his report. This was not a game changer. But he made clear that if he were made to testify, it would be a non-event, since he’d simply reiterate what he already put in writing.
-- RHETORICALLY, AND STRATEGICALLY, Democrats have a choice to make. They were looking to a potential public appearance by Mueller to guide whether to begin impeachment proceedings. On the one hand, it doesn’t appear they are going to get a big Mueller hearing -- and if they force him to testify, the special counsel will stick to the script. On the other hand, his eight-minute statement suggests how powerful putting him on camera could be. Absent a big Mueller event, Democrats might need to find a new goal post.
-- POLITICALLY, of course, Democrats are exceedingly unlikely to let this statement stand. They’re still going to want Mueller to testify.
-- WHERE THINGS STAND: Mueller didn’t offer Democrats anything new. Impeachment is still a decision that rests with Speaker NANCY PELOSI. And all publicly available evidence as of today indicates Pelosi doesn’t think impeachment is a good idea right now.
THAT’S NOT WHAT HE SAID, BUT … @realDonaldTrump: “Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.”
-- FROM SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS : “The Special Counsel has completed the investigation, closed his office, and has closed the case. Mr. Mueller explicitly said that he has nothing to add beyond the report, and therefore, does not plan to testify before Congress. The report was clear—there was no collusion, no conspiracy—and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction. Special Counsel Mueller also stated that Attorney General Barr acted in good faith in his handling of the report. After two years, the Special Counsel is moving on with his life, and everyone else should do the same.”
JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN JERRY NADLER SPEAKS: “Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump – and we will do so.

It has also highlighted how disorienting it can be to lose the gendered cues, like pronouns, names, appearance and mannerisms, that shape so much of social interaction.” NYT

Booker and Gillibrand move harder on impeaching Trump after Mueller's statement,www.politico.com,qforgey@politico.com (Quint Forgey),05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2019/05/29/booker-calls-for-impeaching-trump-after-muellers-statement-1032509,"""Beginning impeachment proceedings is the only path forward,” Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday following special counsel Robert Mueller’s appearance at the Justice Department. | Win McNamee/Getty Images Booker and Gillibrand move harder on impeaching Trump after Mueller's statement Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand Wednesday called for Congress to launch impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, becoming the latest 2020 Democratic White House contenders to endorse the president’s removal from office.
Booker, of New Jersey, had previously demanded further probes by lawmakers into Trump’s conduct and Russian interference in the 2016 election, pressing for members of Congress to receive special counsel Robert Mueller’s underlying investigatory materials and public testimony. Story Continued Below
And Gillibrand, of New York, had urged Democrats to hold more oversight hearings to win over voters not yet sold on the prospect of impeachment.
But Mueller’s remarks during an appearance at the Justice Department Wednesday triggered the change in the candidates' stances, they tweeted.
“Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately,” Booker wrote online, adding : “This Administration has continued to stonewall Congress’s oversight. Beginning impeachment proceedings is the only path forward.”
""It's time for Congress to begin impeachment hearings and follow the facts,"" Gillibrand wrote online three hours later. ""Robert Mueller clearly expects Congress to exercise its constitutional authority and take steps that he could not. We can't let the president defy basic accountability measures built into our Constitution.""
Mueller said Wednesday he would prefer not to appear before Congress to discuss the findings of his investigation, and he reiterated the principal conclusions of his report — which uncovered insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin but did not absolve the president on claims that he obstructed justice.
“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
Several Democrats vying to take on Trump in 2020 interpreted Mueller’s prepared statement as essentially an impeachment referral to Congress.
“What is clear is that I think it's a fair inference from what we heard in that press conference that Bob Mueller was essentially referring impeachment to the United States Congress,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told reporters while campaigning in South Carolina.
Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) tweeted after Mueller’s remarks that impeachment hearings “should begin tomorrow,” writing online that “Mueller did his job. Now it’s time to do ours.""
Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and secretary of Housing and Urban Development, tweeted that lawmakers “should begin an impeachment inquiry” because Mueller “made clear this morning that his investigation now lays at the feet of Congress.”
Former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke wrote online that “[t]here must be consequences, accountability, and justice” as a result of Mueller’s probe and “[t]he only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tweeted that if the House Judiciary Committee ""deems it necessary,"" he ""will support their decision to open an impeachment inquiry.""
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., told NBC News that Mueller’s remarks were “as close to an impeachment referral as you could get under the circumstances,” and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — the first of the leading 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment — tweeted : “Mueller’s statement makes clear what those who have read his report know: It is an impeachment referral, and it’s up to Congress to act. They should.”
A campaign spokesperson for former Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement that Congress should ""continue to investigate"" Trump, but warned that impeachment ""may be unavoidable if this Administration continues on its path.""

Stewart-Cousins: Cuomo 'stressed' by end of session,www.politico.com,nniedzwiadek@politico.com (Nick Niedzwiadek),05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/29/stewart-cousins-cuomo-stressed-by-end-of-session-1032912,"“I guess he gets particularly animated during these stressful times, and we are coming to the end of session,” Stewart-Cousins said. | AP Photo Stewart-Cousins: Cuomo 'stressed' by end of session Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
ALBANY — Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins shrugged off Gov. Andrew Cuomo's latest criticism of her colleagues, suggesting that end-of-session pressure is getting the better of him.
“I just think he gets stressed during these times,” she told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “We’re getting toward the end and our eye is focused on getting things done.” Story Continued Below
Cuomo has taken to the airwaves multiple times in the past two days to urge Democratic lawmakers to come to terms on issues ranging from marijuana legalization to rent law reforms. He even reached for a baseball metaphor to contrast the energy of January to the lethargy of more-recent weeks.
“Yes, we did good things in the first inning,” Cuomo said. “You don’t win a ballgame because you scored in the first inning and then you didn’t score in the additional eight. This has not justified all the time and effort that has gone into electing a Democratic Senate. It just hasn’t, in my opinion. We can do more, we should do more.""
This is the ninth legislative session Cuomo has navigated, but it's the first with all-Democratic control of the Legislature. It's a new dynamic that has engendered jockeying over who deserves credit, or blame , for the fate of progressive legislation.
Stewart-Cousins said her conference, and its counterpart in the Assembly, is continuing to work on outstanding issues and noted that she and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie weathered similar public critiques from the governor during budget negotiations in March.
“I guess he gets particularly animated during these stressful times, and we are coming to the end of session,” she said. “You know, everyone has their way of coping. I prefer to just keep my eye on getting the work done.”
A spokesperson for Cuomo did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the governor's stress levels."
Shanahan splits with Trump over North Korean missile tests - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/shanahan-trump-north-korea-missile-1346762," Pat Shanahan called North Korea's recent tests of short-range ballistic missiles a violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution, publicly diverging from President Donald Trump and siding with National Security Adviser John Bolton.
""The short-range missile, is that a violation? Yes,"" Shanahan told reporters traveling with him in Asia, referring to the early May launches by North Korea. ""These were short range missiles and those are a violation of the UNSCR.""
The U.N. resolution bars North Korea from testing any ballistic missiles, regardless of range, as Bolton pointed out to reporters on Saturday.
But Trump took a different line over the weekend during his visit to Japan. ""North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,"" he tweeted the same day as Bolton's comments.
""There have been no ballistic missiles going out,"" Trump told reporters in Tokyo before backtracking to say ""there have been no long-range missiles going out."""
Manatos registers as foreign agent for Cyprus - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/05/29/manatos-registers-as-foreign-agent-for-cyprus-441539," MANATOS REGISTERS AS FOREIGN AGENT FOR CYPRUS: Andy Manatos has registered as a foreign agent on behalf of Cyprus’ government for his work for the National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes , a group of Greek-Americans. Andy Manatos and his son, Mike Manatos , have lobbied for the Coordinated Effort since 2001, according to domestic lobbying disclosures, advocating for closer American ties to Greece and Cyprus. But neither Manatos had previously registered as a foreign agent.
Story Continued Below
— In a Justice Department filing, Andy Manatos disclosed that Cyprus’ government paid his firm more than $160,000 on Sept. 4 to subsidize the firm’s work for the Coordinated Effort. The firm “expects a similar payment in 2019,” he wrote. Manatos advises “Cypriot officials regarding US policy and the work he is undertaking but does not accept suggestions or direction from the Cypriot officials regarding the work he performs,” even though they’re underwriting the effort, he wrote in the disclosure filing.
— Manatos’ decision to register is the latest example of lobbyists taking care to comply with the Foreign Agents Registration Act as the Justice Department cracks down potential violations following the prosecution of Paul Manafort and others caught up in the special counsel’s investigation on foreign lobbying charges. The Justice Department requires foreign agents to register within 10 days. Asked why he waited so long to register, Andy Manatos wrote in an email that his lawyer had advised him that “registration as a foreign agent was unnecessary” because Cyprus’ government wasn’t directing the lobbying work.
— But FARA defines a foreign agent as someone “whose activities are directly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by” a foreign government or other foreign principal. After his lawyer consulted with the Justice Department, Manatos decided to register.
— Still, most of the work Manatos does on behalf of the Coordinated Effort isn’t lobbying, he said. “The overwhelming majority of our work involves keeping track of matters and conducting research on matters of interest to the Greek-American community,” he wrote in an email to PI. “The Cypriots understand that we Greek-Americans do not take direction from them but from ourselves in the Greek-American community,” he added.

Support surges for a climate debate in Democratic race - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Anthony Adragna,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/climate-change-democrats-2020-1465563,"Democrats across the ideological spectrum want their party to dedicate one of its presidential primary debates to climate change — despite the risk of exposing their own divides.
At least five presidential candidates have backed fellow presidential contender Jay Inslee's idea for a climate-centric debate, in a sign of the issue's growing profile among Democratic voters.
But a public debate might also force Democratic contenders to confront policy differences they have so far papered over, including how quickly they would push the U.S. to shift away from the fossil fuels that provide union jobs. The candidates would also face pressure to offer specifics on their position on the Green New Deal, the ambitious progressive climate resolution that Republicans have sought to tar as an expensive socialist boondoggle.
Presidential candidates like Beto O'Rourke have released ambitious climate change plans on the heels of pressure campaigns from progressive activists, while others, like former Vice President Joe Biden, face big questions about how ambitious an agenda they will lay out while balancing the needs of organized labor. Democrats also have a far from unified position on questions such as whether natural gas and nuclear power should have any role in combating climate change, in a sign of how far leftward the discussion has shifted since Barack Obama left the White House.
Still, even Democratic lawmakers defending tough seats in 2020 said political risks shouldn't deter the presidential hopefuls from giving the Earth’s climate the prime role it deserves.
“This is the most important issue that we face as a planet and a species right now,"" said freshman Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), who in November flipped a seat that Republicans had held for decades. He added, ""If you don’t want to have public debate, this is probably the wrong line of work for you.”
Some more conservative Democrats welcomed a climate debate as well, saying it would offer a chance to showcase a variety of potential solutions, not just the Green New Deal that Republicans are eager to hang around the necks of the entire party.
“I think the planet would be better served if we had an honest discussion about what Democrats are really talking about,” said Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.), a member of the more centrist New Democrat Coalition who has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate. He was one of nearly two dozen Democratic lawmakers of all ideological stripes who told POLITICO last week that they support holding such a debate.
The DNC remains non-committal on the idea of a climate-centered debate. The Democrats’ first presidential is scheduled for June 26-27 in Miami, followed by a second two-night session in late July in Detroit and a third debate in September.
""The DNC is currently ironing out the details for all 12 debates and will work with the networks to ensure that Democrats have a platform to discuss these issues directly with the American people,"" spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement.
One former DNC official who was involved in the process four years ago said Chairman Tom Perez and his team probably would informally gather input from an array of advocates, elected officials and party members before deciding on the debate formats.
The idea for a primary debate dedicated to climate change has been gaining traction since Inslee first proposed it in April. Fellow contenders Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) have also backed the idea, as has former Obama Cabinet official Julián Castro. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who recently unveiled his climate pitch , told POLITICO he thought such a debate would be ""great.""
A coalition of progressive and environmental groups, including CREDO Action, the Sunrise Movement, Friends of the Earth Action, Public Citizen and 350 Action, have also petitioned for a debate. Three Democratic senators — Brian Schatz of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico — sent a letter to NBC and MSNBC last week urging the networks ""to devote a significant amount of time to a discussion on climate action"" in the upcoming debates.
Singling out climate change may invite pressure from outside advocates seeking similar issue-oriented debates on topics like gun control and women's reproductive rights. Progressives, though, welcomed the prospect of building on the momentum for climate action generated by the lofty Green New Deal. And polls show climate change rising up the list of issues voters care about.
Some strategists voiced support for a climate-specific debate as long as Democrats go into it with eyes wide open — knowing that Republicans will almost certainly cast whatever solutions they offer as radical.
""I think it makes sense to do one of these, but to be perfectly clear hosting such a debate will not be without risks,” said Jim Manley, a former veteran aide to ex-Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid. “One of the only plays that the Trump team has is exploiting divisions, real or imagined, within the Democratic Party. And they are going to have a field day cherry picking Quote: s and making up stuff like they did with Medicare for All.""
Some Democrats expressed concern that a climate-focused debate would only reinforce internal party divisions about how to respond to the crisis, even though the presidential candidates unanimously agree on the need for aggressive action.
“I wouldn’t necessarily go for that,” said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), a member of the New Democrat Coalition who has also endorsed the Green New Deal, H. Res. 109 (116). “If you’re going to try to get everybody [united], you need to be talking about all the things that people care about.” Others, like Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), were unsure about singling out climate change over issues like gun control, although he said he’s “attracted” to the notion of single-issue sessions.
Republicans said they thought such a debate would backfire by showcasing internal Democratic tensions while highlighting what they’ve deemed radical, far-left policies.
“I’m happy they want to have a discussion,” said Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a senior member of Senate leadership. He added that Democrats “get to decide what they want to debate and voters will decide what they want to vote on” — but he warned that the Green New Deal ""will blow a hole into our strong, healthy and growing economy.”
The vast majority of Democrats who spoke to POLITICO shrugged off those concerns, saying recent opinion surveys show that voters won’t punish them for pushing aggressively on climate change.
A March CNN-Des Moines Register poll of Iowa voters found that 80 percent of Democrats wanted presidential candidates to make climate change a top priority, second only to health care. Recent Monmouth University polling found that Iowa Democrats consider climate change their second most important issue behind health care, and that nationally, 69 percent of Americans support the government doing more to address the problem.
And in a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released last week, 63 percent of registered voters nationwide said it’s either important or a top priority for Congress to pass a bill to address climate change.
That makes it even smarter for Democrats to enshrine the issue in one of their debates, some leading party members say.
“It is not only a good idea, I think it is a real prerequisite to getting this enormously important issue the attention it deserves,” said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden , the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. “There ought to be a way to get it the visibility and attention it deserves rather than seeing it just jammed in — in some way — to a bigger debate. There are a number of people I know who really think it’s overdue.”"
Durbin alarmed that new FDA chief caving on e-cigs,www.politico.com,SARAH OWERMOHLE,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/durbin-fda-e-cig-1347160,"Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) charged in an unusually sharp attack Wednesday that acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless seemed to have ""no intention"" of addressing youth e-cigarette use, which his predecessor deemed a public health epidemic.
His May 14 meeting with Sharpless was ""one of the most alarming and disappointing meetings in my time in public service,"" the No. 2 Senate Democrat wrote in a letter to Sharpless, a longtime cancer researcher who took the top FDA post in April as Scott Gottlieb left.
Story Continued Below
During the meeting, Durbin said, he pushed for FDA to move up the deadline to review e-cigarette products including kid-friendly vapors, but left the meeting believing Sharpless ""has no intention"" of attacking the problem.
The FDA in 2017 extended the review deadline to August 2022, then this March moved it up to 2021. A federal judge in Maryland this monthsaid the 2017 decision had given a ""holiday"" to manufacturers.
Durbin and Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.) previously introduced legislation to restrict kid-friendly vapor flavors and ban flavored cigars entirely. The FDA under Gottlieb also made moves to ban new flavored cigars from the market and threatened to restrict flavored vapor sales if teen use was not curbed. But so far, the agency has mainly targeted where vapors can be sold, for example mailing out more than a thousand warning letters last year.
In a statement to POLITICO, the FDA said Sharpless was committed to tackling the epidemic of e-cigarette use by preventing youth access to flavored tobacco products and taking action against illegal marketing to minors. It said Sharpless would respond directly to Durbin about his letter.
Durbin also called on the FDA to stop popular e-cigarette brand Juul from claiming that it helps traditional smokers quit with its ""make the switch"" ad campaign. The company has no evidence for such a claim, the senator said.
He concluded by warning Sharpless not to repeat the error Gottlieb made in allowing teen vaping to go unchecked for too long."
How Beto O’Rourke would address immigration reform,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/how-beto-orourke-would-address-immigration-reform-1346871,"Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke released a long-awaited proposal Wednesday to overhaul America’s immigration system, a plan that he claims represents “the most sweeping rewrite of our nation’s immigration and naturalization laws in a generation.”
The 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, a native El Pasoan and Spanish speaker who frequently talks about immigration on the campaign trail, says his suite of policies is “rooted in his experience serving the largest binational community in the Western Hemisphere – one that draws its strength and prosperity from its rich heritage of welcoming immigrants.”
What would the plan do?
As president, O’Rourke says he would use his executive authority to reverse major planks of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, including its plans for a border wall, policies of separating families who cross the border illegally and a directive mandating that asylum seekers at the southern border remain in Mexico while their cases wind through the courts. He would also increase the number of court staff, clerks, interpreters and judges in the U.S. asylum system and deploy as many as 2,000 lawyers to the southern border.
O’Rourke says he would work with Congress to pass measures that create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants, including Dreamers and those with Temporary Protected Status. He also favors easing naturalization protocols, increasing visa caps and establishing a new visa category “whereby communities and congregations can welcome refugees through community sponsorship of visas.”
Diplomatically, O’Rourke says his administration would join with Northern Triangle countries “to fight violence and poverty and bolster our shared security and prosperity.” O’Rourke also pledged to “be firm with the economic and governing elites” of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
How much would it cost?
There are few dollar figures in O’Rourke's proposal. He calls for a $5 billion investment in the Northern Triangle region, “primarily through non-governmental organizations, community groups … and congregations, and public-private partnerships.”
How would he pay for it?
It’s not entirely clear. But O’Rourke argues that immigration reform “will be critical to unlocking” America’s “future success.” Immigrants driving economic growth, O’Rourke claims, will add $2 billion to state and local tax revenues every year and cut the deficit by at least $1 trillion over the next two decades.
What have other Democrats proposed? Julián Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has unveiled a detailed immigration plan . He calls for ""a pathway to full and equal citizenship"" for 11 million undocumented immigrants, splitting up the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and establishing ""a 21st century Marshall Plan for Central America.""
Who would it help?
O’Rourke’s proposal would help younger immigrants known as Dreamers, asylum seekers and Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure beneficiaries.
Who opposes it?
The plan is likely to meet opposition from allies of the president and Republican lawmakers who support the Trump administration’s array of tough immigration policies, which O’Rourke is seeking to largely dismantle."
‘Sexist trash’: Hillary Clinton slams Facebook for keeping up Pelosi videos,www.politico.com,QUINT FORGEY,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/sexist-trash-hillary-clinton-1347209,"Hillary Clinton on Wednesday slammed Facebook for refusing to remove doctored videos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, admonishing the social network for its controversial decision to keep up what Clinton called “sexist trash.”
Those remarks from the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee came during her commencement address to Hunter College’s graduating class at Madison Square Garden in New York, as she was discussing foreign interference in U.S. elections and other threats to American voters.
Story Continued Below
“The big social media platforms know their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation — but they won’t get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it,” Clinton said.
“And we saw why it’s so important just last week, when Facebook refused to take down a fake video of Nancy Pelosi,” she continued. “It wasn’t even a close call. The video is sexist trash. And YouTube took it down but Facebook kept it up.”
The videos of Pelosi, which began disseminating online last week, are digitally manipulated to slow the speaker’s speech in a manner that suggests she was drunk or otherwise physically impaired.
YouTube, a Google subsidiary, has removed the videos from its platform, saying in a statement that the clips “violated our policies.” But a Facebook spokesperson in a statement to POLITICO said the company did not “have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true.”
The videos became a flashpoint last week in a bitter feud between Pelosi and President Donald Trump, with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani sharing one such clip on Twitter and the president telling reporters at an official White House event that the speaker is “a mess” who has “lost it.”
Clinton first criticized the videos as “sexist trash“ during a speech in Houston to the Harris County Democratic Party on Friday, saying that they were “a sign that Trump is running scared.“ In her remarks to the graduates on Wednesday, however, she directed her ire squarely at Facebook.
“Let’s send a message to Facebook that those who are in Facebook’s communities would really like Facebook to pay attention to false and doctored videos before we are flooded with them over the next months,” Clinton said.
Hours earlier, Pelosi bashed the tech giant as “willing enablers of the Russian interference in our election” during an interview with a San Francisco radio station.
“We have said all along, poor Facebook, they were unwittingly exploited by the Russians,” she sad. “I think wittingly, because right now they are putting up something that they know is false. I think it’s wrong. I can take it. … But [Facebook is] lying to the public.”
Clinton on Wednesday also accused the Trump administration of having “too often worked to tear down hard-won civil rights“ instead of “standing up against bigotry and white supremacy,“ and invoked the 1939 Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden — where the graduates were receiving their diplomas 80 years later.
“That‘s right. Twenty-thousand Nazis and Nazi sympathizers right here in the heart of the most diverse city in the world,“ Clinton said, adding: “Today, I wish that felt like ancient history.“"
Israel headed to elections again as Netanyahu fails to form government,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/israel-netanyahu-elections-1346929,"JERUSALEM — Israel’s parliament voted to dissolve itself early Thursday, sending the country to an unprecedented second snap election this year as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition before a midnight deadline.
The dramatic vote, less than two months after parliamentary elections, marked a setback for Netanyahu and sent the longtime leader’s future into turmoil.

Netanyahu, who has led Israel for the past decade, had appeared to capture a fourth consecutive term in the April 9 election. But infighting among his allies, and disagreements over proposed bills to protect Netanyahu from prosecution stymied his efforts to put together a majority coalition.
Rather than concede that task to one of his rivals, Netanyahu’s Likud party advanced a bill to dissolve parliament and send the country to the polls for a second time this year.
“I didn’t spare any effort to avoid unnecessary elections,” Netanyahu said after the vote, lashing out at an ally-turned-rival, Avigdor Lieberman, who refused the prime minister’s offers to join the government.
He said the country was being forced to hold “unnecessary, wasteful elections because the people had their say. They didn’t have their say enough for what Mr. Lieberman wants.”
Had the deadline passed without the vote, Israel’s president would have given another lawmaker, most likely opposition leader Benny Gantz, an opportunity to put together a coalition.
After the vote, Gantz angrily accused Netanyahu of choosing self-preservation over allowing the country’s political process to run its course.
Gantz said that Netanyahu opted for “three crazy months” of a new campaign and millions of wasted dollars over new elections because he is “legally incapacitated” by looming indictments. “There is no other reason,” Gantz said.
The country now plunges into a new election campaign that will last at least three months under Israeli law. With much of the country on vacation in late August, a tentative date of Sept. 17 was set.
The campaign looks to complicate Netanyahu’s precarious legal standing. Israel’s attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against him in three separate corruption cases, pending a hearing scheduled for October.
Even if Netanyahu wins the election, it is unlikely he will be able to form a government and lock down the required political support for an immunity deal before an expected indictment. That would force him to stand trial and put heavy pressure on him to step aside.
The political uncertainty could also spell trouble for the White House’s Mideast peace efforts. The U.S. has scheduled a conference next month in Bahrain to unveil what it says is the first phase of its peace plan, an initiative aimed at drawing investment into the Palestinian territories.
With the Palestinians, who accuse the U.S. of being unfairly biased toward Israel, opposed to the plan, and Netanyahu preoccupied with re-election, it remains unclear how the Americans will be able to proceed. President Donald Trump’s top Mideast adviser, son-in-law Jared Kushner, was in Israel and scheduled to meet with Netanyahu on Thursday.
That Netanyahu struggled to secure a majority coalition in the 120-seat parliament was a shocking turn of events for the country’s dominating political figure.
In the April 9 vote, Likud and its hardline nationalist and religious parties captured a majority of 65 seats.
The immediate cause of the crisis was his dispute with Lieberman, a former aide who leads the small Yisrael Beitenu faction.
The men had clashed over Lieberman’s demand to subject ultra-Orthodox religious males to the military draft, which is compulsory for most Jewish males. Without Lieberman’s five Knesset seats, Netanyahu had no parliamentary majority.
But the deeper issue is connected to Netanyahu’s legal troubles. Facing a likely indictment, he had pushed his coalition partners to pass legislation that would grant him immunity and curb the powers of the country’s Supreme Court.
Opposition parties strongly oppose granting Netanyahu immunity, robbing him of any alternatives to Lieberman as he tried to form a coalition.
For the past two decades, Lieberman has alternated between being a close ally and a thorn in the side of his former boss. He has held a number of senior Cabinet posts, including defense minister and foreign minister.
Lieberman’s base of support is fellow immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and he takes a hard line toward the Palestinians but also is staunchly secular.
He has demanded that the parliament pass pending legislation that requires young ultra-Orthodox men to be drafted into the military. Years of wide exemptions for religious men have generated resentment among the rest of Jewish Israelis, who are required to serve.
“I am not against the ultra-Orthodox community. I am for the state of Israel. I am for a Jewish state but against a Halachic state,” Lieberman wrote on Facebook early Wednesday, using a term that refers to a Jewish state governed by Jewish law.
The ultra-Orthodox parties consider conscription a taboo, fearing that military service will lead to immersion in secularism, and insist the exemptions should stay in place. Netanyahu, dependent on the parties’ political support, says they have compromised enough and refuses to press them further.
Netanyahu maintained contacts with Lieberman and other parties in hopes of forging a deal as a parliamentary debate took place. Many of the Likud speakers lashed out at Lieberman, accusing him of forcing an unnecessary election.
But as a parliamentary debate stretched toward midnight, it became clear there would be no compromise.
A bitter Netanyahu claimed after the vote that Lieberman “had no intention” to compromise and made unrealistic demands. “He is dragging the entire country for another half a year of elections,” he said."
Trump appeals order partially blocking border wall funding,www.politico.com,IAN KULLGREN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/trump-border-wall-funding-1484154,"The Trump administration on Wednesday asked a federal judge to allow construction of the president’s border wall to commence while it appeals an unfavorable ruling from last week.
In court filings, the Justice Department said it would appeal a federal judge‘s decision to halt a $1 billion transfer of Pentagon counter-drug funding to cover expansions of two border barriers. The administration said the planned sections of border wall — in Yuma, Ariz. and El Paso, Texas — sit atop Homeland Security’s list of priorities due to high volumes of drug smuggling through those areas.
“Unless stayed, the Court’s injunction will irreparably harm the Government (and the public) by prohibiting the Government from taking critical steps to stop the flow of illegal drugs from entering the country through the southern border,” DOJ attorneys wrote. “Large quantities of illegal drugs are being smuggled into the country through the Yuma and El Paso sectors, including by transnational criminal organizations.“
The administration asked the district court to make a decision by next Wednesday while it appeals to the Ninth Circuit.
Oakland, Calif.-based U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam had blocked President Donald Trump’s fund transfer’s last week, rejecting the government’s argument that the move was based on “unforseen” need. The administration had planned to start construction on the Yuma section this week, DOJ attorneys wrote.
In its Wednesday filing, the administration argued that taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for the stalled projects at rates of $195,000 a day for the El Paso section and $20,000 a day for the Yuma section, since the contractors will have to be reimbursed for costs they incur during the shutdowns, including site security.
All told, the government said it could face costs of $6 million a month for the stalled projects — outweighing the “aesthetic and recreational interests“ of the Sierra Club, which filed the lawsuit with the Southern Border Communities Coalition.
“These expenditures will come out of the finite funds available for border barrier construction and will thus irreparably harm the Government’s border barrier construction efforts,” the DOJ attorneys wrote.
Congress last year rejected Trump’s request for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, leading to the 35-day partial government shutdown in December and January. Although Congress passed a spending package in February that gave $1.4 billion for roughly 55 miles of new border barriers, Trump declared a national emergency to unlock an additional $6.7 billion.
Trump, in response to Friday’s ruling, called Gilliam an “activist Obama appointed judge“ who ruled in favor of “crime, drugs and human trafficking.“

Dems chafe at high bar to make DNC presidential debates,www.politico.com,ELENA SCHNEIDER,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/dnc-democratic-presidential-debates-1347273,"The Democratic National Committee’s stricter new requirements for presidential contenders to appear in party debates this fall triggered swift backlash Wednesday from Democratic candidates, many of whom are now in danger of being cut from the showcase events in September and October.
Some campaigns have already been struggling to reach the 65,000-donor threshold — or secure one percent in three qualified polls — to gain access to the first debates in June and July. But the DNC’s new criteria for the next round of debates — support from 130,000 unique donors as well as at least 2 percent support in four polls — is set to winnow out senators, governors and a number of other Democratic candidates who are not on a trajectory to hit the polling requirement and could have particular trouble hitting the donor requirement absent a viral moment or another future campaign-shaking event.
“The DNC is playing a gatekeeping function and they’re creating a filter to determine which candidates can make their arguments to the American people,” former Rep. John Delaney, who is largely self-funding his presidential campaign, said in an interview with POLITICO after sending a letter to the DNC to request more information on how the requirements were set. “A lot of very consequential rules are being created by the DNC, and we don’t know what goes into them.”
The rules are also reshuffling spending priorities among less-prominent candidates, some of whom have shifted plans to hire organizers based in Iowa or New Hampshire in order to pour money into donation-generating digital advertising.
Ads about making the debate stage have comprised the biggest slice of Democratic presidential advertising on Facebook, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital firm.
“Whether it’s hiring organizers, staffing, polling, any normal things that you do to build an operation — all has to get readjusted and cut because you now have to run Facebook ads,” said one Democratic presidential aide, granted anonymity to discuss the issue candidly. “You’re not building a movement that way.
“They are decimating the field,” the aide continued.
Another concern among Democratic strategists is that the donation criteria are forcing candidates ""to blow up inboxes"" with a high volume of fundraising emails to have a shot at the debate stage, potentially alienating the small-dollar donors who have become so valuable to Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot, said Jason Bresler, a Democratic consultant and the former political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
But the newer thresholds highlights the difficulty the parties — and the candidates — have with a field of two dozen candidates, some of whom are building national campaigns and some of whom appear more focused on using the presidential race as a platform. DNC Chairman Tom Perez has also long intimated that requirements to qualify for later debates would get steeper.
“For the debates to be meaningful, they have to winnow down the participants,” said Patti Solis Doyle, who managed Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. “This is the uncomfortable reality both the DNC and the candidates have to face.”
DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa defended the DNC’s debate qualifications as “fair, transparent and appropriate for each phase of the primary season,” she said in a statement. “We are confident that the two sets of criteria we have announced thus far achieve those goals, and have been communicated to candidates months before each debate.""
Some campaigns have been concerned for weeks that the donor criteria for future DNC debates could shoot upward, and 2020 candidates on the bubble have spoken out more forcefully in recent weeks.
“I don’t think they should be winnowing the field,” Sen. Michael Bennet, who only jumped into the presidential race this month, told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday. “I certainly don’t think the DNC should be favoring national fundraising and cable television over the early states like New Hampshire.”
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has echoed that criticism, arguing that the criteria aren’t a measure of success, electability or candidate quality. Gillibrand, who was one of the premier online fundraisers in the Democratic Party in 2017 and 2018, is still striving to hit the 65,000-donor criteria for the first debates, though she has qualified via polling. (Gillibrand amassed more than 65,000 unique online donors in just the first quarter of 2017 for her Senate bid, as she voted against a string of Cabinet nominees during the early days of the Donald Trump administration, according to a POLITICO analysis of FEC data.)
And some candidates and Democratic operatives said that the DNC’s latest criteria could disproportionately affect candidates of color and female candidates.
“It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to look at that criteria and know who's going to get kicked out,” said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run. “It’s easy to see that the debates in the fall are going to be a bunch of white men and, if that’s the case, that’s a big misstep.”
Four candidates have already publicly said they have crossed the new, higher donor threshold: Buttigieg, Harris, Sanders and Warren. O'Rourke and Biden each got roughly 100,000 individual donors on their campaign launch days, meaning they could have passed the 130,000 threshold by now.
Seven others have publicly said they’ve hit the halfway mark to 130,000: Booker, Castro, Gabbard, Inslee, Klobuchar, Williamson and Yang. (Yang tweeted he needed another “20,000 or so” donors to hit the new threshold on Wednesday, calling it “very doable.”) Among the candidates scrambling to catch up: Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only candidate running who has carried a Trump state.
In early polling, just eight candidates have crossed the modest 2 percent threshold in four qualifying polls: Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Klobuchar, Booker, Buttiigeg and O’Rourke. None of these early polls will count toward qualifying for the later debates; only polls publicly released after the first debate in June will count in the criteria for the fall debates.
But the donation number has defenders, who argue that being able to amass a strong base of donors is an important way a campaign can prove viability, both in the primary and ahead of the general election.
“I think the number of grassroots donors you can bring in can be a leading indicator for how a candidate can connect” with voters, said Dan Kalik, a senior political advisor to MoveOn.org.
Other activist groups — including some who do not always see eye-to-eye with the DNC — voiced their approval for the increased grassroots threshold.
“Especially given what happened in 2016, the DNC is right to be concerned about any action they take to prematurely winnow the field,” Democracy for America communications director Neil Sroka said. “That said, the fact they’re not just relying on polling ... and centering and welcoming into the fight people with a lot of grassroots support … struck us about as good as you can expect in terms of a requirement,” saying a fall debate stage packed with candidates with no viable path to the nomination could ultimately be detrimental to voters.
Yet these changes to the DNC’s primary rules sets thresholds for candidates long before votes are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire — once considered the official start to the nominating process. It’s “fundamentally transformed” the way presidential campaigns are run, said another presidential staffer, granted anonymity to discuss the issue.
“It seems like an artificially early time to cut off insurgent campaigns,” the staffer said."
Mueller remarks put Barr back into harsh spotlight,www.politico.com,ELIANA JOHNSON,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/robert-mueller-william-barr-1346881,"Moments after Robert Mueller gave brief concluding remarks about his Russia probe on Wednesday, the former Republican New Jersey governor and sometime Trump adviser Chris Christie declared that the special counsel’s statement “definitely contradicts what the attorney general said when he summarized Mueller’s report.”
Christie wasn’t alone. The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff called Mueller’s statement a “direct rebuke of Attorney General William Barr,” arguing that Barr had “deliberately and repeatedly misled the American people.” And while she didn’t mention Barr by name, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “greatly disappointed with the Department of Justice for their misrepresentation of the Mueller report.”
Even though Mueller’s remarks focused on his findings about Russian election meddling and whether President Donald Trump obstructed his probe, it was clear that he had also thrown the klieg lights back on to his old friend Barr — rekindling anger over suspicions that Trump’s attorney general has been carrying water for the president.
And if Mueller was not engaging directly in a food fight, cable news networks did the job for him, playing side-by-side reels of Mueller and Barr’s seemingly conflicting statements nearly all of Wednesday afternoon.
Wittingly or not, Mueller spotlighted differences with Barr on several points. While Barr stated in his April news conference that there was “no evidence of collusion,” Mueller said Wednesday he found “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.” And while Mueller gave a nod to Congress when he said that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” Barr said he hoped Mueller hadn’t intended to leave the decision to Congress “since we don’t convene grand juries and conduct criminal investigations for that purpose.”
Those differences will help to ensure that Barr continues to be a central figure for the remainder of Trump’s term, a boogeyman to liberals who have called for his impeachment, and an increasing favorite of the president, who has long wanted a loyal attorney general and cheered Barr as he has initiated an investigation of the FBI’s Russia investigation.
Perhaps the most significant divergence between Barr and Mueller, who are longtime friends, dating back to their service at the Department of Justice during the George H.W. Bush administration, came on the explosive question of a potential indictment of Trump for obstructing justice. In Mueller’s telling, a Justice Department policy that a sitting president cannot be indicted guided his investigation and informed his decision not to reach a conclusion about whether Trump obstructed justice. Charging the president with a crime was “not an option,” Mueller said, and accusing him of committing one when he could not try the case in court, Mueller added, violated what he considered “principles of fairness.”
Barr, however, seemed to leave a different impression in his own public statements. Speaking to reporters before the release of Mueller’s report in April, and again to lawmakers earlier this month, Barr said Mueller had told him the DOJ policy was not the chief reason he did not charge the president with a crime. “Special counsel Mueller stated three times to us … that he emphatically was not saying that but for the OLC opinion he would have found obstruction,” Barr told a Senate panel in early May. OLC, or the Office of Legal Counsel, is the Justice Department office whose legal guidance has typically been used to mediate between government agencies.
Mueller said nothing that wasn’t in his report, which was publicly released April 18. But many political and legal observers were struck by the emphasis he placed on his reasoning behind not bringing obstruction charges against Trump, and his assertion that if his team “had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”
“He devoted a third of his only public statement to explaining why the office didn’t charge the president with obstruction, which I think tells you something that was important both to clarify because he thought was important but also for the American public to understand,” said a former White House official interviewed by the special counsel’s office.
Both Barr and Mueller on Wednesday evening sought to tamp down the fury over their perceived split. In a rare joint statement from Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec and Special Counsel spokesman Peter Carr, the two said, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements.”
That may technically be true. But Barr’s critics insisted Wednesday that it was a misleading characterization, one that gave the impression that Mueller had said the evidence did not support indicting Trump. Schiff’s statement insisted that Mueller “made clear that, because of the Department’s own policy, it is left it to Congress — not the attorney general — to evaluate and further investigate the president’s misconduct.”
Mueller allies said they thought the special counsel was seeking to clarify why he declined to reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice rather than to pick a fight with the attorney general.
“When I looked at his report there was one section that was open to interpretation,” said Philip Mudd, who worked closely with Mueller during his tenure as FBI director. “I think he looked at that and said, ‘I’m going to clarify that in 8, 9, 10 minutes.’ And that’s what he did. I don’t think Mueller is interested in a ‘He said, she said.’”
It’s not the first indication of tension between the two.
Mueller on Wednesday referred obliquely to a March 27 letter he had sent Barr, after the attorney general first announced his conclusions about Mueller’s then-unreleased report, urging the immediate release of executive summaries of it.
But Mueller seemed to backpedal from any confrontation over the issue by expressing his appreciation for Barr’s decision to make public the vast majority of the report. Mueller also said that he wasn’t questioning Barr’s “good faith” in deciding to wait until a more complete version of the report was ready for release."
"Ohio advances coal, nuclear subsidies after pressure from ...",www.politico.com,,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/ohio-coal-nuclear-trump-1347274,"The Ohio House approved a bill Wednesday to gut clean energy standards and subsidize at-risk nuclear and coal plants after a last-minute push from a Trump reelection official to secure its passage.
Bob Paduchik, a senior adviser to the Trump reelection campaign, made calls Tuesday night to at least five members of the Ohio House of Representatives, pressuring them to vote ‘yes’ on the bill, five people familiar with the outreach told POLITICO. Sources said Paduchik emphasized preserving jobs at the Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear plants, both located in northeastern Ohio on the shores of Lake Erie. Backers of the bill say the plants support a total of 4,000 jobs once contractors and suppliers are added to the mix.
""The message is that if we have these plants shut down we can’t get Trump reelected,"" said one senior legislative source with knowledge of the conversations. ""We’re going into an election year, we can’t lose the jobs.""
Paduchik did not return requests for comment, but confirmed to a local reporter that he called lawmakers to support the bill, saying he did so as a personal matter.
“People ask me for my advice and opinion on things on politics, but they also ask me for my advice and opinion on electricity and power issues,” Paduchik told Cleveland.com . “Honestly, I think diversity in electricity generation is a strength in this nation, and I’m concerned that we lose that in Ohio if we shut down these two plants.”
The bill, which would create a $300 million subsidy program for two nuclear plants and two coal plants in the state, passed 53-43 Wednesday afternoon. It now heads to the state Senate.
Owner FirstEnergy Solutions has threatened to shut the plants down if they are not subsidized, and Cleveland.com reports Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, and labor union leaders made similar arguments in other 11th hour calls to lawmakers.
Legislators contacted by Paduchik include Republican Reps. Don Manning, Darrell Kick, Laura Lanese, Reggie Stoltzfus and Dave Greenspan, sources told POLITICO. The sources requested anonymity because they have other business before the legislature.
Paduchik led President Trump’s successful 2016 campaign in Ohio, after which he became co-chair of the Republican National Committee. In December, the Trump 2020 campaign announced he would return to oversee the president’s reelection bid in the crucial Midwestern swing state.
The White House referred questions on Paduchick's involvement to the Trump campaign, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In addition to Paduchik, three sources said some legislators received calls from two members of the Ohio delegation to the U.S. House — Republican Reps. Steve Stivers and Bob Gibbs. Their offices did not return requests for comment.
FirstEnergy Solutions, which split from utility FirstEnergy in a bankruptcy proceeding last year, said it did not engage Paduchik or the House members on its behalf. FirstEnergy’s political action committee has supported Trump, DeWine and Ohio Republicans in the past, and CEO Chuck Jones met with the president and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry on energy policy before the utility and subsidiary split.
“FirstEnergy Solutions is not working with the Administration in any way, either directly or through proxies. There has been no engagement,” a spokesperson said in an email. The company also said it did not work with “the Trump campaign or the Ohio Congressional Delegation on HB 6.”
Along with subsidizing the nuclear plants, HB 6 would also increase existing payments to two large coal plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, a conglomeration of Midwestern utilities. To pay for the new subsidies, the bill would eliminate the state’s energy efficiency standard and its 12.5 percent-by-2027 renewable energy standard, which are financed on customer utility bills.
Approval in the House means the bill will now move to the Senate. Insiders told POLITICO earlier this week that chamber could take longer to debate the bill, which could create a conundrum for FirstEnergy Solutions, which must decide next month whether to refuel the Perry plant or move ahead with shutdown procedures.
Analysts at ClearView Energy, however, predicted that final passage is likely before the last scheduled day of the legislative session, June 26.
“While we see fewer outspoken supporters in the GOP-controlled State Senate, we think sufficient support among Republicans and Governor Mike DeWine’s (R) advocacy for H.B. 6 could animate approval in the upper chamber,” analyst Tim Fox wrote in a note to clients Wednesday."

2 executives depart The Nature Conservancy after harassment probe,www.politico.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/the-nature-conservancy-harassment-probe-1488630,"Two senior officials at The Nature Conservancy, one of the world's most influential environmental groups, have exited the organization after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.
The departures of Mark Burget, who headed the group's North American operations, and Kacky Andrews, who led global programs, were announced in an email Tuesday from CEO Mark Tercek to staff. It said the group’s president, Brian McPeek, who stepped into ""a less active role"" during an investigation, will now return to his job.
The Nature Conservancy’s investigation into allegations of sexual harassment comes amid rising scrutiny of executives of several companies and organizations, as the #MeToo movement has heightened attention to pervasive mistreatment of women.
The Nature Conservancy, considered the world's largest environmental organization, has long had fans on both sides of the political aisle and around the globe, appealing to both liberal environmentalists seeking to preserve sensitive regions as well as conservatives who support its mission to protect areas for recreation. It listed nearly $1.3 billion in total revenue and support in 2018.
A spokesperson for The Nature Conservancy on Wednesday night confirmed the departures of Burget and Andrews and that McPeek remains the president.
The moves laid out in the memo follow the conclusion of an internal investigation of the organization’s workplace culture by the law firm McDermott Will & Emery. Tercek wrote that the investigation revealed that female employees believed The Nature Conservancy’s “culture can make it difficult for women to thrive.”
That investigation found that “[s]pecifically, in several instances where there were serious allegations of misconduct, TNC opted for no or minor discipline because TNC perceived the event as ‘he said/she said’ with no corroborating evidence. In these instances, the accused was given the benefit of the doubt,” the report said.
The report said The Nature Conservancy must update how it “approaches investigating these claims.” It faulted the organization for failing to adequately investigate anonymous claims made through its employee hotline, insufficiently training employees on how to conduct themselves — especially in the presence of alcohol and off-site — and providing too little reporting about harassment complaints to the board.
“[N]umerous employees who contacted the hotline or McDermott’s investigator reported that TNC is a male-dominated culture where it is difficult for women to flourish,” the report said.
McDermott Will & Emery was brought in to investigate by a special committee to The Nature Conservancy’s board of directors following a series of March 21 tweets by an anonymous Twitter user alleging sexual misconduct by an executive at the organization. The law firm interviewed 34 people, of whom 32 were former or current Nature Conservancy employees and 29 were women. The report said two witnesses were contacted but refused to be interviewed. The “exhaustive” review encompassed “thousands of documents,” including personnel files, emails, code of conduct, job transfer correspondence and previous sexual harassment complaints, among other items.
Complaints from four female employees against one executive that sparked the March 21 tweets were made between May 2014 and March 2018 to the organization’s hotline. A former employee later identified herself as a victim of an “unwelcome” kiss at a February 2010 conference, according to the report, which declared the woman “credible” even though the executive denied the kiss occurred.
The report said the woman “is concerned about how TNC continues to ignore a male dominant culture which is deep-rooted and prolific.”
Ultimately, though, McDermott Will & Emery did not advise reprimanding the executive because of "" the passage of time, the fact that it was not reported, and the absence of any other women coming forward.”
The report said the three other female employees named in calls to The Nature Conservancy’s hotline were the subject of claims that were largely based on rumor and perception of inappropriate relationships, interactions and promotions, which the executives and the named co-workers denied.
McDermott also wrote that two other executives — identified as Executives 2 and 3 in the report — began a romantic relationship without disclosing it to The Nature Conservancy in a timely manner as the organization's policy required. Executive No. 3 reported to executive No. 2, who was responsible for her performance review and recommended a 15 percent raise, which she received. Executive No. 2 also endorsed No. 3 for an executive committee spot, which Tercek granted, the report said.
The report found that both the raise and recommendation to the executive committee position were “a conflict of interest,” and that while the two eventually disclosed their relationship after a “thirteen-month delay,” they both were “dishonest about the status of their relationship.” Executive No. 2’s influence in executive No. 3’s executive committee post, review and raise came during the period when they were in an undisclosed relationship, the report said.
Tercek sought to close the chapter on the issue in his email, writing to staff that ""[i]t is now time for us to move forward, based not only on the report’s recommendations regarding personnel, but also in making sure that we are an organization that is leading on how it manages issues of sexual harassment or other improper work conduct and doing the work necessary to ensure a culture in which all have equal opportunities to succeed and to support our mission.""
The report added that in the future, ""those who investigate will need to make credibility determinations even when there is no corroborating evidence. Central to this determination, and what was missing in many of these investigations, is real evaluation of why/whether the person coming forward has an incentive to lie.”
The Nature Conservancy spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO: ""We are thoroughly considering and exploring the additional recommendations made by the MWE report, including how TNC can strengthen our investigation process, more thoroughly investigate anonymous claims, revamp related trainings, and improve our reporting to the Board. Mark Tercek fully supports these recommendations, and will lead the work to implement them.
""The organization is taking on a broader culture initiative to ensure that TNC is a place where everyone feels valued and respected and that there is a level playing field with equal access for all. This is our CEO's highest priority."""
Roy Moore hits back at Trump in defiant interview,www.politico.com,JAMES ARKIN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/roy-moore-hits-back-at-trump-in-defiant-interview-1487921,"A defiant Roy Moore brushed aside Donald Trump’s warning not to run for Senate again, telling POLITICO on Wednesday that Alabama voters are capable of deciding for themselves whether he’s fit for office.
“The president doesn’t control who votes for the United States Senate in Alabama,” Moore said in a phone interview. “People in Alabama are smarter than that. They elect the senator from Alabama, not from Washington, D.C.”
The scandal-plagued former judge said he is “seriously considering” running for Senate again and plans to decide in a “few weeks.”
Moore's recalcitrance comes as Republicans, including Trump, are warning him to stay out of the race against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. Republicans view the Alabama contest as a linchpin of their Senate majority — ousting Jones in 2020 would give the GOP a larger cushion with the party mostly on defense on the Senate map.
Jones narrowly defeated Moore in a special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct by Moore with young girls decades ago. Those allegations emerged after Moore won the GOP nomination by defeating the Trump-endorsed candidate, then-interim Sen. Luther Strange.
Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he has ""NOTHING"" against Moore, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge. But, he wrote, Moore “cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating.” That came after Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also tweeted at Moore to steer clear of the race.
Top allies to Senate Republican leadership have made clear they view Moore as the best chance Democrats have to maintain the seat.
“We believe most Alabama Republicans realize that nominating Roy Moore would be gift wrapping this Senate seat for Chuck Schumer,” said Steven Law, president of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
Moore is convinced he could capture his party's nomination in the face of the president's opposition again. He said some Republicans are fearful that he still has support in the state.
“They know I'll win,"" he said. ""That's why they're upset.""
He also continues to deny the multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior against him that were reported on during the 2017 race. “It was fake news then, [and] it’s fake news now,” Moore said.
Republicans have believed for weeks that Moore was likely to run for Senate again. They also acknowledge there’s little they can do to stop him, and that he has a hard-core base of supporters in the state that likely gives him both a high floor and low ceiling of support. Alabama election laws require winning a majority of the vote to secure a party nomination, so Moore could have an opening to make a runoff in a crowded primary field.
Opposition to his potential candidacy has been fairly unified throughout the party. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, had spoken with Trump in recent weeks and raised concerns about Moore, according to two people familiar with the discussion.
Trump’s tweet Wednesday was widely praised by Republicans, who believe the president is uniquely able to chip away at Moore’s support given his popularity among the GOP base in deep-red Alabama.
The dynamics of the race ""were different before the president weighed in, but they're fundamentally changed after the president weighed in,” said Josh Holmes, a top McConnell adviser. “I don't think Roy Moore could win a primary before the president weighed in, and I know he can't win one after the president weighed in.”
With or without Moore, the GOP contest appears wide open. Several Republicans are already running: Rep. Bradley Byrne, state Rep. Arnold Mooney, and Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University.
Each of the candidates face hurdles to emerging from the field. Byrne, the first candidate in the race, had more than $2 million in the bank at the end of the first quarter. Though a potential problem looms: Byrne called on Trump to step aside from the presidential race in 2016 after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Though he eventually said he would vote for Trump and has been a staunch supporter since the president took office, it’s unclear whether he can clear the hurdles of his previous criticism.
Tuberville, meanwhile, has put together a strong campaign team of veteran consultants, but he's a first-time candidate without experience as a campaigner or fundraiser. Mooney, a staunch conservative, already earned the endorsement of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) — but as a state representative, he also faces a battle to prove fundraising ability and broader support.
Leaders of the conservative Club for Growth are watching the race closely and have met with Mooney and Tuberville, who could both receive a major boost from an endorsement. The group opposes Byrne and would not back Moore if he does run. David McIntosh, the Club president, said they had “good meetings” with both Mooney and Tuberville.
“We are waiting to see if either put together a great campaign and raise the money necessary to be competitive,” McIntosh said.
If Moore does run, as appears likely, Republicans' goal would be to defeat him outright and deny him a spot in a runoff. But given his potentially unshakable base of support in the state, some Republicans acknowledge it’s possible he could make a runoff again as he did in 2017. One Republican working on the race, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said polling had shown about 15 percent of the primary electorate views Moore “very"" favorably. This Republican said in a crowded field, Moore would be unlikely to grow his support beyond that.
A second Republican involved in the race, however, said Moore has a “hard-core following” that could put him in a runoff. This Republican emphasized that Trump’s opposition would likely mean any opponent could defeat him one-on-one, but Moore making a runoff is a potentially disastrous scenario for Republicans given the unpredictability of those matchups.
“I think it's a disaster if it's misplayed,” this Republican said.
National Republicans are not yet picking a candidate to back, and the state GOP is staying out of the primary. Terry Lathan, the state party chair, said in a statement that they will remain neutral: “It is up to the candidates to make their case to the Republican primary voters to secure their support.”
The primary, set for next March, is still far away. The filing deadline is in December, leaving plenty of time for other candidates to enter the race. Even as the other candidates build their campaigns, Republicans in Washington plan to bash Moore, if he runs, as unelectable not just for the allegations of sexual misconduct, but for the other controversies in his past, including being twice removed from the state Supreme Court.
""Last time around was a sprint. This is a marathon,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the NRSC. “Roy Moore has proven he's incapable of winning a general election, and no stone will be left unturned as it pertains to his background.""

'No obstruction' no more: Mueller statement prompts shift in Trump talking points,www.politico.com,ANITA KUMAR,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/trump-strategically-changes-his-mueller-response-1346882,"It’s been a constant refrain for President Donald Trump since the April 19 release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report: “No collusion, no obstruction,” Trump has said and tweeted dozens of times.
But Mueller’s dramatic public statement on Wednesday was a powerful reminder, perhaps even to the White House, that Trump’s past comments were misleading at best.
In concluding remarks before formally leaving his post after more than two years, Mueller made clear on Wednesday that he did not determine that Trump hadn’t obstructed justice, and that “if we had had confidence the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said so.”
It was far from the “total exoneration” that Trump has repeatedly — and falsely — claimed .
The renewed attention Mueller drew to his findings also seemed to produce a subtle change from Trump and his allies. They were mostly careful not to assert that Mueller had cleared Trump outright. It seemed a retreat from more definitive statements, and a recognition that Mueller’s spoken words would have more resonance than his dense, 448-page official report.
Trump acknowledged the distinction between the exoneration he has claimed in the past and Mueller’s far less forgiving findings when he responded via Twitter on Wednesday that there was “insufficient evidence” in Mueller’s report to show he obstructed justice and that, “therefore,"" he is “innocent.""
It was an unusually mild framing by Trump, who often insists that he did nothing wrong in the Russia probe and that accusations against him are simply made up.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders later issued a statement noting that Mueller’s “report was clear — there was no collusion, no conspiracy — and the Department of Justice confirmed there was no obstruction.” In what seemed like an act of coordination, Trump’s campaign echoed that language, saying, “There was no case for obstruction.”
The change from “no collusion, no obstruction” to “no collusion, no conspiracy” was a striking shift for a White House whose rhetoric has been consistent until now. It also included more nuance about the possibility that Trump had legally obstructed Mueller’s probe than most of their previous assertions.
Not in every case, to be sure: the statement from Trump’s campaign did repeat the assertion that “President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated.”
But Trump aides and allies generally offered clearer-than-usual acknowledgments that it was Attorney General William Barr, and not Mueller, who made the determination that Trump did not obstruct justice — even as prosecutors investigated 11 instances in which the president tried to hamper the Russia probe.
Barr has said Mueller’s report does not provide the basis for charging Trump with obstruction, in part because Trump did not commit the underlying crime of conspiring with the Kremlin to interfere in the 2016 election.
But Democrats call Barr’s defense of Trump inherently suspect given that the president appointed him to the job of attorney general, and say the conclusions of Mueller, a Republican former FBI director who owes nothing to Trump, should carry far more weight.
The response from Trump and his aides on Wednesday appeared to recognize that the Mueller-led Justice Department investigation into whether the Trump campaign worked with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election is now closed and that they need to work more clearly to try to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
Jan Witold Baran, a Republican lawyer specializing in government ethics, said: “If Mueller did not recommend prosecution and the two top DOJ officials” — namely, Barr and his then-deputy, Rod Rosenstein — “concluded that there is insufficient evidence for an obstruction charge, then the House will have to impeach Trump either on the basis that all the prosecutors were wrong or on another basis.”
But Sanders told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that Trump had not changed his response.
“We've been saying the same thing for two years, before the Mueller investigation even had to start,” she said. “We knew there was no collusion, we knew there was no conspiracy and there's been no obstruction. We've been explicitly clear in that. I think I've probably said that phrase no less than a thousand times standing right here in this very spot. The message hasn't changed at all.”
Trump’s responses are always shorter, more unequivocal and more exorbitant than his aides official statements in part because he relies on Twitter shorthand. But within minutes of Mueller’s statement, Trump, the White House and the Trump campaign responded in similar ways.
Jay Sekulow, Trump’s lawyer, said in a statement that the investigation “produced no findings of collusion or obstruction against the president,” although he was careful to attribute that determination to Barr, not Mueller himself.
“The attorney general conclusively determined that there was no obstruction by the president,” he said. “In the words of Attorney General Barr: ‘The report identifies no actions that, in our judgment, constitute obstructive conduct.’”
Mueller’s statement that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to accuse a president of wrongdoing led some members of Congress to announce that they want to investigate further.
“The ball is in our court, Congress,” tweeted Justin Amash, the lone Republican lawmaker pushing for impeachment proceedings.
Elie Honig, a former federal and state prosecutor, said Trump and his aides appeared to be speaking to those lawmakers mulling impeachment proceedings and that the change in language is not for legal reasons, but political ones.
“They want to give cover to anyone who wasn’t sure about impeachment,” he said. “Their hope is the attorney general’s opinion carries weight ... He’s not just any guy. He’s the attorney general of the United States.”
That strategy is unlikely to work with some lawmakers. House Democrats have already accused Barr of acting more like Trump’s personal attorney than the U.S. attorney general and threatened to hold him in contempt for failing to release Mueller’s full report and underlying evidence.

The Wayward Special Counsel Magazine,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/29/the-wayward-special-counsel-227029,"In the end, the by-the-book Robert Mueller wildly departed from the book.
He invented an extraconstitutional legal standard for his obstruction investigation and acted, at the very least, in violation of the spirit of the special counsel regulations.
Story Continued Below
His departing act was a public statement meant to influence the public debate in a manner inappropriate for a prosecutor, in part because the public report he wrote that was inappropriate for a prosecutor failed to achieve clarity despite its hundreds of pages.
A hallmark of the Trump era is that the norm-defying president goads everyone appalled by him to violate norms. The retired Marine and former G-man would seem least likely to fall prey to this dynamic, but here we are: He has put on a master class in how a prosecutor shouldn’t behave.
First and foremost, Mueller ditched the presumption of innocence, a bedrock of the American legal system. In the normal course of things, all of us are considered innocent unless a jury finds us guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Mueller switched this around. Rather than finding conclusive evidence of Trump’s guilt, he had to find conclusive evidence of his innocence. Because he didn’t find this exculpatory evidence, he deemed Trump “not exonerated,” a standard heretofore unknown to the American system.
As he put it in his news conference, in surely one of the more gobsmacking utterances ever made by someone from a Justice Department podium, “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”
If this standard had been applied to any person other than Donald Trump, it would have been widely denounced and the American Civil Liberties Union would be crusading to keep it from ever emerging again in any context in America.
It is profoundly inimical to due process as understood under our Constitution and puts the burden of proof on the accused—exactly what our system seeks to avoid.
Naturally, Trump’s critics concluded from Mueller’s statement that if Trump hadn’t been found innocent, he must be guilty. The snarky headline on a New York magazine piece put it aptly enough, “Mueller: Trump is Not Not a Criminal.”
Well, you might say, of course Mueller departed from standard operating procedure—he’s a special counsel operating in novel circumstances that require novel approaches.
But this is not his writ. A special counsel, under the regulations, is not a freelancer making it up as he goes along. He has the “investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States attorney.” He is supposed to “comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice.”
It is one of the those rules that has caused so much confusion over the obstruction portion of the Mueller report. The DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel has said a sitting president can’t be charged with a crime. Mueller explained in his public statement that this ruling led his office to conclude it could “not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime.”
So, Mueller by his own account, conducted a two-year investigation knowing from the beginning that he wouldn’t make the either/or decision that prosecutors exist to make. Attorney General William Barr was right when he told the Senate Judiciary Committee, “At the end of the day, the federal prosecutor must decide yes or no.” Mueller decided neither.
Mueller offered several reasons in his statement for conducting an obstruction investigation anyway. One was to preserve evidence. But for what? The idea that Trump, after losing reelection in 2020, would be prosecuted as a private citizen for firing FBI Director James Comey is manifestly absurd. Another was that a president can be accused of wrongdoing in “a process other than the criminal justice system,” i.e., impeachment by Congress.
Here, Mueller is basically describing Volume 2 as an impeachment referral. But this isn’t a purpose contemplated by the special counsel regulations, which, again, were written to tether special counsels to Justice Department practice.
The regulations say that the special counsel “shall provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions.” They don’t say a special counsel shall fail to reach a prosecution or declination decision, then write a long report for congressional consumption anyway and go out and make a public statement to catalyze congressional action if he thinks his report is being misread.
That Mueller was effectively conducting an impeachment inquiry from within the executive branch represented a significant distortion of our system. It should be up to Congress, not an inferior executive branch official who’s the functional equivalent of a U.S. attorney, to launch such an inquiry. Even more bizarrely, because Mueller considered Trump’s public statements as potential obstruction, any objections by the president to this quasi-impeachment inquiry were more evidence of alleged wrongdoing.
An institutionalist who lost his way, Mueller will be lionized for the duration because he’s been so useful to Trump’s opposition, but his performance won’t age well—and shouldn’t."
"USS McCain was hidden from Trump, putting spotlight on an old feud",www.politico.com,MATTHEW CHOI,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/uss-mccain-trump-1347275,"The U.S. Navy reportedly tried to obscure the warship USS John S. McCain from President Donald Trump’s view ahead of his visit to Japan last week.
According to a report by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, the destroyer — named partly for the Arizona senator whom Trump repeatedly derided, even after his death — was concealed by tarps and other means to hide its name from the president. Sailors were also told to remove anything bearing the ship’s name, and a barge was moved in front of the ship to further block it from view.
Story Continued Below
The Journal cited an email from a military official that described the plans, which the official said were based on conversations with the White House and the Navy.
Trump has a history of feuding with the late Republican senator, who died of a brain tumor last August, and The Journal’s report has only added to the back and forth between the president and the McCain family.
“Trump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,” Meghan McCain, the senator’s daughter, wrote Wednesday night on Twitter. “There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won’t let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.”
Shortly after, Trump responded that he had no idea about the plan to hide the warship, though he did not make any direct comment relating to his relationship with the late senator.
“I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan,” Trump tweeted. “Nevertheless, @FLOTUS and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women — what a spectacular job they do!”
The USS John S. McCain was originally named for McCain’s grandfather and father, who were both Navy admirals. In July 2018, a month before his death, the senator was added as a namesake.
McCain was one of Trump’s most outspoken Republican critics and never hid his disdain for the president’s norms-bashing style. He famously broke ranks from his party by voting against Republicans’ effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, solidifying his status as persona non grata with the president.
Trump complained earlier this year that he had not been thanked for the state funeral held for McCain last year, even though he did not organize the service. As a presidential candidate in 2016, he mocked the senator, saying McCain was not a war hero because he was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
“I like people who weren’t captured,” Trump said at the time."

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Comment Print The Tariff Man is on track to hit hard again this summer, and it's bad news for EU companies ranging from Dutch cheesemakers to industrial heavyweight Airbus.
European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström warned the EU's trade ministers at a meeting on Monday that they need to steel themselves for U.S. President Donald Trump to hit billions of euros worth of European goods with tariffs, ramping up a decadeslong dispute over unwarranted subsidies for Airbus.
Three officials in the room said Malmström warned them that the U.S. has rejected attempts to negotiate a deal on aviation subsidies and added that Washington is now willing to proceed with the tariffs, which would be legal under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.
""We should brace for this,"" the officials cited Malmström as saying.
Although the WTO ruled that not only Airbus but also its American competitor Boeing benefited from illegal state aid, the U.S. case against Airbus is more advanced. Washington said last month it wants to levy retaliatory tariffs on up to $21 billion of European products, a decision that still needs to be confirmed by a WTO arbitrator. The verdict is expected to come in July.
""I cannot see any reason to make basically the U.S. cheese aficionados pay for the aircraft battle"" — Léa Vitali from the European Dairy Association
""There is a big probability that the U.S. will apply these tariffs as soon as the WTO arbitrator has ruled,"" said one EU diplomat who attended Malmström's briefing. The diplomat added that the U.S. duties would likely hit the EU by the end of July or early August: ""It's what this U.S. administration likes.""
An official from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that Washington has stressed throughout the dispute that it is seeking a negotiated outcome. “It is our hope and expectation that the additional duties, if needed, will provide an incentive for the EU, once and for all, to stop subsidizing Airbus in ways that have adverse effects on the United States,” the official said.

‘Stable genius’ Trump has spent decades fixating on IQ,www.politico.com,ANDREW RESTUCCIA,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/donald-trump-iq-intelligence-1347149,"It was January 2004 and Donald Trump was on the “Today Show” to promote a new reality TV series called “The Apprentice.”
Almost immediately after the interview began, Trump started bragging about the unparalleled intellect of the contestants who would compete for a job at one of his companies.
“These are 16 brilliant people. I mean, they have close to 200 IQs, all of them,” he told host Matt Lauer. “And some may be beautiful and some may not be beautiful. But everybody has an incredible brain.”
It wasn’t the first time Trump fixated on IQ as a measure of a person’s worth — or, as is frequently the case, worthlessness. And it wouldn’t be the last. Fifteen years later, Trump, now president of the United States, still uses IQ as a shorthand for intelligence, dividing the people in his orbit into winners and losers.
In private, according to interviews with a half-dozen people close to him, Trump frequently asserts that people he likes have genius-level IQs. At various points during his presidency, he’s told aides that Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Apple CEO Tim Cook are high-IQ individuals, for example, former White House officials said. Trump has also dubbed himself a “very stable genius” on multiple occasions.
And the president is quick to accuse his political enemies of having low IQs, as he did when he repeated North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his leading Democratic challengers.
“I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a ‘low IQ idiot,’ and many other things, whereas I related the Quote: of Chairman Kim as a much softer ‘low IQ individual,’” Trump said Tuesday after the Biden campaign criticized him for tweeting during his trip to Japan that he smiled when Kim insulted Biden’s intelligence .
While the exact reason for Trump’s IQ obsession is difficult to nail down, people who know him suspect it stems in part from his desire to project an image of success and competence, despite scattered business failings and repeated allegations from critics that he’s incompetent. Trump is also known for being thin-skinned. He often fires back at anyone who criticizes him with a barrage of insults, while simultaneously building himself up.
“I don’t think you have to put him on the couch to see that someone who has such a consistent need to build himself up and belittle everyone else must have some problems with self-esteem,” said Trump biographer Gwenda Blair, who wrote a book about the Trump family. “It’s a lifelong theme for him.”
“Part of it comes from his insecurities about not being perceived as intelligent,” a former White House official added.
In recent years, Trump has accused Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro , Washington Post staffers, former President George W. Bush , comedian Jon Stewart, Republican strategist Rick Wilson , MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, and Rick Perry , now his Energy secretary, of having low IQs.
He once suggested he’d like to compare his IQ to that of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, adding, “And I can tell you who is going to win.” He privately mocked former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ intelligence, according to a former White House official. All the while, Trump has claimed his Cabinet has the highest IQ of any assembled in history.
“Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault,” Trump tweeted in 2013.
Just last week, the president again referred to himself as an “extremely stable genius,” and he has spent years insisting he has a high IQ score, though he has never revealed the exact number. When a Twitter critic challenged him in 2013 to prove his high IQ, Trump responded simply, “The highest, asshole!”
Democrats are increasingly fed up with Trump's name calling, encouraging journalists to ignore it altogether and arguing it's a sign that the president isn't serious about policy or governing.
Trump has been obsessing over IQ and pedigree for decades, long before he moved to the White House. Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization official, recalled that Trump used to brag about one of his executives graduating from Yale Law School at the top of the class, even though Yale Law doesn’t rank its students. Trump later made the same false assertion about Brett Kavanaugh.
“He always used to say that he had a very high IQ,” Res added, recalling her decade-plus working alongside him.
Trump’s black-and-white view of intelligence was formed long before psychologists embraced a more nuanced definition of the term. In 1983, for example, developmental psychologist Howard Gardner put forward his theory of multiple intelligences, which stressed that people learn in many different ways and suggested IQ tests were too narrow.
“Measuring someone’s intelligence is not simply a matter of taking one test with a sharpened No. 2 pencil. Donald Trump came of age before that whole notion, for sure,” Blair said. “He’s still thinking in terms of that No. 2 pencil.”
Recently, however, IQ measurement has found increasing resonance among alt-right and white supremacist groups, who have linked IQ and race to argue for limits on immigration from certain ethnic groups.
Trump, who attended the Wharton School of business at the University of Pennsylvania, has an affinity for people who graduated from prestigious universities.
He warmed up to his former staff secretary, Rob Porter, once he learned that Porter attended Harvard University and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, according to two people familiar with the matter. “This guy is so smart,” he’d sometimes tell other staffers of Porter. “He was a Rhodes Scholar!”
He was similarly impressed with the credentials of his two Supreme Court picks: Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The president has regularly touted their Ivy League educations in conversations with allies, and White House aides believe attending a top-tier law school is one of Trump’s prerequisites for any future nominee to the high court.
Trump has also frequently mentioned his late uncle, a former physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calling him “a great, brilliant genius,” last year.
But Trump himself has long been reluctant to reveal any details about his own schooling. Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen told lawmakers in February that his boss regularly instructed him to pressure the reality TV star’s alma maters with letters warning of jail time if they released Trump's grades.
“I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant, but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,” Cohen told the House Oversight Committee.
The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did it respond to an inquiry about Trump’s IQ score.
The president’s elitism stands in stark contrast to the central messages of his campaign, which promised to upend establishment Washington and sought to appeal to disaffected white working-class voters. But Trump’s advisers say the dichotomy works in his favor, arguing that the president’s business experience and lavish lifestyle is one of the things that makes him appealing to his base.
“He’s a populist in a way, but he’s a populist only in terms of his policies,” said another former White House official. “His personal message has always had a real elitist flavor to it.”

First 2020 debate puts Democrats on edge,www.politico.com,DAVID SIDERS,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/democrats-debate-2020-1346883,"Qualifying for the first Democratic presidential debate was the easy part. Now comes the challenge of preparing for it.
With the debate in Miami less than a month away, at least a half-dozen major candidates have begun to block out time or lighten their schedules to prepare.
On telephone calls and in conference rooms, advisers are peppering them with potential questions. The candidates are practicing tightening their answers, cognizant of the 7 to 10 minutes of total speaking time they expect to be allotted. And they are watching clips of the 2016 Republican presidential primary debates to familiarize themselves with the dynamics of debating on a crowded stage.
All of it is taking place under the expectation that the first debate will represent the most significant milepost of the campaign to date, a make-or-break event that likely will lead to the first winnowing of the crowded 23-candidate primary.
For candidates accustomed to far more control over their circumstances, the run-up is proving to be an unsettling experience.
“This is not a scenario that any of them have been in,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime Hillary Clinton confidant who played the role of then-candidate Donald Trump in Clinton’s debate preparations in 2016. “It’s almost like a particle accelerator. … It becomes a group dynamic that you can’t really control.”
Few candidates, if any, have debated nine others at once. None of the contenders knows yet whether they will appear on June 26 or 27 — as many as 20 candidates will be split over two debates on successive nights — or even whom they will be debating against. Those dynamics are combining to create a deep sense of uncertainty and frustration surrounding evenings likely to be marked by the campaign's largest national viewership yet.
One campaign adviser to one top-tier campaign likened the unknowns surrounding the debate to a “black box.” An adviser to a different campaign said: “It definitely hurts how one prepares for a debate, especially since it’s your first introduction on the national stage. … It’s tough when there is a ton of pressure to meet thresholds, and we can’t get more than two weeks to know who we will be on stage with.”
The campaigns are expected to get answers about debate logistics and format on a conference call on Thursday with Democratic National Committee officials.
But the candidates are unlikely to know on which night they will appear until about two weeks before the debate — and some candidates will continue to sweat out whether they will qualify at all.
In interviews with about a dozen campaigns, advisers said they are beginning to intensify their preparations. Several officials said they would hold campaign run-throughs with people acting as proxies for other candidates, though perhaps not with a full complement of nine actors representing nine candidates. Others are trying to anticipate from which opponents they might expect crossfire.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Sen. Kamala Harris of California are among those who recently started focusing on debate preparations. An aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told POLITICO that while it’s still too early to intensely strategize for the debate, it’s a challenge “when we don't know who we will be on stage with until a few days out” and that it would be “hard to have a moment” with 10 people competing for airtime.
Another campaign highlighted the difficulty of not knowing who all would share the stage, saying staffers who would otherwise study old debate tapes of potential competitors to “get in their heads” are instead presenting a composite of challengers in practice sessions.
""We’re preparing for a cross-section; there are a lot of candidates who have similar positions on the big issues. We know where a lot of our peers are coming from,” said an adviser to California Rep. Eric Swalwell.
For lesser-known candidates such as Swalwell, the debates present an opportunity to gain a much-needed step in the primary.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has hired a debate director, Geoff Potter, and he and his advisers have held initial calls about how to approach the first debate. Unlike a congressional, gubernatorial or Senate debate — where the resulting media coverage can be more significant than the debate itself — millions of viewers are expected to be watching next month, amplifying the significance of a live performance.
On a recent call among Inslee’s advisers about the debates, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s criticism of Trump as a “chaos candidate” in 2016 came up as an example of how one-liners can fall flat. Several other candidates have made similar calculations, with one adviser to a lower-tier candidate saying, “You can’t be artificial about this. … Voters see through it when candidates deliver a zinger.”
John Delaney, a former congressman from Maryland, has been watching recordings of both the Democratic and Republican primary debates in 2016. His communications director, Will McDonald, said, “For most people, this is going to be the first or second time they’re tuning into this contest.”
Advisers for campaigns at the bottom of polls said part of their focus in the coming weeks will be navigating how lesser-known candidates can distinguish themselves without coming across as combative.
Advisers to multiple candidates suggested that they are preparing to draw contrasts in the debate — but more likely with the Democratic field as a whole, not any candidate in particular.
“Maybe you have three minutes in a debate, four minutes; what are you going to do? Are you going to try to swing for the fences, the way [Marco] Rubio did going after Trump? Or are you going to attack somebody else?” asked Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Republican Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. “It’s just an impossible situation. … The Lincoln-Douglas debates, it wasn’t Lincoln, Douglas, Johnson, Smith, Harris, Fitzgerald, O’Reilly. It was Lincoln-Douglas.”
Lamenting the format, Stevens said the debate will not resemble a debate as much as a “multicandidate press conference.”
“It’s crazy,” he said.
One rival everyone is preparing for — and who will not appear on stage — is Trump. He’s widely expected to tweet his reactions to the debates as they unfold, and Democratic strategists said it’s possible the moderators will ask questions based on his tweets. For Democrats who have benefited politically from provoking the president, the possibility of engaging with him in real time is widely viewed as a potential boon.
But several candidates are also preparing to defend themselves against criticism of their records. That could come from other candidates — but more likely, their advisers believe, in the form of challenging prompts from the moderators. Partly for that reason, several campaigns pointed to the proliferation of televised town halls as their most significant practice for the first debate.
“I think preparing for a debate is just like preparing for a town hall,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told POLITICO recently. “You just want to be able to articulate what you’re for in a way that is concise, which is harder for me, and direct.”
Asked if she had been drilled on giving shorter answers by her staff, she said, “Not yet.”
“But I did practice it in my first town hall with MSNBC because every break we had, the producer would say, ‘OK, those were great answers, but shorter, shorter, shorter.’ I was like, ‘OK, OK, OK!’"" she added. ""So I think for my second town hall, CNN, I think, if you watched it, you’d see that the answers were shorter. So I’m getting better.”
Several advisers to candidates outside the top tier said they hope their candidates are onstage with former Vice President Joe Biden or Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont — the top two polling contenders — either to guarantee they’ll get the most eyeballs or convey an immediate contrast. One adviser of a second-tier candidate relished the thought of their candidate being onstage with Biden: “I can offer you the younger alternative of what you’re looking at right now.”
“I want to be next to Joe Biden so the country can Google, ‘Who’s the Asian man next to Joe Biden,’ and then they will discover Andrew Yang,” little-known entrepreneur Yang said. “I think that’s the ideal. I’ve done the math, and I have approximately an 8 percent chance of standing next to Joe Biden.”
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told reporters in New Hampshire recently, “It’s going to be really interesting because you’re going to have so many people, and it’s luck of the draw which night you’re going to be, who you’re going to be standing next to — maybe going to be really tall, don’t know.”
The front-runners are feeling pressure in a different way than those still trying to make an introduction to a national audience are. With so much attention on their ages, Sanders and Biden cannot have a Rick Perry-like forgetful moment. Biden will be expected to be the adult in the room. And Warren’s reputation as a policy wonk means she’ll have added expectations to drive the discussion or at least have well-thought-out responses to most questions.
As the front-runner, Biden is widely considered the most likely to face a pointed challenge from his competitors in the debate. But advisers to many of his opponents remain wary of attacking him too sharply. Even if a competitor could wound Biden in the debate, in a multicandidate field, it is unclear who would benefit.
“In 2016, if Bernie attacked Hillary and he landed a blow, it’s possible those people came to Bernie,” Reines said. “And if Hillary landed a blow on Bernie, people came to her. Now, you have a situation where [Elizabeth] Warren might take a shot at Bernie Sanders, because they’re kind of fighting for the same pool, and a voter says, ‘I don’t like Bernie’s answer, but I don’t like the way Warren asked it, so I’m going to take a hard look at Kamala.’”
He said, “You’ve got a little bit of a whack-a-mole situation, and that’s going to play out onstage.”

Bernie's biggest hurdle: His fellow senior citizens,www.politico.com,HOLLY OTTERBEIN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/bernie-sanders-older-voters-1346590,"Bernie Sanders, 77, has a problem with old people.
In poll after poll, he places a distant second behind former Vice President Joe Biden among the senior set, the demographic that has long had more sway over who becomes president than any other. His campaign acknowledges it's a problem and is trying — so far, unsuccessfully — to fix it.
It’s a familiar issue for the septuagenarian senator: In 2016, Sanders won more voters from young people than Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump combined. But Clinton crushed him among older Americans at the ballot box, denying him the nomination.
The possibility of the same weakness thwarting Sanders’ second bid for the White House looms over his campaign. Sanders’ team knows he needs to do better among older voters. The campaign is scheduling events to attract more elderly voters, including one on Thursday at a seniors community center in Nevada, and his aides are optimistic that his plans to expand Social Security and Medicare benefits will help.
But some of the same qualities that have made Sanders a folk hero among millennials could be repelling seniors. His embrace of democratic socialism and calls for a political revolution are likely a tougher sell to many older voters who lived through the Cold War and are generally more conservative. And in a year when Democrats just want to beat President Donald Trump, the Vermont independent is seen by some Democrats as less electable than, say, Biden.
“Sanders needs to find a way to connect with longer established Democratic voters, and that’s older voters,” said Bhaskar Sunkara, a Sanders supporter who founded the socialist magazine Jacobin and is a former vice chairman of Democratic Socialists of America. “It's tricky. Biden has higher perceptions of electability, and it could be hard to convince people they should be voting for Bernie when they're already familiar with this other guy, and their main concern is getting Trump out of office.""
In the latest Morning Consult weekly tracking poll, Sanders leads Biden by 12 points among Democratic primary voters under 30, and Biden has only a 1-point lead among voters aged 30-44. But Biden leads Sanders by 44 points among seniors, 53 percent to 9 percent.
Similarly, a Fox News poll conducted earlier this month showed Biden leading Sanders, 45 percent to 11 percent among Democratic voters older than 45. Among voters younger than that, Sanders was marginally ahead of Biden, 25 percent to 22 percent.
Iowa is a case study of how Sanders’ unpopularity with older voters could haunt him. In 2016, he came within three-tenths of a point of winning the first-in-the-nation caucus state. The shocking finish against the establishment-backed Clinton helped Sanders propel his campaign to heights that party leaders never expected. But it was his performance among older voters that prevented him from winning Iowa outright: Sanders overwhelmingly won voters under 45, but Clinton drubbed him, 69 percent to 26 percent, among those 65 and older, according to entrance polls.
Mark Longabaugh, a top strategist to Sanders in 2016, said Clinton benefited from a decadeslong relationship with many older voters. A similar dynamic could potentially play out with Biden, who has been in the national political spotlight for almost a half-century.
“I think Biden will benefit a great deal from this,” said Longabaugh. “Those voters that are 70 years old, they’ve gone through this long journey … they know Joe Biden. They might have voted for [Biden] in 2008 when he didn’t succeed.”
Part of Sanders’ challenge is convincing elderly voters he can actually win. Larger percentages of older Democrats want a nominee who can defeat Trump — even if they disagree with most of their views — than younger ones, according to a January poll by Monmouth University.
To that end, Sanders has been touting polls showing him beating Trump in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. His aides have also encouraged his younger supporters to lobby their older relatives to get behind him.
There’s also an ideological hurdle Sanders needs to clear. Older Americans tend to have dimmer views of socialism than people in their 20s and 30s. Sanders, a democratic socialist, has taken pains to explain his ideology, at times by embracing Franklin D. Roosevelt.
""What democratic socialism means to me is making sure that all people live with security and dignity. That was FDR’s vision over 70 years ago and it is what we must continue to fight for today,” he wrote in a recent tweet .
Sanders’ staffers are also working to sell seniors on his plans to ease their financial burdens by increasing Social Security benefits and reducing the price of prescription drugs, among other proposals.
“He has a particularly strong case to make about improving and strengthening Medicare, cutting prescription drug costs, talking about long-term care and home care for the disabled community, and expanding Social Security,” said Faiz Shakir, Sanders’ campaign manager. “All of those issues ... have an appeal to older voters.”
As he’s crisscrossed the country since launching his campaign in February, Sanders has talked about the need for Americans to retire with dignity and the fact that Medicare doesn’t cover dental and vision benefits. In a May speech to the International Association of Machinists, he vowed to block pension cuts. Some of his surrogates and well-known supporters are older, including the co-chair of his campaign, 68-year-old Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Ben Cohen.
Sanders has also begun holding more intimate town halls in early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, which tend to be more of a draw for seniors than his rallies.
But none of those moves have made a significant difference so far among older voters, who tend to vote in larger percentages than the young. (In the 2018 midterms, however, Generation Z, millennials, and Generation X outvoted baby boomers and older generations in raw numbers.)
Terry Alexander, a 62-year-old state representative in South Carolina who endorsed Sanders, said older people simply “need to get to know him a little better.” He said the campaign is planning to do that partly through an “intergenerational"" field operation.
""A lot of African Americans right now are living off their Social Security and Medicaid. He's trying to clean that up so they don't have to work all their lives and then worry,” Alexander said.
Sanders hasn’t always had a problem with seniors. When he first won elected office in 1981, ousting the incumbent mayor of Burlington by a margin of just 10 votes, a Vermont newspaper wrote that he pulled off the upset victory by lining up ""a coalition of disenfranchised city residents — low-income and working people, students and the elderly.""
Some of Sanders’ allies said he doesn’t need to win seniors outright to secure the Democratic nomination. He just needs to lose less of them.
“Our inability to win Democrats and older voters is clearly the reason we came up short. We always try to encourage young people to get out and vote, but young people just don’t vote in numbers that older voters vote,” Longabaugh said. “If he can continue to galvanize working-class voters, independents and younger voters, then he just needs to get a larger slice of some of the other constituencies.”"
Supreme Court denies hearing on bitter Indian casino battle,www.politico.com,DAVID ROGERS,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/supreme-court-indian-casino-comanche-1347276,"The legendary Comanche won’t be getting their day before the U.S. Supreme Court after the justices this week denied the tribe’s petition to be heard on legal issues arising from a bitter dispute over Washington’s handling of Indian casino applications in Oklahoma.
The fight stems from a 2017 Interior Department decision to go around the Comanche and approve — without any consultation — a rival casino project in Terral, Okla., within miles of the tribe’s ancestral lands near the Red River.
More than ever, the ensuing legal battle has exposed years of resentment over how Washington treats the poorer Plains tribes of western Oklahoma versus the more powerful and politically connected Five Civilized Tribes in the east.
Indeed, the newly-built, disputed casino is the 22nd such gaming operation in an already huge multibillion dollar empire controlled by the Chickasaw Nation, the richest of the Five.
In fact, the Comanche were blindsided that construction was already underway on the new Chickasaw casino before Interior published the required public notice in the summer of 2017. The result cost the Comanche precious time in seeking relief, and it’s haunted their efforts since in the federal courts.
Together with the Apache and other Plains tribes, the Comanche fear the Chickasaw’s westward expansion — with the blessing of Interior — threatens their more modest gaming operations and tribal income.
As it happens, the justices still have a second Indian law case pending before them that’s also rooted in Oklahoma. The legal arguments presented in the Comanche’s petition include a footnote directly referencing that case. And depending on how the court rules, the outcome could yet provide some legal footing for the Comanche in future litigation in the lower courts.
Nonetheless, the justices’ denial of the tribe’s petition this week is a setback for the Comanche, denying them a rare chance to air their grievances at a high level.
Still, any such petition for review — known as a writ of certiorari — is a long shot given the high court’s work load and the number of competing interests seeking to be heard as well.
As is typical in such cases, no explanation was given for the denial. But from the court’s website, it is known that the petition, filed in March, was scheduled for a conference of the justices on May 23. On Tuesday, it was listed as having been denied.
“Obviously the Nation is disappointed,” said Richard Grellner, the lead attorney for the Comanche and a veteran of many legal battles on behalf of the Plains tribes. Grellner, based in Oklahoma City, held out hope that a favorable high court ruling on the second Oklahoma Indian law case could give the Comanche’s claims “new life in the lower courts.”
“However, regardless of the outcome,” Grellner said, “the Nation believes Interior and the Chickasaw breached its fundamental obligations to ‘consult’ with the Comanche under a plethora of federal statutes and applicable regulations with respect to the Terral casino.”"

TOP TALKER … WSJ’S REBECCA BALLHAUS and GORDON LUBOLD: “White House Wanted USS John McCain ‘Out of Sight’ During Trump Japan Visit”: “In a May 15 email to U.S. Navy and Air Force officials, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official outlined plans for the president’s arrival that he said had resulted from conversations between the White House Military Office and the Seventh Fleet of the U.S. Navy. In addition to instructions for the proper landing areas for helicopters and preparation for the USS Wasp—where the president was scheduled to speak—the official issued a third directive: ‘USS John McCain needs to be out of sight.’
“‘Please confirm #3 will be satisfied,’ the official wrote. When a Navy commander expressed surprise about the directive for the USS John S. McCain, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command official replied: ‘First I heard of it as well.’ He said he would work with the White House Military Office to obtain more information about the order.
“Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan was aware of the concern about the presence of the USS John McCain in Japan and approved measures to ensure it didn’t interfere with the president’s visit, a U.S. official said. …
“A tarp was hung over the ship’s name ahead of the president’s trip, according to photos reviewed by the Journal, and sailors were directed to remove any coverings from the ship that bore its name. After the tarp was taken down, a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. Sailors on the ship, who typically wear caps bearing its name, were given the day off during Mr. Trump’s visit, people familiar with the matter said.” WSJ
-- @MeghanMcCain: “Trump is a child who will always be deeply threatened by the greatness of my dad’s incredible life. There is a lot of criticism of how much I speak about my dad, but nine months since he passed, Trump won’t let him RIP. So I have to stand up for him. It makes my grief unbearable.”
-- DEFENSE ONE’S KATIE BO WILLIAMS (@KatieBoWill): “Shanahan on USS McCain: ‘I never authorized... any action around the movement or activity regarding that ship. Furthermore, I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain. I would never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship’”.
-- @realDonaldTrump: “I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan. Nevertheless, @FLOTUS⁩ and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women -- what a spectacular job they do!”
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW, MUELLER EDITION …
-- ON THE SAME PAGE … Speaker NANCY PELOSI and House Judiciary Chairman JERRY NADLER are singing from identical song sheets when it comes to impeaching President DONALD TRUMP. Both said “nothing is off the table” yesterday. Of course, this is mostly meaningless, because neither of them took anything off the table before the MUELLER speech. But there had been some concern among Democratic leaders that Nadler was a bit more aggressive than Pelosi.
-- WHAT PELOSI IS SAYING … “Nothing is off the table,” the speaker said at a Commonwealth Club event in San Francisco Wednesday. “But we do want to make such a compelling case, such an ironclad case that even the Republican senate would at the time seems to be not an objective jury, will be convinced of the path that we have to take as a country.” Again, she’s clearly worried about the prolonged impeachment process that results in nothing.
-- THE NUMBERS GAME: PELOSI said the impeachment crowd in the House was “35 of them … maybe it is 38 of them out of 238.” Actually, it’s 41 -- and 42 if you include Michigan GOP Rep. Justin Amash. This represents fewer than 20% of House Democrats, and less than 10% of the House. “Many of them are reflecting their views as well as those of their constituents,” Pelosi said in SF. “Many constituents want to impeach the president. But we want to do what is right and what gets results. What gets results.”
TRANSLATION: This is still a small group of Democrats. BUT … That said, the ranks of pro-impeachment Democrats are growing by the day. House Homeland Security Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON of Mississippi Wednesday became the most recent high-ranking Democrat to call for impeachment proceedings.
-- MISJUDGING MUELLER? … AT THE END OF THE DAY, all Robert Mueller really did was reiterate what was in Volume II of his report: He wasn’t allowed to indict the president for anything, so the special counsel’s office didn’t consider it. To the extent that he leaned into the idea of impeachment, all he did was note the fact that it was up to others -- i.e., Congress -- to figure that out.
MAYBE ROBERT MUELLER is exactly who we thought he was: someone who follows rules to the letter, and views his mission in the narrowest terms possible. And maybe folks on the left are investing too much of their hopes in a guy who just doesn’t want the entire weight of American democracy on his shoulders -- and never has.
-- FORMER PROSECUTOR KEN WHITE IN THE ATLANTIC: “Wednesday’s press conference was consistent with Mueller’s image as a classic just-the-facts-ma’am G-man, a persona that frustrates anti-Trump partisans who dreamed of him as an avenging superhero. But a bit of passion shone through in two areas.” The Atlantic

Washington Couldn’t Agree on What It Was.” (Print headline: “A Message Unlikely to Change Minds.”): “At long last, the sphinx of Washington spoke on Wednesday, and here is what President Trump heard: ‘Case closed.’ Here is what the president’s adversaries heard: ‘Time to impeach.’” NYT

BAD NEWS FOR JARED … WAPO’S LOVEDAY MORRIS and MIRIAM BERGER in Jerusalem: “Israel will hold unprecedented second election after Netanyahu fails to form governing coalition”: “In a stunning turn, Israel will head to elections for a second time in less than six months after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to form a government before a midnight Wednesday deadline.
“Rather than give someone else the chance to do so, his party advanced a bill to dissolve the parliament and trigger new elections in September.
“Despite his reputation as a ­master of political maneuvering, Netan­yahu proved unable to bring Avigdor Liberman, his former defense minister, into a coalition that would give the prime minister a majority in the parliament, or Knesset. The two veteran politicians were at loggerheads over legislation sought by Liberman to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews into the military, a measure bitterly resisted by Netan­yahu’s powerful political allies in the religious parties. …

TRACKING TRADE … THE PRESIDENT’S TOP LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY: BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP, from NYT’s Glenn Thrush and Ana Swanson: “Speaker Nancy Pelosi is resisting pressure from the Trump administration to quickly approve an updated North American trade deal and is telling lawmakers and union officials that a planned study of the agreement could drag on well into the fall, people familiar with the situation said.” NYT
-- THE FALL is well later than the White House’s goal of getting this passed by the August recess. And this timing would place trade in the combustible mix of government funding and debt limit fights — and on the porch of election season.

A NEW HEADACHE? … MIAMI HERALD: “Federal prosecutors demand Cindy Yang records from Mar-a-Lago, Trump campaign”: “Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., this week sent subpoenas to Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump’s private club in Palm Beach, and Trump Victory, a political fundraising committee, demanding they turn over all records relating to Republican Party donor Li ‘Cindy’ Yang and several of her associates and companies, the Miami Herald has learned.
“Yang, a South Florida massage-parlor entrepreneur, is the target of a public corruption investigation seeking to determine if she funneled money from China to the president’s re-election campaign or otherwise violated campaign-finance laws. She became a GOP donor in the 2016 election cycle and opened a consulting company that promised Chinese businesspeople the chance to attend events at Mar-a-Lago and gain access to Trump and his inner circle.
“Some of those events were campaign fundraisers that required guests to buy tickets for entry, payments that are considered political contributions. Foreign nationals are prohibited from donating to U.S. political campaigns.” Miami Herald

Literally, this is not a man who is going to suddenly at this point of his life ’fess up to being a sexual harasser. …
“You also write that Fox News provided questions ahead of time for its interview with Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court nomination fight. Did you ask Fox for comment? No, but, again — it’s a difference between an institutional reporter and a non-institutional reporter. I don’t have to ask the silly questions. … [Contacted on Wednesday, Fox News called Mr. Wolff’s claim “pure fiction.”] ...
“As a journalist, is there a responsibility to seek out the subject’s side of the story? To gather as much information as you can?
“‘As a journalist — or as a writer — my obligation is to come as close to the truth as I possibly can. And that’s not as close to someone else’s truth, but the truth as I see it. Remember, it’s a difference between a book and something else — you don’t have to read my book, you don’t have to agree with my book. But at the end of the day, what you are going to know is that it is my book. It is my vision. It is my report on my experience. It’s not put together by a committee. What you do is a committee project at some point. What I do is not. And I’m not saying one is better than the other, they’re just different functions.’” NYT

BIRTHDAY OF THE DAY: D.C. agent Holly Page - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/playbook-birthday-holly-page-1347277,"How/where are you celebrating your birthday and with whom? “David, my fiance, is making my favorite dinner and I expect to be engaging in political debate with my 15-year-old son, Grant, and learning about tech from my 13-year-old, Colin.”
How did you get your start in politics? “I walked into the wrong office. My intention was to go to the office of the California Democratic gubernatorial nominee, but instead, I found my way to the office of California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy. The best mistake I ever made.”
What’s an interesting book/article you’re reading now or finished? And why? “Howard Stern’s new book ( ‘Howard Stern Comes Again’ ). Howard has become the most interesting and superlative interviewer of our generation. The book is the story of his journey from shock jock to now, and includes highlights from his interviews over the past several years.”
What is a trend going on in the U.S. or abroad that doesn’t get enough attention? “The rise of the non-traditional workforce -- people whose primary income is from independent and client-based work (free agents like me!). By 2020, there will be over 42 million Americans working for themselves, essentially choosing freedom over security. Politicians are still largely speaking to us like we are all working at the Slate Rock and Gravel Company with Fred Flintstone. In reality, Fred is now an Uber driver, Wilma has an online business, and the family needs health care and a retirement plan.”
How is the Trump presidency going? “I’m an optimist, so I’m choosing to view it as a long-term blessing for freedom and democracy (assuming we survive the short term). On the daily, we are reminded that democracy is fragile, it demands attention and participation. There is no guarantee to our freedoms, they must be fought for and protected, and political leadership -- at all levels of government -- matters. I think the country is in the midst of a mid-life crisis of sorts that will hopefully result in a vow renewal.”
What’s a fun fact that people in Washington might not know about you? “While in college at San Francisco State University, I worked as an undercover store detective for the now defunct I. Magnin Store in Union Square. While my general fear of getting hit in the face prevented me from being good at arresting shoplifters, on the day after Thanksgiving in 1989, I did discover a bomb intended to start the store and, specifically, the fur salon on fire.”"
Cyber Command appoints new No. 2 amid growing battle with foreign hackers,www.politico.com,MARTIN MATISHAK,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/cyber-command-deputy-leadership-1347150,"The head of U.S. Cyber Command has tapped the organization’s chief of staff to be his new deputy, filling a critical vacancy as the command looks to bolster operations to defend the 2020 elections from foreign interference.
Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, who also helms the National Security Agency, promoted Navy Rear Adm. Ross Myers to the rank of vice admiral on Memorial Day, according to Cyber Command.
Myers became chief of staff at Cyber Command headquarters in May 2018, the same month Nakasone took the reins. He fills the slot left open by Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, whose retirement was first reported by POLITICO in March. He left the command after a 40-year career in the U.S. military.
The Senate confirmed Myers last week. The Defense Department announced in March that Army Maj. Gen. John Morrison, the commander of Fort Gordon, Ga., and the Army’s Cyber Center of Excellence, would become Cyber Command chief of staff.
The military’s digital warfighting branch, which shares a campus with the NSA at Fort Meade, Md., is looking to build upon the numerous insights gleaned from Operation Synthetic Theology, its digital campaign to protect the 2018 midterm elections from foreign hackers.
That effort included sending direct messages to suspected Russian operatives to inform them that they had been identified and to warn them not to tamper with the midterms. It also saw Cyber Command launch its first publicly known offensive operation, temporarily knocking the Internet Research Agency — an infamous Russian troll farm in St. Petersburg — offline on Election Day and the days immediately afterward.
“Our goal is to have no interference in our elections,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Timothy Haugh, head of the command’s Cyber National Mission Force, said during a rare briefing with reporters at Fort Meade earlier this month.
“Ideally, no foreign actor is going to target our electoral process,” he added.
Myers, a career naval aviator, has held a number of posts during his time in the military, according to his Navy biography.
He served as the director of plans and policy at Cyber Command. He’s also been the assistant deputy director for global operations for the Joint Staff and the executive assistant to the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
While Myers may not possess a digital background, his resume — including commanding at all levels of naval aviation — shows experience running the day-to-day operations of large organizations as well as an intimate knowledge of Cyber Command itself.
The organization’s 133-team, roughly 6,200-person Cyber National Mission Force only reached full operational capability last May. However, Nakasone and others have acknowledged since then that they likely will need to change the training and structure of the teams to maintain readiness and keep up with rapidly evolving digital threats from nations such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea."
Trump: Whoever directed USS John McCain out of sight was 'well-meaning',www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/uss-john-mccain-trump-1488996,"Whoever directed the Navy to keep the destroyer USS John McCain out of sight during a presidential visit to Japan was “well-meaning,” President Donald Trump said Thursday.
""I don't know what happened. I wasn't involved. I would not have done that,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""I was very angry with John McCain because he killed health care. I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way, shape or form. I think John McCain had a lot to getting President (George W.) Bush, a lot to do with it, to go into the Middle East, which was catastrophe.
""To me, John McCain, I wasn't a fan,"" Trump said. ""But I would never do a thing like that.
""Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK? And, they were well-meaning,"" the president added. ""I didn't know anything about it. I would never have done that.""
Trump’s remarks came as acting Shanahan denied knowing about the efforts to shield the McCain and its crew from the president’s view and as a prominent retired general and former Clinton Cabinet member called on Shanahan to resign if he knew.
“Did Acting Sec Def Shanahan know the White House gave instructions to hide the name of a US Navy warship and the sailors ID? IF SO HE SHOULD RESIGN,” tweeted retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who served as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the Clinton administration.
Overnight, Shanahan told reporters traveling with him that a Wall Street Journal report describing directions from the White House Military Office to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command “was the first time I’ve heard about it.”
He later added that he “never authorized ... any action around the movement or activity regarding that ship” and “would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain.”
""Secretary Shanahan was not aware of the directive to move the USS John S McCain nor was he aware of the concern precipitating the directive,” Shanahan spokesman Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino said in a statement.
But even if Shanahan were unaware of the efforts the military was undertaking to keep Trump from seeing the McCain and its crew, “he is allowing political operatives in the White House to give orders to our military forces,” McCaffrey said in another tweet , calling that prospect “a very dangerous event for our democracy"" and ""POLITICAL MISUSE OF US ARMED FORCES."""
Trump offers conflicting signals on whether he believes Russia got him elected,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-russia-2016-election-1347425,"President Donald Trump on Thursday offered conflicting signals on whether he believes Russia helped get him elected, but he claimed that he “had nothing to do” with their efforts to interfere in the 2016 election.
The president first appeared to acknowledge that Russia helped him in a tweeted complaint about the discussion around special counsel Robert Mueller’s report.
“Russia, Russia, Russia! That’s all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected,” he wrote , claiming “it was a crime that didn’t exist.”
Assailing Mueller’s Russia investigation once again as the “Greatest Presidential Harassment in history,” Trump tweeted that “highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!”
But moments later Trump told reporters he was the sole force responsible for his 2016 victory, not the Kremlin.
""No, Russia did not help get me elected,"" the president said. ""You know who got me elected? I got me elected. Russia didn't help me at all. Russia, if anything, helped the other side.""
In his report on the investigation, Mueller outlined 10 instances for which he alleged Trump attempted to thwart the probe, including efforts to have the special counsel removed. On the issue of Russian interference, while Mueller detailed the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, he ultimately determined “that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy” between the two sides. While Mueller's report outlined a sweeping effort by Russian actors to meddle in the 2016 election to Trump's benefit, there has been no definitive evidence showing that their efforts were responsible for his upset victory.
Mueller, who spoke publicly about his investigation for the first time Wednesday, declined to clear the president both in his report and in his public comments, though he has made clear he never planned to bring charges against Trump due to a Justice Department policy against charging sitting presidents.
In his highly anticipated remarks, Mueller reiterated that his investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia and whether Trump sought to obstruct the investigation operated within the framework of the DOJ policy, meaning that “charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”
Still, he said, “if we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”
Trump and his allies have consistently claimed that Mueller’s decision not to bring charges against the president amount to an exoneration in the nearly two-year investigation that Trump has openly fumed about. But Mueller’s emphasis on correcting that idea Wednesday appears to have prompted a slight shift in messaging.
“So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media, say he fought back against this phony crime that didn’t exist, this horrendous false acquisition [sic], and he shouldn’t fight back, he should just sit back and take it,” Trump wrote Thursday. “Could this be Obstruction? No, Mueller didn’t find Obstruction either. Presidential Harassment!”
In comments to reporters later Thursday morning, Trump called accusations that he assisted in Russia’s efforts a “disgrace.” He also returned to his personal attacks on the special counsel, after initially letting up on Mueller in the immediate aftermath of his top-line findings being disclosed.
“I think he is a total conflicted person,” he said while leaving the White House. “I think Mueller is a true never Trumper,” he added, referring to a nickname used by Republicans who oppose the president.
In defending Mueller’s conflicts, Trump again pointed to issues he’s raised in the past, including that the White House had reportedly considered him for the post of FBI director, that there had been a past disagreement over Mueller’s membership at one of Trump’s golf clubs, and Mueller’s relationship with former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired in 2017.
“So whether it is love or deep like, but he was conflicted,” Trump said of Mueller’s relationship with Comey. He went on, arguing that Mueller “should have never been chosen” as special counsel because of his discussions about the FBI director post.
“So you tell somebody, ‘I'm sorry, you can't have the job.’ Then after you say that he is going to make a ruling on you? Doesn't work that way. Plus we had a business dispute,” Trump said."

The bond market is once again flashing recession signals .
Story Continued Below
The Dow is off nearly 1400 points, or around 5 percent, since China talks fell apart and Trump tweeted on May 5 about his plans to tax everything the U.S. imports from China at 25 percent.
The Nasdaq is off nearly 8 percent since its May 3 high, very close to 10 percent correction territory. The S&P is down close to 6 percent since May 3. The numbers are not bad enough to force Trump back to the negotiating table. But they are getting there.
Pressure on Fed again — Markets are starting to place serious pressure on the Fed to cut rates and Trump may not be far behind them. Per HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan, futures markets now expect over 30 basis points of Fed cuts by the end of this year and 75 basis points by the end of next year. The Fed meanwhile is still signaling 25 basis points of tightening by the end of next year. Train wreck waiting to happen.
GDP downgrade? — Thursday morning brings the second estimate of first quarter GDP. Expectations are for little change to the initial 3.2 percent estimate. But there is a solid chance it could dip below 3 percent.
GOOD THURSDAY MORNING — Email on Twitter @AubreeWeaver .
Driving the Day Jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. expected to rise to 214K from 211K … Second estimate of first quarter GDP at 8:30 a.m. expected to dip to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent … Advance Trade in Goods at 8:30 a.m. expected to show deficit rising from $71.5B to $72.7B … Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida speaks at the Economic Club of New York at noon …
Q1 GDP PREP — Via Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “[W]e expect a clear downward revision to first quarter GDP growth ... The biggest single source of revision will be retail inventories, which alone likely will subtract at least a quarter of a percentage point off GDP growth. … [T]he bottom line in our calculation is that growth will be revised down to 2.7%”
CHINA HEARINGS COULD TAKE WEEKS — Our Doug Palmer: “Upcoming hearings on … Trump's plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese goods could take up to two weeks, an industry official said today.
“That would surpass last year's record, when the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative heard from more than 350 witnesses over the course of six days on Trump's plan to impose a 25 percent duty on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. USTR excluded only a few items as part of that process, but did set the duty initially at just 10 percent.” Read more.

And unless the Fed itself or Congress does something about it, our financial system is at risk” Read more.
Markets SLOW DOWN FEARS SLAM STOCKS — WSJ’s Amrith Ramkumar: “Stocks, bond yields and commodities around the world declined again Wednesday, as worries about slowing economic growth spurred a further retreat from riskier investments.
“Risk assets slid to start the day, at one point sending the Dow … down more than 400 points and oil prices down more than 3%, before they trimmed some of their drops near the end of the session. Markets have been stung lately by fears that a drawn-out U.S.-China trade dispute will add pressure on an already slowing world economy.” Read more.
BONDS FLASH RED — NYT’s Neil Irwin: “[G]lobal bond prices have soared, driving interest rates down sharply. Ten-year Treasury bonds are yielding only 2.26 percent as of Wednesday’s market close, down nearly a full percentage point since November 2018. The outlook for inflation in the years ahead is falling as well, as are the prices of oil and other commodities.
“Most significant, the fall in longer-term bond yields has not been matched by a fall in shorter-term rates. For example, a 30-day Treasury bill is yielding 2.35 percent — meaning you can earn more on your money tying it up for a month risk-free than you can tying it up for a full decade. This is not normal.” Read more .
Fly Around FLORIDA REGULATOR SAYS SUSPENSION WAS RETRIBUTION — Our Matt Dixon in Tallahassee: “Ronald Rubin, the state financial regulator under investigation for sexual misconduct, now says he was suspended from his job as retribution for refusing to hire a political ally of his boss.
“Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis coordinated with a lobbyist and other political allies to pressure Rubin to install the person in a top job at the Office of Financial Regulation, Rubin wrote in a statement submitted to investigators Tuesday. When Rubin refused, he said he received a string of angry texts from the lobbyist, Paul Mitchell. The next day, Rubin was accused of sexual harassment and Patronis suspended him from his job.” Read more .
BANK PROFITS RISE — Our Victoria Guida: “Bank profits jumped 8.7 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the previous year, as lenders reap the benefits of higher interest rates, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced today.
“The industry brought in near record-high earnings of $60.7 billion, with net interest income growing by $7.9 billion, or 6 percent, according to the FDIC's latest quarterly report.” Read more .
BANK STOCKS FALL — WSJ’s Corrie Driebusch: “Sliding interest rates are just one of the issues plaguing bank stocks. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has fallen 7.5% in May, significantly more than the S&P 500’s 5.5% decline. While some analysts blame a sharp drop in Treasury yields, which can crimp banks’ lending margins, others say big banks also face other woes.
“Those include intensified worries about the U.S. economy, stock-trading volumes that have fallen this quarter relative to the first three months of the year, and a slide in U.S. debt capital markets volumes. Bank stocks—which tend to rise when companies and consumers are spending freely and taking out big loans—soared ahead of the S&P 500 early in the year amid signs of solid U.S. growth. Recent worries that trade tensions will hit the economy, however, have dented shares of lenders in several ways.” Read more .
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BRIEFS ON RARE EARTH MINERALS — Reuters: “The U.S. Defense Department has briefed Congress on a report on rare earth minerals as it looks to reduce American reliance on China, a Pentagon spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday, amid mounting concern in Washington about Beijing’s role as a supplier.
“Although the Pentagon did not provide details of the report, it said the document was tied to a federal program designed to bolster domestic production capabilities through targeted economic incentives. Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements used in a wide range of consumer products, from iPhones to electric car motors, as well as military jet engines, satellites and lasers.” Read more .

In a rare public statement, special counsel Robert Mueller made crystal clear that he does not want to testify — and said he would only discuss his report if he did. Many Democrats, who had been banking on a blockbuster public hearing with Mueller to lay the groundwork for an impeachment inquiry, still want to hear from him (and some are even willing to issue a subpoena to get it.) But for some Democrats, Mueller’s brief statement was all they needed to hear to jump on the impeachment bandwagon. They specifically interpreted his comments that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing” as a call to action. That includes Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), chairman of the Rules Committee, and Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), head of the Homeland Security Committee. And several 2020 hopefuls are also now calling for impeachment for the first time.

NO MOORE DRAMA -- Republicans are scrambling to stamp out a likely Roy Moore Senate bid. Trump warned Moore, who lost to Sen. Doug Jones (D) in a special election after being accused of sexual misconduct, that it would be “devastating” for the GOP if he ran again. And The New York Times reported that Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), who leads the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, called Trump earlier this month to emphasize that Moore can’t win and get the party on the same page.
But Moore is defiant, with the controversial judge hitting back at his critics and making clear that he is still seriously considering a rematch. “The president doesn’t control who votes for the United States Senate in Alabama,” Moore said in a phone interview with POLITICO. “People in Alabama are smarter than that. They elect the senator from Alabama, not from Washington, D.C.” Much more from James Arkin: https://politi.co/2EHJPmm .

"Trump on impeachment: 'It's a dirty, filthy, disgusting word' - POLITICO",www.politico.com,Caitlin Oprysko,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-impeachment-dirty-word-1347500,"President Donald Trump expressed bewilderment on Thursday at the prospect that House Democrats could even consider moving to oust him from office, calling impeachment a ""dirty, filthy, disgusting word.”
“I don't see how they can because they're possibly allowed, although I can't imagine the courts allowing it. I’ve never gone into it,” Trump told reporters of potential impeachment proceedings while leaving the White House on Thursday. “I never thought that would even be possible to be using that word. To me, it's a dirty word — the word impeach. It's a dirty, filthy, disgusting word.”
Story Continued Below
Circling back to whether he thought he would be impeached, he told reporters, “I don’t think so, because there was no crime.”
He returned to a flawed argument he and his backers have long put forth to dismiss the threat of Trump’s impeachment.
“You know, it's high crimes and, not with — or — it’s high crimes and misdemeanors,” he said. “There was no high crime and there was no misdemeanor. So how do you impeach based on that?”
Trump has frequently fallen back on the lack of charges stemming from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation to argue against his impeachment, though his legal rationale is not solid. The phrase “high crimes and misdemeanors” as a justification for impeachment is not defined in the Constitution. But constitutional scholars say that it likely conveys some violation of public trust in addition to possible statutory violations.
Mueller suggested as much Wednesday in public remarks, when he confirmed that his investigation operated within a Justice Department policy barring the indictment of a sitting president. The DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel opinion “says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” he noted in remarks that emphasized his investigation had not exonerated Trump.
The special counsel’s comments prompted another wave of Democrats calling for the House to begin impeachment proceedings, an effort House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been attempting to beat back for months. She has remained firm in her opinion that initiating impeachment proceedings against Trump is still too divisive and has instead vowed to continue investigating the president."

A draft proposal circulating among Trump’s Homeland Security advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have resided in a country other than their own before coming to the U.S., according to a Homeland Security Department official and an outside advocate familiar with the plan.
If executed, it would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border, many of whom have trekked a perilous journey through Mexico.
Trump is weighing the move as he pursues other plans to crack down on migration at the southern border, including new tariffs on Mexico that he announced Thursday night. Trump said he duty on all goods coming from Mexico starting June 10 to pressure that country to do more to stop migrants from Central Americans from entering the United States.
""The Tariff will gradually remedied,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Earlier Thursday, Trump hinted at changes to his administration’s border policy as he departed for Colorado, telling reporters he was “going to do something very dramatic on the border” and would announce it in a “big league statement.”
“It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,” he said. “And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it’s a national emergency, and most people agree.”
Trump said on Thursday that he would not be closing the border as he has threatened numerous times. “The asylum procedures are ridiculous,” he added. “No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.”
Trump said last month that a recent deal with Mexico on auto exports wouldn’t count if the country failed to stop Central American migrants from illegally crossing the border. The president said he would give Mexico one year to curb illegal border crossings before pulling the trigger on new tariffs — a softening of his earlier threat to close the border entirely, but one that could still inflict economic damage on both countries. The Washington Post first reported the plan to move ahead with the tariffs.
Immigration advocates familiar with the asylum proposal expressed alarm at the scope of the plan, even as they questioned whether it would hold up in court. U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive on U.S. soil, but has long included an exemption for those who have already emigrated to a safe country.
“This decision will cause a chain reaction — Central Americans who are fleeing for their lives being forced back into the burning house they are escaping,” said Pili Tobar, deputy director of America’s Voice, an immigration advocacy group. “A rational approach … is to treat this like the regional refugee crisis that it is and bolster our asylum and refugee process, instead of slamming the door shut with a childish hope that migrants will not come or conditions causing them to flee will get better on their own.”
The move could reach beyond Central America, affecting asylum seekers in other parts of the world, according to an activist who has been briefed on the issue.
Trump, frustrated with his administration’s inability to halt the tide of immigrants at the southern border, has orchestrated a major staffing shakeup at the Homeland Security Department to get tougher on the issue.
His new acting DHS secretary, Kevin McAleenan, just returned from a trip to Guatemala, where he urged officials to try to stop the flow of migrants leaving the Central American country.
While the details of the new restrictions are still in flux, many migrants have been held up by Trump’s “remain in Mexico” policy, which forces asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their asylum requests are pending.
“It’s unbelievably extreme to try to inhibit anyone who comes through another country in their quest for asylum,” said Kerri Talbot, the federal advocacy director for Immigration Hub, an advocacy group for migrants. “It basically means it would block all Central Americans from coming to the U.S.”
While Trump aides believe they can make the changes through an administrative rule, they are also seeking a legislative fix that would be far less vulnerable to a court challenge. Similar language is included in Trump’s emerging immigration bill , which boosts security at the southern border and pushes the nation to admit more high-skilled, well-educated immigrants, rather than immigrants who enter the U.S. based on family ties, according to two people familiar with the proposal.
White House staff, including Ja’Ron Smith and Theodore Wold — both special assistants to the president for domestic policy — briefed Republican senators’ offices on the proposed legislation Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The White House expects to release the legislation in the coming days.
Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has pushed to restrict asylum claims, said the administration has been looking for ways to make the changes for some time.
“People don’t have a right to pick and choose where they ask for asylum,” he said.
The proposal has been considered in the past by Republicans. It was included in a wide-ranging immigration House bill last year that was killed.

ACLU seeks to block more sections of Trump’s border wall,www.politico.com,IAN KULLGREN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/aclu-block-trump-border-wall-1347501,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The American Civil Liberties Union has asked a federal court to block additional sections of President Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Attorneys asked the court to halt construction of a border wall in Southern California and three sections near Tucson, Ariz., late Wednesday. The ACLU, representing the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, has a good chance of initially prevailing, given the same California court has already suspended the construction of sections in Yuma, Ariz., and El Paso, Texas. Story Continued Below
The ACLU, in a court filing , said it presents “virtually identical“ arguments to those in the previous case. The construction of the border wall on protected federal land “will irreparably harm Plaintiff Sierra Club’s members’ recreational and aesthetic interests in the borderlands they live in, use, and treasure,” the attorneys wrote.
The Justice Department on Wednesday said it would appeal a federal judge‘s decision to halt a $1 billion transfer of Pentagon counterdrug funding to cover expansions of the Yuma and El Paso sectors and asked the court to let construction proceed in the meantime.
The administration argued that taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for the stalled projects at rates of $195,000 a day for the El Paso section and $20,000 a day for the Yuma section because contractors will have to be reimbursed for costs they incur during any shutdowns.
Congress approved legislation in February for $1.4 billion for roughly 55 miles of new border barriers, but Trump declared a national emergency to unlock an additional $6.7 billion.

"Trump says he might meet with Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage during UK visit",www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-uk-boris-johnson-nigel-farage-1347574,"President Donald Trump on Thursday said he might meet with Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage — pro-Brexit politicians, one of whom is vying to replace outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May — when he visits the U.K. next week.
The president’s comments come days after he said he feels “badly” for May, who announced Friday that she would resign after failing to get Parliament to ratify her deal to exit the European Union.
Trump, who has backed Brexit since his 2016 presidential campaign, told reporters Thursday that he considers Johnson and Farage to be “very good guys” and “very interesting people.” But he refrained from offering support to either Farage or Johnson, the latter of which is making a run for prime minister.
“I mean, they're friends of mine. But I haven't thought about supporting them,” he said. “Maybe it’s not my business to support people. But I have a lot of respect for both of those men.”
Trump’s relationship with May is rocky, and the president has ripped the prime minister’s struggle to deliver a Brexit deal. When Trump visited the U.K. in 2018, he accused the politically vulnerable May of wrecking Brexit and suggested Johnson would make a great prime minister.
“I think they are big powers over there,” the president said of Johnson and Farage on Thursday. “I think they’ve done a good job.”
Johnson has emerged as the only prospective leader capable of maintaining the support of the coalition of voters who backed the U.K.’s Conservative Party in the last election, according to a recent POLITICO-Hanbury poll .
But Trump offered extra praise to Farage, whose Brexit Party reeled in just under 31 percent of the popular vote in the latest European Parliament election. Farage, the former head of the United Kingdom Independence Party, returned to the British political scene after all but retiring in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum. Farage also has been a supporter of Trump's, at one time joining him on the campaign trail in 2016.
A U.K. official said there hasn’t been any discussion between the administration and No. 10 Downing Street about setting up a meeting for Trump and Johnson. But, the official added, “Obviously what he does in his downtime is up to him.”
“The meetings that the president has in his private time there are a matter for him and the White House,” the official said.

TopLine MOORE PROBLEMS — Trump tried to encourage Moore not to run, but Moore doesn’t care. “I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win,” he tweeted Wednesday morning, referring to Moore’s 2017 bid. But “Roy Moore cannot win [in 2020], and the consequences will be devastating.”
Moore brushed the president’s tweets aside in an interview with Campaign Pro’s James Arkin . “The president doesn’t control who votes for the United States Senate in Alabama,” Moore said in a phone interview. “People in Alabama are smarter than that. They elect the senator from Alabama, not from Washington, D.C.”
But national Republicans are moving to undercut Moore, should he run. NRSC chair Todd Young “had spoken with Trump in recent weeks and raised concerns about Moore,” James reported. But “national Republicans are not yet picking a candidate to back, and the state GOP is staying out of the primary.” The Club for Growth has met with both state Rep. Arnold Mooney and former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville, but is still watching the race to see whom they might back (the group opposes Rep. Bradley Byrne ).
Moore still denies the allegations of sexual misconduct with minors that helped, in part, sink his 2017 race against now-Democratic Sen. Doug Jones , calling them “fake news.” And he believes national Republicans are attacking him because he still has a base. “They know I'll win,"" he told James. ""That's why they're upset.""
Presidential Big Board THE DEBATE STAGE — Less-prominent 2020 hopefuls were chafing at the higher bar to make the fall presidential debates. “The DNC is playing a gatekeeping function and they’re creating a filter to determine which candidates can make their arguments to the American people,” former Rep. John Delaney told Elena Schneider and me . “The rules are also reshuffling spending priorities among less-prominent candidates, some of whom have shifted plans to hire organizers based in Iowa or New Hampshire in order to pour money into donation-generating digital advertising,” we wrote.
The thresholds highlight the difficulty the DNC — and the candidates themselves — are having with a field of two dozen candidates, with some who are intent on running an actual campaign and others who appear to be using the race as more of a platform. “For the debates to be meaningful, they have to winnow down the participants,” Patti Solis Doyle, Hillary Clinton’s 2008 manager, told us. “This is the uncomfortable reality both the DNC and the candidates have to face.”
— And the random nature of how the candidates will be assigned during the first round of debates in late June is throwing a wrench into candidates’ plans. “Increasingly frustrated by a lack of clarity about which candidates will appear on stage together, at least half a dozen major candidates have nevertheless begun to block out time or are taking on a lighter schedule to turn their focus to the debate,” POLITICO’s David Siders, Natasha Korecki and Elena reported . “In interviews with about a dozen campaigns, advisers said they are beginning to prepare their candidates more intensely for the debate. Many are struggling, however, to adjust for which competitors will share a stage, or from whom they might expect crossfire.”
— Democrats are pushing for their party to dedicate a debate to climate change, POLITICO’s Anthony Adragna wrote.
SENIOR CLASS — Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is running into problems with voters around his age. “In poll after poll, he places a distant second behind former Vice President Joe Biden among the senior set, the demographic that has long had more sway over who becomes president than any other. His campaign acknowledges it's a problem and is trying — so far, unsuccessfully — to fix it,” POLITICO’s Holly Otterbein reported .
TO IMPEACH, OR NOT IMPEACH? — Sens. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings on Wednesday after special counsel Robert Mueller’s public statement on Wednesday, joining seven other 2020 hopefuls who had previously made that call, per The New York Times’ Maggie Astor .
POLICY CORNER — Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke proposed an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system, including a pathway to citizenship for 11 million, POLITICO’s David Siders reported.
Down the Ballot AD WARS — SLF, which is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , took a swipe at Bullock. The ad , which is SLF’s first TV ad this year, “is an effort to use Bullock's presidential campaign as a weapon to damage his image in Montana, even though Bullock has been unequivocal that he is running for president and not interested in the Senate,” James reported . It is backed by $150,000 on TV and digital over the next week “is also intended as a warning shot to other presidential hopefuls in states with Senate elections next year, including former Gov. John Hickenlooper in Colorado and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke in Texas, both states where Democrats already have candidates running.”
THE SENATE MAP — Jaime Harrison, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic party, officially launched his bid to challenge GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham , criticizing Graham for being a major Trump booster, James wrote .
NC-09 FOREVER — Democrat Dan McCready and Republican Dan Bishop are sharply divided over abortion. “I would think that in future years Roe v. Wade will be seen as similar to the Dred Scott decision,” Bishop told The Charlotte Observer’s Jim Morrill . McCready said he supports the high court’s decision: “I’m a person of faith. The thought of any abortion is tragic to me. But I do not think it’s the government’s job to get between a woman and her doctor.”
— Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill that would ban abortions after roughly six weeks (if similar legislation was upheld in court), and Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards plans on signing it, The Advocate’s Sam Karlin reported.
THE SAFE SEATS — A runoff in NC-03 for the GOP nomination is dividing congressional Republicans. “It’s North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows and the political arm of the House Freedom Caucus versus the Republican women in the chamber — all 13 of them — plus another male lawmaker [Rep. George Holding ],” Roll Call’s Simone Pathé reported. Meadows backs state Rep. Greg Murphy, while other members are backing Joan Perry.
RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINES — California is embarking on an ambitious plan to replace all of the state’s aging voting machines. Secretary of State Alex Padilla ordered “all of California's 58 voting districts to update their voting systems by the March 2020 primaries. If they don't comply, their votes won't be counted, unless they get an exemption from the state,” NBC News’ Kevin Monahan, Cynthia McFadden and Adiel Kaplan reported. “NBC News contacted all 58 counties in the state. Many said they were worried about the cost but most believe they will make Padilla's deadline. Only 10 jurisdictions are requesting exemptions or protective extensions.”
STAFFING UP — Rahna Epting will be executive director of MoveOn Political Action and MoveOn Civic Action starting in the fall, the organization announced.
— EMILY’s List named Madhur Bansal as vice president of research, Karen Defilippi as vice president of federal and gubernatorial campaigns, Geri Prado as vice president of state and local campaigns and Ben Ray as senior director of campaign communications.
CODA — EXCHANGE OF THE DAY: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow: “I wish you were running for the Senate.” Hickenlooper: “You’ve obviously been talking to Chuck Schumer ” ( video ).

Quick Fix — Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, has no confidence in the acting FDA chief , the Illinois senator said in a letter released on Wednesday.
— Utah on Friday will request a waiver to boost funding for its limited Medicaid expansion , part of an ongoing strategy to override a larger Medicaid expansion that a majority of voters supported last year.

Driving the Day DICK DURBIN SAYS HE HAS NO CONFIDENCE IN ACTING FDA CHIEF — The striking rebuke came after a recent meeting between the No. 2 Senate Democrat and Ned Sharpless, who's led FDA in an acting capacity for nearly two months.
The conversation about youth use of e-cigarettes was ""one of the most alarming and disappointing meetings in my time in public service,"" Durbin said in a letter on Wednesday. More .
— What Durbin contends: The Illinois Democrat — who had forged a solid working relationship with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb — said that the agency must do more, quickly to get e-cigarettes out of the hands of kids.
""It is my belief that any person leading the FDA … must, first and foremost, feel a deep sense of responsibility to protect the health and well-being of all Americans, especially our nation's children,"" the senator wrote to Sharpless. ""I do not have confidence that you are that leader.""
— How FDA responded: ""Dr. Sharpless is committed to continuing to tackle the troubling epidemic of e-cigarette use among kids,"" a spokesperson told POLITICO. ""This includes preventing youth access to, and appeal of, flavored tobacco products like e-cigarettes and cigars, taking action against manufacturers and retailers who illegally market or sell these products to minors, and educating youth about the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products.""
— What PULSE is wondering: How much of Durbin's criticism was driven by the policy — and how much was about setting a tone with Sharpless?
COMING FRIDAY: UTAH'S LATEST MEDICAID WAIVER REQUEST — State officials will unveil a proposal intended to secure enhanced Obamacare funding for its limited Medicaid expansion, according to a notice obtained by POLITICO's Rachana Pradhan. The proposal also would implement per-person caps on federal funding.
— The proposal, which needs CMS approval, is the second stage of an effort by Utah Republicans to override a Medicaid expansion ballot initiative that passed last year.
Seeking to limit the initiative, the state's GOP leaders quickly adopted a plan to only cover low-income adults who earn up to the federal poverty line and not the full Obamacare expansion. But that plan came at a cost of tens of millions of additional dollars, because Utah didn't get Obamacare's enhanced funding level too.
— What's at stake: GOP lawmakers in other states are watching closely to see if they can emulate Utah's effort to limit a voter-backed Medicaid expansion while securing full Obamacare funding. Health care advocates in other states are watching too, as they weigh pursuing Medicaid ballot initiatives.
It's also a test for what the Trump administration is willing to allow under its efforts to overhaul the health care safety net without Congress.
LOUISIANA PASSES 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION BILL — State lawmakers Wednesday approved a ban on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, but with a twist: the bill specifies it would take effect only if the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upholds a similar law that Mississippi enacted in March.

Judge strikes down law that sought to abolish Waterfront Commission,www.politico.com,rhutchins@politico.com (Ryan Hutchins),05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2019/05/29/judge-strikes-down-law-that-sought-to-abolish-waterfront-commission-1033593,"A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a controversial New Jersey law that sought to abolish the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, a 65-year-old agency charged with fighting corruption on the docks.
U.S. District Court Judge Susan Wigenton, sitting in Newark, delivered a stinging rebuke of the law signed by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on his last day in office in 2018. In her ruling, the judge turned Christie’s own words against him, using his prior concerns about the legislation to cast doubt on the constitutionality of the law and, ultimately, to find that the governor and state lawmakers far exceeded their power in passing the measure.
Wigenton concluded in her opinion that no state has the authority to unilaterally withdraw from the sort of compact that created the commission — in this case, one that was approved by both New York and New Jersey, as well as Congress. The same criteria could likely be applied to the far larger and more powerful Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which also has some oversight of the ports.
Just as any major change to the operations of such organizations requires the passage of new legislation in both states, so too does a decision to terminate the operations, Wigenton wrote in her 17-page ruling.
“In analyzing the Compact drafters’ intent, this Court remains cognizant that States do not easily cede their sovereign powers,” Wigenton wrote . “However, this notion is not dispositive and a review of the Compact’s legislative history, the parties’ course of performance through the actions of their executive and legislative bodies, and the customary practices employed in other interstate compacts, strongly supports a finding that the drafters did not intend to permit a State’s unilateral withdrawal or termination.”
The law in question came after years of failed efforts to get New York to agree to structural changes at the Waterfront Commission. The agency was created as a way to root out mob influence in the shipping industry, but some claim it has outlived in usefulness — and exceeded its mission.
Supporters of the legislation, including the shipping industry and the union representing port workers, say the agency has become an impediment to economic growth. They have been particularly incensed by the commission's involvement in the hiring process for dock workers and had previously filed an unsuccessful lawsuit targeting the practice.
The Christie law would have barred the commission from regulating hiring practices and performing law enforcement functions at port facilities, cutting off its primary revenue stream. The New Jersey State Police would have been charged with carrying out those tasks, at a net cost of around $2.1 million annually, legislative analysts predicted.
Remarkably, Christie had vetoed the legislation in 2015 and raised some of the same points the judge made in her ruling on Wednesday. Christie, a Republican and a former U.S. attorney, said at the time that he had been told of a “concrete constitutional hurdle” and was “advised that federal law does not permit one state to unilaterally withdraw from a bi-state compact approved by Congress.”
Even so, Christie ultimately signed the law after a Democratic rival who had first proposed the legislation — now-former state Sen. Raymond Lesniak — agreed to take his name off the bill. The measure, NJ S 3502 (16R) , was among 108 bills on which Christie acted during his final hours in office last year.
Gov. Phil Murphy, Christie’s Democratic successor, agreed to defend the law after the Waterfront Commission sued the state on the grounds the state had exceeded its authority.
“When they entered into the Compact, New Jersey and New York also retained their sovereign right to revoke powers delegated to the Waterfront Commission, and Plaintiff has no recourse against New Jersey for dissolution of the Compact,” New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal wrote in an argument filed last year.
Spokespeople for Murphy and the state Attorney General’s Office declined to comment.
The commission’s staff insist the agency is still needed. They argued in court that the shipping industry is incapable of policing its own hiring practices, noting a striking lack of diversity on the docks and a pool of workers that lives in areas far from the urban centers where the docks are located. And, as the judge noted in an earlier opinion , the commission says corruption continues to this day.
“We are very pleased with the Court’s decision,” Phoebe Sorial, the agency’s general counsel, said in a statement. “Today’s significant victory safeguards the Waterfront Commission’s ability to continue its critical mission of combating corruption and ensuring fair hiring practices in the Port of New York-New Jersey.
“Notwithstanding this lawsuit, we have worked closely with Governor Murphy’s administration to enhance Port productivity and fair hiring, and we look forward to continuing to work together for the good of the Port and the citizens of New Jersey and New York,” Sorial said.

The city Board of Elections has added 19 more early polling sites to the rollout planned for November, according to state officials, but the addition is unlikely to mollify city leaders who were pushing for a more widespread effort.
The total is now at 57, which is more than the board had initially planned but still far short of the 100 polling sites the city is requesting. The addition comes after months of contentious back and forth between the mayor, the City Council and BOE Executive Director Michael Ryan, who has been reluctant to embrace a more ambitious rollout amid concerns that it would overwhelm the notoriously error-prone elections apparatus.
Albany set aside $10 million in the budget to reimburse localities that, under a recently passed law, must host nine days of early voting. The State Board of Elections set a Wednesday deadline for municipalities to submit the number of early polling places to qualify for some of the cash.
The city's board confirmed the new number. It had initially planned only 38 sites.
That did not sit well with Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, along with good-government groups, considers it far too few locations. To help the oft-maligned body nearly triple that number, he has offered $75 million as part of the upcoming budget. The mayor recently threatened legal recourse if the board did not step up its efforts.
""The only acceptable announcement is to have at least 100 early voting sites,"" he said at an unrelated press conference this week. ""If they do not do that, we will consider all options possible to make them create an early voting program that actually works for everyday New Yorkers, and we’ll certainly consider legal action among those potential steps.""
On Wednesday, the board submitted a list of 57 sites to Albany. While state aid will be based on that figure, the board would still be able to add more sites before November if it chooses.
However, local election officials do not seem inclined to meet the mayor's mandate.
Ryan has said that the organization would rather try a more tailored rollout to minimize the potential for chaos, rather than ramp up to the full capacity that will likely be needed for the presidential election in 2020.
“I want to make sure we don’t end up like Howard Hughes when he built the Spruce [Goose],” Ryan said at a recent hearing. “He built this big beautiful thing, but it doesn’t fly.”
The two sides have also sparred over potential locations. Ryan has argued that many traditional polling sites are not willing to cede their facilities for the additional time required for early voting, and brought a stack of letters from locations that did not want to participate to a recent Council hearing for dramatic effect.
In response, the mayor later sent over a list of 222 willing and accessible locations while questioning the board's competence, though board officials shot back that many of them are not feasible as de Blasio has maintained.
The city board has had trouble endearing itself to local officials, and its reluctance in opening more sites has not helped.
In November, rain and malfunctioning machines combined to cause hours-long waits at polling places throughout the city. In 2016, the board faced widespread outrage after deleting more than 100,000 eligible voters from the rolls during the Democratic primary.
And recently, the board faced backlash from the governor on down for publishing voter information online, prompting it to eventually reverse that decision."
Shanahan denies knowing about plan to hide USS John S. McCain from Trump - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-defense/2019/05/30/shanahan-denies-knowing-about-plan-to-hide-uss-john-s-mccain-from-trump-441873,"With Wesley Morgan and Editor's The acting Defense secretary says he didn’t know of a plan to obscure the name of the destroyer USS John S. McCain from President Donald Trump during his visit to Japan this week.
— Lockheed Martin’s CEO is confident she can sell Turkey’s F-35s to other countries if Ankara is kicked out of the program.
— The secretary of the Navy once told Trump he should be fired if he can’t get the Navy’s newest carrier back on track. Now it may come to that.
HAPPY THURSDAY
Pentagon SHANAHAN’S ROLE: Acting today denied a report that he knew of a plan to cover up the name of the destroyer USS John S. McCain when Trump visited the U.S. Navy base in Japan this week.
“When I read about it this morning, it was the first I heard about it,” Shanahan told reporters traveling with him in Jakarta today, per The Associated Press.
“I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain. ... I’d never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship. I’ve asked my chief of staff to look into the matter,” he added later .
The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday night that Shanahan knew of the concern that Trump might be upset if he saw the name of his old foe when he toured the base this week, and approved a plan to put the ship “out of sight.”
That involved placing a tarp over the name of the ship, moving a barge in front of it to keep it out of view, and giving crew members — who wear ballcaps with the ship’s name — the day off so they wouldn’t be around for Trump’s visit. The ship is undergoing repairs following its 2017 collision with a merchant vessel that killed 10 sailors.
A senior Navy official told The Washington Post that once the Navy learned of the plan it directed the removal of the tarp before Trump visited, and that the crew’s day off wasn’t connected to the president’s visit.
In a tweet not long after the story posted , Trump denied knowing anything about the plan to hide the ship, but didn’t dispute the story.
“I was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan. Nevertheless, @FLOTUS and I loved being with our great Military Men and Women - what a spectacular job they do!”
North Korea SHANAHAN SIDES WITH BOLTON: Shanahan says North Korea violated a U.N. resolution when it launched short-range missiles this month, putting him at odds with Trump, but also in agreement with just about everyone else.
""The short-range missile, is that a violation? Yes,"" Shanahan told reporters traveling with him in Asia. ""These were short-range missiles and those are a violation of the UNSCR,” writes our colleague Wesley Morgan.
In making the comments , Shanahan joins national security adviser John Bolton, the State Department, lawmakers in both parties and world leaders.
Homeland Security DUNFORD DODGES: Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford took a pass on a chance to support Trump’s order to divert Pentagon funds toward the border wall, Morgan writes .
“I’m not going to comment on the appropriateness of taking money from the Department of Defense and moving it to the border,” he said during an appearance at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday.

FORMER SECAF: Deborah Lee James, former Air Force secretary, will discuss her new book ""Aim High: Chart Your Course and Find Your Success” at the National Press Club this morning at 10.
Nuclear Weapons VIOLATING THE BAN: “Russia has likely been secretly carrying out very low-yield nuclear tests to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, according to a new U.S. intelligence assessment, challenging Moscow’s claims that it is faithfully adhering to an international treaty banning nuclear tests,” The Wall Street Journal reports .
“The assessment marks the first time the U.S. has said the Kremlin has failed to strictly observe its commitments under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.”
In response, the Arms Control Association notes that Lt. Gen. Robert Ashley, who discussed the information during an appearance at The Hudson Institute on Wednesday, did not conclusively say the Russians had conducted the tests, only that they had “the capability” to do so.
The association called on the administration to ratify the test ban treaty and check on Russia’s compliance.

On the Hill STOPPING ARMS DEALS: Lawmakers from both parties who are angry over Trump’s decision to go around Congress and fast-track arms sales to Middle East countries are figuring out ways to block the transfers, reports The Hill.
“Congress still has many paths it can take to both register concern about the president misusing emergency powers in this instance and ultimately act to stop the sales and shipments,” said Jeff Abramson with the Arms Control Association.

State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law' - POLITICO,www.politico.com,msn.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.
The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.
“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.
Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.
The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signa l a religious component, experts said.
Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.
“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.
The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.
The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.
Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.
State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.
But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”
“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.
Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.
“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”
“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.
Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.
The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.
The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.
But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.
It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.
According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
Farm lending data shows cracks in ag economy - POLITICO,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-agriculture/2019/05/30/farm-lending-data-shows-cracks-in-ag-economy-637490,"With help from Catherine Boudreau and Megan Cassella
 Farmers are falling behind on their loans at a higher rate this year, as agriculture faces economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s trade agenda to declining income and rising farm debt.
— Food stamp spending had a direct impact on employment rates in rural areas , an Agriculture Department report found.
— The FDA’s public meeting on cannabidiol set for Friday could be a step toward providing clarity on federal CBD rules, after the new farm bill legalized hemp production and sent regulators scrambling to manage booming interest in the plant and its trendy byproduct.
HAPPY THURSDAY, MAY 30! Welcome to Morning Ag, where we just learned there are dolphins living in the Potomac River (and many of them are named after presidents and members of Congress). FARM LENDING DATA SHOWS CRACKS IN AG: The FDIC released its quarterly banking report on Wednesday, revealing an uptick in the rate of farm loans that are past due, your host writes . It’s the latest datapoint in the broader trend of worsening conditions in the farm economy, which is grappling with Trump’s trade wars, a five-year drop in income and the highest levels of farm sector debt since the 1980s crisis.
“Some farm banks are reporting asset quality deterioration,” said Diane Ellis, director of FDIC’s insurance and research division. The rate of noncurrent farm loans (those that are more than 90 days late or in “nonaccrual” status) at all FDIC-insured lenders was 1.26 percent in the first quarter of 2019 — the highest since early 2012, according to the data.
Community banks bearing the brunt: Ellis said the “emerging strain” in ag lending is largely hitting smaller banks “in the middle of the country.” The share of noncurrent farm production loans at community banks was 1.28 percent in the first quarter, higher than the long-term average, she said.
Keeping an eye on land values: Farmers have been able to borrow against their property, and farmland values have held steady, but FDIC officials warned that won’t always be the case. The Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank last month said there’s “potential for lower farmland values moving forward.”
USDA: FOOD STAMP SPENDING BOOSTS RURAL EMPLOYMENT: Payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program nearly quadrupled between 2001 and 2014, in part because of Obama-era policies intended to stimulate the economy during and after the Great Recession. For every $10,000 in additional food stamp benefits that were spent during this period, employment in non-metropolitan counties increased by 0.4 percent, according a new report published by USDA’s Economic Research Service. The impact in urban counties was not statistically significant, the agency said.
A first: The study marked the first time that the actual stimulus impacts of SNAP spending were estimated using statistical methods, ERS said. Past research only tried to predict them using economic simulation models.
How SNAP compares: ERS researchers also found that federal money spent on food stamp benefits between 2008 and 2010 — a window that captured part of the recession and its immediate aftermath — had a much larger impact than other government payments combined, including Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance.
That’s likely because SNAP benefits are paid directly to low-income people, “who have a high propensity to spend rather than save,” driving demand for food and other goods, the study says.
Adding fuel to the fire? USDA is planning to move ERS researchers studying issues on which the Trump administration has made controversial moves — including food stamps — out of Washington, POLITICO has reported .
The White House has repeatedly targeted SNAP for spending cuts. A USDA proposal would disqualify an estimated 750,000 people who are able-bodied adults without dependents from SNAP, by making it more difficult for states to waive rules limiting these so-called ABAWDs to three months of benefits unless they are working, volunteering or enrolled in training for at least 20 hours a week.
House Ag to weigh in: The panel’s Biotechnology, Horticulture and Research Subcommittee will hold a hearing on the ERS and National Institute of Food and Agriculture relocation on June 5. USDA is expected to reveal the new site that will house the agencies any day now.
STATES SEEK CBD CLARITY WITH FDA MEETING AHEAD: Federal regulators have been slow to get a handle on the growing interest in hemp and CBD since Congress passed the 2018 farm bill in December, leaving states to chart their own course to manage their slice of the already $1.5 billion sector, write Pro Health Care’s Sarah Owermohle and Renuka Rayasam.
On the agenda: The FDA will host a public meeting Friday on cannabidiol, and a packed house is likely. The event will address whether CBD oil and other edible versions are considered food or medicine, as well as the potential risks and benefits associated with such goods, according to Deputy Commissioner Amy Abernethy.
So far, the agency has largely taken a whack-a-mole approach to cracking down on manufacturers of CBD goods making questionable claims about the substance’s health benefits. And the patchwork of state rules has already caused headaches, like when Idaho police arrested a truck driver transporting hemp from Oregon and charged him with trafficking marijuana.
Hemp rules also hazy: Farmers faced their own legal hurdles trying to import hemp seeds ahead of planting season, until the Trump administration found a workaround .
This week, USDA General Counsel Stephen Vaden issued a memo laying out some basic hemp guidelines, though formal regulations aren’t expected until this fall. The document says states cannot prohibit interstate transport of legally produced hemp, among other conclusions.
Trade HEADING NORTH, SOUTH TO TALK USMCA: Vice President Mike Pence visits Ottawa today to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to talk next steps in ratifying the new NAFTA deal, per the VP’s office. Pence and Trudeau will meet privately and then give joint remarks to Canadian business leaders and Parliament.
The trip comes one day after Canada’s House of Commons filed its bill to implement the so-called U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement — the first major legislative step toward ratification in any of the three nations, as Pro Canada’s Alexander Panetta notes here .
Southbound: A bipartisan group of congressional aides are set to visit Mexico City next week to review the country’s newly passed labor overhaul law, per Pro Trade’s Sabrina Rodriguez. The trip could potentially assuage Democrats’ concerns about whether labor standards in the trade deal can be enforced.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested she wants to see how Mexico implements those labor changes before Congress votes on USMCA. Mexico has yet to put forward a plan to pay for, among other changes, additional labor inspectors or new structures to handle labor disputes and monitor unions.
Calendar check: Time is running short for legislative action on the landmark trade deal. Congress has just 28 days where both chambers are scheduled to be in session before the August recess begins. And Canada’s Parliament adjourns next month ahead of elections in October, so any legislative action beyond June would require an emergency session.

DeVos Today FIRESIDE CHAT WITH DEVOS: The Education secretary will be on hand to discuss some of the “challenges facing today’s classrooms” at The Fund for American Studies' annual conference on June 28, the group’s president announced in an email to supporters on Wednesday.
— Those challenges include “the decline of civic education, intellectual diversity and economic literacy,” Roger R. Ream wrote. “We'll talk about the initiatives her department is undertaking to address some of these concerns, and how nonprofits like TFAS and ordinary Americans like you can help.”
— TFAS says its vision is to “win over each new generation to the ideas of liberty, limited government and free markets,” and it offers programs teaching those principles to students and young professionals.
— Other featured speakers include: Paul Gigot, editorial page editor of The Wall Street Journal; José Piñera, a Chilean economist; and Andrew Puzder, former CEO of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s Restaurants. Puzder withdrew his nomination as Labor secretary in 2017 after he admitted to not paying taxes on the services of an undocumented immigrant who worked for him and after his former wife’s allegations of domestic abuse resurfaced.
2020 Watch PROFESSOR BIDEN: While pitching his education plan at a forum with teachers, Biden shared some personal nuggets about his work in the education world that you may not have known. Take this example: “I used to drive a school bus — not a joke — when I was in law school.”
— It may have been an odd detail to share, given Biden’s controversial history with school busing. But 2020 contenders have been working to court and connect with teachers at town hall meetings led by the American Federation of Teachers as part of the union's primary endorsement process.
— Biden was no different, chatting on Tuesday about the time he spent working as a substitute teacher at an alternative school — also during law school — for “all the kids who got kicked out of the regular school. I learned a whole heck of a lot about how it works,” he said.
— He also went into detail about the two decades he spent as an adjunct law professor at Widener University, teaching an advanced course in constitutional law, while serving as a senator representing Delaware. It was a three-hour class, but he said it never lasted less than five hours because students would stay to talk through trouble with finances or home life.
— “I don’t think people fully appreciate the circumstance that many of you find yourselves in,” he said.
MUCH ADO ABOUT THAT FORUM: Vivi, the 10-year-old girl who asked Biden a question at Tuesday's AFT forum, is “proud” of her interaction with him, according to a new statement from her teacher, even if social media seized on it as another ""creepy Biden"" moment.
— The teacher, Lucia Moreno, a Houston Federation of Teachers member, released a statement through her union after receiving several media calls on Wednesday about the moment. After Biden answered Vivi’s question, he told her, “I’ll bet you’re as bright as you are good-looking.” When she told him her favorite subject is journalism, he led her to the back to meet the press corps and stood behind her with his hands on her shoulders.
— Pictures of the moment made the rounds on Twitter, with some calling it “creepy.” Just before entering the race, Biden weathered allegations that his handsy style made some women uncomfortable.
— Moreno, who runs an after-school journalism program, gave this statement: “I took two of my students to the AFT Votes Town Hall with Vice President Biden yesterday to show them the power of journalism, activism and politics, and I was deeply proud that Vivi — who is the daughter of a Salvadoran immigrant — was able to ask the Vice President a question and interact with him directly. After the event when I spoke to her mother, she told me she would treasure the experience of her daughter meeting a politician who believes in family values and understands the experiences of immigrants. Today, when we returned to the classroom, Vivi was equally proud of the moment and excited to tell the entire school about the learning experience she had.”

Third House Republican blocks massive disaster aid package - POLITICO,www.politico.com,Sarah Ferris,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/third-house-republican-blocks-massive-disaster-aid-package-1348433,"Conservative House Republicans succeeded again Thursday in their campaign to derail passage of a $19.1 billion disaster aid package.
Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) objected to passing the bill by voice vote. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who derailed the same measure earlier this week, was by Rose's side.
The move means the measure will not be sent to President Donald Trump for his signature until the House returns from recess Monday and takes a roll call vote.
This is the third time a member of the GOP’s most conservative wing has risen to block the bill from becoming law during the 10-day Memorial Day recess, sparking public scorn from some members of their own party.
The dissenting lawmakers argue that such a massive emergency aid package should not be passed without a recorded vote and that the funding should be offset by other spending reductions, rather than increasing the federal deficit.
They also contend that the president’s $4.5 billion request for extra border security funding should be included."

Follow O'ROURKE ROLLS OUT IMMIGRATION PLAN: 2020 Democratic presidential contender Beto O’Rourke on Wednesday proposed a major rewrite of the immigration system that would create a pathway to citizenship for TPS and DACA recipients, remove fees for naturalization and raise visa caps, POLITICO’s David Siders reports . The former Texas representative says he would use his presidential authority to halt many Trump administration policies, such as travel bans, family separations and construction of the southern border wall.
The plan proposes increasing immigration court staff, which faces a soaring case backlog. O’Rourke argues that immigration reform “will be critical to unlocking” America’s “future success,” POLITICO’s Quint Forgey writes. “Immigrants driving economic growth, O’Rourke claims, will add $2 billion to state and local tax revenues every year and cut the deficit by at least $1 trillion over the next two decades.” Read a breakdown of the proposal from Forgey here .
NLRB STAFF CHANGES AT THE NLRB: “The heads of the National Labor Relations Board are planning a restructure of administrative staff at the agency’s roughly 26 regional offices, including demoting employees in certain job classifications nationwide,” Bloomberg Law’s Hassan Kanu reports. “The plan would reclassify almost all NLRB administrative professionals as general ‘program support assistants,’ and place those employees into the same grade within the government’s General Schedule pay system,” he writes.
NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb and the agency’s career staff have been at odds since January 2018 , when Robb proposed restructuring the agency to demote regional directors, whom the business lobby considers too pro-union. More from Bloomberg Law here .

Around the Agencies TRUMP STRUGGLES TO FILL IMMIGRATION POSTS: “Trump has purged several of his top immigration officials in recent months, saying he wanted to go in a ‘tougher direction,’” POLITICO’s Gabby Orr and Daniel Lippman report. “But filling those positions with uniformly lauded candidates has proved difficult.”
They report that 16 current and former officials expressed doubt that the president’s choice to lead ICE, Mark Morgan, who started as acting director on Tuesday, “is a genuine immigration hardliner” or “understands the complexities of domestic immigration enforcement.” Morgan also never won over Brandon Judd, president of a union for Border Patrol agents.
Despite Morgan’s recent appearances praising the president’s immigration policies on Fox News, three people familiar with the process told Orr and Lippman that Morgan was chosen, “in part, because Trump had exhausted his other options.” His original pick, Ronald Vitiello, was scrapped along with other DHS officials in April, and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence plans to retire within a year.

ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST: “Scott Lloyd, whose nearly two-year tenure leading the HHS refugee office sparked lawsuits and congressional inquiries, will leave the Trump administration next week, HHS announced Wednesday,” POLITICO’s Dan Diamond reports. “Lloyd ran the refugee office for most of 2017 and 2018 as HHS was taking custody of thousands of migrant children separated from their families under the administration's zero-tolerance border enforcement policy.”
“HHS leaders previously concluded that Lloyd mismanaged efforts to reunify families,” Diamond reports. Lloyd’s moves to block unaccompanied teenage girls in federal custody from obtaining abortions initiated an ACLU-led legal battle that went all the way to the Supreme Court. More from Diamond here .
In the States FOOD STAMPS BOOST EMPLOYMENT IN RURAL AREAS: Employment increased by 0.4 percent for every $10,000 spent in food stamps in non-metropolitan counties between 2001 and 2014, USDA’s Economic Research Service found. As POLITICO’s Catherine Boudreau reports, it was the agency’s first-ever statistical analysis of the economic stimulus of payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “The Obama administration’s 2009 stimulus package authorized a large increase in SNAP benefits during the recession and its immediate aftermath,” she explains.
“SNAP redemptions [the value of SNAP benefits redeemed by SNAP-authorized stores] could have a larger economic stimulus impact than many other forms of government spending per dollar spent, especially during a recession, because they are paid directly to low-income people,” the report said.

FINES RACK UP OVER D.C.’S ‘BAN THE BOX’: D.C. employers have faced nearly $500,000 in charges over violations of the city’s “ban the box” law, which bars employers from inquiring about an applicant’s criminal history before hiring, The Washington Post’s Justin Wm. Moyer reports. Since passing the Fair Criminal Record Screening Act in 2014, the city has levied 1,100 charges for discrimination under the law, according to Moyer, and “more than 90 percent of those charges related to criminal background questions that appeared on job applications.”
D.C. Office of Human Rights Director Mónica Palacio told the Post that “some large multinational employers” changed their policies in response to the law. Large businesses that don’t comply can face fines of up to $5,000. More here .
Unions DOZENS OF DEMOCRATS PRESS DELTA OVER ANTI-UNION CAMPAIGN: Some 72 House Democrats signed on to a letter with Rep. Mark Pocan (Wis.) urging Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian “to immediately cease all efforts” to dissuade the company’s workers from joining the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The letter, dated Tuesday, said the company has made “misleading and deceptive claims about the role of a union and about the IAM specifically.”
The IAM filed charges earlier this month with the National Mediation Board against Delta, alleging the company’s “anti-union” campaign has interfered with a union drive by its flight attendants and baggage handlers. That campaign was brought into the spotlight earlier this month when a photo of a provocative anti-union poster, part of a Delta push called “Don’t Risk It, Don’t Sign It,” prompted a Twitter backlash and inquiries from several Democrats. Nine senators, including presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , also penned a letter to Bastian calling the anti-union effort “insulting and demeaning.” A Delta spokesperson told Morning Shift that IAM’s claims “are completely baseless.” Read the latest letter here .
WALKOUT AT VOX MEDIA: Hundreds of workers at Vox Media on Wednesday staged a one-hour walkout “to urge management to agree to a fair contract,” the Vox Media Union said on Twitter . According to the union , workers have been negotiating with management for over a year and the walkout stemmed from issues including “guaranteed annual raises and equitable minimum wage scales,” “fair retroactive wage increases” and “full and fair severance” for laid off employees. Vox Media did not respond to Morning Shift’s request for comment.

""Since my heart is golden / I've got sense to hold in / Tempted just to make an ugly scene / No I'm not as proper / My money's in copper / Ripped down from the brownstones to the street.""
Aviation BOEING’S CHIEF ON CBS EVENING NEWS: The CEO of Boeing told CBS News that he thinks the grounded 737 MAX will return to service by the end of 2019 or perhaps sooner. Muilenburg also said he’d let his family fly on the MAX “without any hesitation,” and that Boeing won’t rebrand the plane (as President Donald Trump proposed ). Our Brianna Gurciullo has more .
THE WAIT CONTINUES: Airlines, for their part, are expecting at least 10 to 12 more weeks of delay before the MAX gets back in the air, The Wall Street Journal reports . That’s according to Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association. And it comes with several other challenges for the company, including a possible lag between regulators in different countries approving the plane to fly again as well as convincing passengers that the MAX is safe to fly on.
ICYMI: Trump repeated his claims about aviation innovation while in Japan this week: “They’re always coming up with new ideas. They’re making planes so complex you can’t fly them. … We all want innovation, but it’s too much,” he said.
FLYING HIGH: Believe it or not, airline satisfaction is at its highest point ever, according to a survey by J.D. Power, the marketing information services company that you probably know from its car awards and ratings. Citing “a combination of newer planes, better ticket value and improved customer touchpoints,” the firm said overall satisfaction with airlines is at its highest point in measured history, up 11 points (on a 1,000 point scale) over a record-setting performance last year.
What’s driving it: “New technology investments have dramatically improved the reservation and check-in process. Fleets are newer and travelers generally feel that they are getting great value for their money. These improvements have been most profound in the traditional carrier segment, where customer satisfaction has climbed considerably,” said J.D. Power’s travel intelligence lead Michael Taylor.
YOU CAN BRING YOUR WEED ON THE PLANE NOW (KINDA): TSA updated its marijuana policy over the holiday weekend, the news blog Marijuana Moment reported earlier this week. The agency changed the medical marijuana section on its “What Can I Bring” website from no to yes, with special instructions. “Specifically, the agency is clarifying that hemp-derived CBD products may now be carried on planes under certain circumstances,” MM writes.
An agency spokesperson told MM that the policy change follows the FDA’s approval of a cannabis-derived anti-seizure medication called Epidiolex, designed for children with pediatric epilepsy.
Read more on the change from MM here , and check out TSA's updated website here .
A HARD DAY’S NIGHT: TSA announced Wednesday that it has also made changes to its performance management systems for bag screeners that include removing some of the “burdensome reporting requirements” for employee evaluations — making it easier for managers to identify which screeners should be eligible for raises. Also, screeners selected as “model officers” under a new recognition program will become eligible for “additional salary increases, monetary awards, and/or other forms of special recognition over and above the performance rating process,” TSA said. The changes will go into effect in fiscal 2020.
WELCOME TO THE CLUB: Boston's Logan Airport is the latest hub to team up with Clear, a company developing biometrics technology for security checkpoints. Travelers using Logan’s Terminal A can sign up for the service, which says it helps get passengers through security more quickly and easily for $15 a month.
Infrastructure FROM THE PROBLEM SOLVERS: Infrastructure talks between the White House and Democrats may have blown up earlier this month, but ideas are still flowing about how to make good policy going forward. The Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan working group in Congress, released a new report on Tuesday offering a few suggestions on infrastructure. It includes expanding infrastructure financing options, incentivizing states to adopt P3 legislation, and streamlining project permitting. The report also calls for indexing and modernizing the gas tax.
And Brookings fellow Shalini Vajjhala offers this advice to the Trump administration and Congress: Don’t focus on making big dollar announcements. Instead, reward proactive investments by states and cities, focus on early stages of projects, and prioritize resilience.
Transit STOP, THE RAIL YOU SAVE MIGHT BE YOUR OWN: Fifteen members of New York’s congressional delegation sent a letter to MTA leaders urging the agency to not buy rail cars from China Railway Rolling Stock Corp. over cybersecurity concerns. “The lawmakers are requesting MTA provide additional information about any briefings it has had with DHS or other agencies to discuss risks and to specify any cybersecurity protocols it's put in place for the Chinese company, among other things,” our Stephanie Beasley reports .
Background: Lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned as CRRC continues to land major contracts throughout the United States. A bill, S. 1663 (116) , introduced in the Senate earlier this month would prohibit Washington’s transit agency from using federal funds to buy Chinese-manufactured rail cars. And another bill, S. 846 (116) , would more broadly prevent FTA funds from going toward state-owned enterprises. That measure has the backing of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which wrote to lawmakers in support of its House counterpart this week.

Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance,www.politico.com,BERNIE BECKER,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/wyden-threatens-nominee-holds-over-tax-return-response-1489740,"Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”
“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”
Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.
Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.
In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.
Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.
Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December."

“A draft proposal circulating among Trump’s Homeland Security advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have resided in a country other than their own before coming to the U.S., according to a DHS official and an outside advocate familiar with the plan. If executed, it would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border, many of whom have trekked a perilous journey through Mexico.” POLITICO
SAD NEWS … “‘Gentleman’ Thad Cochran, Mississippi’s ‘Quiet Persuader’ in the U.S. Senate, dead at 81,” by the Jackson Clarion-Ledger’s Geoffrey Pender: “Cochran was first elected to the Senate in 1978, becoming the first Republican in more than 100 years to win a statewide election in Mississippi. He was the 10th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history. Cochran previously served three terms in the House of Representatives, from 1973-1978, before winning an election to replace longtime Sen. James Eastland, who retired.
“Cochran, a Republican, was re-elected in 2014 to a seventh six-year term that began in January 2015. He served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a post he had held briefly in the mid-2000s. He resigned last year due to health concerns.
“Cochran, of quiet stately demeanor and known for playing piano to relax in his office, has been called ‘Gentleman Thad’ by his peers in Congress. Time Magazine dubbed him ‘The Quiet Persuader’ for his behind-the-scenes consensus building in the Senate. But he’s also been called the ‘King of Pork’ for securing billions in federal spending for Mississippi.” Clarion-Ledger

CENSUS BOMBSHELL -- “Deceased G.O.P. Strategist’s Hard Drives Reveal New Details on the Census Citizenship Question,” by NYT’s Michael Wines: “Thomas B. Hofeller achieved near-mythic status in the Republican Party as the Michelangelo of gerrymandering, the architect of partisan political maps that cemented the party’s dominance across the country. But after he died last summer, his estranged daughter discovered hard drives in her father’s home that revealed something else: Mr. Hofeller had played a crucial role in the Trump administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
“Files on those drives showed that he wrote a study in 2015 concluding that adding a citizenship question to the census would allow Republicans to draft even more extreme gerrymandered maps to stymie Democrats. And months after urging President Trump’s transition team to tack the question onto the census, he wrote the key portion of a draft Justice Department letter claiming the question was needed to enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act — the rationale the administration later used to justify its decision.” NYT
#METOO LATEST -- “Sixteen women allege discrimination at FBI training academy in lawsuit,” by NBC’s Stephanie Gosk, Sarah Fitzpatrick, Julia Ainsley and Kenzi Abou-Sabe: “The women, seven of whom still work at the FBI, detail incidents where they say they were punished for behavior their male counterparts got away with. They also describe what they say is a male-biased review process, and even overt sexual harassment. …
“One of the women, Lauren Rose, provided an email she says she received from then-FBI Director James Comey in response to her frustrations at being dismissed from training after serving with the FBI for nearly 6 years. Rose described unsuccessful attempts to speak with a supervisor to get clarity about the decision to dismiss her one week before graduation in May 2015. She says Comey responded in a lengthy message, telling her ‘I believe I have thoughtful leaders at Training Division, who apply tremendous care to such decisions,’ and he would therefore not question their actions.” NBC

But it was the rupture after last June’s G-7 meeting that made up her mind: Trump is not a partner that Germany can rely on.
“Almost 12 months on, the situation has only gotten worse. There’s a mix of anguish and frustration in Berlin and officials are asking themselves whether the relationship has already crossed the point of no return. Even if Trump loses in 2020, they say the trust that underpinned the transatlantic friendship for seven decades may be gone for good. Germany has already started building new alliances that will safeguard its interests in a world where the U.S. won’t. And some of them are not to Washington’s liking.” Bloomberg

2020 WATCH -- QUITE A DATELINE … “Cory Booker Shoots Down Joe Biden’s Claims On Crime Bill And Mass Incarceration,” by HuffPost’s Kevin Robillard somewhere on US-218 between Mount Pleasant and Keokuk, Iowa: “New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, sharply criticized one of the signature legislative achievements of former Vice President Joe Biden, the contest’s front-runner, calling a decades-old crime law that Biden helped write and pass ‘awful’ and ‘shameful’ for its role in increasing mass incarceration.
“In an interview with HuffPost while traveling on a campaign-rented RV between two stops in southeastern Iowa during Memorial Day weekend, Booker ― who has made criminal justice reform central to his White House bid ― said he disagreed with Biden’s assertion that the 1994 law didn’t significantly increase the U.S. jail population.” HuffPost

“Previously, the investigation had centered on corruption inside Tallahassee government, including during Gillum’s time as mayor.

Trump administration makes major push on Congress to pass new NAFTA,www.politico.com,MEGAN CASSELLA,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-administration-nafta-congress-1348431,"The Trump administration has taken a step toward ratification of the new North American trade agreement, sending a draft statement to Congress that puts the legislative body on notice the pact could be coming soon.
The decision to send the draft of what’s called the ""Statement of Administrative Action"" on Thursday afternoon is creating fresh tension with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats who are still pressing the administration to address problems that they have raised with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The step comes after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and other Trump administration officials emphasized that they would not send the USMCA to Congress without a signal from Pelosi that she and her caucus were ready to hold a vote on it.
The move begins a 30-day window that must pass before the Trump administration is allowed to submit the full implementing legislation to Congress. It does not start a clock on any legislation to be taken up, but it paves the way for the next step in the process — sending the USMCA to Capitol Hill for a vote — to take place as soon as the end of next month.
But Democrats are continuing to press for changes in areas such as labor standards and enforcement. Pelosi has also indicated that she wants to see how Mexico implements its new labor laws before USMCA gets a vote in Congress.
The House speaker derided the decision to send the draft statement before Democrats were fully satisfied as ""not a positive step.""
""It indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement,"" she said in a lengthy statement. “A new trade agreement without enforcement is not progress for the American worker, just a press release for the president.“
House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) also said that the timeline for considering the deal will depend on when changes are made to address Democrats' issues with the agreement. The ""premature submission"" of the draft statement will have ""no impact"" on continuing discussions, Neal added.
A Capitol Hill aide added that the draft statement was unlikely to bring the Trump administration ""any closer to addressing concerns that members of Congress have voiced.”
“I think they’re trying to create the illusion of progress by checking a box,"" the aide said.
Administration officials, for their part, sought to emphasize that the decision to move forward with the statement of administrative action was foremost a procedural step.
In a letter sent to key congressional leaders including Pelosi, Lighthizer said the draft statement ""provides an outline for further discussions with Congress on these issues.”
""We believe that the USMCA can — and ultimately will — attract broad bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress,"" Lighthizer wrote. ""That certainly remains my goal.""
The timing of the move leaves open the possibility of the Trump administration seeing the deal passed this summer, depending on whether and when officials are able to reach a compromise with Democrats.
Vice President Mike Pence told reporters earlier Thursday during a trip to Ottawa that the administration is ""working earnestly"" to wrap the process up before the fall.
""I can assure you that the president and I are working with members of the United States Congress to pass the USMCA — and to pass the USMCA this summer,"" Pence said during a news conference after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The White House's move also backs up actions that its North American trading partners have taken this week to move the deal toward approval in their respective countries. Mexico took the first steps to ratify the new North American pact in its Senate on Thursday, while Canada introduced a bill earlier this week to implement the deal.
Although the move represents the most significant step so far toward ratification in the U.S., it does not guarantee the trade deal will be voted on anytime soon.
Former President Barack Obama, for example, submitted his statement of administrative action for the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership in August 2016, but he never ultimately sent the implementing bill for the deal.
That’s partly because Republican leaders refused to move on the legislation in the heat of the 2016 presidential election, and partly because even members of Congress who supported the TPP had a number of concerns about various provisions in the agreement.

Barr says Mueller 'could’ve reached a decision' on obstruction,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/william-barr-mueller-report-decision-1348216,"Attorney General William Barr split with Robert Mueller on Thursday over Mueller’s decision to punt on whether Trump sought to obstruct his Russia investigation, saying the special counsel ""could've reached a decision.""
The rift between Barr and Mueller publicly reemerged after Mueller broke his silence on Wednesday following the nearly two year investigation. In his first public comments, Mueller told reporters that charging Trump with anything was never “an option we could consider” due to a longstanding Department of Justice policy against charging a sitting president with a federal crime.
Story Continued Below
While Mueller made clear the investigation operated under that framework, Barr told reporters last month that Mueller had not solely relied on the DOJ opinion when deciding whether Trump obstructed justice.
In a letter to lawmakers summarizing Mueller’s conclusions earlier this year, Barr said that because Mueller did not make a determination on obstruction, he and then-deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made the decisions themselves.
Asked whether he agreed with Mueller’s interpretation of the DOJ opinion, Barr said he felt differently.
“I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,” he told CBS’s Jan Crawford in an interview set to air Friday. “The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he is in office, but he could’ve reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.”
Barr said he wouldn’t litigate Mueller’s reasoning for declining to make a decision one way or the other, telling Crawford the special counsel “had his reasons for not doing it, which he explained, and I’m not going to argue about those reasons.”
“But when he didn’t make a decision, the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I felt it was necessary for us as the heads of the department to reach that decision,” Barr continued.
Democrats and even some Republicans have blasted Barr for at times fiercely defending Trump, accusing him of acting as the president’s personal lawyer rather than the country’s. Even Mueller reached out to the attorney general in the wake of his letter to Congress to express concern with how his findings had been portrayed.
Barr’s antagonizers have pointed to a letter Barr wrote last year, before being nominated for attorney general, in which he outlined his opinions on executive authority as they pertained to the Russia investigation. Barr and Rosenstein's call on obstruction, combined with Barr's defenses of Trump, have prompted a slew of calls for Barr to resign or be impeached by Congress.
The attorney general also tweaked Mueller for pointing out in his remarks Wednesday that per the Justice Department’s opinion, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” which many read to mean impeachment proceedings.
“I’m not sure what he was suggesting, but the Department of Justice doesn’t use our powers of investigating crime as an adjunct to Congress,” Barr asserted."
'They don’t make 'em like Joe anymore': Biden expands grip on congressional endorsements,www.politico.com,NOLAN D. MCCASKILL,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/joe-biden-congressional-endorsements-1347598,"Former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his lead in congressional endorsements Thursday, landing the backing of second-term Rep. Al Lawson of Florida.
“They don’t make ‘em like Joe anymore,” Lawson said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. “We have an opportunity now to meet head on the greatest challenges of our time, and ensure our best days still lie ahead of us and that is why I am endorsing him to be the next president of the United States.”
Lawson said Biden “has a long history of doing what’s right and not what’s easy to advance the causes of America’s working families.”
Lawson is the latest in a string of Democrats to line up behind Biden in Florida , which will be a key battleground state in the 2020 presidential election.
He cited Biden’s “proven track record of bringing people together and delivering results” on issues ranging from health care and the environment to civil rights and women’s rights.
“America is at a crossroads,” Lawson wrote, “and it is vital that we elect a leader who will restore the soul of this country, put us back on a path of prosperity and make certain we are respected on the world stage. I have no doubt that Vice President Biden is that leader.”
A Lawson spokesman said the congressman “has always had a great deal of respect and admiration for” Biden, noting the two campaigned together for Hillary Clinton in 2016 at the historically black university Florida A&M. Biden supported Lawson’s congressional bid that year.
Biden entered the crowded Democratic presidential primary in April as the putative front-runner. He has dominated national polling, leading second-place Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by double digits, and is also atop early state polls.
Lawson, a former professional basketball player and assistant basketball coach at Florida State, is Biden’s 15th endorsement from a current member of Congress — and the fifth from the Congressional Black Caucus.
“As Biden is fond of saying, all politics is personal,” said a Biden campaign aide. “The product of his career in elected office is a long list of deep relationships. He is not one to merely check the box when he gets on the phone. He‘s going to have a real, substantive conversation.”
Though CBC members Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey launched their White House bids well before Biden, it’s the former vice president and six-term senator who has the most endorsements within the 55-member group. Several of its members, however, have warmed up to the prospect of a Biden-Harris ticket to take on President Donald Trump next year.
Former CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.), who has also endorsed Biden, could play a formal role in his campaign , possibly as co-chair."
USMCA action everywhere except in the U.S.,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/05/30/usmca-action-everywhere-except-in-the-us-441931," and Adam Behsudi Editor’s Story Continued Below
— The U.S. is checking in on the progress of USMCA in Canada and Mexico, all while momentum back home in Congress is stalled. Vice President Mike Pence will be in Ottawa today and a bipartisan delegation of congressional staffers will head to Mexico next week.
— The Export-Import Bank this morning will hold its first meeting in four years to swear in its new chair and some of its new board members.
— White House trade adviser Peter Navarro throws out some numbers as part of a new push to get Congress to pass a bill that would expand President Donald Trump’s powers to raise tariffs.
IT'S THURSDAY, MAY 30! is firmly in the chronically-late-to-the-airport category but (knock on wood!) has yet to miss a flight. Are you with me or this guy on this one? Let me know: mcassella@politico.com or @mmcassella .
Driving the Day USMCA ACTION EVERYWHERE EXCEPT IN THE U.S.: Canada on Tuesday introduced its bill to implement the new NAFTA, but there is still little momentum stateside in getting the pact through Congress.
To the south: House Democrats say they won’t be rushed by Canada’s moves. A trip to Mexico City for a bipartisan, bicameral group of congressional aides next week signals adherence to a timeline Speaker Nancy Pelosi set out last month that she wants to see how Mexico implements its recently passed labor reform law before Congress considers USMCA. The aides will meet with Mexican officials about the ratification process and labor changes.
— Outstanding items: Mexico has yet to put forward a plan for how it will pay for reforms like the addition of labor inspectors and creation of new structures to handle labor disputes and monitor unions.
The labor changes are ""going to take a really concerted effort and it could take many years. The important thing is to see the roadmap, the commitment, the timeline and the needed resources to make it all happen,"" Cathy Feingold, director of AFL-CIO's international department, told POLITICO. ""None of that has been developed yet."" Sabrina has more here .
To the north: Vice President Mike Pence, who has become the Trump administration’s chief cheerleader for the deal, will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa today to “talk about next steps in advancing the USMCA,” according to Pence’s office. Pence and Trudeau will first meet behind closed doors before giving joint remarks to members of the press, business community and Canadian Parliament.
The visit is the latest trip for Pence, who until now had been focused on ginning up support for the agreement in the U.S. He’s held public and private roundtables and discussions in Indiana, Michigan, Virginia, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Florida and North Carolina, as well as locally, according to his office. Pro Canada’s Alex Panetta has more here .
ASIA-PACIFIC REGION URGED TO LEAD ON TRADE REFORM: A new paper from the Asia Society Policy Institute today warns that “the trade regime is in trouble and in urgent need of reform,” and calls on the nations of the Asia-Pacific region to find the way out of the morass.
“No part of the world has benefited more from the rules-based trading system than the Asia-Pacific region, where trade has exploded since the creation of the WTO,” the paper says. “In light of the U.S. retreat, it is time for the countries of the Asia-Pacific … to step up and lead reform efforts in the WTO and elsewhere.”
Asia-Pacific countries should lead efforts to reshape the WTO by updating rules and existing agreements, pursuing new plurilateral agreements on urgent matters, and improving the dispute settlement system, the paper says.
The paper was co-authored by former acting Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Wendy Cutler and other trade experts from around the region. It will be discussed at an event in Washington today.
THE DIFFICULTY OF MOVING SUPPLY CHAINS: Trump seems to be telling U.S. apparel importers to move their supply chains out of China with his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on all remaining Chinese goods, but that’s easier said than done, Hun Quach, vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said Wednesday.
U.S. companies fear foreign competitors will swoop in to make deals with their Chinese partners as soon as they pull out. That will give those competitors a significant advantage, even if U.S. companies form new supply chains in Vietnam, Bangladesh or elsewhere, Quach said.
In addition, no one is certain how long Trump’s tariffs will be in place. If companies move out of China and then the tariffs are lifted, it will be very hard to move back into China to resume operations. The former Chinese partners are going to say: “‘Nope, we’re good. You go back to Vietnam, you go back to Bangladesh, you go back to … wherever you’re sourcing now as your alternative and you’re good there,’” Quach said.
FIRST EX-IM BOARD MEETING IN 4 YEARS TODAY: U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will attend the U.S. Export-Import Bank’s first board meeting in four years today. One item on the agenda : approving the minutes from the last meeting on July 16, 2015.
The bank is fully operational after the Senate approved three new members to the board earlier this month. That includes new president Kimberly Reed. Lighthizer and Ross are ex-officio members of the board, which has about $40 billion in potential business in its pipeline because of the four-year delay in getting new members.
NEW TRADE STAFF TAKE OVER IN BRUSSELS: Sabine Weyand will take over as director-general for the European Commission's trade department on June 1, replacing outgoing trade director Jean-Luc Demarty, the EC announced on Wednesday.
Weyand, a German national, is expected to take the lead on negotiating a future trade deal with the United Kingdom. Demarty will stick around as ""hors classe"" adviser to commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Secretary-General Martin Selmayr, and deal with multilateralism, WTO reform and trade negotiations with the U.S.
There are now four women leading EU trade policy: Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström; Weyand; and Sandra Gallina and Helena König, who serve as deputy director-generals.
NAVARRO CRUNCHES THE NUMBERS IN PUSH FOR TRADE BILL: Navarro is reviving the push for Congress to pass the Reciprocal Trade Act — and this time he’s crunched some numbers to back up his argument. The bill, which was introduced at the start of the year but gained little momentum on Capitol Hill, would give Trump expansive powers to raise tariffs to match the levels imposed by other countries.
Navarro, in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, argued that it would also reduce the U.S. trade deficit by between $54.3 billion and $63.6 billion — a figure he said would lead to a “jobs boost ranging between 350,000 and 380,000.” Read it here .

Trade Remedy Corner QUARTZ COUNTERTOP PROBE EXPANDS TO INDIA, TURKEY: The Commerce Department said it will initiate new anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations of quartz surface products from India and Turkey. Imports of quartz countertops from China have already been hit with huge tariffs as part of a separate case, which is now waiting for a final injury determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission. The investigation of imports from India and Turkey, as well as the case against China, was petitioned by Minnesota-based Cambria.
COMMERCE HITS KEGS FROM 3 COUNTRIES WITH DUTIES: Refillable stainless steel kegs from China, Mexico and Germany have been unfairly dumped in the United States, Commerce found on Wednesday. In its preliminary ruling, the department imposed anti-dumping duties as high as 79.7 percent against China, 18.5 percent against Mexico and 8.6 percent against Germany.
Imports of the product from the three countries totaled $35.6 million in 2017. The decision marks a win for Pennsylvania-based American Keg Company, which petitioned the case. Commerce is scheduled to make a final decision by mid-August with respect to Mexico and mid-October with respect to China and Germany.
CHINESE MATTRESSES GET PUMMELED: Commerce also issued preliminary anti-dumping duties ranging from 38.5 percent to a whopping 1,731.7 percent on imports of mattresses from China. Imports of mattresses topped $436 million in 2017. The sky-high rate applied to all producers in China that did not cooperate in the investigation. Commerce said it determined the rate based on its practice of applying “adverse facts available” — a process that involves filling in deficient information in a way that deters non-cooperation.

Shareholders question plants' climate readiness,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-energy/2019/05/30/shareholders-question-plants-climate-readiness-441891,"Editor's Note: This edition of Morning Energy is published weekdays at 10 a.m. POLITICO Pro Energy subscribers hold exclusive early access to the newsletter each morning at 6 a.m. To learn more about POLITICO Pro's comprehensive policy intelligence coverage, policy tools and services, click here . Quick Fix — Activist shareholders are pushing new resolutions that would require oil companies to address whether their facilities are prepared for the growing threats from climate change.
Story Continued Below
— Two senior officials at one of the world's most influential environmental groups have exited following an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct.
— The Ohio House approved legislation that would subsidize two at-risk nuclear power plants and increase existing payments for two coal plants after a last-minute push from a Trump re-election official.
GOOD THURSDAY MORNING! Entergy's Rob Hall notched another win for knowing David Davis stepped down from the Supreme Court to serve in the Senate in 1877. For today: Who was the first African-American female senator? ARE YOU READY FOR THIS? Oil and gas companies are facing new scrutiny over whether they have adequately prepared for the consequences of climate change. Activist investors who have long criticized the industry for its role in causing climate change took a new tack at two shareholder meetings this week, where they homed in on concerns that the industry has not done enough to prepare for risks like wildfires, sea level rise or intense storms, as Pro's Zack Colman reports this morning .
On Wednesday, Exxon shareholders voted down a resolution that requested the company publish a report ""on the public health risks of expanding petrochemical operations and investments in areas increasingly prone to climate change-induced storms, flooding, and sea level rise."" On the same day, Chevron shareholders opposed establishing an independent panel to evaluate its holistic climate change plan. Both companies said their boards already take climate change into account in other ways.
Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow and director of the energy security and climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Zack, however, many companies know they are exposed to climate change, but willfully look the other way or downplay the risks to investor returns.
""There’s a real question I think in public policy about how we're going to handle forward-looking climate liability,"" Jaffe said. ""Not hardening facilities and not taking risk on board enough could have real damage, which is separate from, 'Are you the cause of climate change?'""
2 EXIT GREEN GROUP AFTER SEXUAL MISCONDUCT PROBE: Two senior officials at The Nature Conservancy have left the organization after an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct, Zack reports. Mark Burget, who headed the group's North American operations, and Kacky Andrews, who led global programs, will depart, according to an email from CEO Mark Tercek to staff.
The environmental group's president, Brian McPeek, who stepped into ""a less active role"" during the investigation, will now return to his job. The moves follow an internal investigation into the organization's workplace culture by the law firm McDermott Will & Emery, which Tercek wrote revealed female employees believed The Nature Conservancy's ""culture can make it difficult to thrive.""
The investigation found that ""[s]pecifically , in several instances where there were serious allegations of misconduct, TNC opted for no or minor discipline because TNC perceived the event as 'he said/she said' with no corroborating evidence. In these instances, the accused was given the benefit of the doubt,"" the report said. Read more here .
Beyond the Beltway OHIO IS FOR NUCLEAR SUBSIDIES? A senior adviser to Donald Trump's re-election campaign made calls Tuesday night to at least five members of the Ohio House of Representatives, pressuring them to vote ""yes"" on a bill to subsidize at-risk nuclear and coal plants that successfully passed the chamber on Wednesday, POLITICO's Gavin Bade reports .
Sources told Gavin that the adviser, Bob Paduchik, said the president's re-election would be harmed if jobs were lost at the state's Perry and Davis-Besse nuclear plants. ""The message is that if we have these plants shut down we can't get Trump re-elected,"" said one senior legislative source with knowledge of the conversations. ""We're going into an election year, we can't lose the jobs.""
FirstEnergy Solutions has threatened to shut down the plants if they are not subsidized, and Cleveland.com reports Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, and labor union leaders made similar arguments in other eleventh-hour calls to lawmakers.
Approval in the House means the bill will now move to the Senate, where it has fewer vocal supporters but is still expected to pass by June, according to research firm ClearView Energy.
Around the Agencies WHERE'S PERRY? Energy Secretary Rick Perry is in Salt Lake City today for the Governor's Energy Summit. The secretary will deliver remarks with Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and Dominion Energy CEO Thomas Farrell. He will later take part in a fireside chat with Wyoming GOP Gov. Mark Gordon. Agenda here .
PARK SERVICE MOURNS LOSS OF 2: Two Alaska-based National Park Service employees, Jeff Babcock and Charles Eric Benson, died in an airplane crash in Whitehorse, Canada, on Monday evening, the agency confirmed in a release . Babcock served as the NPS Alaska region aviation manager and Benson was the NPS Alaska region safety manager.
The men were ""on a personal trip to ferry a privately-owned airplane from the Lower 48 to Anchorage, Alaska, when the plane went down shortly after take-off from Whitehorse International Airport,"" the release said. In a statement, Bert Frost, NPS Alaska regional director, called the men ""two of our very best,"" adding that the NPS and Alaska region ""have suffered a terrible loss.""
On the Hill MARKEY QUESTIONS WHITE HOUSE ROLE IN CLIMATE ASSESSMENT: Democratic Sen. Ed Markey (Mass.) wrote to Kelvin Droegemeier, head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to express concern that the White House is interfering with climate science at federal agencies, following a recent New York Times report that said the next National Climate Assessment would not include worst-case scenario projections.
Markey asked Droegemeier to identify all federal agencies and any outside agencies involved in the modeling of the NCA. ""Any political interference into the climate science that underpins this report could have a chilling effect on the scientific research going forward and could potentially put American lives and property at increased risk by understating the urgency of climate action,"" Markey wrote.
SOUND BITE: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Green New Deal a ""wonderful aspirational statement"" Wednesday, but made clear it is not legislation. ""It's a wonderful thing to attract attention and galvanize support,"" but ""legislation is legislation. Advocacy is advocacy,"" she said at the Commonwealth Club. Instead, Pelosi pointed to the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis to address the best legislative approach.
— ""This is an imperative, it's not an issue, it's not a bill. It is a value,"" she said of addressing climate change. ""It is again an imperative that it gets done. But we want it to get done in a way that unifies people. ... We can bring people together, but they all have to be at the table as we shape the consensus that is the boldest, toughest common denominator and not any weakening of the resolve.""
FLORIDA SENATORS CALL FOR RED TIDE DECLARATION: Florida's GOP senators, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott , urged Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to approve Gov.

— Privacy bill problems: Democrats and Republicans are wrangling over whether consumers should have the right to sue tech companies for mishandling their data.

Tech of the Town FACEBOOK SHAREHOLDER VOTE — Consumer and civil rights groups will make the case at Facebook’s annual shareholder meeting today against Mark Zuckerberg’s re-election to the board. Color of Change and Majority Action argue that Zuckerberg’s dual role as CEO and chairman has led the company down a path of harming users, investors and the overall business. “With Zuckerberg’s overwhelming control of the board and company, shareholders cannot be assured that the company will adopt the comprehensive reforms needed to restore confidence,” said Eli Kasargod-Staub, executive director of Majority Action.
— The push to rein in Zuckerberg is part of a broader trend of groups using shareholder meetings to try to force change at tech companies. But the tactic has its limits. Amazon shareholders last week rejected demands to halt the sale of facial recognition technology to government agencies and to adopt a more aggressive plan for fighting climate change.
PRIVACY LEGISLATION HITS ANOTHER SNAG — Lawmakers negotiating national privacy legislation are at odds over whether consumers should have a “private right of action,” allowing them to sue companies like Facebook and Google for violating a future privacy law, Cristiano and John report . Democrats looking to increase accountability for tech companies support the provision while Republicans warn it would harm small businesses and clog the courts with lawsuits. It’s another roadblock slowing down progress on a bipartisan bill, which lawmakers had hoped to iron out months ago. (The parties are also at odds over whether a federal law would override state regulations.)
— But key GOP negotiators say the provision is still in play. “There’s some not inconsequential issues that we have to work through, but I don’t think that any of them is a deal breaker,” Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters last week. Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) said he did not see the debate as something that “would prevent us from reaching an agreement.” He added: “Everything is still a live part of talks.”
— How California fits in: Privacy advocates had sought to strengthen the private right of action in California’s privacy law, but the effort stalled. Now they’re directing the push at Congress. Read the full story here .
APPLE: WE’RE GOOD FOR COMPETITION — Apple is mounting a defense against arguments that it has an unfair advantage over other developers in its own App Store. “We believe competition makes everything better and results in the best apps for our customers,” the company declares in a new website . It notes that the iPhone camera competes with Instagram and Snapchat, while Apple Maps competes with Google Maps and Waze. Apple also touts its review process that ensures the 60,000 apps it approves each week meet its standards for privacy, security, functionality and decency. “Our users trust Apple — and that trust is critical to how we operate a fair, competitive store for developer app distribution,” the company states.
— What’s going on? For one thing, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The presidential candidate has said Apple should be split from its App Store , part of her broader proposal to break up big tech companies that act as a platform and a service. Spotify is also complaining to European antitrust regulators that Apple’s mandatory revenue sharing model is anti-competitive.
GHOST IN THE MACHINE — A coalition of human rights groups, tech companies and security researchers today signalled opposition to a proposal from U.K. Government Communications Headquarters officials to give law enforcement the ability to view encrypted messages. “The ‘ghost key’ proposal put forward by GCHQ would enable a third party to see the plain text of an encrypted conversation without notifying the participants,” wrote the coalition , which includes Apple, Google and Microsoft as well as organizations like New America’s Open Technology Institute, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Democracy and Technology. The idea “poses serious threats to cybersecurity and fundamental human rights including privacy and free expression,” according to the coalition.
CORNYN: O’RIELLY DESERVES ANOTHER FCC TERM — A month from now, Republican FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly’s current term expires. Although he can remain seated until the end of 2020, he would need President Donald Trump’s renomination and a Senate confirmation vote to serve beyond then. O’Rielly has said he wants another five-year term if possible. “I think he’s outstanding,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told John. “He used to work with me at the whip’s office and I think he’s done a good job and has earned another term if he wants it.”
— Such Senate GOP support bolsters O’Rielly’s prospects. The Senate often seeks to advance nominations in bipartisan pairs, and one pairing contender for this GOP FCC spot could be Democratic FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra. Chopra’s term expires in late September.
PLUS: NOTES FOR NEXT WEEK — The Senate Commerce Committee will hold a June 5 hearing on the state of the TV and video marketplace. The witness list includes reps from NCTA, NAB, Free Press and Nielsen (but not streaming services like Netflix). That same afternoon, the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on intellectual property will hold a second hearing on “The State of Patent Eligibility in America.”

The U.K. loses its mojo in Washington - POLITICO,www.politico.com,,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/britain-influence-in-washington-brexit-1347688,"When he visited Britain last year, President Donald Trump nodded to the venerable “special relationship"" between the United States and the United Kingdom. ""Our bond is like no other,” he proclaimed.
But as he prepares for his first state visit to the longtime ally next week, close observers say Britain’s influence in Washington is at a low point, suffering from a long-term decline accelerated by the one-two punch of Brexit and the election of Trump, whose actions have done more to harm the relationship than his words may suggest.
On the military front, Britain is arguably less important to the United States than in years past, as its armed forces have shrunk and France has stepped up to catch wandering American eyes. On economics, the Trump administration is already pushing a hard-line stance ahead of potential negotiations for a trade deal that would take effect once Britain leaves the European Union. Even the two countries’ famously close intelligence relationship is hitting obstacles as Trump aides threaten to withhold secrets if Britain doesn’t bar the Chinese firm Huawei from building its cellular networks.
Diplomats say that despite his occasional oratorical assurances, Trump himself appears to care little for the countries’ “special relationship” or international alliances in general. He has accused Britain of spying on his presidential campaign and undermined outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May in interviews and on Twitter, essentially endorsing one of May’s critics for her post and questioning her efforts to engineer a proper Brexit.
“At no moment has the fact of being an ally in anyway prevented Trump from trying to twist the arm of the other side,” said Gérard Araud, until recently the French ambassador to the United States. “The special relationship was more special on the British side than the American side.”
The state of the relationship will face intense scrutiny next week, when Trump travels to Britain for his official state visit. The visit, which the British promised early on in Trump’s tenure, was once seen as a chance to reaffirm the countries’ bond, but the pomp and circumstance-filled event is likely to instead expose the spreading cracks.
Trump will land in Britain amid chaos. May is due to quit her post within days of Trump’s departure, she has no clear successor and British politicians have been unable to settle on a plan to leave the EU. The British are wary that Trump will wade into the fractious debate, perhaps endorsing Brexit hard-liner Boris Johnson to replace May, or even meeting with Nigel Farage, leader of the populist Brexit Party.
During Trump’s trip to the U.K. last year, dubbed a “working visit,” London erupted with demonstrations, generating lasting images of a giant diapered and screaming baby Trump balloon. Protests are expected this time, too.
The British Embassy did not offer anyone for comment, while the White House pointed to Trump’s past comments praising the British-U.K. relationship. But Andrew Overton, a former staffer at the British Embassy in D.C., told POLITICO that the main change in the “special relationship” is simple — Trump.
“Trump is always looking for leverage,” Overton said.
A White House official pushed back on the characterization.
“The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is fundamental to our shared security and prosperity,” the official said. “The United States has no closer partner than the U.K.”
On trade, Trump and his aides have shown no inclination to offer favorable terms to London, which is desperate to strike a bilateral deal with Washington once it leaves the EU.
The Trump administration is already pursuing tough terms sure to be deeply unpopular in Britain. For instance, the U.S. wants the British to drop restrictions on GMOs — genetically modified foods — and chlorine-washed chicken products. Such restrictions currently align the U.K. with EU standards on food products.
America’s ambassador to Britain, Woody Johnson, recently published a column in which he urged the British to embrace the American approach to such products and ignore the “smear campaign from people with their own protectionist agenda.”
Trump has long taken a hard line on trade negotiations, convinced that even U.S. allies are cheating Americans on such deals, so his administration’s treatment of the U.K. so far isn’t exactly a surprise.
Araud, perhaps, put it most bluntly. “Trump is really very transactional,” he told POLITICO. “I don’t see any reason to believe that he will be nice with the British.”
Democrats have similarly cautioned that Brexit could hurt the two countries’ future trading relationship.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told the Irish Parliament that there will be no post-Brexit U.S.-U.K. trade deal if Britain’s departure from the EU threatens the 1998 Good Friday peace accord that eased tensions in Northern Ireland, a notable remark given that Trump will likely need lawmakers’ approval for any trade deal.
Britain’s expected exit from the EU has raised concerns that a border will have to be imposed between Northern Ireland, which is considered part of the U.K., and the rest of Ireland, given that Ireland will remain in the EU. The notion of imposing a “hard border” has already to led to warnings that violence could return to the region.
While Britain will remain a member of the NATO alliance, the bilateral U.S.-U.K. military relationship has grown weaker, observers say.
When speaking of how the British had “vanished” in Washington, Araud told the Financial Times earlier this year: “The British ambassador told me — and I loved it — that every time the British military is meeting with the American military, the Americans are talking about the French.”
Former U.S. officials and analysts say Araud is not entirely exaggerating.
The size of the British armed forces has shrunk in recent decades, and the country has imposed repeated funding cuts while struggling to articulate a military vision and get new recruits, according to analysts.
“You talk to the Brits, but you don’t expect a lot because they’re so tied up in their own drama,” said Derek Chollet, a former top Pentagon official in the Obama administration. “For many years, for decades, they stood out from the pack of partners. Now they’re kind of back in the pack a little bit, and others are playing a role that traditionally they would play.”
Michael Shurkin, a senior political scientist with the Rand Corp., said it’s not so much that the U.S. thinks less of the British as it is that it’s intrigued by the French. He compared the situation to the famous meme of the young man walking with his girlfriend while eyeing another woman.
“The French have this incredible cohesion and coherence when it comes to their vision of what their military is for,” Shurkin said. “The money is there, they know what to do with it and they’re moving forward.”
While the British joined the French and the U.S. in intervening in Libya against dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011, the U.K. Parliament voted down an attempt to pursue military strikes against the Syrian regime in 2013 after it is alleged to have used chemical weapons.
“We could look back and see Libya as kind of the last gasp of the U.K. in terms of its meaning in the world,” Chollet said.
Even the British-U.S. intelligence relationship faces new strain.
Amid his praise of the “special relationship” on a recent visit to Britain, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautiously warned the British that if they move ahead with using the Chinese firm Huawei to help them build their future telecommunications networks, the U.S. will think twice about sharing information with them.
“Insufficient security will impede the United States’ ability to share certain information within trusted networks,” Pompeo said.
Despite the strains, compared to most other bilateral relationships, the one between Britain and the United States remains unusually tight, even the most cynical observers acknowledge.
The cultural and linguistic similarities between the two countries run deep, as does the shared history encompassing World War II and its aftermath. During Trump’s state visit next week, he will attend a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-Day, a powerful reminder of how the two countries have stood by each other in the darkest moments.
“Our countries cherish the same beliefs in liberty, democracy and the rule of law,” said Jeremy Hunt, the British foreign secretary, when he hosted Pompeo earlier this month.
In turn, Pompeo repeatedly praised U.S.-U.K. ties, pointing out that British diplomats even get unusually broad access to the State Department. “The ‘special relationship’ is the beating heart of the entire free world,” Pompeo said.
But Brexit has so thoroughly dominated British politics that the country appears to have little capacity for much else, analysts and officials say.
The bitter divorce with the EU was supposed to have already taken place, but political disarray has led to several extensions, with no end in sight. And when the expected separation takes effect, a huge chunk of the British apparatus will have to focus for years on actually implementing it.
Former U.S. officials and analysts described Brexit as a self-imposed wound that is hastening the decadeslong downward trend in British influence worldwide.
Some even say that, due to Brexit, Trump or other reasons, the U.K.-U.S. relationship is at its worst point since the Suez Canal crisis of 1956, which saw a falling out between the two countries over Britain's decision to join a military campaign against Egypt.
“I think it’s much worse than the Suez crisis, in the sense that the Suez crisis occurred during the Cold War so there still was this external threat that was pushing the United States and the U.K. together,” said Charles Kupchan, a former Obama administration official now with the Council on Foreign Relations.
Overton, the former British Embassy staffer who bemoaned Trump’s effect on U.S.-U.K. ties, took some solace in pointing out that — in the grand scheme — it’s not just Britain that has had tensions with America under Trump. Neither France nor Germany have fared much better.
Instead, Trump appears to save his kindest words for strongmen in countries such as Russia and North Korea, while the leaders of traditional allies are left scratching their heads over how to respond to his unpredictable moods.
“The president has a preference for autocratic regimes,” Overton said. “Everything is so reactionary for all Western countries in Washington.”"
Hyperloop lobbying takes off,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/05/30/hyperloop-lobbying-takes-off-637914,"With David Beavers and Daniel Lippman HYPERLOOP LOBBYING TAKES OFF: Companies such as Virgin Hyperloop One and Hyperloop Transportation Technologies have been working to develop hyperloop technology, which would whisk pods carrying people or cargo through vacuum tubes at speeds of 600 miles per hour or more. Now, their efforts are far enough along that they’re hiring Washington lobbyists to help them win regulatory approval of the technology. While Virgin Hyperloop One has retained Washington lobbyists since 2017, according to disclosure filings, the company has added more firms this year.
Story Continued Below
— Virgin Hyperloop One now retains Atlas Crossing and Jochum Shore & Trossevin , as well as Peck Madigan Jones and Sixkiller Consulting as subcontractors to Atlas Crossing, according to disclosure filings. Hyperloop Transportation Technologies retains G2G Consulting . And Hyperloop America Inc. hired Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and First Rule this year. Virgin Hyperloop One has increased its lobbying footprint “in an effort to better understand the regulatory hurdles the company faces” and also recently brought on the Washington lawyer John DeVierno to study Transportation Department regulations, according to Ryan Kelly , a spokesperson for the company.
— Josh Raycroft , Virgin Hyperloop One’s director of business strategy, testified at a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing in September as part of the company’s effort to win friends in Washington. “Just like the company testified before Senate Commerce, the foremost goal has been — and continues to be — to safely deploy and to find a regulatory home for this new transformative transportation technology,” Kelly wrote in an email to PI.
ROHRABACHER WILL ADVISE CANNABIS COMPANIES: Former Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) has joined the growing clique of former lawmakers advising cannabis concerns. Rohrabacher has “joined BudTrader.com as a shareholder and advisory board member, so I may continue the fight for cannabis legalization on a national level,” he tweeted Tuesday. He’s also serving as a special adviser to PharmaCielo , a Canadian company that describes itself as “the dominant player in Colombia’s cannabis sector.” “They're providing a high quality product while undermining criminal cartels,” Rohrabacher tweeted Wednesday evening.
— Advising the cannabis industry has become a popular gig for retired members of Congress of both parties. Former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) of the Daschle Group and former Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) of Squire Patton Boggs recently joined the board of Northern Swan Holdings , which invests in the cannabis industry. Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) signed up as an adviser to the Cannabis Trade Federation after losing reelection last year. And former House Speaker John Boehner is on the board of the cannabis company Acreage Holdings .
REVOLVING DOOR REPORT: “Nearly two-thirds of recently retired or defeated U.S. lawmakers now working outside politics have landed jobs influencing federal policy, providing further evidence that members of Congress continue to spin through Washington’s revolving door at astonishing rates,” Alan Zibel writes in a new report for Public Citizen . Of 44 former members of Congress that Public Citizen analyzed, 26 have worked in lobbying or consulting or for a trade group. Here’s the full report .
GOP TAX LAW KEEPS ON GIVING: Assured Guaranty , a Bermuda-based insurer, has hired Miller & Chevalier to lobby on the implementation of the GOP tax law — the latest sign that the law is continuing to drive business on K Street nearly 18 months after its passage. Marc Gerson , a former tax counsel to the House Ways and Means Committee, and three other Miller & Chevalier lobbyists will advocate on ""international tax issues"" related to the law, according to a disclosure filing.
BRYAN CAVE SUES GABON OVER UNPAID BILLS: “ Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner sued the government of Gabon on Wednesday seeking more than $1.25 million in unpaid legal fees, an amount that an arbitration panel awarded to the international law firm last month for its work promoting closer diplomatic ties between the coastal African country and the United States,” The National Law Journal ’s C. Ryan Barber reports. The law firm registered as a foreign agent “after taking on the Gabonese Republic as a client in 2016. Under the terms of its contract with Gabon, disclosed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Bryan Cave was owed $1.38 million for its work fostering a deeper relationship between the two governments.” Full story .

Checking in on OZ,www.politico.com,politico.com,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2019/05/30/checking-in-on-oz-441933,"Editor’s Quick Fix — The Opportunity Zone program created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is proving to be a lucrative opportunity for law firms and outside experts — perhaps no surprise, given that there’s still a fair number of questions hanging over the initiative.
— Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) isn’t alone — other Republican senators also appear to be blocking the House retirement measure.
— State legislative session season is coming to a close, so what are the big tax takeaways from the 50 capitals?
IT’S THURSDAY, so some of you all are already running out of congressional recess.
Would’ve been a long watch: Today marks 108 years since Ray Harroun won the initial Indianapolis 500, winning $14,250 in the process. (That’s about $376,000 in 2018 dollars.) Harroun won in six hours and 42 minutes, an average of a bit under 75 miles an hour.
Have we asked you to send your tips quickly?
Driving the Day LET’S TALK OZ: For a $1.6 billion program in a $1.5 trillion bill, Opportunity Zones continue to get a lot of attention.
The latest example, via Bloomberg Tax’s Melissa Heelan Stanzione: Big law firms are pulling together ad hoc groups from various departments to advise clients on potential opportunities, in no small part because there’s still a lot of uncharted waters for a program that is still less than a year and a half old.
Attorneys said interested investors have started reaching out to them more since Treasury and the IRS released a second set of proposed regulations on Opportunity Zones last month, which were more thorough than some observers had expected. Still, the novelty is a big part of the reason that law firms see an opportunity here — investors don’t necessarily have a lot of experience with these kind of deals.
Related story: CNBC warned investors to do their due diligence before hopping on this “ hot new tax play .”
Knowing what we don’t know: Despite those fuller than expected regulations, there are still a fair number of big unanswered questions about Opportunity Zones — not to mention a lack of reporting requirements . Michael Novogradac, a CPA keeping close track of the program, told Morning Tax that important outstanding questions include the treatment of mobile intangible assets like intellectual property and how long a new or existing business has to become a qualified opportunity zone business.
WHO’S GOT A HOLD? Cruz has gotten basically all of the attention so far for blocking the House retirement bill, H.R. 1994 (116) , that would roll back tax increases on, among others, children of service members receiving survivor benefits. (The Texas Republican wants to expand saving options for homeschool families.)
But Senate GOP aides acknowledge that Cruz isn’t the only senator standing in the way of the bill passing by unanimous consent. (A Democratic aide said there’s no holds on their side of the aisle.) Outside groups monitoring the retirement bill say they’ve been told that Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who has been at least mildly critical of the House measure, is another opponent. A Toomey spokesman would only tell Morning Tax that “we don’t have anything for you on this.” Senators will probably have to return to the Capitol next week before the bill’s path forward becomes much clearer, though there will undoubtedly be pressure on all lawmakers to get a fix for Gold Star families into law as soon as possible.
OUT TO THE CAPITALS: Taxes always seem to be a popular topic when state legislatures convene, and this year was no different — Texas passed a property tax revamp, Illinois sent a graduated income tax to a referendum, Oregon imposed a gross receipts tax on business and Washington state is using a payroll tax to pay for long-term care services.
Morning Tax asked Richard Auxier of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and Jared Walczak of the Tax Foundation to help suss out the big themes of state tax policy this year.
Auxier noted that tax matters were a bit quieter this year because many states grappled with how or whether to conform their systems to the changes made by the TCJA, H.R. 1 (115) , a year ago. Not only that: The economy is generally pretty strong, and “one reason we’re probably seeing few major state tax changes is because the state revenue story is positive in most states,” Auxier noted. “For example, New Jersey made a deposit in its rainy day fund! Unfortunately, one motivator for a lot of state tax action is a recession. Calm is often okay.”
But that doesn’t mean states aren’t still looking for new ways to raise revenues and keep the books in line. “States continue to show considerable interest in excise taxes on new or newly-legal activities, like sports betting, marijuana, and peer-to-peer car sharing,” Walczak said. “There's nothing particularly new about raising gas taxes, but this year saw a spate of proposals for increases, some of which are still pending.” Not that those efforts were across-the-board successful: Several states had trouble legalizing recreational marijuana this year, for instance.
Around the World IT’S ANOTHER GREAT BLOOMBERG HEADLINE: “ Bonanza for Baltic Boozers as Nations Race to Cut Alcohol Taxes.” In fact, Bloomberg notes that it’s getting close to a race to the bottom on alcohol taxes in the Baltics, with Estonia recently deciding to reverse fields on an earlier tax hike and Latvia saying it might cut its own taxes in response. Finland says it’s also closely watching how Estonia, which will cut duties on liquor by a quarter, and Latvia handle the matter. Estonia’s alcohol tax had caused some pain — fewer Finns came to visit, and its own residents marched into neighboring Latvia to buy their own supplies. But along with a question of lost revenue, the alcohol tax hike had driven down consumption, and doctors are concerned about the public health effects of backpedaling.
Around the Nation ONE MORE STATE UPDATE: North Carolina Republicans are maneuvering to get another tax cut through the legislature, as the Winston-Salem Journal reports. The state Senate has already passed a measure to cut the franchise tax, but that proposal’s prospects are murky in the House. So instead of sitting still, the Senate put a similar franchise tax cut into its latest budget. The budget would cut the franchise tax to 96 cents on every $1,000 of a corporation’s assets by 2021, down from the current $1.50 per $1,000, and would also increase the state’s standard deduction. One other potential pitfall: Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, reportedly is thinking about vetoing a state budget or the separate Senate tax proposal because they wouldn’t expand Medicaid.

Nikki Haley begins experiment in political life after Trump,www.politico.com,ELIANA JOHNSON,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/nikki-haley-2020-elections-1348432,"Of the many senior officials to leave the Trump administration over the past two years, few have exited on better terms than former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. Before her departure last December, President Donald Trump feted Haley with an Oval Office photo-op and declared that his U.N. diplomat “has been very special to me.”
And while many former Trump officials, from former White House chief of staff John Kelly to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have kept a low profile in the private sector, Haley is charting a different course. She is emerging as a fundraiser and surrogate for 2020 Republican Senate candidates, and next month will begin zigzagging across the country to campaign for a trio of GOP senators.
Story Continued Below
By remaining a loyal Republican soldier on good terms with the president — a forthcoming memoir is not expected to join the ranks of cutting insider tell-alls — Haley is also something of a test case for independent political life after Trump.
The former South Carolina governor’s summer itinerary includes a June 15 stop in Boone, Iowa, where Haley will help Sen. Joni Ernst launch her reelection campaign at Ernst’s annual Roast ’n Ride event, where Iowans are slated to grill over 2,000 pounds of pork. Given its location in a key presidential caucus state, the event is sure to spark murmurs about Haley’s own political ambitions, including the prospect of a 2024 presidential bid.
She has already begun to reemerge on the public stage, including with remarks Thursday before an economic club in Grand Rapids, Mich., where she echoed Trump’s recent warnings that socialism threatens the U.S. — a message likely to be a key Trump 2020 campaign theme. Though they have not set a firm date, Haley has spoken with senior adviser Jared Kushner and the president himself about joining him on the campaign trail in 2020, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
“Capitalism is the greatest force for ending poverty and lifting up human beings in history,” Haley said . “America’s dangerous flirtation with socialism is in colleges, in the media and in Congress. We have an obligation to remind everyone that if you care about global poverty, you should support capitalism.” She will also deliver the keynote address at the Susan B. Anthony Foundation’s annual gala on Monday.
“She is one of the few female superstars in the Republican Party and our party needs more conservative women,” said Corry Bliss, a Republican consultant who previously served as the executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC dedicated to winning Republican House seats. “As far as the base is concerned, she stood with Trump, and that’s all they care about.”
While a bevy of Republicans are contemplating how to position themselves for the post-Trump era, Haley is the first to begin the process of redefining herself outside the president’s shadow. This fall, she will publish a book, “With All Due Respect,” offering her reflections on “major national and international matters,” according to the publisher’s website. The book will cast her as a decidedly nonTrumpian figure: that is, “a leader who seeks to bring Americans together in divisive times.” Yet there is no sign she will use the book to criticize Trump — even as she casts herself as a different sort of leader.
Haley was never a Trump true believer. During the 2016 GOP primaries, she initially supported Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. And for all Trump’s praise when she left the administration, Haley left some raw feelings at the State Department and the White House because of her insistence on maintaining her independence, particularly in the form of barbed statements about Russia at a time when Trump was looking to improve relations with Moscow. Never openly critical of Trump, Haley also didn’t shy from asserting herself either. Indeed, her book title is an in-your-face reference to an April 2018 episode in which Haley publicly announced plans for new U.S. sanctions on Russia, only for a White House official to suggest she had suffered “momentary confusion” and that the president had not yet made up his mind. “With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” Haley replied.
Haley, 47, was seen as a rising GOP star before Trump’s election, which was widely considered a rejection of the more inclusive version of the GOP she championed as the two-term government of South Carolina. She was critical of Trump during the Republican primary, tacitly criticizing him in her nationally televised response to President Barack Obama’s final State of the Union address, and endorsed Rubio.
“I think she’s one of the most effective surrogates we have in the party. Time in the Trump administration gives her credibility with the more conservative elements of the party but she can also showcase diversity,” said Matt Gorman, former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.
During the 2018 midterms, a handful of women in the Trump administration, including White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, were among the most popular surrogates on the campaign trail in the 2018 midterms, and National Republican Senatorial Committee aides predicted the same would be true in 2020.
Until now, much of the flesh-pressing and fundraising Haley has undertaken since leaving office has taken place behind closed doors. Last week, for example, Haley helped raise approximately $500,000 for four female GOP Senate candidates — Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Iowa’s Ernst — at a New York City fundraiser hosted by Annie Dickerson, a longtime Republican fundraiser and the founder of the GOP aligned political action committee Winning for Women, according to a source familiar with the event.
That sort of work will take a public turn starting early next month with a spate of political events starting June 10, when she will help kick off Capito’s reelection campaign in Charleston, W.Va.
She has also been asked to campaign alongside Republican candidates who might be more reluctant to stump with the president, including Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, widely considered the most vulnerable of the 2020 cycle. The president’s approval rating in the state is underwater by 13 points, according to an April poll conducted by Morning Consult. Gardner, who was traveling internationally in connection with his position on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was not present Thursday when Trump visited Colorado to deliver remarks at the Air Force Academy’s commencement ceremony.
Gardner campaign spokesman Cosey Contres said the campaign invited Haley to Colorado because of “her focus on bringing people together” — something few voters, Republican or Democrat, would say about Trump. “Every day, Cory is trying to find ways to bring people together, and she played a similar role on the world stage,” Contres said.
Since her departure from the Trump administration, Haley has balanced the humdrum of post-political life with the forward-looking calculations of somebody who may run for president in the future.
Aside from book writing, she is delivering a bevy of paid speeches — a CNBC report indicated her fee is as high as $200,000 and that she has requested the use of a private jet. She founded an issue-advocacy group, Stand for America, in late February, and joined the board of Boeing, the besieged aerospace giant, earlier this month."
Chip Roy inflames GOP colleagues with stand against disaster aid package,www.politico.com,SARAH FERRIS,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/roy-disaster-aid-1348430,"Conservative freshman Rep. Chip Roy was at the airport heading back to Texas late last week when he heard that House GOP leaders had agreed to a voice vote on a $19 billion funding bill.
So he called his wife, canceled his flight and headed back to the Capitol.
The next day, the former chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) made national headlines as he single-handedly blocked a funding bill that would have delivered badly needed cash to a dozen states — infuriating fellow Republicans and putting a target on his back for the next election cycle.
Roy’s surprise last-minute tactic guaranteed a weeklong delay of aid to states hit by wildfires, hurricanes and flooding, including his home state — further pushing back assistance that had already been stalled since before the midterm elections.
But Roy, who won election last year by only 2.6 percentage points, said he has no regrets about helping lead the charge to demand a full debate and a recorded vote on the $19 billion package.
“I’ve gotten an enormous amount of support from the district, people writing in, emails, text messages,” Roy said in a lengthy phone interview this week about the fierce reaction within the GOP and by the Democrats’ campaign arm in Texas. “I have no concern about any candidate they want to throw my way.”
Roy, a fierce fiscal hawk and member of the Freedom Caucus, said his biggest concern is that the House would approve a funding package that’s just shy of the annual budget for NASA without a single minute of debate, let alone a roll-call vote. He was also irked that Congress was willing to forgo aid for the southern border in an attempt to rush to a deal.
Over the past several days, Roy has helped coordinate an impromptu wall of opposition to the Democrats’ efforts to fast-track the disaster package, personally ensuring that another like-minded Republican will be on the floor to keep it from moving to President Donald Trump’s desk. He coordinated with Reps. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.) before they showed up on the floor on Tuesday. And he spoke with Rep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) before Thursday’s session — which marked the final chance to clear the bill before the House returns next week.
Roy did so over the objections of some in GOP leadership: Before he went on the floor, he shared his plan with top Republicans in the House and Trump administration. Some privately warned Roy about the optics of blocking emergency money that would be used to rebuild homes for people displaced by natural disasters.
“‘Well, if you’re objecting to the disaster [supplemental], clearly you’re going to be tarred and feathered,” Roy said recalling the conversations. “They’ll say that you’re evil.”
But his answer was the same: He wanted lawmakers to vote on the record.
Afterward, Roy received texts and calls from more than a half-dozen fellow conservatives, mostly those in the Freedom Caucus, who were willing to make the trek to Washington during recess to support the cause.
Rose, the Tennessee freshman who blocked the package on Thursday, also said people in his district have voiced support for his maneuver.
""When they hear things like this can happen without members here to vote ... it's part of what earns this city the reputation as the swamp,"" Rose said.
But Roy has also heard from Republicans who are furious with him over the effort.
The ad hoc effort by the small number of conservatives has sharply split congressional Republicans, many of whom have spent months personally pressing GOP and Democratic leadership to speed things up. That includes Rep. Kay Granger of Texas, the top Republican on the influential House Appropriations Committee, who took the rare step of criticizing her colleague's move as a “political stunt.”
Rep. Austin Scott, whose district lost millions in crop damage from a 2018 hurricane, had just landed in Atlanta when he heard the Senate had reached a deal to approve the disaster package.
The Georgia Republican immediately booked a flight back to Washington, before he learned that House Democratic leaders weren’t planning to call members back to the Capitol because they’d already scattered across the country. Some members had already left for congressional trips overseas.
Back home in his district, Scott was among several Republicans who started asking Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) to agree to hold a voice vote, which they ultimately did.
Scott said he spoke to Roy privately after he watched the Texas conservative’s stand on Friday, though he wouldn't disclose what exactly was said. On Twitter afterward, Scott called his GOP colleagues "" clowns .""
“It’s theater and grandstanding, it’s all it is. It’s not even a principled stand,"" Scott said in an interview. ""They’re not trying to negotiate a resolution. They’re just acting up.""
Roy has argued that the impact of the delay is minimal — something that even House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) acknowledged to reporters this week. The House will easily clear the package when lawmakers return on Monday, amounting to just a few more days of waiting.
But some Republicans are privately annoyed by what they saw as a pointless political move that invites attacks from Democrats.
And they also can't help but compare Roy’s tactics to those of his former boss in 2013, when Cruz led the government into a painful government shutdown over Obamacare. Roy was Cruz’ chief of staff at the time, though he denied that his move on disaster aid was influenced by the same strategy.
For lawmakers from states such as Texas and Florida, the conservatives’ opposition is just one more hurdle in a long line of setbacks over the past year. For months, it was Trump’s opposition to the amount of aid for Puerto Rico that was holding up the money. Then there were a series of flare-ups over individual members' demands for policy add-ons, like harbor maintenance funds or protections for hemp farmers.
Democratic Rep. Lizzie Fletcher — whose Houston-area district has waited for nearly two years for federal assistance — said she worked closely with Texas Republican Reps. Pete Olson and Randy Weber, as well as their counterparts in the Senate, to unlock $4 billion for their state.
“Our delegation has worked in a very bipartisan way,” Fletcher said in an interview. “To see someone, especially someone from our delegation, hold it up on these procedural reasons ... it’s incredibly frustrating.”
But Roy remained defiant despite the pushback.
“With all due respect to members who have been here for awhile ... I’m sorry, we have a job to do. That some members of either party, of any state have some concern about what we’re trying to do to fight for fiscal sanity, excuse me,” Roy said. “I'm not the one who caused the $22 trillion in debt.”"
How John Hickenlooper would expand access to contraception,www.politico.com,ALICE MIRANDA OLLSTEIN,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/2020-election-hickenlooper-contraception-policy-1489258,"Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper rolled out a plan Thursday to expand access to contraception, particularly for low-income women in rural areas.
Responding to a wave of efforts by the Trump administration and Republican-controlled states to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, enact new abortion curbs and make it easier for employers to opt out of providing insurance coverage of birth control, Hickenlooper predicts his plan would both save the government money and reduce the number of women seeking abortions.
What would the plan do?
Hickenlooper's plan revives an effort he shepherded in Colorado a decade ago that increased funding for clinics that serve low-income and uninsured women, trained more health care providers in the use of long acting reversible contraception like IUDs and invested in outreach to young adults.
Hickenlooper would increase funding for the federal Title X family planning program by $700 million, undo a Trump administration rule that's been blocked by federal courts and would effectively deny program funding to Planned Parenthood, train more providers and launch a national outreach campaign to make more people aware of the benefits of LARC, which are more effective than other contraceptive methods.
How would it work? LARC can cost several hundred dollars, putting them out of reach for many women. The Affordable Care Act made the contraception free for women with insurance. Hickenlooper's plan targets the remaining uninsured population, millions of whom depend on Title X-funded clinics for access to free and subsidized birth control. The proposal would make these clinics available in more areas and ensure that the providers working in those clinics offer LARC as an option along with birth control pills and other methods.
Hickenlooper said his Colorado initiative saved $5.85 in Medicaid costs alone for every dollar the state spent, lowered the teen pregnancy rate by 54 percent and lowered the teen abortion rate by 64 percent. These results in a purple swing state, he said, should convince people across the political spectrum to support the nationwide plan.
What are the weaknesses in the proposal? Hickenlooper acknowledges that the plan is likely to face significant political opposition, citing his experience on the state level, where Republicans repeatedly tried to block taxpayer funding for the program.
Additionally, even those supportive of the concept may balk at the cost to taxpayers. With the number of uninsured people in the country increasing over the last couple years after a steep decline, the funding required for the program to reach all the women who may need access could be much more than anticipated.
There are also widespread misconceptions and a lack of awareness about LARC that the program would have to work to overcome.
What have other Democrats proposed? Much of the Democratic field has pledged to roll back the Trump administration's Title X rule that would have cut funding to Planned Parenthood, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.)
Several others, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have similarly promised to undo the Trump administration's rule allowing employers to opt out of providing insurance coverage for contraception.
Who would it help? Hickenlooper's plan is aimed squarely at helping women of reproductive age who lack health insurance — a disproportionate number of whom are low-income women of color. It aims to increase services and support for the roughly four million women in the country who depend on Title X funding for access to contraception and other health care needs.
Who opposes it? Some conservative lawmakers and anti-abortion advocacy groups are fiercely opposed to LARC because they consider it a form of abortion rather than a contraceptive method because the devices in some circumstances prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus."
"Administration 'concealed' GOP redistricting strategist's role in census citizenship question, court filing alleges",www.politico.com,REBECCA RAINEY,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/republican-redistricting-census-1489667,"Trump administration officials ""concealed"" a Republican redistricting strategist's role in the effort to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, the American Civil Liberties Union alleged in a court filing Thursday.
New evidence obtained in a separate gerrymandering lawsuit brought by advocacy group Common Cause revealed that the strategist, Thomas Hofeller, “played a significant role in orchestrating the addition of the citizenship question,” the ACLU said.
The evidence suggests that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’ adviser Mark Neuman and a Justice Department official ""obscured"" Hofeller's involvement in the decision ""through affirmative misrepresentations,"" the ACLU, which sued on behalf of immigrant rights groups in the Southern District for New York, said.
The filing also alleged the citizenship question would ""create a structural electoral advantage for, in his [Hofeller's] own words, 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.'”
Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act. DOJ sent the formal request in a December 2017 letter.
The ACLU filing states that the new evidence revealed that in August 2017, Hofeller “helped ghostwrite a draft DOJ letter to Commerce requesting a citizenship question and providing the Voting Rights Act enforcement rationale for doing so.”
The letter that DOJ eventually sent to Commerce “bears striking similarities” to Hofeller’s 2015 study that concluded that adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census “would clearly be a disadvantage to the Democrats” and “advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites” in redistricting, according to the filing.
ACLU attorneys allege in the filing that senior DOJ official John Gore “repeatedly testified that he prepared the initial draft of the DOJ letter, failing to disclose that Neuman gave him a draft of the DOJ letter in October 2017.”
“The evidence reveals that the plan to add the citizenship question was hatched by the Republicans’ chief redistricting mastermind to create an electoral advantage for Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,"" Karen Hobert Flynn, president of Common Cause said in a statement. ""This contradicts testimony by Administration officials that they wanted to add the question to benefit Latino voters, when in fact the opposite was true.”
The Justice Department called the case “an unfortunate last-ditch effort to derail the Supreme Court’s consideration of this case” and said it would respond to the allegations in filings on Monday.
“These eleventh-hour allegations by the plaintiffs, including an accusation of dishonesty against a senior Department of Justice official, are false,” a DOJ spokesperson said. “Before today, Mr. Gore had never heard of the unpublished study apparently obtained from the personal effects of a deceased political consultant. That study played no role in the Department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question to the 2020 decennial census.”
A federal judge in the New York City suit, as well as judges in San Francisco and Greenbelt, Md., have blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — rulings that set up a showdown at the Supreme Court.
Last month , the court seemed divided along ideological lines during arguments about Ross’s decision, which three federal judges have found illegal because it lacked a coherent explanation and could lead to a large undercount of non-citizens, as well as Americans of Hispanic origin.
Although the administration’s appeal of the New York federal court’s judgment is pending, the ACLU reminded the court in the filing that it “retains jurisdiction” over “sanctions” and “contempt-related matters.”
A conference is scheduled over the motion on June 5 in New York City."
"Even if Roe is upheld, abortion opponents are winning",www.politico.com,RACHANA PRADHAN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/abortion-opponents-winning-roe-vs-wade-1488818,"Abortion is still legal in the United States, but for women in vast swaths of the country it’s a right in name only.
Six states are down to only one abortion clinic; a court stepped in Friday to stop Missouri’s sole clinic from closing, at least for now. Some women seeking abortions have to travel long distances, and face mandatory waiting periods or examinations. On top of that, a new wave of restrictive laws, or outright bans, is rippling across GOP-led states like Alabama and Georgia.
Story Continued Below
Both sides of the abortion battle are focused on the future of Roe v. Wade, but opponents have already won the ground game over the past decade, chipping away at abortion access.
The Supreme Court’s new conservative majority, about to wrap up its first term, has not yet taken up a case challenging Roe. Just this week it declined to reinstate an Indiana law, signed by Mike Pence when he was governor, that would have banned abortion on the basis of gender, race or fetal disability. But that’s no guarantee the court won’t take another look at the landmark 1973 abortion rights ruling.
But even without the high court, GOP-backed laws have added restrictions and obstacles, whittling away access. Since the start of the Trump administration, hostility to abortion in general and Planned Parenthood in particular has only intensified in statehouses around the country.
“We celebrate freedom in America. But I believe that my choice ends when another life begins,” Louisiana state Rep. Valarie Hodges said just before a fetal ""heartbeat"" abortion bill passed there.
Years of piecemeal state laws have left their mark. Mandatory waiting periods, travel, missed work and lost wages all make getting an abortion more expensive and more difficult, particularly for low-income women. Doctors and clinic staff have to face protesters, threats, proliferating regulations and draining legal challenges; clinics have closed. In remote parts of the midwest and south, women may have to travel more than 300 miles to end a pregnancy.
“This is a moment of seeing how all of these laws fly in the face of medicine and science and go against what we in the medical profession know, which is that any restriction on medical care by politicians will endanger people’s health,” Planned Parenthood President Leana Wen, a physician herself, said in an interview.
It's intensified of late. Republicans in Alabama and other states have raced to enact laws that would almost completely ban abortion, sometimes without exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape or incest. Eight states have enacted laws which, if allowed to go into effect, would ban abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, as early as the sixth week of pregnancy, when many women don’t even know they are pregnant. (Missouri’s variant is eight weeks.) Alabama has gone even further, granting “personhood” and legal rights from conception.
Those laws may eventually reach the Supreme Court and test Roe, the 1973 decision that recognized women’s right to abortion. But those statutes aren’t what’s crimping access nationwide right now. That’s happened through a drip, drip, drip of lower-profile efforts that have created obstacles for pregnant women and led to a dwindling supply of doctors trained and willing to perform abortions.
Many of those laws were promoted as attempts to make abortion safer — though courts often disagreed and threw them out as unconstitutional barriers. Now, abortion opponents are openly talking about ending the practice altogether.
“The strategy used to be death by a thousand cuts,” said Colleen McNicholas, a physician based in St. Louis who also provides abortions in Kansas and Oklahoma. “They’re no longer pretending things are to promote the health and well-being of women, which is what we used to hear all the time. Now they’re being very bold and upfront.”
“It doesn’t change the fact that for many Americans, particularly for women in the middle [of the country] and the South, abortion is inaccessible,” she added.
Data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, shows that 788 clinics in the U.S. provided abortion services in 2014 — a drop of 51 clinics over three years. Since 2013 about 20 clinics have closed just in Texas.
Further, one in five women would have to travel at least 43 miles to get to a clinic, according to a Guttmacher analysis from October 2017. In North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, at least half of the women between 15 and 44 years old lived more than 90 miles from a clinic.
Six states — Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia — have only one clinic left that performs abortions, according to a recent analysis from Planned Parenthood and Guttmacher. Missouri’s was on the brink of closure at midnight Friday; a court delayed that and will hold another hearing on its status next week. Lawmakers in many of those states have pursued limits in when abortion can be allowed — such as fetal heartbeat laws or 15-week bans, though the laws have been blocked in court. Four of those states have also passed so-called trigger laws that would ban abortion immediately should the Supreme Court overturn Roe.
On the surface, the St. Louis clinic is a dispute with the state health department over licensing, safety and regulation. But the showdown comes just days after state lawmakers passed a ban on abortion after eight weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest.
“States have been marching down this path for a number of years. The restrictions that have passed previously have set the stage for the bans this year,” said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher’s senior state issues manager. “It’s counseling, it’s waiting periods, it’s abortion coverage in your health plan. It’s limits on abortion providers, such as unnecessary clinic regulations.”
“Missouri is the first and other states could be next,"" Planned Parenthood’s Wen said on a recent call with reporters.
The ramifications of the anti-abortion movement’s sustained assault against Planned Parenthood are perhaps no clearer than in Texas, where lawmakers have passed dozens of restrictive laws, including mandatory ultrasounds, waiting periods and state funding restrictions.
The Supreme Court overturned another set of Texas restrictions in 2016 — but not before about 20 clinics shut down, many of which were never able to reopen. Providers retired, staff found other jobs and clinics had to start from scratch to get licensed and staff up. “All of those things take time and a significant amount of money,” said Kari White, an associate professor in Health Care Organization and Policy at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an investigator with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project.
Even though Texas permits abortions until 20 weeks — itself a cut-off point that conflicts with Roe v. Wade , although it hasn’t yet come to the Supreme Court — abortion access has sharply declined. That scenario is likely to play out in other conservative states, even if they don’t go as far as Georgia or Alabama.
More than half of Texas’ 41 abortion clinics closed or stopped performing abortions after the state passed legislation, TX HB2 (132) , in 2013 that bundled several onerous restrictions, according to research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The average distance a woman had to travel one way for an abortion jumped to 35 miles from 15 miles. In rural parts of the state, drives of 100 miles or more to access care are not uncommon, according to the group.
The evaluation project found that while the number of abortions overall declined after the Texas law went into effect, the number of second-trimester abortions rose as women were forced to wait and travel longer distances. Currently only about 22 abortion providers, mostly in urban areas, are operating in Texas, a state with roughly 6.3 million women of reproductive age.
Low-income women are disproportionately affected by abortion restrictions, said Kamyon Conner, executive director of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women who can’t afford an abortion, which costs between $500 and $10,000 dollars depending on the point in pregnancy. The nonprofit was part of a group that challenged dozens of Texas abortion restrictions in court.
Calls to the group’s hotline have tripled over the past few years to 6,000 in 2018, but it only funded about 1,000 women last year, she said. Some of those women are undocumented immigrants, some are incarcerated and others have children but cannot afford to raise more.
Other costs mount — both in money and time, Conner said. Because Texas has a 24-hour waiting period between an initial consult and the abortion, women miss work and may have to pay for hotel rooms.
“There are fewer clinics to provide the services,” said Conner. “The few clinics that are left are in very high demand.”
Telemedicine could plug some gaps in care for women seeking abortion medication, instead of a surgical abortion. But there too access varies widely by geography. Some states ban telemedicine-facilitated abortions. Elsewhere, providers are using video-chat technology to dispense the medication. Seventeen states require licensed abortion providers to be physically present when administering abortion medication, which effectively is a ban on telemedicine, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortion medication is approved for use up to ten weeks into pregnancy, but under current FDA rules can only be dispensed at certain medical facilities, including abortion clinics.
Alternatives are being tested. In one FDA-reviewed study, clinicians can mail abortion medication directly to patients after a video chat. Study participants can go to any clinic for their screening and ultrasound, send the results to a participating abortion provider, and then video chat with that provider. If appropriate, the provider can decide to dispense the medication to the patient’s address, and the patient can take it at home.
Under this system, women don’t have to travel several hours just to pick up the abortion pills, Erica Chong, director of Gynuity Health Projects, told POLITICO. The Gynuity study has enrolled about 360 people across eight states since 2016; it builds on recent research concluding that telemedicine-facilitated medical abortions are just as safe for patients as the ones administered in-person.
Because it’s been reviewed by the FDA, the Gynuity trial is exempt from the dispensation limitation. The study operates in Maine, New York, New Mexico, Hawaii, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Georgia. Gynuity’s trial in Georgia began a few weeks ago, shortly before the state passed its “fetal heartbeat” law.
“With a lot of these bans, there’s going to be a long legal battle,” Chong said, explaining that she didn’t expect the new Georgia law, which bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected at about six weeks, to affect the study in that state just yet. But she noted that the recent spate of early abortion bans have alarmed patients, who are unsure whether their appointments are still legal.
Gynuity’s goal is to convince the FDA that dispensing abortion medication directly to women's homes, or even to retail pharmacies, is safe and effective, and that restrictions on its dispensation should be eased, Chong said.
Outside the Gynuity trial, some providers across the country let patients drive to the facility closest to them and video chat a clinician located at another site. Planned Parenthood, for instance, lets patients in 14 states virtually consult with clinicians based elsewhere. Yet in many cases, the clinician must watch the patient ingest the pill on screen to comply with federal restrictions limiting where the medication can be dispensed. Women might still have to travel across state lines to access these services — and many don’t even realize these options exist.
“How’s a woman in Alabama going to know to go to a Georgia clinic to find services?” Chong said."
Outrage over McCain incident adds to Shanahan's hurdles,www.politico.com,WESLEY MORGAN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/uss-john-mccain-trump-japan-1491631," Pat Shanahan’s quest for the Pentagon's top job faced a new obstacle Thursday amid outrage over an aborted attempt to hide the name of the destroyer USS John S. McCain during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan.
Anger by Democratic lawmakers and retired military brass added to months of questions about the former Boeing executive's leadership style, on top of months of complaints about his role in implementing Trump's Iran and Syria policies, as well as his willingness to shift billions of dollars to build the president's border wall despite opposition in Congress.
But the McCain furor threatened to take those criticisms to a new level, following reports that someone in the White House had sought to conceal or move a ship that bears the name of a deceased Republican senator and war hero — and that for a time, at least, people in the Navy were willing to go along.
“It’s beyond petty,” said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, which would be the first stop in Shanahan’s confirmation process once Trump nominates him. “It’s disgraceful and the White House should be embarrassed.”
“It certainly doesn’t inspire any confidence in his leadership,” a Senate Democratic aide said, adding that the incident “raises concerns” about whether Shanahan — unlike former Secretary Jim Mattis — could deflect White House efforts to politicize the military.
“This is pathetic,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), another Armed Services member.
A spokesperson for Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was close friends with McCain and is an ally of the president, said the South Carolina senator is in touch with the Navy asking for clarification.
""It's important to Senator Graham that the McCain family knows what happened, if anything,"" Kevin Bishop, Graham's spokesperson, said in an email.
Former military leaders demanded answers about how such a plan was allowed to get as far as it did, calling it an insult to a ship that had already stricken by tragedy. (10 of the McCain's sailors died in 2017 after a collision with a merchant vessel.) And they said those responsible need to go.
“[Shanahan] ought to take responsibility no matter what, and he ought to demand that whoever in the White House made this request be fired,” former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus said in an interview. “Whether he knew about it or not, declining to take responsibility in his initial reaction ought to be looked at carefully” by Congress during Shanahan’s upcoming confirmation hearing.
Retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey went even further, calling for Shanahan’s head to roll if he had been aware of the White House request.
“Did Acting Sec Def Shanahan know the White House gave instructions to hide the name of a US Navy warship and the sailors ID? IF SO HE SHOULD RESIGN,” tweeted McCaffrey, who also served as drug czar in the Clinton administration.
The Wall Street Journal, which broke the story Wednesday night, reported that Shanahan was aware of the plan to either hide the ship or move it from port.
But Shanahan initially told reporters Thursday that he learned about the effort through media reports and declined to comment further. He later said he would never dishonor the memory of the late Sen. John McCain and promised to get to the bottom of what happened.
The Journal said the Navy placed a tarp over the stern of the ship to hide its name and told crew members to take the day off so they wouldn’t be around when Trump visited the base on Monday night Eastern time. The Navy has since said that the tarp was removed the Saturday before Trump arrived and the ship was in a ""normal configuration"" during the visit. A Navy official who asked not to be named said the crews of the McCain and the destroyer USS Stethem ""were not among commands selected"" to go to Trump's event, and were off as part of a 96-hour Memorial Day liberty period.
Still, Trump appeared to confirm Thursday that someone in the White House had made the request — and he repeated his well-known dislike for the Arizona senator.
""Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK? And, they were well-meaning,"" the president told reporters.
But Trump said he himself never made any such request. “I would never do a thing like that,” he said.
Trump later tweeted that the Navy had ""put out a disclaimer"" on the story. ""Looks like the story was an exaggeration, or even Fake News - but why not, everything else is!""
Shanahan, after denying knowledge of the incident, said he has tasked his chief of staff with finding out who knew what and when. Yet critics say Shanahan is responsible for the military’s actions.
“This is certainly going to come up in Shanahan’s confirmation hearing,” said Price Floyd, a former Pentagon spokesperson in the Obama administration who also did White House advance travel work with the State Department. “Advance guys work for the man"" — meaning the president — ""but it’s egregious that any staffer would think they need to move a ship because of its name,” he said.
“In my time as an advance person, I couldn’t imagine asking to do something like that. It’s beyond the pale,” Floyd added.
A former senior military officer with experience in the Pacific said such a micromanaging of ship movements by a member of the White House staff would be a striking breach of the military chain of command.
“It would be extraordinary for higher levels to influence those types of movements of individual ships,” said the former officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “I don’t know how this happened but I certainly never saw anything like that in my career.”
Shanahan became acting secretary Jan. 1 after Mattis, a seasoned Marine four-star general known for slow-walking or diverting some of Trump's decisions, resigned over the president's decision to pull troops from Syria. Shanahan then openly lobbied for months to get the secretary job permanently, before Trump announced plans to nominate him May 9.
But Trump has yet to make the nomination official.
And before this latest incident, Shanahan was already facing headwinds: Senators were already furious over Trump’s decision to sell weapons to Middle Eastern countries over the objections of Congress, and his declaration of a national emergency in order to divert billions in military funds toward the border wall.
Now he can add the destroyer McCain to the list of questions he will almost certainly face during his Senate hearing.
Still, many lawmakers will probably be willing to believe that Shanahan didn’t know of the plans for the destroyer, said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the American Enterprise Institute.
“The timing is not great but absent hard evidence to the contrary, most members will be amenable to taking the acting secretary at his word on this matter,” she said.
Regardless of what Shanahan knew about the McCain, high-ranking retired officers and government officials said he is making a mistake in asking his chief of staff to investigate the incident. That’s a job better suited to the Defense Department’s inspector general, Mabus and others said.
“If neither the president nor the secretary of defense were aware of this, which they maintain, they should find out who did take such shameful actions and hold them accountable for a profound lack of judgment,” said retired Adm. James Stavridis, former NATO supreme allied commander. “A DoD IG investigation would be a logical place to start.”
The investigation would have to involve senior military leaders, so it’s not appropriate for Shanahan’s office to investigate, said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno.
Some wanted to know how the plan got as far as it did without someone hitting the brakes. The Journal said the idea to hide the ship began with the White House Military Office, then was communicated to Navy officials in the Pacific.
“It’s a disturbing episode that brings up the issue of the degree to which the military is being used as a political prop and politics being injecting into military activities,” Barno said, adding that the White House office ""has no authority over military commanders.""
“Why didn’t anybody who received this guidance object to this earlier, at the combatant command, at 7th Fleet, at the two-star level in Yokosuka?” Barno continued. “Saner minds prevailed, but before that, how did it make its way down the entire chain of command?”
Kelly Magsamen, a former senior Obama Pentagon official who worked closely with Pacific Command, said she was dumbfounded.
“I’m flabbergasted that anyone in the chain of command tolerated the request and began to implement it, that they even got halfway down the road on this stuff,” she said. “This request would never have been made under any other president, and if it had, the military chain of command would have pushed back significantly, and if they feel they can’t or won’t under this administration, that’s very troubling.
“It suggests to me there’s something wrong in the military leadership ranks right now that these types of events continue to occur — something beyond just Trump,” Magsamen said.
Retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, a former operations officer with U.S. Pacific Command, said he was most troubled by the slow response between when one part of Pacific Command received the request and began to act on it on May 15, and when someone removed the tarp 10 days later — based on the timeline outlined in the initial news reports.
“Nearly everyone should understand it’s not appropriate to try to eliminate or marginalize the presence of a ship or ship’s company because of the name of the ship,” he said."
"Ocasio-Cortez, Cruz strike Twitter pact to work together on lobbying legislation",www.politico.com,THEODORIC MEYER,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/ocasio-cortez-cruz-twitter-pact-lobbying-1348434,"Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez set aside their Twitter bickering Thursday to strike an unusual bargain: an agreement to work together on a bill to ban former members of Congress from lobbying for life.
The Texas Republican and the New York Democrat made the pact on Twitter after Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a report by the watchdog group Public Citizen on the number of former lawmakers who’ve headed to K Street this year.
“I don’t think it should be legal at ALL to become a corporate lobbyist if you’ve served in Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted .
Cruz, who’s feuded with Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter before, tweeted that he agreed, suggesting it might be “a chance for some bipartisan cooperation.”
Ocasio-Cortez responded by proposing a deal : “If we can agree on a bill with no partisan snuck-in clauses, no poison pills, etc - just a straight, clean ban on members of Congress becoming paid lobbyists - then I’ll co-lead the bill with you.”
“You’re on,” Cruz responded .
Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) added that he was “IN.”
Cruz and Ocasio-Cortez aren’t the first lawmakers to propose banning their former colleagues from lobbying. Sens. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced a bill to do so in February, and Rep. Trey Hollingsworth (R-Ind.) introduced a companion bill in the House.
It's unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz would sign on to the existing bills or introduce their own. Neither of their offices immediately responded to requests for comment.
More than a dozen former members of Congress have joined lobbying firms so far this year, although not all of them plan to register as lobbyists. Others have announced plans to start their own consulting firms.
Former senators are currently banned from lobbying Congress for two years after leaving office; former representatives are banned for only one year. Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who’s now a top lobbyist, famously resigned from the Senate in 2007 right before Congress extended the ban for senators from one year to two.
President Donald Trump proposed during his 2016 campaign extending the ban for members of Congress and their staffs to five years, but there’s no evidence his administration has pushed to do so.
Former lawmakers are allowed to immediately lobby the executive branch — including any former colleagues who have taken jobs in the administration.
“A lot of my closest friends are the people I came in with — Mike Pompeo, Mick Mulvaney,” former Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), who joined the lobbying firm K&L Gates after losing reelection, told POLITICO earlier this month.
Pompeo, the secretary of State, and Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, were first elected to Congress in 2010, the same year Denham arrived in Washington."
Trump administration accused of obstructing congressional probe of Education Department,www.politico.com,MICHAEL STRATFORD,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/cummings-education-department-probe-1493005,"House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings on Thursday accused the Trump administration of blocking a congressional investigation into the attempted removal of the acting independent watchdog.
Cummings (D-Md.) said that Education Department officials refused to turn over documents related to the Trump administration’s efforts earlier this year to replace the agency’s acting inspector general. The move by the administration came after the acting IG opened an investigation into Education ’ decision to reinstate the federal powers of an accreditor of for-profit colleges.
In response to the House Oversight Committee’s investigation, department officials have so far turned over seven pages of documents, most of which were “heavily redacted,” according to Cummings.
The department “is obstructing our investigation and appears to be part of an unprecedented cover-up by the Trump administration across multiple Executive Branch agencies and departments,” Cummings wrote in a letter on Thursday along with Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.).
Reed D. Rubinstein, the acting general counsel, said in a letter to the committee earlier this month that “Congress’ oversight requests here implicate core Executive Branch interests and raise serious separation of powers concerns.”
The requests for documents involve “deliberations regarding a presidential appointment, a core Presidential function,” he wrote, adding that the Education Department was “unclear about Congress’ legislative need and authority over such deliberations.”
The congressional inquiry began after President Donald Trump in January appointed Phil Rosenfelt, the deputy general counsel, to replace Sandra Bruce as acting inspector general. The White House backtracked on the appointment several days later after a swift backlash from Democrats, who said it was an attack on the independence of the inspector general.
Democrats have also cried foul over the attempt to remove Bruce as acting inspector general because it came after she resisted a request by Deputy Secretary of Education Mick Zais to “reconsider” an investigation into DeVos’ decision to reinstate a controversial accreditor of for-profit colleges.
The Education Department has previously said that the decision to replace Bruce with Rosenfelt, a longtime career official, was made internally before Bruce opened that investigation into DeVos’ actions.
DeVos has also publicly defended the Trump administration’s handling of her agency’s inspector general. “To suggest that anything nefarious was unfolding there is absolutely wrong,” she said during a Senate hearing in March.
Cummings and DeSaulnier in their letter set a new June 10 deadline for the Education Department to produce all of the documents requested by the committee. They also requested that Zais sit for a transcribed interview on June 13.
Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill declined to say whether Zais would agree to a transcribed interview. “We have answered the Chairman’s questions and are willing to work with the Committee on all lawful oversight requests on this or any other matter,” she said."
Schiff: 'There’s been an epidemic of cowardice in the GOP',www.politico.com,politico.com,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/schiff-republicans-cowardice-1348501,"Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, attacked Republicans’ moral character on Thursday while continuing to temper Democrats’ calls for impeaching President Donald Trump until such proceedings are clearly “the right thing for the country.”
The California Democrat told Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer in a question-and-answer session that GOP lawmakers had come up to him privately to “express their deep concerns and worries” about the Trump administration and offer bits of encouragement as Schiff’s committee forges ahead with its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“But I’m, frankly, exhausted by the private misgivings,” Schiff said. “People need to speak out.”
The lawmaker said he respected Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who became the first Republican lawmaker to accuse Trump of committing impeachable offenses with a series of tweets earlier this month.
Schiff also reminisced about the late Sen. John McCain’s frequent clashes with the president and lauded the Arizona Republican’s stands as acts of courage.
“I think what we knew, implicitly, was that courage is contagious,” he said. “But what we didn’t realize is that cowardice is also contagious. I think there’s been an epidemic of cowardice in the GOP. This president doesn’t stand for anything that the Republican Party said it stood for.”
He refused, however, to make an outright call to oust Trump.
Schiff’s comments came the day after Mueller sparked a new round of cries to launch impeachments proceedings during his first public remarks since the conclusion of his two-year counterintelligence probe. Mueller on Wednesday seemed to hand off to Congress whether Trump should be held accountable if he obstructed the Russia investigation — one of the two major issues the special counsel’s team dug into and detailed in its 448-page report.
A number of Democrats on Wednesday used Mueller’s words as a rallying cry to ramp up pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to open an impeachment inquiry into the president. Pelosi has pushed back against such efforts, repeatedly arguing that it is not worthwhile to impeach Trump — and that it could even help his chances for reelection in in 2020.
Schiff on Thursday said the decision to launch efforts to eject the president shouldn’t be made based on any political consequences they might have. Rather, he argued, House Democrats should take action when it is clear impeachment is necessary for the country.
“I think the most powerful argument to be made is regardless of what the Senate will do, regardless of whether an acquittal is inevitable, when the president’s conduct is at such a deleterious level, the House should act nonetheless,” Schiff said. “And damn the consequences.”
The lawmaker warned, however, that impeachment proceedings would be an “absorbing and wrenching experience.”
“I’m not there yet,” Schiff said. “Although the president seems to be doing everything in his power to get me there.”
He added that a tipping point for him would be if Trump were to ignore a court order. House committees have legally challenged the White House for refusing to allow witnesses to testify or turn over documents in multiple instances.
Schiff was the subject of GOP attacks earlier this year, after Mueller’s investigation wrapped up, for claiming “more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The special counsel wrote there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, though his report detailed sweeping efforts by Russian actors to meddle to Trump’s benefit.
Amid Republican calls for his resignation, Schiff argued that the conduct of the president and his aides, “criminal or not,” is unacceptable. He continued to push forward the House Intelligence Committee’s investigation after a redacted version of Mueller’s report was made public.
While Schiff has said the case for impeachment is getting “stronger,” he said Thursday that he doesn't think “people should be under the impression that impeachment is a cure-all.”
Instead, he looped back to what he characterized as a deeper problem — Republicans, whom Schiff accused of bending their values to adhere to the president’s agenda.
“To me, that’s what has our republic trembling — that one party will not do its duty,” he said."
Trump threatens Mexico with tariffs over immigration - POLITICO,www.politico.com,IAN KULLGREN,05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-mexico-tariffs-immigration-1348503," on Thursday said he would impose a 5 percent tariff on all goods from Mexico until its leaders took steps to curb illegal immigration to the United States.
“On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,” Trump wrote on Twitter . “The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied … at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.”
A short time later, the White House followed up with details: The tariff will increase to 10 percent on July 1; 15 percent on Aug. 1; 20 percent on Sept. 1; and 25 percent on Oct. 1.
“Americans are paying for this right now,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting staff, told reporters. “Illegal immigration comes at a cost. American taxpayers are paying for what’s going on at the border. This is already impacting the economy negatively.”
Trump has long been frustrated with his administration’s inability to halt the tide of immigrants at the southern border, but never more so than as he runs for reelection on a record that includes little of what he promised on immigration in his 2016 campaign.
He has accused the Mexican government of failing to do more as his administration has struggled with how to deal with the increase in immigrants, which has reached its highest level in years. U.S. Border Patrol arrested nearly 99,000 migrants at the border in April, many from Central America, and U.S. immigration officials now have a record number of people in custody.”
Mulvaney told reporters Thursday night that Trump was using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce during a national emergency. He said tariffs would remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially halted the stem of immigrants crossing the border. But when he was asked for a specific number of reductions, Mulvaney declined to say, calling the situation “fluid.”
“If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed,” the White House said in a written statement.
The acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, said Mexico needed to increase operational security on the border, get tougher on criminal operations and help the U.S. on asylum cases. But he, too, declined to provide specific numbers.
Trump made the announcement on the same day that the administration took a procedural step that would allow it submit the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement to Congress for a vote this summer. That agreement, which is an update of the 25-year-old NAFTA, locks in tariff-free trade between the three countries.
It also came while Vice President Mike Pence was flying back from Ottawa, where he discussed the trade agreement with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.
“Our administration is working earnestly with leaders in the Congress of the United States to approve the USMCA this summer,” Pence said in Ottawa before departing. When he was asked about the possibility of a new tariff, the vice president said that Mexico and Congress needed to do more on immigration.
Mulvaney said the trade deal was completely separate from the tariffs that Trump threatened to impose Thursday, calling this an issue about immigration, not trade.
The United States imported $346 billion worth of goods from Mexico in 2018. That includes tens of billions of dollars of cars, trucks and auto parts. Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on Mexico comes just a few weeks after he removed a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum exports from Canada and Mexico in order to pave the way in Congress for approval of the USMCA.
Mulvaney said White House officials spoke to Republican leaders in both chambers of Congress, who he said were largely supportive, though few reacted Thursday night after Trump made the announcement. Only hours before his tweet, senior administration officials said that Trump had not made up his mind about the tariffs.
After the president’s announcement, his supporters praised his action. Jenny Beth Martin, honorary chairwoman of Tea Party Patriots Action, said she applauded Trump’s “bold” action.
“It's refreshing to see a President who’s willing to get tough, even with an ally, when our border is threatened — and who’s also determined to keep his campaign promises by making border security a top priority,” she said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation's James Carafano and Jack Spencer released a statement calling the tariffs ""the wrong policy for addressing the crisis at the border.""
“While Americans are greatly harmed by illegal immigration, these tariffs would only further punish our citizens, forcing them to pay more for basic goods and services every day – all because Washington has consistently failed to do its job,"" the statement said.
The president is also considering sweeping restrictions on asylum that would effectively block Central American migrants from entering the U.S., several administration officials and advocates briefed on the plan said earlier Thursday. A draft proposal circulating among Trump’s Homeland Security advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have resided in a country other than their own before coming to the U.S.
Trump’s idea to use tariffs as leverage on immigration is not new. He said last month that a recent deal with Mexico on auto exports wouldn’t count if the country failed to stop Central American migrants from illegally crossing the border. The president said he would give Mexico one year to curb illegal border crossings before pulling the trigger on new tariffs — a softening of his earlier threat to close the border entirely, but one that could still inflict economic damage on both countries.

'They don’t make 'em like Joe anymore': Biden expands grip on congressional endorsements,www.politico.com,NOLAN D. MCCASKILL,05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2019/05/30/they-dont-make-em-like-joe-anymore-biden-expands-grip-on-congressional-endorsements-1033673,"Former Vice President Joe Biden expanded his lead in congressional endorsements Thursday, landing the backing of second-term Rep. Al Lawson of Florida.
“They don’t make ‘em like Joe anymore,” Lawson said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. “We have an opportunity now to meet head on the greatest challenges of our time, and ensure our best days still lie ahead of us and that is why I am endorsing him to be the next president of the United States.”
Lawson said Biden “has a long history of doing what’s right and not what’s easy to advance the causes of America’s working families.”
Lawson is the latest in a string of Democrats to line up behind Biden in Florida , which will be a key battleground state in the 2020 presidential election.
He cited Biden’s “proven track record of bringing people together and delivering results” on issues ranging from health care and the environment to civil rights and women’s rights.
“America is at a crossroads,” Lawson wrote, “and it is vital that we elect a leader who will restore the soul of this country, put us back on a path of prosperity and make certain we are respected on the world stage. I have no doubt that Vice President Biden is that leader.”
A Lawson spokesperson said the congressman “has always had a great deal of respect and admiration for” Biden, noting the two campaigned together for Hillary Clinton in 2016 at the historically black university Florida A&M. Biden supported Lawson’s congressional bid that year.
Biden entered the crowded Democratic presidential primary in April as the putative front-runner. He has dominated national polling, leading second-place Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by double digits, and is also atop early state polls.
Lawson, a former professional basketball player and assistant basketball coach at Florida State, is Biden’s 15th endorsement from a current member of Congress — and the fifth from the Congressional Black Caucus.
“As Biden is fond of saying, all politics is personal,” said a Biden campaign aide. “The product of his career in elected office is a long list of deep relationships. He is not one to merely check the box when he gets on the phone. He‘s going to have a real, substantive conversation.”
Though CBC members Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey launched their White House bids well before Biden, it’s the former vice president and six-term senator who has the most endorsements within the 55-member group. Several of its members, however, have warmed up to the prospect of a Biden-Harris ticket to take on President Donald Trump next year.
Former CBC Chairman Cedric Richmond (D-La.), who has also endorsed Biden, could play a formal role in his campaign , possibly as co-chair.

Ocasio-Cortez joins Bronx town hall to push for rent law overhaul in Albany,www.politico.com,jchadha@politico.com (Janaki Chadha),05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/05/30/ocasio-cortez-joins-bronx-town-hall-to-push-for-rent-overhaul-in-albany-1034854,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , whose upset election last year helped spur a reshuffling of Albany politics, returned to the Bronx Thursday night calling for an end to real estate industry influence in New York politics — a theme of her insurgent campaign and one that could soon bring significant change for tenants in New York City and beyond.
“It’s no secret that big real estate has an enormous financial grip over elections in New York state and federally,” she said during a town hall with a coalition of tenant groups pushing a nine-bill package to overhaul New York’s rent laws.
Ocasio-Cortez said city, state and federal housing policies come ""together to make a picture that all too often enriches people who are already powerful and impoverishes people who are already vulnerable.”
The crowd of more than 100 were intent on passing the nine bills currently being debated in Albany carrying signs and chanting slogans directed at New York's legislative leaders. Ocasio-Cortez didn’t go into detail on the bills tenant activists are currently pushing, but when asked if she supports “universal rent control” in New York state — as the package as been termed — she said yes.
State lawmakers including State Sens. Alessandra Biaggi and Jamaal Bailey and Assemblywoman Nathalia Fernandez, were pressed by attendees on the level of support for the nine-bill package in both chambers, and how legislative leaders plan to move negotiations forward.
Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie put out a joint statement on Thursday vowing to pass a strong package of tenant protection bills this session and committing to the ""principles"" of the legislation sought by tenant groups. But they left themselves some wiggle room for negotiations to get the package over the line before the rent laws sunset on June 15.
Housing activists said their statement fell short. They have called for the Legislature to leave Gov. Andrew Cuomo out of rent law negotiations and for both houses to come out in clear support of all nine bills.
One statewide measure that activists worry would go on the chopping block is the ""Good Cause"" bill, which would prohibit landlords from evicting tenants without sufficient cause. Housing groups are also calling for programs that allow landlords to raise rents for building and apartment improvements to be fully eliminated, rather than simply modified.
Bailey, Biaggi and Fernandez said they are pushing the entire package in their conferences, but indicated some of the measures need to gain more support before the conferences can come out and support them. They also emphasized the importance of keeping the door open for negotiations.
Biaggi was asked about a NY1 report that said only three of the bills out of the nine-measure package have enough support from Senate Democrats to pass.
“I have not heard that rumor — I’m also inside that room, that’s not something that has come up,” she said. “But I will say that not everyone is going to agree on every single thing, that’s just the reality.”
Ocasio-Cortez implied the story was leaked to weaken support for the package.
“I’m obviously not in the state Senate and I’m not in those rooms,” she said. “But I do know that this is a tactic that’s often used in D.C., where someone will leak a story to demoralize the organizers.”
On housing reforms at the federal level, Ocasio-Cortez said she is advocating for more funding for the New York City Housing Authority and Section 8 vouchers.
She said the city and state’s “hands are tied” when it comes to NYCHA, and that they can’t make up for the lack of federal funding for the housing authority. She also slammed the recent Trump administration decision to bar families from public housing if any member is undocumented, as well as other policies that allow public housing tenants to be evicted for low-level drug offenses."
